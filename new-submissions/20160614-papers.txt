abstract: A small dipole oscillator moving along a circular trajectory in zero-point electromagnetic field ( ZPF ) and with a polarization normal to the rotation plane, is considered. Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF, associated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar to spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in ZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a consequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The average centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this modified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in terms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After renormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction of a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations are carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial component of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non relativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency, the force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result could mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains its average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the estimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not observable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been much smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical approach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected result and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the quark world governed by non abelian colored fields, subject of the next paper.

abstract: Post-selection strategies have been proposed with the aim of amplifying weak signals, which may help to overcome detection thresholds associated with technical noise in high-precision measurements. Here we use an optical setup to experimentally explore two different post-selection protocols for the estimation of a small parameter: a weak-value amplification procedure and an alternative method, that does not provide amplification, but nonetheless is shown to be more robust for the sake of parameter estimation. Each technique leads approximately to the saturation of quantum limits for the estimation precision, expressed by the Cram\'er-Rao bound. For both situations, we show that information on the parameter is obtained jointly from the measuring device and the post-selection statistics.

abstract: Donor impurity spins in silicon-28 are highly competitive qubits for upcoming solid-state quantum technologies, yet a proven scalable strategy for multi-qubit devices remains conspicuously absent. These CMOS-compatible, atomically identical qubits offer significant advantages including 3-hour coherence ($T_2$) lifetimes, as well as simultaneous qubit initialization, manipulation and readout fidelities near $\sim\!99.9\%$. These properties meet the requirements for many modern quantum error correction protocols, which are essential for constructing large-scale universal quantum technologies. However, a method of reliably coupling spatially-separated qubits, which crucially does not sacrifice qubit quality and is robust to manufacturing imperfections, has yet to be identified. Here we present such a platform for donor qubits in silicon, by exploiting optically-accessible `deep' chalcogen donors. We show that these donors emit highly uniform light, can be optically initialized, and offer long-lived spin qubit ground states without requiring milliKelvin temperatures. These combined properties make chalcogen donors uniquely suitable for incorporation into silicon photonic architectures for single-shot single-qubit readout as well as for multi-qubit coupling. This unlocks clear pathways for silicon-based quantum computing, spin to photon conversion, photonic memories, silicon-integrated triggered single photon sources and all-optical silicon switches.

abstract: We study an one-dimensional transverse field Ising model with additional periodically modulated real and complex fields. It is shown that both models can be mapped on a pseudo spin system in the k space in the aid of an extended Bogoliubov transformation. This allows us to introduce the geometric quantity, the Chern number, to identify the nature of quantum phases. Based on the exact solution, we find that the spatially modulated real and complex fields rearrange the phase boundaries from that of the ordinary Ising model, which can be characterized by the Chern numbers defined in the context of Dirac and biorthonormal inner products, respectively.

abstract: Based on a gambling formulation of quantum mechanics, we obtain that dispersion-free probabilities are actually not valid, or rational, probabilities for quantum mechanics, and hence should be excluded from consideration. More generally, we derive a Gleason-type theorem that holds for any dimension n of a quantum system, and in particular for n = 2, stating that the only valid probability assignments are exactly the ones that are definable as the trace of the product of a projector and a density matrix operator.

abstract: Many methods now exist to prepare free electrons into orbital angular momentum states, and the predicted applications of these electron states as probes of materials and scattering processes are numerous. The development of electron orbital angular momentum measurement techniques has lagged behind. We show that coupling between electron orbital angular momentum and a spatially varying magnetic field produces an angular momentum-dependent focusing effect. We propose a design for an orbital angular momentum measurement device built on this principle. As the method of measurement is non-interferometric, the device works equally well for mixed, superposed and pure final orbital angular momentum states. The energy and orbital angular momentum distributions of inelastically scattered electrons may be simultaneously measurable with this technique.

abstract: LISA Pathfinder's measurement of a relative acceleration noise between two free-falling test masses with a square root of the power spectral density of $5.2 \pm 0.1 \mbox{ fm s}^{-2}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ appreciably constrains collapse models. In particular, we bound the localization rate parameter, $\lambda_{\rm CSL}$, in the continuous spontaneous localization model (CSL) to be at most $\left( 2.96 \pm 0.12 \right) \times 10^{-8} \mbox{ s}^{-1}$. Moreover, we bound the regularization scale, $\sigma_{\rm DP}$, used in the Diosi-Penrose (DP) model to be at least $40.1 \pm 0.5 \mbox{ fm}$. These bounds significantly constrain the validity of these models. In particular: (i) a lower bound of $2.2 \times 10^{-8\pm2} \mbox{s}^{-1}$ for $\lambda_{\rm CSL}$ has been proposed in (although a lower bound of about $10^{-17} \mbox{s}^{-1}$ is sometimes used), in order for the collapse noise to be substantial enough to explain the phenomenology of quantum measurement, and (ii) 40 fm is larger than the size of any nucleus, while the regularization scale has been proposed to be the size of the nucleus.

abstract: Resource theory is a widely-applicable framework for analyzing the physical resources required for given tasks, such as computation, communication, and energy extraction. In this paper, we propose a general scheme for studying and understanding resource theories based on resource-destroying maps, which leave resource-free states unchanged but erase the resource stored in all other states. In particular, we introduce a group of simple conditions for the class of resource-free operations, which play a key role in the general framework of resource theories. Our theory reveals fundamental connections among free states, free operations and resource measures. To illustrate the properties of resource destruction, we explicitly discuss our theory in the contexts of coherence and discord.

abstract: We present general conditions for quantum error suppression for Hamiltonian-based quantum computation using subsystem codes. This involves encoding the Hamiltonian performing the computation using an error detecting subsystem code and the addition of a penalty term that commutes with the encoded Hamiltonian. The scheme is general and includes the stabilizer formalism of both subspace and subsystem codes as special cases. We derive performance bounds and show that complete error suppression results in the large penalty limit. To illustrate the power of subsystem-based error suppression, we introduce fully 2-local constructions for protection of the swap gate of adiabatic gate teleportation and the Ising chain in a transverse field.

abstract: Analyzing the dimension of an unknown quantum system in a device-independent manner, i.e., using only the measurement statistics, is a fundamental task in quantum physics and quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider this problem in the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we provide a lower bound on the dimension of the prepared quantum systems which is a function that only depends on the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we show that our bound performs well on several examples. In particular, we show that our bound provides new insights into the notion of dimension witness, and we also use it to show that the sets of restricted-dimensional prepare-and-measure correlations are not always convex.

We combine a reservoir engineering strategy with coherent dynamics to generate multi-qubit entangled states. We find that an interplay between the coherent and incoherent dynamics results in the generation of stable (time-independent) many-body entangled steady states. Our results will be relevant in the context of the dissipative generation of quantum states, with applications in short-distance quantum computation and for exploring the emergence of collective phenomena in many-body open quantum systems.

abstract: We present a protocol for Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking of arbitrary quantum gates using Monte Carlo sampling of quantum states. It is generally applicable, including non-Clifford gates while preserving key advantages of Randomized Benchmarking such as error amplification as well as independence from state preparation and measurement errors. This property is crucial for implementations in many contemporary systems. Although the protocol scales exponentially in the number of qubits, it is superior to direct Monte Carlo sampling of the average gate fidelity in both the total number of experiments by orders of magnitude and savings in classical preprocessing, that are exponential.

In this work, we demonstrate this feature with a concrete example based on exact solutions. Numerical simulations show that the entangled state can be generated through the dynamic process with a high fidelity.

abstract: Resilience to noise and to decoherence processes is an important ingredient for the implementation of quantum information processing, and quantum technologies. To this end, techniques such as pulsed and continuous dynamical decoupling have been proposed to reduce noise effects. In this paper, we suggest a new approach to implementing continuous dynamical decoupling techniques, that uses an extra control parameter; namely, the ability to shape the time dependence of the detuning. This approach reduces the complexity of the experimental setup, such that we are only left with noise originating from the frequency of the driving field, which is much more robust than the amplitude (Rabi frequency) noise. We show that our technique can be utilized for improved sensing and high fidelity entangling gates.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.03967
abstract: In this paper we attempt to analyze the physical and philosophical meaning of quantum contextuality. In the first part we will argue that a general confusion within the literature comes from the improper "scrambling" of two different meanings of quantum contextuality. The first one is related to an epistemic interpretation of contextuality, introduced by Bohr, which stresses the incompatibility (or complementarity) of quantum measurements. The second, is related to an ontic notion of contextuality, exposed through the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem, which focuses on the constraints to discuss about actual (definite valued) properties within the orthodox formalism of QM. We will show how these two notions have been scrambled together creating an "omelette of contextuality" which has been fully widespread through a popularized "epistemic explanation" of the KS theorem according to which: The outcome of the observable A when measured together with B or together with C will necessarily differ in case [A,B] = [A,C] = 0, and [B,C] =/ 0. We will show why this statement is not only improperly scrambling epistemic and ontic perspectives, but is also physically and philosophically meaningless. In the second part of the paper, we will analyse the relation between 'classical contexts' and QM. We will show that three accepted presuppositions found within the orthodox literature are, in general, false. Namely: (i) that quantum contextuality does not preclude an objective description of physical reality, (ii) that the choice of a context (or basis) restores a classical description of reality, and (iii) that the choice of a (classical) context is a necessary condition for accounting for empirical statements in QM.

abstract: A system of two or more quantum dots interacting with a dissipative plasmonic nanostructure is investigated in detail by using a cavity quantum electrodynamics approach with a model Hamiltonian. We focus on determining and understanding system configurations that generate multiple bipartite quantum entanglements between the occupation states of the quantum dots. These configurations include allowing for the quantum dots to be asymmetrically coupled to the plasmonic system. Analytical solution of a simplified limit for an arbitrary number of quantum dots and numerical simulations and optimization for the two- and three-dot cases are used to develop guidelines for maximizing the bipartite entanglements. For any number of quantum dots, we show that through simple starting states and parameter guidelines, one quantum dot can be made to share a strong amount of bipartite entanglement with all other quantum dots in the system, while entangling all other pairs to a lesser degree.

abstract: A unified view on the phenomenon of monogamy exhibited by Bell inequalities and non-contextuality inequalities arising from the no-signaling and no-disturbance principles is developed using the graph-theoretic method introduced in \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050404 (2012)}. The sufficient condition for the existence of a monogamy between any two Bell or non-contextuality inequalities in terms of a decomposition of the commutation graph representing all the observables in the setup into induced chordal graphs, is studied. The condition is used to show that any two cycle inequalities, whether studied as non-contextuality or Bell inequalities and for any length of the cycle, are monogamous under certain conditions with each other. As a main application, a novel type of trade-off is then derived, namely Bell inequalities that do not exhibit monogamy features of their own can be activated to be monogamous by the addition of a local contextuality term. This is illustrated by means of the well-known $I_{3322}$ inequality. The non-necessity of the condition for the existence of a monogamy relation is shown by means of an explicit counter-example. In the derivation of novel no-signaling monogamies, we uncover a new feature, namely that two-party Bell expressions that are trivially classically saturated can become non-trivial upon the addition of an expression involving a third party with a single measurement input. This implies that the study of Bell inequalities (and the corresponding classical polytopes) with single inputs for some of the parties becomes interesting.

abstract: The connection between coined and continuous-time quantum walk models has been addressed in a number of papers. In most of those studies, the continuous-time model is derived from coined quantum walks by employing dimensional reduction and taking appropriate limits. In this work, we produce the evolution of a coined quantum walk on a generic graph using a continuous-time quantum walk on a larger graph. In addition to expanding the underlying structure, we also have to switch on and off edges during the continuous-time evolution to accommodate the alternation between the shift and coin operators from the coined model. In one particular case, the connection is very natural, and the continuous-time quantum walk that simulates the coined quantum walk is driven by the graph Laplacian on the dynamically changing expanded graph.

abstract: In this paper, we theoretically propose and investigate a feasible experimental scheme for the phonon analogue of the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in an optomechanical setup formed by a mechanical oscillator (MO) inside a Fabry-Perot cavity, which is driven by an amplitude-modulated classical laser field in the dispersive (far-detuned) regime. The time modulation of the driving field leads to the parametric amplification of the mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the MO, which results in the generation of Casimir phonons over time scales longer than the cavity lifetime. We show that the generated phonons exhibit quadrature squeezing, bunching effect, and super-Poissonian statistics which are controllable by the externally modulated laser pump. In particular, we find that the scheme allows for a perfect squeezing transfer from one mechanical quadrature to another when the laser frequency is varied from red detuning to blue detuning. Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the thermal noise of the MO environment, we show that there exists a critical temperature above which there is no phonon quadrature squeezing to occur. We also show that the generated Casimir phonons can be detected via monitoring the width of the displacement spectrum of the MO.

The functionality of the interferometer is based on the universal \moire effect that was recently implemented for X-ray phase-contrast imaging in the far-field regime. Interference fringes were achieved with monochromatic, bichromatic, and polychromatic neutron beams; for both continuous and pulsed beams. This far-field neutron interferometry allows for the utilization of the full neutron flux for precise measurements of potential gradients, and expands neutron phase-contrast imaging techniques to more intense polycromatic neutron beams.

abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has suggested the tantalizing possibility of opening a topological gap upon driving the surface states of a three-dimensional strong topological insulator (TI) with circularly polarized light. With this motivation, we study the response of TIs to a driving field that couples to states near the surface. We unexpectedly find coherent oscillations between the surface and the bulk and trace their appearance to unavoidable resonances caused by photon absorption from the drive. We show how these resonant oscillations may be captured by the Demkov- Osherov model of multi-level Landau-Zener physics, leading to non-trivial consequences such as the loss of adiabaticity upon slow ramping of the amplitude. We numerically demonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time-dependent Wigner distribution, which is directly measurable in time-resolved ARPES experiments. Our results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence of a gapped bulk, and thus suggest experimental signatures of a novel surface-bulk coupling mechanism that is fundamental for proposals to engineer non-trivial states by periodic driving.

abstract: Experiments in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics rely on lasers at many different wavelengths and with varying requirements on spectral linewidth, power, and intensity stability. Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSELs), when combined with nonlinear frequency conversion, can potentially replace many of the laser systems currently in use. Here we present and characterize VECSEL systems that can perform all laser-based tasks for quantum information processing experiments with trapped magnesium ions. For photoionization of neutral magnesium, 570.6$\,$nm light is generated with an intracavity frequency-doubled VECSEL containing a lithium triborate (LBO) crystal for second harmonic generation. External frequency doubling produces 285.3$\,$nm light for resonant interaction with the $^{1}S_{0}\leftrightarrow$ $^{1}P_{1}$ transition of neutral Mg. Using an externally frequency-quadrupled VECSEL, we implement Doppler cooling of $^{25}$Mg$^{+}$ on the 279.6$\,$nm $^{2}S_{1/2}\leftrightarrow$ $^{2}P_{3/2}$ cycling transition, repumping on the 280.4$\,$nm $^{2}S_{1/2}\leftrightarrow$ $^{2}P_{1/2}$ transition, coherent state manipulation, and resolved sideband cooling close to the motional ground state. Our systems serve as prototypes for applications in AMO requiring single-frequency, power-scalable laser sources at multiple wavelengths.

Two-photon Raman transitions between left and right wells induce spin-orbit coupling. This scheme does not require near resonant light, features adjustable interactions by shaping the double well potential, and does not depend on special properties of the atoms. A pseudospinor Bose-Einstein condensate spontaneously acquires an antiferromagnetic pseudospin texture which breaks the lattice symmetry similar to a supersolid.

abstract: Using higher order coherence of thermal light sources, we can achieve enhancement of resolution of standard x-ray imaging techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and phase contrast imaging. The cost of implementing such schemes is minimal comparing to the schemes using entangled two-photon pairs. The proposed diffractive quan- tum crystallography using multipath interference of thermal light can be eventually free of radiation damage, because the diffraction pattern could be formed by using low energy photons of optical wavelength. Thus it is promising to apply the proposed quantum crystallography scheme to nanocrystalline or non-crystalline samples that are too difficult to be crystallized.

abstract: What is the minimum amount of information and time needed to solve 2SAT? When the instance is known, it can be solved in polynomial time, but is this also possible without knowing the instance? Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC '13) considered a model where the input is accessed by proposing possible assignments to a special oracle. This oracle, on encountering some constraint unsatisfied by the proposal, returns only the constraint index. It turns out that, in this model, even 1SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP. Hence, we consider a model in which the input is accessed by proposing probability distributions over assignments to the variables. The oracle then returns the index of the constraint that is most likely to be violated by this distribution. We show that the information obtained this way is sufficient to solve 1SAT in polynomial time, even when the clauses can be repeated. For 2SAT, as long as there are no repeated clauses, in polynomial time we can even learn an equivalent formula for the hidden instance and hence also solve it. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantum regime. We show that in this setting 1QSAT can be solved in polynomial time up to constant precision, and 2QSAT can be learnt in polynomial time up to inverse polynomial precision.

abstract: We show that for two-band one-dimensional systems certain nonsymmorphic symmetries combined with parity or time-reversal symmetry enforce the existence of band crossings in the bulk, which realize Fermi surfaces of reduced dimensionality. We find that these unavoidable crossings originate from the momentum dependence of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, which puts strong restrictions on the global structure of the band configurations. The symmetry-required band crossings are generically located at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and their exact positions are determined by the algebra of the symmetry operators. It is revealed that these band degeneracies are of a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological nature, as opposed to the local topological charges of Fermi points in, say, Weyl semimetals. We also discuss generalizations of the symmetry-required band crossings to higher dimensions.

abstract: Quantum and thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic waves are the cornerstone of quantum and statistical physics, and inherent to such phenomena as thermal radiation and van der Waals forces. While the basic principles are the material of elementary texts, recent experimental and technological advances have made it necessary to come to terms with counterintuitive consequences of electromagnetic fluctuations at short scales -- in the so called {\it near-field} regime. We focus on three manifestations of such behavior: {\bf (i)} The Stefan--Boltzmann law describes thermal radiation from macroscopic bodies, but fails to account for magnitude, polarization and coherence of radiation from small objects (say compared to the skin depth). {\bf (ii)} The heat transfer between two bodies at similar close proximity is dominated by evanescent waves, and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the classical contribution due to propagating waves. {\bf (iii)} Casimir/van der Waals interactions are a dominant force between objects at sub-micron separation; the non-equilibrium analogs of this force (for objects at different temperatures) have not been sufficiently explored (at least experimentally). To explore these phenomena we introduce the tool of fluctuational quantum electrodynamics (QED) originally introduced by Rytov in the 1950s. Combined with a scattering formalism, this enables studies of heat radiation and transfer, equilibrium and non-equilibrium forces for objects of different material properties, shapes, separations and arrangements.

abstract: The phases and properties of matter under global rotation have attracted much interest recently. In this paper we investigate the pairing phenomena in a system of fermions under the presence of rotation. We find that there is a generic suppression effect on pairing states with zero angular momentum. We demonstrate this effect with the chiral condensation and the color superconductivity in hot dense QCD matter as explicit examples. In the case of chiral condensation, a new phase diagram in the temperature-rotation parameter space is found, with a nontrivial critical point.

abstract: A solar cell is a heat engine, but textbook treatments are not wholly satisfactory from a thermodynamic standpoint, since they present solar cells as directly converting the energy of light into electricity, and the current in the circuit as maintained by an electrostatic potential. We propose a thermodynamic cycle in which the gas of electrons in the p phase serves as the working substance. The interface between the p and n phases acts as a self-oscillating piston that modulates the absorption of heat from the photons so that it may perform a net positive work during a complete cycle of its motion, in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. We draw a simple hydrodynamical analogy between this model and the "putt-putt" engine of toy boats, in which the interface between the water's liquid and gas phases serves as the piston. We point out some testable consequences of this model.

abstract: We discuss the emergence of bound states in the low-energy spectrum of the string-net Hamiltonian in the presence of a string tension. In the ladder geometry, we show that a single bound state arises either for a finite tension or in the zero-tension limit depending on the theory considered. In the latter case, we perturbatively compute the binding energy as a function of the total quantum dimension. We also address this issue in the honeycomb lattice where the number of bound states in the topological phase depends on the total quantum dimension. Finally, the internal structure of these bound states is analyzed in the zero-tension limit.

abstract: We present an efficient implementation of dynamically pruned quantum dynamics, both in coordinate space and in phase space. We combine the ideas behind the biorthogonal von Neumann basis (PvB) with the orthogonalized momentum-symmetrized Gaussians (Weylets) to create a new basis, projected Weylets, that takes the best from both methods. We benchmark pruned dynamics using phase-space-localized PvB, projected Weylets, and coordinate-space-localized DVR bases, with real-world examples in up to six dimensions. We show that coordinate-space localization is most important for efficient pruning and that pruned dynamics is much faster compared to unpruned, exact dynamics. Phase-space localization is useful for more demanding dynamics where many basis functions are required. There, projected Weylets offer a more compact representation than pruned DVR bases.

abstract: We introduce tensor surgery and apply it to tensors defined by graphs and hypergraphs. By splitting vertices, creating virtual edges and by inserting new ones, we obtain nontrivial upper bounds on tensor rank, border rank and asymptotic rank of the resulting tensors. We illustrate our method with a number of examples. Tensor surgery on the triangle graph, which corresponds to the matrix multiplication tensor, leads to nontrivial rank bounds for all odd cycle graphs, which correspond to the tensors of iterated matrix multiplication. In the asymptotic setting we obtain upper bounds in terms of the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ and the rectangular matrix multiplication parameter $\alpha$ that are optimal if $\omega$ equals two. We also give examples that illustrate that tensor surgery on general graphs might involve the absorption of virtual hyperedges and provide an example of tensor surgery on a hypergraph. In the context of quantum information theory, our results may be interpreted as upper bounds on the rate of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states needed in order to create a graph of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states, or, more generally, GHZ states shared among subsets of the vertices.
