abstract: Aberg has claimed in a recent Letter," Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 150402 (2014)", that the coherence of a reservoir can be used repeatedly to perform coherent operations without ever diminishing in power to do so. The claim has particular relevance for quantum thermodynamics because, as shown in "Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 150402 (2014)", latent energy that is locked by coherence may be extractable without incurring any additional cost. We show here, however, that repeated use of the reservoir gives an overall coherent operation of diminished accuracy and is necessarily accompanied by an increased thermodynamic cost.

abstract: It was recently realised that quantum theory allows for so-called causally nonseparable processes, which are incompatible with any definite causal order. This was first suggested on a rather abstract level by the formalism of process matrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in some observers' laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was then shown, on a more practical level, that the quantum switch---a new resource for quantum computation that goes beyond causally ordered circuits---provided precisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable process. To demonstrate that a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Ara\'ujo et al., New J. Phys. 17, 102001 (2015)] the concept of witnesses of causal nonseparability. Here we present a shorter introduction to this concept, and concentrate on some explicit examples to show how to construct and use such witnesses in practice.

abstract: A BosonSampling device is a quantum machine expected to perform tasks intractable for a classical computer, yet requiring minimal non-classical resources as compared to full-scale quantum computers. Photonic implementations to date employed sources based on inefficient processes that only simulate heralded single-photon statistics when strongly reducing emission probabilities. BosonSampling with only single-photon input has thus never been realised. Here, we report on a BosonSampling device operated with a bright solid-state source of highly-pure single-photon Fock states: the emission from an efficient and deterministic quantum dot-micropillar system is demultiplexed into three partially-indistinguishable single-photons, with purity $1{-}g^{(2)}(0)$ of $0.990\pm0.001$, interfering in a $6{\times}6$ linear optics network. Our demultiplexed source is orders-of-magnitude brighter than current heralded multi-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion, allowing us to complete the BosonSampling experiment 100 times faster than previous equivalent implementations. This intrinsic source superiority places BosonSampling with larger photon numbers within near reach.

abstract: We consider the quantum processor based on a chain of trapped ions to propose an architecture wherein the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions (position and momentum) could be exploited as the computational Hilbert space. We adopt a continuous-variables approach to develop a toolbox of quantum operations to manipulate one or two vibrational modes at a time. Together with the intrinsic non-linearity of the qubit degree of freedom, employed to mediate the interaction between modes, arbitrary manipulation and readout of the ionic wave function could be achieved.

abstract: A non-commuting measurement transfers, via the apparatus, information encoded in a system's state to the external "observer". Classical measurements determine properties of physical objects. In the quantum realm, the very same notion restricts the recording process to orthogonal states as only those are distinguishable by measurements. Therefore, even a possibility to describe physical reality by means of non-hermitian operators should \emph{volens nolens} be excluded as their eigenstates are not orthogonal. Here, we show that non-hermitian operators with real spectrum can be treated within the standard framework of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we propose a quantum canonical transformation that maps hermitian systems onto non-hermitian ones. Similar to classical inertial forces this transformation is accompanied by an energetic cost pinning the system on the unitary path.

abstract: The transfer of data is a fundamental task in information systems. Microprocessors contain dedicated data buses that transmit bits across different locations and implement sophisticated routing protocols. Transferring quantum information with high fidelity is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic fragility of quantum states. We report on the implementation of the perfect state transfer protocol applied to a photonic qubit entangled with another qubit at a different location. On a single device we perform three routing procedures on entangled states with an average fidelity of 97.1%. Our protocol extends the regular perfect state transfer by maintaining quantum information encoded in the polarisation state of the photonic qubit. Our results demonstrate the key principle of perfect state transfer, opening a route toward data transfer for quantum computing systems.

abstract: Spin echo is a fundamental tool for quantum registers and biomedical imaging. It is believed that a strong magnetic field is needed for the spin echo to provide long memory and high resolution since a degenerate spin cannot be well controlled or addressed under a zero magnetic field. While a degenerate spin is never subject to dynamic control, it is still subject to geometric control. We here show the spin echo of a degenerate spin subsystem, which is geometrically controlled via a mediating state split by the crystal field, in a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The demonstration revealed that the degenerate spin is protected from both the amplitude and phase noises by inherent symmetry breaking called axial and transverse zero-field splittings. The geometric spin echo under zero field provides a way to ideally maintain the coherence without any dynamics, thus opening the way to pseudo-static quantum RAM and non-invasive biosensors.

In particular, we provide a one-to-one correspondence between patterns and density operators, represented by mixed states when the uncertainty comes into play. The classification process in the quantum framework is performed by the introduction of a normalized trace distance between density operators in place of the Euclidean distance between patterns. We provide a comparison of the introduced method in the case of 2D data classification.

abstract: The effect of noise on various protocols of secure quantum communication has been studied. Specifically, we have investigated the effect of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping, Pauli type as well as various collective noise models on the protocols of quantum key distribution, quantum key agreement,quantum secure direct quantum communication and quantum dialogue. From each type of protocol of secure quantum communication, we have chosen two protocols for our comparative study; one based on single qubit states and the other one on entangled states. The comparative study reported here has revealed that single-qubit-based schemes are generally found to perform better in the presence of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping noises, while entanglement-based protocols turn out to be preferable in the presence of collective noises. It is also observed that the effect of noise entirely depends upon the number of rounds of quantum communication involved in a scheme of quantum communication. Further, it is observed that squeezing, a completely quantum mechanical resource present in the squeezed generalized amplitude channel, can be used in a beneficial way as it may yield higher fidelity compared to the corresponding zero squeezing case.

abstract: Considering the intrinsic nonlinearity in a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a charge qubit, vacuum Rabi splitting effect is studied in a nanomechanical QED (qubit-resonator) system. A driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model describes the dynamics of this qubit-resonator system. Using quantum regression theorem and master equation approach, we have calculated the two-time correlation spectrum analytically. In the weak driving limit, these analytical results clarify the influence of the driving strength and nonlinearity parameter on the correlation spectrum. Also, numerical calculations confirm these analytical results.

The electromagnetic zero-point energy for some frequencies is suppressed by the block below the free-space value, while for other frequencies it is increased. We also calculate the regularized (Casimir) zero-point energy at each frequency and find that it too is less than the free-space value (zero) for some frequencies. The total Casimir energy is positive.

abstract: A well-known situation in which a non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system $S$ arises is when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system $M$ in contact with a Markovian bath. In such cases, while the joint dynamics of $S$-$M$ is Markovian and obeys a standard (bipartite) Lindblad-type master equation (ME), this is in general not true for the reduced dynamics of $S$. Furthermore, there are several instances (\eg the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model) in which a {\it closed} ME for the $S$'s state {\it cannot} even be worked out. Here, we find a class of bipartite Lindblad-type MEs such that the reduced ME of $S$ can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any initial product state of $S$-$M$. We provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our result in terms of a mapping between two collision models

abstract: Three experimental groups succeeded recently to close, at the same time, locality and fair sampling loopholes and confirmed that realism or counterfactual definiteness may not be used to explain quantum phenomena. Since there is now a general consensus that Bell inequalities are violated it is important to understand what does it mean and how can we explain the existence of strong correlations between outcomes of distant measurements, predicted by quantum mechanics. Do we have to announce that: Einstein was wrong, Nature is not local and the correlations are produced due to the quantum magic and emerge, somehow, from outside space-time? We reject such conclusions and we show that violations of various inequalities can neither prove completeness of quantum mechanics nor that Nature is not local. We propose simpler contextual explanation of long range correlations predicted by quantum mechanics which reconciles in some sense Bohr with Einstein and we conclude that there is no evidence that Nature plays dice. We argue that to prove predictable completeness of quantum mechanics one has to search for fine structures in experimental data which might have been averaged out in standard statistical analysis and which were not predicted by the theory.

abstract: We analyze plane waves in a model of quantum mechanics in a three dimensional noncommutative (NC) space $R^3_{\lambda}$. Signature features of NC models are impossibility of probing distances smaller than a certain length scale {\lambda} and a presence of natural energetic cut-off at energy scale of order $1/{\lambda}^2$ (in convenient units). We analyze consequences of such restrictions on a 1 dimensional Casimir effect. The result shows resemblance to flux tube potential for quark-antiquark pairs and to effective bosonic string theories with L\"uscher terms. Such behavior might effect the radius of possible compact (fuzzy) dimensions.

abstract: We predict a repulsive Casimir-Polder-type dispersion interaction between a single neutron and a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a single neutron subject to an external magnetic field. Due to its intrinsic magnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-level system which can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric one (surface) is found to be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller than than the standard atom-surface Casimir-Polder force due to the magnetic nature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-neutron mass ratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational potential of the same surface.

abstract: Performing experiments on small-scale quantum computers is certainly a challenging endeavor. Many parameters need to be optimized to achieve high-fidelity operations. This can be done efficiently for operations acting on single qubits as errors can be fully characterized. For multi-qubit operations, though, this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for which resources scale exponentially with the system size. Furthermore, in recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two-level system encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum information processors, which additionally increases the number of parameters that need to be controlled. For the optimization of the experimental system for a given task (e.g.~a quantum algorithm), one has to find a satisfactory error model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model. In this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but constant phase shifts. The method, which we implement here on a small-scale linear ion-trap quantum computer, is readily applicable to other AMO platforms for quantum information processing.

abstract: We study the applicability of collisional models for non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. By allowing interactions between the separate environmental degrees of freedom in between collisions we are able to construct a collision model that allows to study quantum memory effects in open system dynamics. We also discuss the possibility to embed non-Markovian collision model dynamics into Markovian collision model dynamics in an extended state space. As a concrete example we show how using the proposed class of collision models we can discretely model non- Markovian amplitude damping of a qubit. In the time-continuous limit, we obtain the well-known results for spontaneous decay of a two level system in to a structured zero-temperature reservoir

abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this work, we propose an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum currents. Our detection scheme relies on initiating the system in an anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a $4$-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown to be robust under a weak disorder.

abstract: A branching process treatment for the nonlocal Wigner pseudo-differential operator and its numerical applications in quantum dynamics is proposed and analyzed. We start from the discussion on two typical truncations of the nonlocal term, i.e., the $k$-truncated and $y$-truncated models. After introducing an auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})$, the (truncated) Wigner equation is reformulated into the integral formulation as well as its adjoint correspondence, both of which can be regarded as the renewal-type equations and have transparent stochastic interpretation. We prove that the moment of a branching process happens to be the solution for the adjoint equation, which connects rigorously the Wigner quantum dynamics to the stochastic branching process, and thus a sound mathematical framework for the Wigner Monte Carlo methods is established. Within the framework, the branching process for the $y$-truncated model recovers the popular signed particle Monte Carlo method which needs a discretization of the momentum space beforehand, whereas the $k$-truncated branching method allows a continuous momentum sampling. More interestingly, with the help of the rigorous connection, we find that a constant auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})\equiv\gamma_0$ performs better from the point of view of both theoretical and numerical aspects. In theory, we obtain a simple but analytical calculation formula for the growth rate of particle number, i.e., $\me^{2\gamma_0 t}$ with $t$ being the time. In numerics, the constant auxiliary function may facilitate the random sampling from the exponential distribution and improve the accuracy. Typical numerical experiments on the Gaussian barrier scattering validate our theoretical findings, as well as demonstrate the accuracy, the efficiency and thus the computability of the Wigner branching process.

abstract: We investigate photon merging and splitting processes in inhomogeneous, slowly varying electromagnetic fields. Our study is based on the three-photon polarization tensor following from the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. We put special emphasis on deviations from the well-known constant field results, also revisiting the selection rules for these processes. In the context of high-intensity laser facilities, we analytically determine compact expressions for the number of merged/split photons as obtained in the focal spots of intense laser beams. For the parameter range of a typical petawatt class laser system as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe, we provide estimates for the numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment. The combination of frequency upshifting, polarization dependence and scattering off the inhomogeneities renders photon merging an ideal signature for the experimental exploration of nonlinear quantum vacuum properties.

abstract: The spectacular successes of quantum physics have made it a commonplace to assert that we live in a quantum world. This idea seems to imply a kind of "quantum fundamentalism" according to which everything in the universe (if not the universe as a whole) is fundamentally of a quantum nature and ultimately describable in quantum-mechanical terms. Bohr's conception of quantum mechanics has traditionally been seen as opposed to such a view, not least because of his insistence on the necessity of the concepts of classical physics in the account of quantum phenomena. Recently, however, a consensus seems to be emerging among careful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to some version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by re-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional reading of Bohr in which (1) the answer to what an object is (quantum or classical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any physical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be treated that way at the same time.

abstract: It is well known that Niels Bohr insisted on the necessity of classical concepts in the account of quantum phenomena. But there is little consensus concerning his reasons, and what he exactly meant by this. In this paper, I re-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the necessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists in distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a purely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence concerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his interpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen interpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the literature. I conclude with a few remarks on how Bohr's ideas make much sense also when modern developments in quantum gravity and early universe cosmology are taken into account.
