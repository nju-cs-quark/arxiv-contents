abstract: The uncertainty principle can be understood as constraining the probability of winning a game in which Alice measures one of two conjugate observables, such as position or momentum, on a system provided by Bob, and he is to guess the outcome. Two variants are possible: either Alice tells Bob which observable she measured, or he has to furnish guesses for both cases. Here I derive new uncertainty relations for both, formulated directly in terms of Bob's guessing probabilities. For the former these relate to the entanglement that can be recovered by action on Bob's system alone. This gives a condition for approximate quantum error correction in terms of the recoverability of "amplitude" and "phase" information, implicitly used in the recent construction of efficient quantum polar codes. I also find a tight relation on the guessing probabilities for the latter game, which may have application in quantum cryptography.

abstract: The coherent transport of fermions in disordered networks of $l$ single-particle states connected by $k$-body interactions is studied. These networks are modeled by embedded Gaussian random matrix ensembles (EGE). The conductance bandwidth of the ensemble averaged transmission as well as the total current increases with the number of fermions $n$ in the network and is maximal for $k \sim n/2$. The transmission is peaked around the band center for $k=n$ making the transport efficient in a narrow energy band. We show that for all parameters the transport is enhanced significantly if only centrosymmetric ensembles (csEGE) are considered. In this case the transmission shows numerous resonances of perfect transport. Analyzing the transmission by spectral decomposition, we find that centrosymmetry induces strong correlations and enhances the extrema of the distributions. This suppresses destructive interference effects in the system and thus, causes backscattering-free transmission resonances which enhance the overall transport.

abstract: Experiments to probe the basic quantum properties of motional degrees of freedom of mechanical systems have developed rapidly over the last decade. One promising approach is to use hybrid electromechanical systems incorporating superconducting qubits and microwave circuitry. However, a critical challenge facing the development of these systems is to achieve strong coupling between mechanics and qubits while simultaneously reducing coupling of both the qubit and mechanical mode to the environment. Here we report measurements of a qubit-coupled mechanical resonator system consisting of an ultra-high-frequency nanoresonator and a long coherence-time superconducting transmon qubit, embedded in superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. It is demonstrated that the nanoresonator and transmon have commensurate energies and transmon coherence times are one order of magnitude larger than for all previously reported qubit-coupled nanoresonators. Moreover, we show that numerical simulations of this new hybrid quantum system are in good agreement with spectroscopic measurements and suggest that the nanoresonator in our device resides at low thermal occupation number, near its ground state, acting as a dissipative bath seen by the qubit. We also outline how this system could soon be developed as a platform for implementing more advanced experiments with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics, including the study of nanoresonator quantum noise properties, reservoir engineering, and nanomechanical quantum state generation and detection.

abstract: The dynamical behavior of entanglement between the atomic ensemble and the spontaneous emission is investigated by applying the femtosecond Gaussian pulses in double- lambda quantum system. In fact by solving the density matrix equations of motion in such a system and by using the von Neumann entropy, the degree of entanglement (DEM) could be measured in semi classical regime and in the multi-photon resonance condition. We interested in investigating the maximum value for DEM and controlled the DEM via relative phase. At first we consider three laser fields as CW optical laser fields and one femtosecond Gaussian field. In this case DEM has interesting behavior. When the system is applied by the other laser fields and Gaussian pulse is still there DEM can be controlled via phase but after finishing the time duration of the femtosecond Gaussian pulse DEM will be phase independent. Then we consider all the laser fields as femtosecond Gaussian pulses which interact with atomic system and we achieve to this point that the steady state entanglement can be occurred by using such ultra-short laser pulses; in this situation DEM will be phase independent. The system would be disentangled in special parameters of Rabi frequencies and all the atoms are coherently populated in a dark state in dressed state picture. Moreover when the system is entangled, there is a population distribution of the atoms in dressed states.

abstract: Quantum evolution of a two-spin system with anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian in the magnetic field is considered. We show that this evolution happens on some manifold with geometry depending on the ratio between the interaction couplings and on the initial state. The Fubini-Study metric of this manifold is calculated. The entanglement of the states belonging to this manifold is examined. Also we investigate similar problem for a two-spin system described by the Dzyaloshinsky-Moria Hamiltonian. The problem is solved using the fact that this Hamiltonian and the anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian are linked by the unitary transformation.

abstract: A new family of DTQWs on the line is introduced, which presents an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical ({\sl i.e.} non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article open up the possibility of performing quantum simulation of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.

abstract: We generalize a recently proposed algebraic method in order to treat non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The approach is applied to several quadratic Hamiltonians studied earlier by other authors. Instead of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation we simply obtain the eigenvalues of a suitable matrix representation of the operator. We take into account the existence of unitary and antiunitary symmetries in the quantum-mechanical problem.

abstract: In the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, Gaussian wavepacket solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation provide useful physical insight. This is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, for which both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac wave equations result in strange and counterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These behaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. As a potential remedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002 (2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose mutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in nature---suggesting a "many interacting worlds" interpretation. It is shown that the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation results in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In particular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and its spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally, the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through spacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic quantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.

abstract: We prove that estimating the smallest eigenvalue of a translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 1D chain of quantum systems is QMAEXP-complete, even for systems of low dimension. This improves on the work by Gottesman and Irani (2009), where this dimension was several orders of magnitude larger, whereas our dimension is comparable to the best-known non-translationally-invariant result by Hallgren et al. (2013). The main novelty of our work is the introduction of a new approach to encoding quantum computation in the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, and for analyzing its ground state energy. While previous constructions directly encoded one of the standard models, we introduce a new Turing-complete model of quantum computation - a quantum ring machine. We then translate the ring machine of a QMAEXP verifier into another new model - a quantum Thue system. This hybrid classical-quantum model is an extension of string rewriting systems and is specifically tailored to encoding quantum computation in a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian with translationally-invariant interactions. This allows us to shift the proof burden from simplifying the Hamiltonians used to encode a standard computational model, to proving universality of a very simplified model. While previous constructions could accommodate only serial computation, quantum Thue systems allow for non-determinism and concurrency. This requires more sophisticated techniques for analyzing the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian: we relate it to the Laplacian of a graph with unitary edge weights. To capture the non-deterministic branching in the computational path, we allow arbitrary graphs, including ones with cycles, which goes beyond path graphs considered in all previous constructions.

abstract: We discuss the physics of the high temperature superconductivity in hole doped copper oxide ceramics in the pseudogap region. Starting from an effective reduced Hamiltonian relevant to the dynamics of holes injected into the copper oxide layers proposed in a previous paper, we determine the superconductive condensate wavefunction. We show that the low-lying elementary condensate excitations are analogous to the rotons in superfluid $^4He$. We argue that the rotons-like excitations account for the specific heat anomaly at the critical temperature. We discuss and compare with experimental observations the London penetration length, the Abrikosov vortices, the upper and lower critical magnetic fields, and the critical current density. We give arguments to explain the origin of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets. We investigate the nodal gap in the cuprate superconductors and discuss both the doping and temperature dependence of the nodal gap. We suggest that the nodal gap is responsible for the doping dependence of the so-called nodal Fermi velocity detected in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies. We discuss the thermodynamics of the nodal quasielectron liquid and their role in the low temperature specific heat. We propose that the ubiquitous presence of charge density wave in hole doped cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap region originates from instabilities of the nodal quasielectrons driven by the interaction with the planar $CuO_2$ lattice. We investigate the doping dependence of the charge density wave gap and the competition between charge order and superconductivity. We discuss the effects of external magnetic fields on the charge density wave gap and elucidate the interplay between charge density wave and Abrikosov vortices. Finally, we examine the physics underlying quantum oscillations in the pseudogap region.

abstract: By analyzing the key properties of black holes from the point of view of quantum information, we derive a model-independent picture of black hole quantum computing. It has been noticed that this picture exhibits striking similarities with quantum critical condensates, allowing the use of a common language to describe quantum computing in both systems. We analyze such quantum computing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that the external influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic properties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial time-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal entanglement and total scrambling. We show that for black hole type quantum computers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-life time. Furthermore, we construct explicitly a set of Hamiltonians that generates a universal set of quantum gates for the black hole type computer. We find that the gates work at maximal energy efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a fundamental bound on the complexity of quantum circuits encoded on these systems, and characterize the unitary operations that are implementable. It becomes apparent that the computational power is very limited due to the fact that the black hole life-time is of the same order of the gate operation time. As a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve its information, within the life-time of a black hole, by externally coupling to the black hole qubits. However, we show that, in principle, coupling to some of the internal degrees of freedom allows acquiring knowledge about the micro-state. Still, due to the trivial complexity of operations that can be performed, there is no time advantage over the collection of Hawking radiation and subsequent decoding.

abstract: We study novel types of contributions to the partition function of the Maxwell system defined on a small compact manifold ${\mathbb{M}}$ with nontrivial mappings $\pi_1[U(1)]\cong\mathbb{Z}$. These novel contributions cannot be described in terms of conventional physical propagating photons with two transverse polarizations, and instead emerge as a result of tunneling transitions between topologically different but physically identical vacuum winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to the Casimir pressure, yet to be measured. We argue that if the same system is considered in the background of a small external time-dependent E\&M field, then real physical photons will be emitted from the vacuum, similar to the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) where photons are radiated from the vacuum due to time-dependent boundary conditions. We propose an experimental realization of such small effects using a microwave cavity. We also comment on the possible cosmological implications of this effect.
