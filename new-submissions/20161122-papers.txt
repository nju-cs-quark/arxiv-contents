abstract: Using Gardiner and Collet's input-output model and the concept of cascade system, we determine the filtering equation for a system driven by non-classical states of light. We describe the stochastic evolution conditioned on the results of the quadrature measurement. The observed system and electromagnetic field are described by making use of quantum stochastic unitary evolution. We consider two examples of the non-classical states of the field: a combination of vacuum and single photon states and a mixture of two coherent states.

In this approach we give a new way to design protocols, and we discover a new multipartite quantum communication protocol. We introduce the notion of topologically compressed transformations. Our new protocol can implement multiple, non-local compressed transformations among multi-parties using one multipartite resource state.

abstract: The existence of higher than pairwise quantum interference in the set-up, in which there are more than two slits, is currently under experimental investigation. However, it is still unclear what the confirmation of existence of such interference would mean for quantum theory -- whether that usual quantum mechanics is merely a limiting case of some more general theory or whether that some assumption of quantum theory taken as a fundamental one does not actually hold true. The present paper tries to understand why quantum theory is limited only to a certain kind of interference.

abstract: In a recent paper Mahler {\em et al.} have argued that the experiments of Kocsis {\em et al.} provide experimental evidence for Bohmian mechanics. Unfortunately these experiments used relativistic, zero rest mass photons whereas Bohmian mechanics is based on non-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger particles having non-zero rest mass. The experimental results can be correctly understood in terms of a different approach based on the electromagnetic field that was already outlined by Bohm in an appendix of the second of his 1952 papers. A subsequent development of this approach by Bohm, Hiley, Kaloyerou and Holland, show in detail how this theory accounts for the experimental results. We are led to the conclusion that the experiments have constructed mean momentum flow lines by measuring the real part of the weak Poynting vector. These results support and clarify the analysis of Bliokh {\em et al}. The experimental flow lines can be constructed independently of the number of photons in the beam leading to the conclusion that flow lines cannot be interpreted as `photon trajectories'. We discuss exactly how the notion of a photon arises in the field approach.

abstract: Synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators (SPOPOs) are optical cavities containing a nonlinear crystal capable of down-converting a frequency comb to lower frequencies. These have received a lot of attention lately, because their intrinsic multimode nature makes them compact sources of quantum correlated light with promising applications in modern quantum information technologies. In this work we show that SPOPOs are also capable of accessing the challenging but interesting regime where spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in the quantum properties of the emitted light, difficult to access with any other nonlinear optical cavity. Apart from opening the possibility of studying experimentally this elusive regime of dissipative phase transitions, our predictions will have a practical impact, since we show that spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a specific spatiotemporal mode with perfect squeezing for any value of the system parameters, turning SPOPOs into robust sources of highly nonclassical light above threshold.

We find the analytical solutions in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions for the scattering states with energy greater than the maximum value of the potential. We also discussed the case for the energy lower than the maximum and the similarities and differences with the abrupt step potential in both cases. We graphically illustrate the relevant physical situations to the problem.

abstract: To reconstruct thermodynamics based on the microscopic laws is one of the most important unfulfilled goals of statistical physics. Here, we show that the first law and the second law for adiabatic processes are derived from an assumption that "probability distributions of energy in Gibbs states satisfy large deviation", which is widely accepted as a property of thermodynamic equilibrium states. We define an adiabatic transformation as a probabilistic mixture of the energy-preserving unitary transformations on the many-body systems and the work storage. As the second law, we show that an adiabatic transformation from a set of Gibbs states to another set of Gibbs states is possible if and only if the regularized von Neumann entropy becomes large. As the first law, we show that the energy loss of the thermodynamic systems during the adiabatic transformation is stored in the work storage as ``work,'' in the following meaning; (i) the energy of the work storage takes certain values macroscopically, in the initial state and the final state. (ii) the entropy of the work storage in the final state is macroscopically equal to the entropy of the initial state. As corollaries, our results give the maximam work principle and the first law for the isothermal processes.

abstract: We review a highly efficient and accurate method for the propagation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, recently published. The method is readily generalized to solve an arbitrary set of ODE's. The propagation is based on a global approach, in which large time-intervals are treated as a whole, replacing the local considerations of the common propagators. The new method is suitable for various classes of problems, including problems with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, nonlinear problems, non-Hermitian problems and problems with an inhomogeneous source term. In this paper, a thorough presentation of the basic principles of the propagator is given. We give also a special emphasis on the details of the numerical implementation of the method. For the first time, we present the application for a non-Hermitian problem by a numerical example of a one-dimensional atom under the influence of an intense laser field. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by a comparison with the common Runge-Kutta approach.

abstract: In a recent work, we have derived simple Lindblad-based equations for the thermalization of systems in contact with a thermal reservoir. Here, we apply these equations to the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) in contact with a blackbody radiation and analyze the dipole matrix elements involved in the thermalization process. We find that the thermalization can be complete only if the density is sufficiently high, while, in the limit of low density, the system thermalizes partially, namely, within the Hilbert subspaces where the total spin has a fixed value. In this regime, and in the isotropic case, we evaluate the characteristic thermalization time analytically, and show that it diverges with the system size in correspondence of the critical points and inside the ferromagnetic region. Quite interestingly, at zero temperature the thermalization time diverges only quadratically with the system size, whereas quantum adiabatic algorithms, aimed at finding the ground state of same system, imply a cubic divergence of the required adiabatic time.

abstract: Locality of a noisy state for a large number of nonlocally entangled qudits was analyzed in the literature only in the qubit case and only within separability of a noisy N-qubit state. In the present paper, we evaluate amounts of noise breaking the nonlocal character of statistical correlations of $N$ entangled qudits by analyzing Bell inequalities violations via the general frame, the LqHV (local quasi hidden variable) modeling frame, introduced in [Loubenets: J. Math. Phys. 53, 022201 (2012)]. This allows us to derive the general exact bound on locality of a noisy N-qudit state which is new and important for all $N\geq 3$ and $d\geq 2.$ We specify the locality noise thresholds for the maximally entangled state and arbitrary nonlocal states of $N\geq 3$ qudits and study their asymptotics for large $N$. In view of developing quantum information technologies with many particle quantum systems, this problem is of a particular interest.

abstract: Is wave function collapse a prediction of the Schr\"odinger equation? This unusual problem is explored in an enlarged framework of interpretation, where quantum dynamics is considered exact and its interpretation is extended to include local entanglement of two systems, including a macroscopic one. This property of local entanglement, which results directly from the Schr\"odinger equation but is unrelated with observables, is measured by local probabilities, fundamentally distinct from quantum probabilities and evolving nonlinearly. When applied to a macroscopic system and the fluctuations in its environment, local entanglement can also inject a formerly ignored species of incoherence into the quantum state of this system,. When applied to a quantum measurement, the conjunction of these two effects suggests a self-consistent mechanism of collapse, which would directly derive from the Schr\"odinger equation. (This work develops and improves significantly a previously circulated version with the same title [23])

abstract: Continuous variable Beam Splitter (BS) generated entanglement from single mode optical states generated by single nonclassicality (NC) inducing operation have been found of immense importance in several information processing tasks. There exists a broader class of optical states, generated from successive action of multiple different NC-inducing operations, which show many intriguing nonclassical properties; however the BS conversion of the NC for such states remains unexplored. In this work we have critically analyzed the BS generated entanglement from such nonclassical optical states at input. Here we present a scenario where BS output entanglement becomes non-monotonic with the input NC parameters, amenable experimentally (e.g. number of photon excitation and squeezing strength), in contrast with the previous results with states comprising of single NC- inducing operation. We explain this counter intuitive feature in terms of the competition between the NCs induced by specific type of NC-inducing operations.

abstract: The realization of cross-Kerr nonlinearity is an important task for many applications in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a method for realizing cross-Kerr nonlinearity interaction between two superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators coupled by a three-level superconducting flux qutrit (coupler). By employing the qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, we derive an effective Hamiltonian involving two-photon number operators and a coupler operator. This Hamiltonian can be used to describe a cross-Kerr nonlinearity interaction between two resonators when the coupler is in the ground state. Because the coupler is unexcited during the entire process, the effect of coupler decoherence can be greatly minimized. More importantly, compared with the previous proposals, our proposal does not require classical pulses. Furthermore, due to use of only a three-level qutrit, the experimental setup is much simplified when compared with previous proposals requiring a four-level artificial atomic systems. Based on our Hamiltonian, we implement a two-resonator qubits controlled-phase gate and generate a two-resonator entangled coherent state. Numerical simulation shows that the high-fidelity implementation of the phase gate and creation of the entangled coherent state are feasible with current circuit QED technology.

abstract: Initializing a set of qubits to a given quantum state is a basic prerequisite for the physical implementation of quantum-information protocols. Here, we discuss the polarization of the electronic and nuclear spin in a single Nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. Our initialization scheme uses a sequence of laser, microwave and radio-frequency pulses, and we optimize the pumping parameters of the laser pulse. A rate equation model is formulated that explains the effect of the laser pulse on the spin system. We have experimentally determined the population of the relevant spin states as a function of the duration of the laser pulse by measuring Rabi oscillations and Ramsey-type free-induction decays. The experimental data have been analyzed to determine the pumping rates of the rate equation model.

With these generators the desired braid quantum gates are obtained. We show that the generalized GHZ states, which are maximally entangled states, can be obtained directly from these braid quantum gates without resorting to further local unitary transformations. We also point out an interesting observation that for a a general multi-qudit state there exists a unitary braid quantum gate based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra that connects it from one of its component basis states, if the coefficient of the component state is such that the square of its norm is no less than $1/4$.

abstract: Besides their stunning physical properties which are unmatched in a classical world, squeezed states of electromagnetic radiation bear advanced application potentials in quantum information systems and precision metrology, including gravitational wave detectors with unprecedented sensitivity. Since the first experiments on such nonclassical light, quantum analysis has been based on homodyning techniques and photon correlation measurements. These methods require a well-defined carrier frequency and photons contained in a quantum state need to be absorbed or amplified. They currently function in the visible to near-infrared and microwave spectral ranges. Quantum nondemolition experiments may be performed at the expense of excess fluctuations in another quadrature. Here we generate mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed vacuum noise. After propagation through free space, the quantum fluctuations of the electric field are studied in the time domain by electro-optic sampling with few-femtosecond laser pulses. We directly compare the local noise amplitude to the level of bare vacuum fluctuations. This nonlinear approach operates off resonance without absorption or amplification of the field that is investigated. Subcycle intervals with noise level significantly below the pure quantum vacuum are found. Enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time segments manifest generation of highly correlated quantum radiation as a consequence of the uncertainty principle. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this work opens a window to the elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an energy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.

abstract: Attempts to find a quantum-to-classical correspondence in a classically forbidden region leads to non-physical paths, involving, for example, complex time or spatial coordinates. Here, we identify genuine quasi-classical paths for tunneling in terms of probabilistic correlations in sequential time-of-arrival measurements. In particular, we construct the post-selected probability density $P_{p.s.}(x, \tau)$ for a particle to be found at time $\tau$ in position $x$ inside the forbidden region, provided that it later crossed the barrier. The classical paths follow from the maximization of the probability density with respect to $\tau$. For almost monochromatic initial states, the paths correspond to the maxima of the modulus square of the wave-function $|\psi(x,\tau)|^2$ with respect to $\tau$ and for constant $x$ inside the barrier region. The derived paths are expressed in terms of classical equations, but they have no analogues in classical mechanics. Finally, we evaluate the paths explicitly for the case of a square potential barrier.

abstract: The no-signaling constraints state that the probability distribution of the outputs of any subset of parties is independent of the inputs of the complementary set; here we re-examine these to see how they arise from relativistic causality. We show that while the usual no-signaling constraints are sufficient, in general they are not necessary to ensure that a theory does not violate causality. Depending on the exact space-time coordinates of the measurement events in a multi-party Bell experiment, causality only imposes a subset of the usual no-signaling conditions. After revisiting the derivation of the two-party no-signaling constraints, we consider the three-party Bell scenario and characterise a space-time region in which a subset of the no-signaling conditions is sufficient to preserve causality. Secondly, we examine the implications for device-independent cryptography against an eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity. We show an explicit attack in certain measurement configurations on a family of protocols based on the n-party Mermin inequalities that were previously proven secure under the old no-signaling conditions. We then show that security of two-party protocols can also be compromised when the eavesdropper's measurement configuration is not constrained. The monogamy of non-local correlations that underpin their use in secrecy can also be broken in certain space-time configurations. Thirdly, we inspect the notion of free-choice and propose a definition of free-choice in the multi-party Bell experiment. We then re-examine the question whether quantum correlations may admit explanations by finite speed superluminal influences. Finally, we study genuine multiparty non-locality and present a new class of causal bilocal models. We propose a new Svetlichny-type inequality that is satisfied by the causal bilocal model and show its violation within quantum theory.

abstract: We consider quantum phase space dynamics using the Wigner representation of quantum mechanics. We stress the usefulness of the integral form for the description of Wigner's phase space current~$\bm J$ as an alternative to the popular Moyal bracket. The integral form brings out the symmetries between momentum and position representations of quantum mechanics, is numerically stable, and allows us to perform some calculations using elementary integrals instead of Groenewold star-products. Our central result is an explicit, elementary proof which shows that only systems up to quadratic in their potential fulfil Liouville's theorem of volume preservation in quantum mechanics. Contrary to a recent suggestion, our proof shows that the non-Liouvillian character of quantum phase space dynamics cannot be transformed away.

abstract: The sensing capability of a single optically bright electronic spin in diamond can be enhanced by making use of proximal dark nuclei as ancillary spins. Such systems, so far only realized in bulk diamond, provide orders of magnitude higher sensitivity and spectral resolution in the case of magnetic sensing, as well as improved readout fidelity and state storage time in quantum information schemes. In nanodiamonds, which offer additional opportunities as mobile nanoscale sensors, electronic-nuclear spin complexes have remained inaccessible. We demonstrate coherent control of a 13C nuclear spin located 4{\AA} from a nitrogen-vacancy center in a nanodiamond and show quantum-state transfer between the two components of this hybrid spin system. We extract a nuclear-spin free precession time of T2* = 26 us, which exceeds the bare electron free precession time in nanodiamond by two orders of magnitude.

abstract: Bell nonlocality can be formulated in terms of a resource theory with local-hidden variable models as resourceless objects. Two such theories are known, one built upon local operations assisted by shared randomness (LOSRs) and the other one allowing, in addition, for prior-to-input classical communication. We show that prior communication, although unable to create nonlocality, leads to wirings not only beyond LOSRs but also not contained in a much broader class of (nonlocality-generating) global wirings. Technically, this is shown by proving that it can improve the statistical distinguishability between Bell correlations optimised over all fixed measurement choices. This has implications in nonlocality quantification, and leads us to a natural universal definition of Bell nonlocality measures. To end up with, we also consider the statistical strength of nonlocality proofs. We point out some issues of its standard definition in the resource-theoretic operational framework, and suggest simple fixes for them. Our findings reveal non-trivial features of the geometry of the set of wirings and may have implications in the operational distinguishability of nonlocal behaviors.

abstract: Graph states and hypergraph states are quantum states that can be described by a stabilizer formalism and play an important role in quantum information processing. We consider the action of local unitary operations on graph states and hypergraph states. We focus on non-Clifford operations and find for certain transformations a graphical description in terms of weighted hypergraphs. This allows to identify hypergraph states that are locally equivalent to graph states. Moreover, we present a systematic way to construct pairs of graph states which are equivalent under local unitary operations, but not equivalent under local Clifford operations. This generates counterexamples to a conjecture known as LU-LC conjecture. So far, the only counterexample to this conjecture was found by random search. Our method reproduces this as a special case and provides a physical interpretation.

abstract: Quantum computers will eventually reach a size at which quantum error correction (QEC) becomes imperative. In order to make quantum information robust to errors introduced by qubit imperfections and flawed control operations, QEC protocols encode a logical qubit in multiple physical qubits. This redundancy allows the extraction of error syndromes and the subsequent correction or detection of errors without destroying the logical state itself through direct measurement. While several experiments have shown a reduction of high intrinsic or artificially introduced errors in logical qubits, fault-tolerant encoding of a logical qubit has never been demonstrated. Here we show the encoding and syndrome measurement of a fault-tolerant logical qubit via an error detection protocol on four physical qubits, represented by trapped atomic ions. This demonstrates for the first time the robustness of a fault-tolerant qubit to imperfections in the very operations used to encode it. This advantage persists in the face of large added error rates and experimental calibration errors.

abstract: Bell's theorem states that some predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by a local-realist theory. That conflict is expressed by Bell's inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this "freedom of choice" was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional "quantum random number generators" (QRNGs) was space-like separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell's inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as "cosmic setting generators." In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. We observe statistically significant $\gtrsim 11.7 \sigma$ and $\gtrsim 13.8 \sigma$ violations of Bell's inequality with estimated $p$-values of $ \lesssim 7.4 \times 10^{-32}$ and $\lesssim 1.1 \times 10^{-43}$, respectively, thereby pushing back by $\sim$600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.

Using a "smooth" analysis of lattices by SysNF lattices we design a quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve the following variant of the bounded-distance-decoding problem: given a lattice L, a vector v, and numbers b = {\lambda}_1(L)/n^{17}, a = {\lambda}_1(L)/n^{13} decide if v's distance from L is in the range [a/2, a] or at most b, where {\lambda}_1(L) is the length of L's shortest non-zero vector. Improving these parameters to a = b = {\lambda}_1(L)/\sqrt{n} would invalidate one of the security assumptions of the Learning-with-Errors (LWE) cryptosystem against quantum attacks.

abstract: We propose a new method for optomechanical quantum non-demolition (QND) detection of phonon number, based on a "shelving" style measurement. The scheme uses a two-mode optomechanical system where the frequency splitting of the two photonic modes is near-resonant with the mechanical frequency. The combination of a strong optical drive and the underlying nonlinear optomechanical interaction gives rise to spin-like dynamics which facilitate the measurement. This approach allows phonon number measurement to be accomplished parametrically faster than in other schemes which are restricted to weak driving. The ultimate power of the scheme is controlled by the size of the single photon optomechanical cooperativity.

abstract: We study the non-equilibrium transport properties of a highly anisotropic two-dimensional lattice of spin-1/2 particles governed by a Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonian. The anisotropy of the lattice allows us to approximate the system at finite temperature as an array of incoherently coupled one-dimensional chains. We show that in the regime of strong intrachain interactions, the weak interchain coupling considerably boosts spin transport in the driven system. Interestingly, we show that this enhancement increases with the length of the chains, which is related to superdiffusive spin transport. We describe the mechanism behind this effect, compare it to a similar phenomenon in single chains induced by dephasing, and explain why the former is much stronger.

abstract: We report measurements of Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation of coherent light transmitted through disordered one-dimensional photonic lattices. Although such a lattice exhibits transverse Anderson localization when a single input site is excited, uniform excitation precludes its observation. By examining the Hanbury Brown--Twiss correlation for a uniformly excited disordered lattice, we observe intensity anticorrelations associated with photon antibunching--a signature of non-Gaussian statistics. Although the measured average intensity distribution is uniform, transverse Anderson localization nevertheless underlies the observed anticorrelation.

abstract: When a disordered array of coupled waveguides is illuminated with an extended coherent optical field, discrete speckle develops: partially coherent light with a granular intensity distribution on the lattice sites. The same paradigm applies to a variety of other settings in photonics, such as imperfectly coupled resonators or fibers with randomly coupled cores. Through numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we uncover a set of surprising features that characterize discrete speckle in one- and two-dimensional lattices known to exhibit transverse Anderson localization. Firstly, the fingerprint of localization is embedded in the fluctuations of the discrete speckle and is revealed in the narrowing of the spatial coherence function. Secondly, the transverse coherence length (or speckle grain size) is frozen during propagation. Thirdly, the axial coherence depth is independent of the axial position, thereby resulting in a coherence voxel of fixed volume independently of position. We take these unique features collectively to define a distinct regime that we call discrete Anderson speckle.

abstract: Monochromatic coherent light traversing a disordered photonic medium evolves into a random field whose statistics are dictated by the disorder level. Here we demonstrate experimentally that light statistics can be deterministically tuned in certain disordered lattices, even when the disorder level is held fixed, by controllably breaking the excitation symmetry of the lattice modes. We exploit a lattice endowed with disorder-immune chiral symmetry in which the eigenmodes come in skew-symmetric pairs. If a single lattice site is excited, a "photonic thermalization gap" emerges: the realm of sub-thermal light statistics is inaccessible regardless of the disorder level. However, by exciting two sites with a variable relative phase, as in a traditional two-path interferometer, the chiral symmetry is judiciously broken and interferometric control over the light statistics is exercised, spanning sub-thermal and super-thermal regimes. These results may help develop novel incoherent lighting sources from coherent lasers.

abstract: The formation of gaps -- forbidden ranges in the values of a physical parameter -- is a ubiquitous feature of a variety of physical systems: from energy bandgaps of electrons in periodic lattices and their analogs in photonic, phononic, and plasmonic systems to pseudo energy gaps in aperiodic quasicrystals. Here, we report on a `thermalization' gap for light propagating in finite disordered structures characterized by disorder-immune chiral symmetry -- the appearance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in skew-symmetric pairs. In this class of systems, the span of sub- thermal photon statistics is inaccessible to input coherent light, which -- once the steady state is reached -- always emerges with super-thermal statistics no matter how small the disorder level. We formulate an independent constraint that must be satisfied by the input field for the chiral symmetry to be `activated' and the gap to be observed. This unique feature enables a new form of photon-statistics interferometry: the deterministic tuning of photon statistics -- from sub-thermal to super-thermal -- in a compact device, without changing the disorder level, via controlled excitation-symmetry-breaking realized by sculpting the amplitude or phase of the input coherent field.

abstract: A discrete quantum spin system is presented in which several modern methods of canonical quantum gravity can be tested with promising results. In particular, features of interacting dynamics are analyzed with an emphasis on homogeneous configurations and the dynamical building-up and stability of long-range correlations. Different types of homogeneous minisuperspace models are introduced for the system, including one based on condensate states, and shown to capture different aspects of the discrete system. They are evaluated with effective methods and by means of continuum limits, showing good agreement with operator calculations whenever the latter are available. As a possibly quite general result, it is concluded that an analysis of the building-up of long-range correlations in discrete systems requires non-perturbative solutions of the dynamical equations. Some questions related to stability can be analyzed perturbatively, but suggest that matter couplings may be relevant for this question in the context of quantum cosmology.

abstract: The coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the g.s. of the three-species condensates (3-BEC) have been solved analytically under the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Six types of spatial configurations in miscible phase are found. The whole parameter-space has been divided into zones each supports a specific configuration (miscible or immiscible). The borders of the zones are described by analytical formulae. Due to the division, the variation of the spatial configuration against the parameters can be visualized, and the effects of the parameters can be thereby understood. There are regions in the parameter-space where the configuration is highly sensitive to the parameters. These regions are tunable and valuable for the determination of the parameters.

abstract: A technique is proposed to cool Fermi gases to the regime of quantum degeneracy based on the expected inhibition of spontaneous emission due to the Pauli principle. The reduction of the linewidth for spontaneous emission originates a corresponding reduction of the Doppler temperature, which under specific conditions may give rise to a runaway process through which fermions are progressively cooled. The approach requires a combination of a magneto-optical trap as a cooling system and an optical dipole trap to enhance quantum degeneracy. This results in expected Fermi degeneracy factors $T/T_F$ comparable to the lowest values recently achieved, with potential for a direct implementation in optical lattices. The experimental demonstration of this technique should also indirectly provide a macroscopic manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle at the atomic physics level.

abstract: We show how the classical action, an adiabatic invariant, can be preserved under non-adiabatic conditions. Specifically, for a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H = p^2/2m + U(q,t)$ in one degree of freedom, and for an arbitrary choice of action $I_0$, we construct a "fast-forward" potential energy function $V_{\rm FF}(q,t)$ that, when added to $H$, guides all trajectories with initial action $I_0$ to end with the same value of action. We use this result to construct a local dynamical invariant $J(q,p,t)$ whose value remains constant along these trajectories. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. Finally, we sketch how our classical results may be used to design approximate quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity.

abstract: Spatial quantum correlations in the transverse degree of freedom promise to enhance optical resolution, image detection, and quantum communications through parallel quantum information encoding. In particular, the ability to observe these spatial quantum correlations in a single shot will enable such enhancements in applications that require real time imaging, such as particle tracking and in-situ imaging of atomic systems. Here, we report on the direct measurement of spatial quantum correlations in the macroscopic regime in single images using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. A four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium atoms is used to generate narrowband-bright-entangled pulsed twin-beams of light with $\sim10^8$ photons in each beam. Owing to momentum conservation in this process, the twin-beams are momentum correlated, which leads to spatial quantum correlations in far field. We show around 2 dB of spatial quantum noise reduction with respect to the shot noise limit. The spatial squeezing is present over a large range of total number of photons in the pulsed twin-beams.

abstract: Influence of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode on the energy-weighted sum (EWS) of the excitation strengths is analyzed, within the random-phase approximation (RPA). When a certain symmetry is broken at the mean-field level, a NG mode emerges in the RPA, which can be represented by canonical variables forming a two-dimensional Jordan block. A general formula is derived which separates out the NG-mode contribution to the EWS, via the projection on the subspace directed by the NG mode. As examples, the formula is applied to the $E1$ excitation and the rotational excitations in nuclei.

abstract: Propagation of coherent light through a disordered network is accompanied by randomization and possible conversion into thermal light. Here, we show that network topology plays a decisive role in determining the statistics of the emerging field if the underlying lattice satisfies chiral symmetry. By examining one-dimensional arrays of randomly coupled waveguides arranged on linear and ring topologies, we are led to a remarkable prediction: the field circularity and the photon statistics in ring lattices are dictated by its parity -- whether the number of sites is even or odd, while the same quantities are insensitive to the parity of a linear lattice. Adding or subtracting a single lattice site can switch the photon statistics from super-thermal to sub-thermal, or vice versa. This behavior is understood by examining the real and imaginary fields on a chiral-symmetric lattice, which form two strands that interleave along the lattice sites. These strands can be fully braided around an even-sited ring lattice thereby producing super-thermal photon statistics, while an odd-sited lattice is incommensurate with such an arrangement and the statistics become sub-thermal. Such effects are suppressed in the limit of high lattice disorder, whereupon Anderson localization arrests the spread of light around the lattice and eliminates topology-dependent phenomena.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1611.06711
abstract: Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes represent an orthonormal basis set of solutions of the paraxial wave equation. LG are characterized by two integer parameters $n$ and $\ell$ that are related to the radial and azimuthal profile of the beam. The physical dimension of the mode is instead determined by the beam waist parameter $w_0$: only LG modes with the same $w_0$ satisfy the orthogonality relation. Here, we derive the scalar product between two LG modes with different beam waists and show how this result can be exploited to derive different expansions of a generic beam in terms of LG modes. In particular, we apply our results to the recently introduced Circular Beams, by deriving a previously unknown expansion. We finally show how the waist parameter must be chosen in order to optimize such expansion.

abstract: We give an exposition of the Horn inequalities and their triple role characterizing tensor product invariants, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices, and intersections of Schubert varieties. We follow Belkale's geometric method, but assume only basic representation theory and algebraic geometry, aiming for self-contained, concrete proofs. In particular, we do not assume the Littlewood-Richardson rule nor an a priori relation between intersections of Schubert cells and tensor product invariants. Our motivation is largely pedagogical, but the desire for concrete approaches is also motivated by current research in computational complexity theory and effective algorithms.
