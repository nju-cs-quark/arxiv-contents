abstract: The calculation of realistic N-body wave functions for identical fermions is still an open problem in physics, chemistry, and materials science, even for N as small as two. A recently discovered fundamental algebraic structure of many-body Hilbert space allows an arbitrary many-fermion wave function to be written in terms of a finite number of antisymmetric functions called shapes. Shapes naturally generalize the single-Slater-determinant form for the ground state to more than one dimension. Their number is exactly $N!^{d-1}$ in $d$ dimensions. An efficient algorithm is described to generate all fermion shapes in spaces of odd dimension, which improves on a recently published general algorithm. The results are placed in the context of contemporary investigations of strongly correlated electrons.

abstract: Analytical expressions for the transition probability and the energy spectrum of the 1D Schr\"odinger equation with position dependent mass are presented for the triangular quantum barrier and quantum well. The transmission coefficient is obtained by using the wave functions written in terms of the Airy's functions and of the solutions of the Kummer's differential equation. In order to show the validity of our analyze, an example by taking some numerical values for GaAs heterostructure is presented.

abstract: Resource states that contain nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order are identified for universal measurement-based quantum computation. Our resource states fall into two classes: one as the qudit generalizations of the qubit cluster state, and the other as the higher-symmetry generalizations of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state, namely, with unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry. The symmetry in cluster states protects information propagation (identity gate), while the higher symmetry in AKLT-type states enables nontrivial gate computation. This work demonstrates a close connection between measurement-based quantum computation and symmetry-protected topological order.

abstract: This is a work in two parts in which we show how to solve a large class of Lindblad master equations for non-interacting particles on $L$ sites. In part I we concentrate on bosonic particles. We show how to reduce the problem to diagonalizing an $L \times L$ non-Hermitian matrix. In particular, for boundary dissipative driving of a uniform chain, the matrix is a tridiagonal bordered Toeplitz matrix which can be solved analytically for the normal master modes and their relaxation rates (rapidities). In the regimes in which an analytical solution cannot be found, our approach can still provide a speed-up in the numerical evaluation. We use this numerical method to study the relaxation gap at non-equilibrium phase transitions in a boundary driven bosonic ladder with synthetic gauge fields. We conclude by showing how to construct the non-equilibrium steady state.

abstract: It is widely accepted that the Bures-Helstrom (BH) metric and the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound impose a limit on our ability to discriminate between neighbouring quantum states. We explore an alternative metric based on the quantum relative entropy, which imposes a less stringent bound. Specialising to qubits, we derive the explicit form of the metric, which defines a distance on the qubit state space. We then show how the Bures-Helstrom-Cramer-Rao (BHCR) bound can be beaten using quantum entanglement. We propose an experiment using trapped cold atoms to implement this idea. The less stringent boundimposes the absolute limit on state discrimination.

abstract: Multipartite entanglement and nonclassicality of four-mode Gaussian states generated in two simultaneous nonlinear processes involving parametric down-conversion and frequency up-conversion are analyzed assuming the vacuum as the initial state. Suitable conditions for the generation of highly entangled states are found. Transfer of the entanglement from the down-converted modes into the up-converted ones is also suggested. The analysis of the whole set of states reveals that sub-shot-noise intensity correlations between the equally-populated down-converted modes, as well as the equally-populated up-converted modes, uniquely identify entangled states. They represent a powerful entanglement identifier also in other cases with arbitrarily populated modes.

abstract: A fundamental requirement for the emergence of classical behavior from an underlying quantum description is that certain observed quantum systems make a transition to chaotic dynamics as their action is increased relative to $\hbar$. While experiments have demonstrated some aspects of this transition, the emergence of trajectories with a positive Lyapunov exponent has never been directly observed. Here, we remove a major obstacle to achieving this goal by showing that, for the Duffing oscillator, the transition to a positive Lyapunov exponent can be resolved clearly from observed trajectories even with measurement efficiencies as low as 20\%. We also find that the positive Lyapunov exponent is robust to highly mixed, low purity states and to variations in the parameters of the system.

abstract: Thermal microwave states are omnipresent noise sources in superconducting quantum circuits covering all relevant frequency regimes. We report on three individual second-order decoherence mechanisms of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to well-controlled heatable resistors acting as black-body radiators. We quantify the efficiency of a resonator filter in the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings regime and find evidence for parasitic loss channels. Furthermore, we probe second-order noise in the low-frequency regime resulting in the expected $T^{3}$ temperature dependence of the qubit dephasing rate. Finally, we show that qubit parameter fluctuations due to interacting two-level states are enhanced under the influence of thermal microwave states.

abstract: In experiments with superconducting quantum circuits, the characterization of propagating microwave fields is a fundamental task. We quantify the $n^{2}\,{+}\,n$ photon statistics of thermal microwave photons emitted from a black-body radiator for mean photon numbers $0.05\,{\lesssim}\,n\,{\lesssim}\,1.5$. We probe the fields using either correlation measurements or a transmon qubit coupled to a microwave resonator. Our experiments provide a precise quantitative characterization of weak thermal microwave states and demonstrate that they are a versatile tool for the characterization of superconducting circuits.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.07380
abstract: Ehrenfest's theorem in the infinite square well is up to now only manifested indirectly. The manifestation of this theorem is first done in the finite square well, and then consider the infinite square well as the limit of the finite well. For a direct manifestation, we need a more precise formula to describe the degree of infiniteness of the divergent potential energy. We show that the potential energy term term, which is the product of the potential energy and the energy eigenfunction, is a well defined function which can be expressed in terms of Dirac delta functions. This means that the infinity in this model is not that vague but has obtained a specification. This results that expectation values can be calculated precisely and Ehrenfest's thereom can be confirmed directly.

abstract: Type II optical parametric oscillators are amongst the highest-quality sources of quantum-correlated light. In particular, when pumped above threshold, such devices generate a pair of bright orthogonally-polarized beams with strong continuous-variable entanglement. However, these sources are of limited practical use, because the entangled beams emerge with different frequencies and a diffusing phase-difference. It has been proven that the use of an internal wave-plate coupling the modes with orthogonal polarization is capable of locking the frequencies of the emerging beams to half the pump frequency, as well as reducing the phase-difference diffusion, at the expense of reducing the entanglement levels. In this work we characterize theoretically an alternative locking mechanism: the injection of a laser at half the pump frequency. Apart from being less invasive, this method should allow for an easier real-time experimental control. We show that such an injection is capable of generating the desired phase locking between the emerging beams, while still allowing for large levels of entanglement. Moreover, we find an additional region of the parameter space (at relatively large injections) where a mode with well defined polarization is in a highly squeezed vacuum state.

abstract: We theoretically consider the possibility of generating nonlinear transverse patterns in an optomechanical system in which the mechanical element is a microstructured oscillating end-mirrror consisting in an array of weakly-coupled micromirrors. While in the limit of large number of micro-mirrors we naturally recover the continuous model that we recently studied in [Ruiz-Rivas et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 033850 (2015)], we pay special numerical attention to the opposite limit, showing that the structures predicted with the continuous model can be observed for a number of micro-mirrors as low as ten or less. This opens new venues for experimental approaches to the subject.

abstract: Understanding decoherence in cryogenically-cooled rare-earth-ion doped glass fibers is of fundamental interest and a prerequisite for applications of these material in quantum information applications. Here we study the coherence properties in a weakly doped erbium silica glass fiber motivated by our recent observation of efficient and long-lived Zeeman sublevel storage in this material and by its potential for applications at telecommunication wavelengths. We analyze photon echo decays as well as the potential mechanisms of spectral diffusion that can be caused by coupling with dynamic disorder modes that are characteristic for glassy hosts, and by the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between $Er^{3+}$ ions. We also investigate the effective linewidth as a function of magnetic field, temperature and time, and then present a model that describes these experimental observations. We highlight that the operating conditions (0.6 K and 0.05 T) at which we previously observed efficient spectral hole burning coincide with those for narrow linewidths (1 MHz) { an important property for applications that has not been reported before for a rare-earth-ion doped glass.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is among the most fundamental, yet from classical intuition also most surprising properties of the fully quantum nature of physical reality. We report several experiments performed on IBM's Quantum Experience demonstrating envariance -- entanglement assisted invariance. Envariance is a recently discovered symmetry of composite quantum systems, which is at the foundational origin of physics and a purely quantum phenomenon. These very easily reproducible and freely accessible experiments on Quantum Experience provide simple tools to study the properties of envariance, and we illustrate this for several cases with "quantum universes" consisting of up to five qubits.

abstract: Quantum systems can display particle- or wave-like properties, depending on the type of measurement that is performed on them. The Bell-state quantum eraser is an experiment that brings the duality to the forefront, as a single measurement can retroactively be made to measure particle-like or wave-like properties (or anything in between). Here we develop a unitary information-theoretic description of this (and several related) quantum measurement situations that sheds light on the trade-off between the quantum and classical features of the measurement. In particular, we show that both the coherence of the quantum state and the classical information obtained from it can be described using quantum-information-theoretic tools only, and that those two measures satisfy an equality on account of the chain rule for entropies. The coherence information and the which-path information have simple interpretations in terms of state preparation and state determination, and suggest ways to account for the relationship between the classical and the quantum world.

abstract: Recently, in Sci. Rep. \textbf{6} (2016) 28767, Li et al., have proposed a scheme for quantum key distribution using Bell states. This comment provides a proof that the proposed scheme of Li et al., is insecure as it involves leakage of information. Further, it is also shown that all the error rates computed in the Li et al.'s paper are incorrect as the authors failed to recognize the fact that any eavesdropping effort will lead to entanglement swapping. Finally, it is established that Li et al.'s scheme can be viewed as an incrementally (but incorrectly)modified version of the existing schemes based on Goldenberg Vaidman (GV) subroutine.

abstract: Excitations in superfluid helium represent attractive mechanical degrees of freedom for cavity optomechanics schemes. Here we numerically and analytically investigate the properties of optomechanical resonators formed by thin films of superfluid $^4$He covering micrometer-scale whispering gallery mode cavities. We predict that through proper optimization of the interaction between film and optical field, large optomechanical coupling rates $g_0>2\pi \times 100$ kHz and single photon cooperativities $C_0>10$ are achievable. Our analytical model reveals the unconventional behaviour of these thin films, such as thicker and heavier films exhibiting smaller effective mass and larger zero point motion. The optomechanical system outlined here provides access to unusual regimes such as $g_0>\Omega_M$ and opens the prospect of laser cooling a liquid into its quantum ground state.

abstract: We consider the effect of electron-electron interactions on a voltage biased quantum point contact in the tunneling regime used as a detector of a nearby qubit. We model the leads of the quantum point contact as Luttinger liquids, incorporate the effects of finite temperature and analyze the detection-induced decoherence rate and the detector efficiency, $Q$. We find that interactions generically reduce the induced decoherence along with the detector's efficiency, and strongly affect the relative strength of the decoherence induced by tunneling and that induced by interactions with the local density. With increasing interaction strength, the regime of quantum limited detection ($Q=1$) is shifted to increasingly lower temperatures or higher bias voltages respectively. For small to moderate interaction strengths, $Q$ is a monotonously decreasing function of temperature as in the non-interacting case. Surprisingly, for sufficiently strong interactions we identify an intermediate temperature regime where the efficiency of the detector increases with rising temperature.

abstract: The spacetime dependence of the inverse temperature four-vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for certain states of the quantized Klein-Gordon field on (parts of) Minkowski spacetime is discussed. These states fulfill a recently proposed version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) boundary value condition, the so-called "local KMS (LKMS) condition". It turns out that, depending on the mass parameter $m\geq 0$, any such state can be extended either (i) to a LKMS state on some forward or backward lightcone, with $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ depending linearily on spacetime, or (ii) to a thermal equilibrium (KMS) state on all of Minkowski space with constant $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. This parallels previously known results for local thermal equilibrium (LTE) states of the quantized Klein-Gordon field. Furthermore, in the case of a massless field our results point to a discrepancy with some classic results in general approaches to (non-quantum) relativistic thermodynamics.

abstract: We present an upper bound on the exponent of the asymptotic behaviour of the tensor rank of a family of tensors defined by the complete graph on $k$ vertices. For $k\geq4$, we show that the exponent per edge is at most 0.77, outperforming the best known upper bound on the exponent per edge for matrix multiplication ($k=3$), which is approximately 0.79. We raise the question whether for some $k$ the exponent per edge can be below $2/3$, i.e. can outperform matrix multiplication even if the matrix multiplication exponent equals 2. In order to obtain our results, we generalise to higher order tensors a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of tight tensors and a result by Coppersmith and Winograd on the asymptotic rank of matrix multiplication. Our results have applications in entanglement theory and communication complexity.
