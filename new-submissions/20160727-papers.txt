abstract: We report on high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors based on amorphous WSi and optimized at 1064 nm. At an operating temperature of 1.8 K, we demonstrated a 93% system detection efficiency at this wavelength with a dark noise of a few counts per second. Combined with cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion, this fiber-coupled detector enabled us to generate narrowband single photons with a heralding efficiency greater than 90% and a high spectral brightness of $0.6\times10^4$ photons/(s$\cdot$mW$\cdot$MHz). Beyond single-photon generation at large rate, such high-efficiency detectors open the path to efficient multiple-photon heralding and complex quantum state engineering.

abstract: We study the entanglement entropy (EE) of Gaussian systems on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, both in the vacuum and at nonzero temperatures. By restricting the reduced subsystem to periodic sublattices, we can compute the entanglement spectrum and EE exactly. We illustrate this for a free (1+1)-dimensional massive scalar field at a fixed temperature. Consistent with previous literature, we demonstrate that for a sufficiently large periodic sublattice the EE grows extensively, even in the vacuum. Furthermore, the analytic expression for the EE allows us probe its behavior both in the massless limit and in the continuum limit at any temperature.

abstract: Quantum carpets- in position and momentum space- woven by the self-interference of de Broglie wave of an atom or an electron, trapped in an infinitely deep potential well, are explained. The recurrence of self-similar structures in designs of these carpets mimics the phenomena of quantum revivals and fractional revivals. We identify fractional revivals of various order by means of these space-time and momentum-time interference patterns.

abstract: We investigate small geometric configurations that furnish observable-based proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. Assuming that each context consists of the same number of observables and each observable is shared by two contexts, it is proved that the most economical proofs are the famous Mermin-Peres square and the Mermin pentagram featuring, respectively, $9$ and $10$ observables, there being no proofs using less than $9$ observables. We also propose a new proof with $14$ observables forming a `magic' heptagram. On the other hand, some other prominent small-size finite geometries, like the Pasch configuration and the prism, are shown not to be contextual.

abstract: The semiclassical long-time limit of free evolution of quantum wave packets on the torus is under consideration. Despite of simplicity of this system, there are still open questions concerning the detailed description of the evolution on time scales beyond the Ehrenfest time. One of the approaches is based on the limiting Wigner or Husimi distributions of time-evolved wave packets as the Planck constant tends to zero and time tends to infinity. We derive explicit expressions for semiclassical measures corresponding to all time scales and the corresponding stages of evolution: classical-like motion, spreading of the wave packet, and its revivals. Also we discuss limitations of the approach based on semiclassical measures and suggest its generalization.

abstract: Instantaneous quantum computing is a sub-universal quantum complexity class, whose circuits have proven to be hard to simulate classically in the Discrete-Variable (DV) realm. We extend this proof to the Continuous-Variable (CV) domain by using squeezed states and homodyne detection, and by exploring the properties of post-selected circuits. In order to treat post-selection in CVs we consider finitely-resolved homodyne detectors, corresponding to a realistic scheme based on discrete probability distributions of the measurement outcomes. The unavoidable errors stemming from the use of finitely squeezed states are suppressed through a qubit-into-oscillator GKP encoding of quan- tum information, which was previously shown to enable fault-tolerant CV quantum computation. Finally, we show that, in order to render post-selected computational classes in CVs meaningful, a logarithmic scaling of the squeezing parameter with the circuit size is necessary, translating into a polynomial scaling of the input energy.

abstract: Alternative exact expressions are derived for the minimum error probability of a hypothesis test discriminating among $M$ quantum states. The first expression corresponds to the error probability of a binary hypothesis test with certain parameters; the second involves the optimization of a given information-spectrum measure. Particularized in the classical-quantum channel coding setting, this characterization implies the tightness of two existing converse bounds; one derived by Matthews and Wehner using hypothesis-testing, and one obtained by Hayashi and Nagaoka via an information-spectrum approach.

abstract: As with entanglement, different forms of Bell nonlocality arise in the multipartite scenario. These can be defined in terms of relaxations of the causal assumptions in a local hidden-variable theory. However, a characterisation of all the forms of multipartite nonlocality has until now been out of reach, mainly due to the complexity of generic multipartite causal models. Here, we employ the formalism of Bayesian networks to reveal connections among different causal structures that make a both practical and physically meaningful classification possible. The framework developed holds in general for arbitrarily many parties. We apply it, in particular, to the tripartite scenario, where we fully characterize the nonlocality classes. This allow us to show the existence of quantum correlations that are nonlocal in a stronger sense than previously thought and, as a by-product, to derive non-trivial Bell inequalities with no quantum violation. Our findings constitute a significant step forward in the understanding of multipartite Bell nonlocality and open new venues for future research.

abstract: Optical fields with orbital angular momentum (OAM) interact with medium have many remarkable properties with its unique azimuthal phase, showing many potential applications in high capacity information processing, high precision measurement etc. The dephasing mechanics of optical fields with OAM in an interface between light and matter plays a vital role in many areas of physics. In this work, we study the transverse azimuthal dephasing of OAM spin wave in a hot atomic gas via OAM storage. The transverse azimuthal phase difference between the control and probe beams is mapped onto the spin wave, which essentially results in dephasing of atomic spin wave. The dephasing of OAM spin wave can be controlled by the parameters of OAM topological charge and beam waist. Our results are helpful for studying OAM light interaction with matter, maybe hold a promise in OAM-based quantum information processing.

This allows us to determine the estimation error for any measurement strength, including the weak measurement case, and to obtain an explicit analytic form for the average minimum square errors.

abstract: We address extended systems interacting with classical fluctuating environments and analyze the use of quantum probes to discriminate local noise, described by independent fluctuating fields, from common noise, corresponding to the interaction with a common one. In particular, we consider a bipartite system made of two non interacting harmonic oscillators and assess discrimination strategies based on homodyne detection, comparing their performances with the ultimate bounds on the error probabilities of quantum-limited measurements. We analyze in details the use of Gaussian probes, with emphasis on experimentally friendly signals. Our results show that a joint measurement of the position-quadrature on the two oscillators outperforms any other homodyne-based scheme for any input Gaussian state.

abstract: Considering stationary states of continuous-variable systems undergoing an open dynamics, we unveil the connection between properties and symmetries of the latter and the dynamical parameters. In particular, we explore the relation between the Lyapunov equation for dynamical systems and the steady-state solutions of a time-independent Lindblad master equation for bosonic modes. Exploiting bona-fide relations that characterize some genuine quantum properties (entanglement, classicality, and steerability), we obtain conditions on the dynamical parameters for which the system is driven to a steady-state possessing such properties. We also develop a method to capture the symmetries of a steady state based on symmetries of the Lyapunov equation. All the results and examples can be useful for steady-state engineering process.

abstract: We report measurements of energy-dependent attosecond photoionization delays between the two outer-most valence shells of N$_2$O and H$_2$O. The combination of single-shot signal referencing with the use of different metal foils to filter the attosecond pulse train enables us to extract delays from congested spectra. Remarkably large delays up to 160 as are observed in N$_2$O, whereas the delays in H$_2$O are all smaller than 50 as in the photon-energy range of 20-40 eV. These results are interpreted by developing a theory of molecular photoionization delays. The long delays measured in N$_2$O are shown to reflect the population of molecular shape resonances that trap the photoelectron for a duration of up to $\sim$110 as. The unstructured continua of H$_2$O result in much smaller delays at the same photon energies. Our experimental and theoretical methods make the study of molecular attosecond photoionization dynamics accessible.

abstract: We investigate the measurement-only topological quantum computation (MOTQC) approach proposed by Bonderson et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 010501 (2008)] where the braiding operation is shown to be equivalent to a series of topological charge "forced measurements" of anyons. In a forced measurement, the charge measurement is forced to yield the desired outcome (e.g. charge 0) via repeatedly measuring charges in different bases. This is a probabilistical process with a certain success probability for each trial. In practice, the number of measurements needed will vary from run to run. We show that such an uncertainty associated with forced measurements can be removed by simulating the braiding operation using a fixed number of three measurements supplemented by a correction operator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in practice we can avoid applying the correction operator in hardware by implementing it in software. Our findings greatly simplify the MOTQC proposal and only require the capability of performing charge measurements to implement topologically protected transformations generated by braiding exchanges without physically moving anyons.

abstract: We prove a lower bound on the information leakage of any classical protocol computing the equality function in the simultaneous message passing (SMP) model. Our bound is valid in the finite length regime and is strong enough to demonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of information leakage for practical quantum protocols. We prove our bound by obtaining an improved finite size version of the communication bound due to Babai and Kimmel, relating randomized communication to deterministic communication in the SMP model. We then relate information leakage to randomized communication through a series of reductions. We first provide alternative characterizations for information leakage, allowing us to link it to average length communication while allowing for shared randomness (pairwise, with the referee). A Markov inequality links this with bounded length communication, and a Newman type argument allows us to go from shared to private randomness. The only reduction in which we incur more than a logarithmic additive factor is in the Markov inequality; in particular, our compression method is essentially tight for the SMP model with average length communication.

abstract: According to the famous Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the universality of spontaneous defect generation in continuous phase transitions (CPTs) can be understood by the critical slowing down. In most CPTs of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the universality of spontaneous defect generations has been explained by the divergent relaxation time associated with the nontrivial gapless Bogoliubov excitations. However, for atomic BECs in synthetic gauge fields, their spontaneous superfluidity breakdown is resulted from the divergent correlation length associated with the zero Landau critical velocity. Here, by considering an atomic BEC ladder subjected to a synthetic magnetic field, we reveal that the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown obeys the KZM. The Kibble-Zurek scalings are derived from the Landau critical velocity which determines the correlation length. In further, the critical exponents are numerically extracted from the critical spatial-temporal dynamics of the bifurcation delay and the spontaneous vortex generation. Our study provides a general way to explore and understand the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown in CPTs from a single-well dispersion to a double-well one, such as, BECs in synthetic gauge fields, spin-orbit coupled BECs, and BECs in shaken optical lattices.

abstract: Emission of high-order harmonics from solids provides a new avenue in attosecond science. On one hand, it allows to investigate fundamental processes of the non-linear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a periodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward efficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave functions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A key feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of HHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron ionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other. Here, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave functions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction band. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual lattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of localization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate HHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and narrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for narrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to harmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to HHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to controlling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal, with hard to overestimate implications for the emerging area of atto-nanoscience.

We argue that our definitions resolve some of the shortcomings of existing definitions. We then give several feasibility results for our strong definitions. As a consequence, we obtain several interesting results, including: (1) the classical Carter-Wegman authentication scheme with 3-universal hashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with quantum side information; (2) quantum authentication where the entire key can be reused if verification is successful; (3) conceptually simple constructions of quantum authentication; and (4) a conceptually simple QKD protocol.

abstract: The process of topological phase transition in a chiral magnetic material from skyrmion lattice phase to helical phase has been investigated numerically and experimentally, yet the analytical expression of the evolution of skyrmion number and emergent magnetic monopole charge during the process is still waiting to be explored. In this letter, by utilizing the topological current theory, we show that the change of skyrmion number of a layer in the system is equal to the net monopole charges that flows through the layer. Based on this relation, with the help of statistical argument, we derive the analytical expressions of the skyrmion number and the monopole charge as functions of the external magnetic field. We find that the evolution of the skyrmion number is exactly the logistic growth function, and the evolution of the monopole charge is proportional to the derivative of the skyrmion number of the system. our analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations in \cite{2013SCIENCE}. The goodness of data fitting goes up to 99.94\%.

Finally, we advert to the information geometry theory by calculating the Fisher information metric for the considered system of coupled oscillators.

abstract: Alkaline-earth(-like) ultracold atoms, trapped in optical lattices and in the presence of an external gauge field, can stabilise Mott insulating phases characterised by density and magnetic order. We show that this property can be used to realise a topological fractional pump. Our analysis is based on a many-body adiabatic expansion and on time-dependent matrix-product-states numerical simulations. We characterise the pumping protocol by including both finite-size and non-adiabatic corrections. For a specific form of atom-atom interaction, we present an exactly-solvable model of a fractional pump. Finally, the numerical simulations allow us to thoroughly study a realistic setup amenable of an experimental realisation.
