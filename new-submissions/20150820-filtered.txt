abstract: The possibility to induce predetermined coherent quantum dynamics by controlling only the dissipative environmental parameters (such as temperature and pressure) is studied using the combined optimal control and environment engineering frameworks. As an example, we consider the problem of transforming an optically excited donor state into free charge carriers via intermediate higher-lying bridge state(s), with a view to solar energy conversion. In this context, vibrational bath engineering allows to promote fast, directional charge transfer and to suppress recombinative losses.
