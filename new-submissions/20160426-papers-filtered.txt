abstract: We investigate the ground state behavior of the Dicke-Hubbard model including counter-rotating-terms. By developing an extended coherent state approach within mean-field theory, we self-consistently obtain the ground state energy and delocalized order parameter. Particularly, localization-delocalization quantum phase transition of photons is clearly observed by breaking the parity symmetry, which is in sharp contrast to the Dicke-Hubbard model under rotating-wave approximation. The corresponding phase boundaries are stabilized in the weak inter-site photon hopping limit, which makes it easier to detect the critical behaviors, compared to the Rabi-Hubbard model. Moreover, we find that concurrence is greatly enhanced as the order parameter emerges, which implies a promising way to detect the criticality by utilizing quantum entanglement.
