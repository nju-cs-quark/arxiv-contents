abstract: We present a method to show that the ground states of some quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians in one spatial dimension are nonlocal. We assign a Bell inequality to the given Hamiltonian in a natural way and we find its classical bound using dynamic programming. The Bell inequality is such that its quantum value corresponds to the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian, which we find it exactly by mapping the spin system to a quadratic system of fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The method can also be used from the opposite point of view; namely, as a new method to optimize certain Bell inequalities. In the translationally invariant (TI) case, we provide an exponentially faster solution of the classical bound and analytically closed expressions of the quantum value. We apply our method to three examples: a tight TI inequality for $8$ parties, a quasi TI uniparametric inequality for any even number of parties, and we show that the ground state of a spin glass is nonlocal in some parameter region. This opens the possibility for the use of ground states of commonly studied Hamiltonians as multipartite resources for quantum information protocols that require nonlocality.

abstract: We address the characterization of qubit chains and assess the performances of local measurements compared to those provided by Feynman probes, i.e. nonlocal measurements realized by coupling a single qubit register to the chain. We show that local measurements are suitable to estimate small values of the coupling and that a Bayesian strategy may be successfully exploited to achieve optimal precision. For larger values of the coupling Bayesian local strategies do not lead to a consistent estimate. In this regime, Feynman probes may be exploited to build a consistent Bayesian estimator that saturates the Cramer-Rao bound, thus providing an effective characterization of the chain. Finally, we show that ultimate bounds to precision, i.e. saturation of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, may be achieved by a two-step scheme employing Feynman probes followed by local measurements.

abstract: We propose an efficient light-matter interface at optical frequencies between a superconducting qubit and a single photon. The desired interface is based on a hybrid architecture composed of an organic molecule embedded inside an optical waveguide and electrically coupled to a superconducting qubit far from the optical axis. We show that high fidelity, photon-mediated, entanglement between distant superconducting qubits can be achieved with incident pulses at the single photon level. Such low light level is highly sought for to overcome the decoherence of the superconducting qubit caused by absorption of optical photons.

abstract: We investigate, in the context of a real massless scalar field in $1+1$ dimensions, models of partially reflecting mirrors simulated by Dirac $\delta-\delta^{\prime}$ point interactions. In the literature, these models do not exhibit full transparency at high frequencies. In order to provide a more realistic feature for these models, we propose a modified $\delta-\delta^{\prime}$ point interaction that enables to achieve full transparency in the limit of high frequencies. Taking this modified $\delta-\delta^{\prime}$ model into account, we investigate the Casimir force, comparing our results with those found in the literature.

title: Quasi-probabilities in Conditioned Quantum Measurement and a Geometric/Statistical Interpretation of Aharonov's Weak Value

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.06406
abstract: We show that the joint behaviour of an arbitrary pair of quantum observables can be described by quasi-probabilities, which are extensions of the standard probabilities used for describing the behaviour of a single observable. The physical situations that require these quasi-probabilities arise when one considers quantum measurement of an observable conditioned by some other variable, with the notable example being the weak measurement employed to obtain Aharonov's weak value. Specifically, we present a general prescription for the construction of quasi-joint-probability (QJP) distributions associated with a given pair of observables. These QJP distributions are introduced in two complementary approaches: one from a bottom-up, strictly operational construction realised by examining the mathematical framework of the conditioned measurement scheme, and the other from a top-down viewpoint realised by applying the results of spectral theorem for normal operators and its Fourier transforms. It is then revealed that, for a pair of simultaneously measurable observables, the QJP distribution reduces to their unique standard joint-probability distribution, whereas for a non-commuting pair there exists an inherent indefiniteness in the choice, admitting a multitude of candidates that may equally be used for describing their joint behaviour. In the course of our argument, we find that the QJP distributions furnish the space of operators with their characteristic geometric structures such that the orthogonal projections and inner products of observables can, respectively, be given statistical interpretations as `conditionings' and `correlations'. The weak value $A_{w}$ for an observable $A$ is then given a geometric/statistical interpretation as either the orthogonal projection of $A$ onto the subspace generated by another observable $B$, or equivalently, as the conditioning of $A$ given $B$.

abstract: This paper undertakes a critical reexamination of the electrostatic version of the Aharonov-Bohm ("AB") effect. The conclusions are as follows: 1. Aharonov and Bohm's 1959 exposition is invalid because it does not consider the wavefunction of the entire system, including the source of electrostatic potential. 2. As originally proposed, the electrostatic AB effect does not exist. Perhaps surprisingly, this conclusion holds despite the relativistic covariance of the electromagnetic four-potential combined with the well-established magnetic AB effect. 3. Although the authors attempted, in a 1961 paper, to demonstrate that consideration of the entire system would not change their result, they inadvertently assumed the desired outcome in their analysis. 4. Claimed observations of the electrostatic AB effect or an analogue thereof are shown to be mistaken.

title: Further Considerations Regarding the Aharonov-Bohm Effect and the Wavefunction of the Entire System

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: In an earlier paper it was demonstrated that the hypothesized electrostatic version of the Aharonov-Bohm ("AB") effect does not exist. The conclusion follows straightforwardly once one recognizes that interference takes place in the configuration space of the entire system, including the experimental apparatus, and the wavefunction of the apparatus cannot be ignored. Two additional results are presented here. 1. Observations of interference that had been attributed to an analogue of the electrostatic AB effect (or "scalar effect") are actually due to a magnetic AB effect. 2. In the original magnetic AB effect itself, there is no phase shift if it is possible effectively to shield the solenoid from the influence of the passing electron. This result is not in conflict with the landmark experiments of Tonomura and colleagues if Wang's recent claim is correct, that superconductive shielding could not have isolated the toroidal magnet from the magnetic pulse of the passing electron.

abstract: We address the possibility of using even/odd states of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons for the quantum information tasks. Single photon qubit states and two photon entangled states in even/odd basis of OAM are considered. We present a method for the tomography and general projective measurement in even/odd basis. With the general projective measurement, we show the Bell violation and quantum cryptography with Bell's inequality. We also describe hyper and hybrid entanglement of even/odd OAM states along with polarization, which can be applied in the implementation of quantum protocols like super dense coding.

abstract: During measurements, appreciable amplification (enhancement) of microscopic effects occur to make them tangible to a macroscopic observer. Such amplification may be caused by instabilities involved in a measurement process. It is demonstrated that these instabilities may result in random branching of deterministic dynamics which may lead to random wave function collapse. In the case of two level systems, the Born probability rule emerges as the simplest linear solution to the equation for measurement probabilities.

abstract: This paper presents an epistemological perspective on quantum communication between parties that highlights the choices that must be made in order to send and obtain information. The notion of information obtained in such a communication is a property associated with the observers and while dependent on the nature of the physical system its fundamental basis is epistemic. We argue that the observation process is in accord with the principle of psychophysical parallelism that was used by Bohr, von Neumann, Schrodinger and others to establish the philosophical basis of complementarity but has since fallen out of fashion. This principle gave coherence to the original Copenhagen Interpretation without which the latter has come to have some sort of an ad hoc character.

abstract: The boundary of a 2D topological superconductor can be modeled by a conformal field theory. Here we demonstrate the behaviors of this high level description emerging from a microscopic model at finite temperatures. To achieve that, we analyze the low energy sector of Kitaev's honeycomb lattice model and probe its energy current. We observe that the scaling of the energy current with temperature reveals the central charge of the conformal field theory, which is in agreement with the Chern number of the bulk. Importantly, these currents can discriminate between distinct topological phases at finite temperatures. We assess the resilience of this measurement of the central charge under coupling disorder, bulk dimerisation and defects at the boundary, thus establishing it as a favorable means of experimentally probing topological superconductors.

We show the independence of the result with respect to regulating function.

More precisely we establish a link between entanglement of states generated by the algorithm and auxiliary algebraic varieties built from the set of separable states. This new perspective enables us to propose qualitative interpretations of earlier numerical results obtained by M. Rossi et al. We also illustrate our purpose with a couple of examples investigated in details.

We apply the Schr\"odinger factorization to the radial Hamiltonian of the Dunkl oscillator to find the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators. The energy spectrum is found by using the theory of unitary irreducible representations. By solving analytically the Schr\"odinger equation, we construct the Sturmian basis for the unitary irreducible representations of the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We construct the $SU(1,1)$ Perelomov radial coherent states for this problem and compute their time evolution.

In a second step the time Schr\"odinger equation has been derived. Analytical proofs and computer simulations show the correctness and applicability of the derived Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: Disordered systems provide paradigmatic instances of ergodicity breaking and localization phenomena. Here we explore the dynamics of excitations in a system of Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers. The finite temperature produces an intrinsic uncertainty in the atomic positions, which translates into quenched correlated disorder in the interatomic interaction strengths. In a simple approach, the dynamics in the many-body Hilbert space can be understood in terms of a one-dimensional Anderson-like model with disorder on every other site, featuring both localized and delocalized states. We conduct an experiment on an eight-atom chain and observe a clear suppression of excitation transfer. Our experiment accesses a regime which is described by a two-dimensional Anderson model on a "trimmed" square lattice. Our results thus provide a concrete example in which the absence of excitation propagation in a many-body system is directly related to Anderson-like localization in the Hilbert space, which is believed to be the mechanism underlying many-body localization.

abstract: We introduce a hybrid method for dielectric-metal composites that describes the dynamics of the metallic system classically whilst retaining a quantum description of the dielectric. The time-dependent dipole moment of the classical system is mimicked by the introduction of projected equations of motion (PEOM) and the coupling between the two systems is achieved through an effective dipole-dipole interaction. To benchmark this method, we model a test system (semiconducting quantum dot-metal nanoparticle hybrid). We begin by examining the energy absorption rate, showing agreement between the PEOM method and the analytical rotating wave approximation (RWA) solution. We then investigate population inversion and show that the PEOM method provides an accurate model for the interaction under ultrashort pulse excitation where the traditional RWA breaks down.

abstract: Fractional occupation numbers can produce open-shell degeneracy in density functional theory. We develop the corresponding perturbation theory by requiring that a differentiable map connects the initial and perturbed states. The degenerate state connects to a single perturbed state which extremizes, but does not necessarily minimize or maximize, the energy with respect to occupation numbers. Using a system of three electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential, we relate the counterintuitive sign of first-order occupation numbers to eigenvalues of the electron-electron interaction Hessian.
