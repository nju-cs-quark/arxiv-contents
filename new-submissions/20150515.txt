abstract: The role of noise in the transport properties of quantum excitations is a topic of great importance in many fields, from organic semiconductors for technological applications to light-harvesting complexes in photosynthesis. In this paper we study a semi-classical model where a tight-binding Hamiltonian is fully coupled to an underlying spatially extended nonlinear chain of atoms. We show that the transport properties of a quantum excitation are subtly modulated by (i) the specific type (local vs non-local) of exciton-phonon coupling and by (ii) nonlinear effects of the underlying lattice. We report a non-monotonic dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient on temperature, in agreement with earlier predictions, as a direct consequence of the lattice-induced fluctuations in the hopping rates due to long-wavelength vibrational modes. A standard measure of transport efficiency confirms that both nonlinearity in the underlying lattice and off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling promote transport efficiency at high temperatures, preventing the Zeno-like quench observed in other models lacking an explicit noise-providing dynamical system.

abstract: Time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEGF) are shown to provide a flexible, effective tool for the description of quantum mechanical single particle scattering on a spatially localized, time-dependent potential. Focusing on numerical methods, arbitrary space and time dependence of the potential can be treated, provided it is zero before an initial time instant. In this case, appropriate version of the Dyson and Keldysh equations lead to a transparent description with clear physical interpretation. The interaction of a short laser pulse and an electron propagating initially in free space is discussed as an example.

abstract: We discuss the entropic criterion for separability of compound quantum systems for general non-additive entropic forms based on arbitrary concave functions $f$. For any separable state, the generalized entropy of the whole system is shown to be not smaller than that of the subsystems, for any choice of $f$, providing thus a necessary criterion for separability. Nevertheless, the criterion is not sufficient and examples of entangled states with the same property are provided. This entails, in particular, that the conjecture about the positivity of the conditional Tsallis entropy for all $q$, a more stringent requirement than the positivity of the conditional von Neumann entropy, is actually a necessary but not sufficient condition for separability in general. The direct relation between the entropic criterion and the largest eigenvalues of the full and reduced density operators of the system is also discussed.

abstract: We examine the violation of the majorization relations between the eigenvalues of the full and reduced density operators of entangled states of composite systems and its detection using generalized entropic forms based on arbitrary concave functions. It is shown that the violation of these relations may not always be detected by the conditional von Neumann and Tsallis entropies (for any $q>0$). Families of smooth entropic forms which are always able to detect such violations are, however, provided. These features are then examined for particular sets of mixed states in a two-qudit system, which for $d\geq 3$ may exhibit different types of violation of the majorization relations. Comparison with the Peres criterion for separability is also shown.

Extended thermodynamic relations are given. When applied to a bipartite spin 1/2 system, the formalism allows to avoid fake entanglement for data based on the Bell-CHSH observable, and, in general, on any set of Bell constraints. Particular results obtained with the Tsallis entropy and with an introduced exponential entropic form are also discussed.

abstract: The steering property known for two qubit-state in terms of specific inequalities for correlation function is translated for the state of qudit with the spin $j=3/2$. Since most steering detection inequalities are based on the correlation functions we introduce analogs of such functions for the single qudit systems. The tomographic probability representation for the qudit states is applied. The connection between the correlation function in two qubit system and the single qudit is presented in an integral form with a intertwining kernel calculated explicitly in tomographic probability terms.

abstract: We propose a quantum repeater for continuous variable (CV) quantum optical states. Our repeater relies on an error correction protocol for loss on CV states based on CV teleportation and entanglement distillation via noiseless linear amplification. The error correction protocol is concatenated to preserve the same effective transmission coefficient for the quantum channel over increasing distance. The probability of successful operation of the repeater scales polynomially with distance. However, the protocol is limited by a trade-off between fidelity and probability of success.

abstract: It was repeatedly underlined in literature that quantum mechanics cannot be considered a closed theory if the Born rule is postulated rather than derived from the first principles. In this paper the Born postulate is derived from time-reversibility of solutions of quantum equations of motion. The Born postulate is obtained as a solution of simple functional equation that takes into account the properties of probability and time-reversibility of the equation of motion. The form of the equation of motion is not specified, therefore, the result obtained is applicable to any type of reversible quantum equation of motion. In the second part of this article it is emphasized that, due to topological limitations, time-reversibility of quantum equations does not automatically result in reversibility of real physical processes even when a single particle is involved.

abstract: Quantum measurement is a physical process. A system and an apparatus interact for a certain time period (measurement time). During this interaction, information of an observable is transferred from the system to the apparatus. In this study, we study the amount of energy fluctuation of the apparatus that is required for this physical process to occur. To do so, the interface between the quantum and classical worlds ("Heisenberg cut") must be carefully chosen so that the quantum side is large enough to autonomously switch on the interaction. At this setting we prove that a trade-off relation (energy-time uncertainty relation) holds between the energy fluctuation of the apparatus and the measurement time. We use this trade-off relation to discuss the spacetime uncertainty relation questioning the operational meaning of the microscopic structure of spacetime. In addition, we derive another trade-off inequality between the measurement time and the strength of interaction between the system and the apparatus. The larger the information carried by an observable to be measured, the stronger restriction the trade-off relations give.

abstract: Boson Sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialised quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, Scattershot Boson Sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric downconversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. Here we report the first Scattershot Boson Sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.

abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is widely regarded as the quintessential quantum interference phenomenon in optics. In this work we examine how nonlinearity can smear statistical photon bunching in the HOM interferometer. We model both the nonlinearity and a balanced beam splitter with a single two-level system and calculate a finite probability of anti-bunching arising in this geometry. We thus argue that the presence of such nonlinearity would reduce the visibility in the standard HOM setup, offering some explanation for the diminution of the HOM visibility observed in many experiments. We use the same model to show that the nonlinearity affects a resonant two-photon propagation through a two-level impurity in a waveguide due to a "weak photon blockade" caused by the impossibility of double-occupancy and argue that this effect might be stronger for multi-photon propagation.

In addition to the few-photon nonlinearity known from similar experiments with Rydberg $S$-states, we observe the interaction-induced dephasing of Rydberg polaritons at very low photon input rates into the medium. We develop a model combining the propagation of the two-photon wavefunction through our system with nonperturbative calculations of the anisotropic Rydberg-interaction to show that the observed effect can be attributed to pairwise interaction of individual Rydberg polaritons.

abstract: Although the theoretical treatment to describe the light field in Quantum Optics was generic, during large time it was predominantly related to optical modes trapped inside cavities. Important results were then obtained in this scenario. However, in view of the practical difficulties due to the deleterious effects of decoherence upon states of trapped fields, many physicists in this area began to focus more emphasis in the treatment using traveling fields. This brief report concerns with engineering non-classical states of light field to show some details and applications in the later scenario. Here the interaction "atom-trapped field", is translated to the interaction "beam splitter-traveling field".

abstract: The recently developed formalism of Markovian Master Equations for quantum open systems with external periodic driving is applied to the theory of dynamical decoupling by periodic control. This new approach provides a more detailed quantitative picture of this phenomena applicable to traditional NMR spectroscopy and more recent attempts to reduce decoherence in quantum devices based on two-level systems. For the popular choices of bath spectral densities exact formulas for the parameters in the corresponding Bloch equations are available. In the context of NMR imaging a new parameter describing bath relaxation time can be extracted by comparing the exact solutions with experimental data.

abstract: A long-lived qubit is usually well-isolated from all other systems and the environments, and so is not easy to couple with measurement apparatus. It is sometimes difficult to implement reliable projective measurements on such a qubit. One potential solution is spin amplification with many ancillary qubits. Here, we propose a spin amplification technique, where the ancillary qubits state change depending on the state of the target qubit. The technique works even in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening. We show that fast and accurate amplification is possible even if the coupling and frequency of the ancillary qubits is inhomogeneous. Since our scheme is robust against realistic imperfections, this could provide a new mechanism for reading out a single spin that could not have been measured using the previous approaches.

abstract: Random number plays a key role in information science, especially in cryptography. Based on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, quantum random number generators can produce genuine randomness. In particular, random numbers can be produced from laser phase fluctuations with a very high speed, typically in the Gbps regime. In this work, by developing a physical model, we investigate the origin of the randomness in quantum random number generators based on laser phase fluctuations. We show how the randomness essentially stems from spontaneous emissions. The laser phase fluctuation can be quantitatively evaluated from basic principles and also qualitatively explained by the Brownian motion model. After taking account of practical device precision, we show that the randomness generation speed is limited by the finite resolution of detection devices. Our result also provides the optimal experiment design in order to achieve the maximum generation speed.

abstract: We study the effects of Lorentz transformations on the three-particle non-local systems with three spin$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, which either include the GHZ state or the W state. We used the Pauli spin operator and a three-particle generalization of the Bell's inequality, introduced by Svetlichny's, in order to study the entanglement of the systems. In our setup, the moving and lab frames used the same set of measurement directions which violate the Svetlichny's inequality to its maximum possible value in the lab frame. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the Mermin's and Collins' inequalities. Our analysis show that, regardless of the type of entanglement of the entangled particles, the value of the Svetlichny's inequality in the moving frame is decreased by increasing the boost velocity and the energy of particles in the lab frame. We found that, in the relativistic regime, the Svetlichny's inequality is a good criterion to investigate the non-locality of the GHZ state. We have also shown that the Mermin's and Collins' inequalities lead to reasonable predictions, in agreement with the behavior of the spin state, about the non-locality and specially the W state in the relativistic regime. Thereinafter, we compare our results with those in which the Czachor's relativistic spin is used instead of the Pauli operator. We found that the results obtained by considering the Pauli spin operator are in more agreement with the behavior of spin state of the system in the relativistic information theory.

abstract: In this paper we apply the time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method to explore single- and double-slit diffraction of matter waves. By using a simplified model of two electrons prepared in the ground state of an atom (molecule) and then suddenly released we are able to calculate the diffraction patterns in one spatial dimension in close correspondence with the numerically exact results. Through the Coulomb repulsion the one electron serves as an environment for the other thus introducing decoherence in the quantum state which is easily quantified. It is demonstrated that the set of single particle wave functions yield by TDQMC can be used to directly construct density matrix for that particle without tracing out the other particles from the density matrix of the whole system. In this way it is possible to build explicitly time-dependent density matrices for different components of a complex quantum system straight within the TDQMC algorithm which may widen our understanding of quantum dynamics in many-body systems.

abstract: We study quantum correlations in a bipartite heteronuclear $(N-1)\times1$ system in an external magnetic field. The system consists of a spin ring with an arbitrary number $N-1$ of spins on the ring and one spin in its center. The spins on the ring are connected by secular dipole-dipole interactions and interact with the central spin through the Heisenberg $zz$-interaction. We show that the quantum discord, describing quantum correlations between the ring and the central spin, can be obtained analytically for this model in the high temperature approximation. The model allows us to find contributions of different parts of the spin-spin interactions to quantum correlations. We also investigate the evolution of quantum and classical correlations at different numbers of spins.

abstract: We consider discrete and integer-valued cellular automata (CA). A particular class of which comprises "Hamiltonian CA" with equations of motion that bear similarities to Hamilton's equations, while they present discrete updating rules. The dynamics is linear, quite similar to unitary evolution described by the Schroedinger equation. This has been essential in our construction of an invertible map between such CA and continuous quantum mechanical models, which incorporate a fundamental discreteness scale. Based on Shannon's sampling theory, it leads, for example, to a one-to-one relation between quantum mechanical and CA conservation laws. The important issue of linearity of the theory is examined here by incorporating higher-order nonlinearities into the underlying action. These produce inconsistent nonlocal (in time) effects when trying to describe continuously such nonlinear CA. Therefore, in the present framework, only linear CA and local quantum mechanical dynamics are compatible.

abstract: We examine the behavior of quantum correlations of spin pairs in a finite anisotropic $XY$ spin chain immersed in a transverse magnetic field, through the analysis of the quantum discord and the conventional and quadratic one way-information deficits. We first provide a brief review of these measures, showing that the last ones can be obtained as particular cases of a generalized information deficit based on general entropic forms. All these measures coincide with an entanglement entropy in the case of pure states, but can be non-zero in separable mixed states, vanishing just for classically correlated states. It is then shown that their behavior in the exact ground state of the chain exhibits similar features, deviating significantly from that of the pair entanglement below the critical field. In contrast with entanglement, they reach full range in this region, becoming independent of the pair separation and coupling range in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field. It is also shown, however, that significant differences between the quantum discord and the information deficits arise in the local minimizing measurement that defines them. Both analytical and numerical results are provided.

We show here that general measurements, defined by positive-operator-valued measures, can certify up to two bits of randomness, which is the optimal amount of randomness that can be certified from an entangled bit. General measurements thus provide an advantage over projective ones for device-independent randomness certification.

abstract: We investigate the exact dynamics of a system of two independent harmonic oscillators coupled through their angular momentum. The exact analytic solution of the equations of motion for the field operators is derived, and the conditions for dynamical stability are obtained. As application, we examine the emergence of squeezing and mode entanglement for an arbitrary separable coherent initial state. It is shown that close to instability, the system develops considerable entanglement, which is accompanied with simultaneous squeezing in the coordinate of one oscillator and the momentum of the other oscillator. In contrast, for weak coupling away from instability, the generated entanglement is small, with weak alternating squeezing in the coordinate and momentum of each oscillator. Approximate expressions describing these regimes are also provided.

abstract: A possible solution of the well known paradox of chiral molecules is based on the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking. At low pressure the molecules are delocalized between the two minima of a given molecular potential while at higher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a phase transition is provided by measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at different pressures. In particular, at pressure greater than a critical value no inversion line is observed. These data are well accounted for by a model previously developed and recently extended to mixtures. In the present paper, we discuss the variation of the critical pressure in binary mixtures as a function of the fractions of the constituents.

abstract: We consider interacting one-dimensional, spinless Fermi gases, whose low-energy properties are described by Luttinger liquid theory. We perform a systematic, in-depth analysis of the relation between the macroscopic, phenomenological parameters of Luttinger liquid effective field theory, and the microscopic interactions of the Fermi gas. In particular, we begin by explaining how to model effective interactions in one dimension, which we then apply to the main forward scattering channel -- the interbranch collisions -- common to these systems. We renormalise the corresponding interbranch phenomenological constants in favour of scattering phase shifts. Interestingly, our renormalisation procedure shows (i) how Luttinger's model arises in a completely natural way -- and not as a convenient approximation -- from Tomonaga's model, and (ii) the reasons behind the interbranch coupling constant remaining unrenormalised in Luttinger's model. We then consider the so-called intrabranch processes, whose phenomenological coupling constant is known to be fixed by charge conservation, but whose microscopic origin is not well understood. We show that, contrary to general belief and common sense, the intrabranch interactions appearing in Luttinger liquid theory do not correspond to an intrabranch scattering channel, nor an energy shift due to intrabranch interactions, in the microscopic theory. Instead, they are due to interbranch processes. We finally apply our results to a particular example of an exactly solvable model, namely the fermionic dual to the Lieb-Liniger model in the Tonks-Girardeau and super-Tonks-Girardeau regimes.

abstract: The quantum ratchet current is studied in the parameter space of the dissipative kicked rotor model coupled to a zero temperature quantum environment. We show that vacuum fluctuations blur the generic isoperiodic stable structures found in the classical case. Such structures tend to survive when a measure of statistical dependence between the quantum and classical currents are displayed in the parameter space. In addition, we show that quantum fluctuations can be used to overcome transport barriers in the phase space. Related quantum ratchet current activation regions are spotted in the parameter space. Results are discussed {based on quantum, semiclassical and classical calculations. While the semiclassical dynamics involves vacuum fluctuations, the classical map is driven by thermal noise.

abstract: It is common knowledge that the microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles are equivalent in thermodynamically large systems. Here, we study finite-size effects in the latter two ensembles. We show that contrary to naive expectations, finite-size errors are exponentially small in grand canonical ensemble calculations for translationally invariant systems in phases without long range order at finite temperature. Open boundary conditions and canonical ensemble calculations suffer from finite-size errors that scale as the inverse length scale of the system. We further show that finite-size effects are generally smallest in numerical linked cluster expansions. Our conclusions are supported by analytical and numerical analyses of classical and quantum systems.

abstract: We performed quantum manipulations of the multi-level spin system S=5/2 of a Mn$^{2+}$ ion, by means of a two-tone pulse drive. The detuning between the excitation and readout radio frequency pulses allows one to select the number of photons involved in a Rabi oscillation as well as increase the frequency of this nutation. Thus detuning can lead to a resonant multi-photon process. Our analytical model for a two-photon process as well as a numerical generalization fit well the experimental findings, with implications in the use of multi-level spin systems as tunable solid state qubits.

abstract: Using measures of entanglement such as negativity and tangles we provide a detailed analysis of entanglement structures in pure states of non-interacting qubits. The motivation for this exercise primarily comes from holographic considerations, where entanglement is inextricably linked with the emergence of geometry. We use the qubit systems as toy models to probe the internal structure, and introduce some useful measures involving entanglement negativity to quantify general features of entanglement. In particular, our analysis focuses on various constraints on the pattern of entanglement which are known to be satisfied by holographic sates, such as the saturation of Araki-Lieb inequality (in certain circumstances), and the monogamy of mutual information. We argue that even systems as simple as few non-interacting qubits can be useful laboratories to explore how the emergence of the bulk geometry may be related to quantum information principles.

abstract: We investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the transmission of light through a thermal vapour of three-level ladder-type atoms, in the presence of 2 counter-propagating control fields. A simple theoretical model predicts the presence of electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) in this pure three-level system when the control field is resonant. Experimentally, we use $^{87}$Rb in a large magnetic field of 0.62~T to reach the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime and realise a non-degenerate three-level system. Experimental observations verify the predictions over a wide range of detunings.

abstract: We investigate the self-correcting properties of a network of Majorana wires, in the form of a trijunction, in contact with a parity-preserving thermal environment. As opposed to the case where Majoranas are immobile, braiding Majoranas within a trijunction introduces dangerous error processes that we identify. Such errors prevent the lifetime of the memory from increasing with the size of the system. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings put a fundamental restriction on the feasibility of this specific quantum computing architecture.

abstract: Three of the big puzzles of theoretical physics are the following: (i) There is apparently no time evolution in the dynamics of quantum general relativity, because the allowed quantum states must obey the Hamiltonian constraint. (ii) During a quantum measurement, the state of the quantum system randomly collapses from being in a linear superposition of the eigenstates of the measured observable, to just one of the eigenstates, in apparent violation of the predictions of the deterministic, linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. (iii) The observed value of the cosmological constant is exceedingly small, compared to its natural value, creating a serious fine-tuning problem. In this essay we propose a novel idea to show how the three problems help solve each other.

abstract: We propose a model for addressing the superfluidity of two different Fermi species confined in a bilayer geometry of square optical lattices. The fermions are assumed to be molecules with interlayer s-wave interactions, whose dipole moments are oriented perpendicularly to the layers. Using functional integral techniques we investigate the BCS-like state induced in the bilayer at finite temperatures. In particular, we determine the critical temperature as a function of the coupling strength between molecules in different layers and of the interlayer spacing. By means of Ginzburg-Landau theory we calculate the superfluid density. We also study the dimerized BEC phase through the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where the effective mass leads to identify the crossover from BCS to BEC regimes. The possibility of tuning the effective mass as a direct consequence of the lattice confinement, allows us to suggest a range of values of the interlayer spacing, which would enable observing this superfluidity within current experimental conditions.

abstract: We propose a scheme which can realize an extended two-component Bose-Hubbard model using polaritons confined in an array of optical cavities. In addition to the density-dependent interactions, this model also contains nonlinear coupling terms between the two components of the polariton. Using a mean-field calculation, we obtain the phase diagram which shows how these terms affect the transition between the Mott insulator and the superfluid phase. In addition, we employ both a perturbation approach and an exact diagonalization method to gain more insights into the phase diagram.
