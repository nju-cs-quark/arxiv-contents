<p>
We report measurements of Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation of coherent light transmitted through disordered one-dimensional photonic lattices. Although such a lattice exhibits transverse Anderson localization when a single input site is excited, uniform excitation precludes its observation. By examining the Hanbury Brown--Twiss correlation for a uniformly excited disordered lattice, we observe intensity anticorrelations associated with photon antibunching--a signature of non-Gaussian statistics. Although the measured average intensity distribution is uniform, transverse Anderson localization nevertheless underlies the observed anticorrelation.

**2.    Discrete Anderson Speckle**

<blockquote>
<p>
When a disordered array of coupled waveguides is illuminated with an extended coherent optical field, discrete speckle develops: partially coherent light with a granular intensity distribution on the lattice sites. The same paradigm applies to a variety of other settings in photonics, such as imperfectly coupled resonators or fibers with randomly coupled cores. Through numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we uncover a set of surprising features that characterize discrete speckle in one- and two-dimensional lattices known to exhibit transverse Anderson localization. Firstly, the fingerprint of localization is embedded in the fluctuations of the discrete speckle and is revealed in the narrowing of the spatial coherence function. Secondly, the transverse coherence length (or speckle grain size) is frozen during propagation. Thirdly, the axial coherence depth is independent of the axial position, thereby resulting in a coherence voxel of fixed volume independently of position. We take these unique features collectively to define a distinct regime that we call discrete Anderson speckle.

**3.    Sub-thermal to super-thermal light statistics from a disordered lattice via deterministic control of excitation symmetry**

<p>
Monochromatic coherent light traversing a disordered photonic medium evolves into a random field whose statistics are dictated by the disorder level. Here we demonstrate experimentally that light statistics can be deterministically tuned in certain disordered lattices, even when the disorder level is held fixed, by controllably breaking the excitation symmetry of the lattice modes. We exploit a lattice endowed with disorder-immune chiral symmetry in which the eigenmodes come in skew-symmetric pairs. If a single lattice site is excited, a "photonic thermalization gap" emerges: the realm of sub-thermal light statistics is inaccessible regardless of the disorder level. However, by exciting two sites with a variable relative phase, as in a traditional two-path interferometer, the chiral symmetry is judiciously broken and interferometric control over the light statistics is exercised, spanning sub-thermal and super-thermal regimes. These results may help develop novel incoherent lighting sources from coherent lasers.

**4.    A photonic thermalization gap in disordered lattices**  
H. E. Kondakci, A. F. Abouraddy, B. E. A. Saleh  
Nature Phys. 11, 930 (2015)

<blockquote>
<p>
The formation of gaps -- forbidden ranges in the values of a physical parameter -- is a ubiquitous feature of a variety of physical systems: from energy bandgaps of electrons in periodic lattices and their analogs in photonic, phononic, and plasmonic systems to pseudo energy gaps in aperiodic quasicrystals. Here, we report on a `thermalization' gap for light propagating in finite disordered structures characterized by disorder-immune chiral symmetry -- the appearance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in skew-symmetric pairs. In this class of systems, the span of sub- thermal photon statistics is inaccessible to input coherent light, which -- once the steady state is reached -- always emerges with super-thermal statistics no matter how small the disorder level. We formulate an independent constraint that must be satisfied by the input field for the chiral symmetry to be `activated' and the gap to be observed. This unique feature enables a new form of photon-statistics interferometry: the deterministic tuning of photon statistics -- from sub-thermal to super-thermal -- in a compact device, without changing the disorder level, via controlled excitation-symmetry-breaking realized by sculpting the amplitude or phase of the input coherent field.

**5.    Lattice topology dictates photon statistics**  
H. Esat Kondakci, Ayman F. Abouraddy, Bahaa E. A. Saleh

<blockquote>
<p>
Propagation of coherent light through a disordered network is accompanied by randomization and possible conversion into thermal light. Here, we show that network topology plays a decisive role in determining the statistics of the emerging field if the underlying lattice satisfies chiral symmetry. By examining one-dimensional arrays of randomly coupled waveguides arranged on linear and ring topologies, we are led to a remarkable prediction: the field circularity and the photon statistics in ring lattices are dictated by its parity -- whether the number of sites is even or odd, while the same quantities are insensitive to the parity of a linear lattice. Adding or subtracting a single lattice site can switch the photon statistics from super-thermal to sub-thermal, or vice versa. This behavior is understood by examining the real and imaginary fields on a chiral-symmetric lattice, which form two strands that interleave along the lattice sites. These strands can be fully braided around an even-sited ring lattice thereby producing super-thermal photon statistics, while an odd-sited lattice is incommensurate with such an arrangement and the statistics become sub-thermal. Such effects are suppressed in the limit of high lattice disorder, whereupon Anderson localization arrests the spread of light around the lattice and eliminates topology-dependent phenomena.
