abstract: We establish ultimate limits on how precise a parameter, e.g. frequency or the strength of a magnetic field, can be estimated with the aid of \emph{full and fast quantum control}. We consider uncorrelated noisy evolutions of N qubits and show that fast control allows to fully restore the Heisenberg scaling ($\sim\!1/N^2$) for all rank-one Pauli noise except dephasing. For all other types of noise the \emph{asymptotic} quantum enhancement is unavoidably limited to a constant-factor improvement over the standard quantum limit ($\sim\!1/N$) even when allowing for the full power of fast control. The latter holds both in the single-shot and infinitely-many repetitions scenarios. However, even in this case allowing for fast quantum control helps to increase the improvement factor. Furthermore, for frequency estimation with \emph{finite} resource we show how a parallel scheme utilizing any fixed number of entangled qubits but no fast quantum control can be outperformed by a simple, easily implementable, sequential scheme which only requires entanglement between one sensing and one auxiliary qubit.

abstract: For multilevel spin systems, the robustness of the quantum mechanical (QM) violation of macrorealism (MR) with respect to unsharp (coarse-grained) measurements is investigated using three different necessary conditions of MR, namely, the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), Wigner's form of the Leggett-Garg inequality (WLGI) and the condition of no signalling in time (NSIT). It is demonstrated that, contingent upon using a suitable measurement scheme, while for ideal sharp measurements, in the asymptotic limit of spin, the algebraic maxima of the QM violations of all these three necessary conditions of MR are attained, the QM violations of LGI, WLGI and NSIT persist in that limit even for \textit{arbitrary} unsharp measurements, i.e. for any non zero value of the sharpness parameter characterizing the degree of coarse-graining of the relevant measurements.

abstract: Remote state preparation (RSP) provides an indirect way of manipulating quantum information based on the nonlocal effect of quantum measurement. Although RSP has been demonstrated in recent years to remotely prepare multi-photon states, quantum measurement on the same number of photons was required, i.e., to prepare N-photon states via RSP, quantum measurement on the other N-photons was required, hence significantly limiting practicality and applicability of RSP. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of remote preparation of three-photon entangled states by measuring only a single-photon entangled with the three photons. We further generalize our protocol to prepare multi-photon entangled states with arbitrary photon number and purity via single-photon measurement. As our RSP scheme relies on the nonlinearity induced by single-photon measurement, it enables quantum state engineering of multi-photon entangled states beyond the linear optical limit. Our results are expected to have significant impacts on quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the phase sensitivity with parity detection on an SU(1,1) interferometer with a coherent state combined with a squeezed vacuum state. This interferometer is formed with two parametric amplifiers for beam splitting and recombination instead of beam splitters. We show that the sensitivity of estimation phase approaches Heisenberg limit and give the corresponding optimal condition. Moreover, we derive the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound of the SU(1,1) interferometer.

abstract: In this paper we investigate the coherence properties of a quantum dot under two-photon resonant excitation in combination with an additional photo-neutralization laser. The photo-neutralization increases the efficiency of the excitation process and thus, the brightness of the source, by a factor of approximately 1.5 for biexciton-exciton pairs. This enhancement does not degrade the relevant coherences in the system; neither the single photon coherence time, nor the coherence of the excitation process.

abstract: We propose two setups for realizing a chiral quantum network, where two-level systems representing the nodes interact via directional emission into discrete waveguides, as introduced in Ref.~[T.\ Ramos \emph{et al.}, arXiv:1602.00926]. The first implementation realizes a spin waveguide via Rydberg states in a chain of atoms, whereas the second one realizes a phonon waveguide via the localized vibrations of a string of trapped ions. For both architectures, we show that strong chirality can be obtained by a proper design of synthetic gauge fields in the couplings from the nodes to the waveguide. In the Rydberg case, this is achieved via intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the dipole-dipole interactions, while for the trapped ions it is obtained by engineered sideband transitions. We take long-range couplings into account that appear naturally in these implementations, discuss useful experimental parameters, and analyze potential error sources. Finally, we describe effects that can be observed in these implementations within state-of-the-art technology, such as the driven-dissipative formation of entangled dimer states.

We demonstrate the existence of a class of states for which entanglement is forever frozen during the dynamics, even if the state of the system does evolve. At the same time non-local correlations, quantified by the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, either undergo sudden death or are trapped during the dynamics.

abstract: The notion of complementarity or mutually exclusiveness of physical processes has always been of keen interest to the physicists whether it came from the realms of quantum mechanical processes or it arose from the information processing tasks associated with quantum information theory. In this work we show that there exists a complementary relationship in terms of the genuine non-locality as a principle between a system and its subsystems. Our approach to this problem is a device independent approach which works irrespective of any theoretical setting. We consider Svetlichny games in a multiparty binary input and output scenario with a threshold value of the winning probability as a signature of genuine multiparty non locality. We analytically show that, in the Svetlichny games setup, there exists complementary relations between Svetlichny correlations of $n$ party and Svetlichny correlations of $k\leq n$ parties within the no-signaling framework. In other words, in general non local theories, the genuine multiparty non locality for multiparty systems comes at the price of upper bounding the genuine multiparty non locality of the reduced subsystem. In addition to Svetlichny games we consider many other non local games like Mermin games, Bancal \emph{et al's} IP, Guess Your Neighbors Input game and provide numerical findings ( in case of no-signaling and quantum correlations ) in support of our main result.

abstract: Using the coherent state functional integral formulation of the partition function, we show that the sine-Gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime arises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly imperfect Bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow, when these fluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle Hilbert space. We consider bipartitions of the single-particle Hilbert space relevant to experiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g., restriction to high or low energy sectors of the dynamics, and spatial bipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar Bose gases. By assuming full unitary quantum control in the low energy subspace of a trapped gas, we show that: 1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the lowest energy mode partially decouples the low and high energy sectors, allowing any low-energy single-particle wavefunction to define a background for sine-Gordon dynamics on curved spacetime, and 2) macroscopic occupation of a quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an analogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows, with respective weights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed quantum states.

abstract: In 1954, Dicke showed that a system of quantum emitters within a subwavelength volume produced a superradiant burst. For such a burst to occur, the emitters must be in the special Dicke state in which all emitters are excited and indistinguishable. We demonstrate that a superradiance burst may arise for non-Dicke initial states as well. The mechanisms of this superradiance phenomenon are discussed.

abstract: Levitated diamond nanocrystals with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in high vacuum have been proposed as a unique system for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, including the generation of large quantum superposition states and tests of quantum gravity. This system promises extreme isolation from its environment while providing quantum control and sensing through the NV centre spin. While optical trapping has been the most explored method of levitation, recent results indicate that excessive optical heating of the nanodiamonds under vacuum may make the method impractical with currently available materials. Here, we study an alternative magneto-gravitational trap for diamagnetic particles, such as diamond nanocrystals, with stable levitation from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum. Magnetic field gradients from permanent magnets confine the particle in two dimensions, while confinement in the third dimension is gravitational. We demonstrate that feedback cooling of the centre-of-mass motion of a trapped nanodiamond cluster results in cooling of one degree of freedom to less than 1 K.

abstract: We consider non-Hermitian dynamics of a quantum particle hopping on a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice made of $N$ sites with asymmetric hopping rates induced by a time-periodic oscillating imaginary gauge field. A deeply different behavior is found depending on the lattice topology. While in a linear chain (open boundary conditions) an oscillating field can lead to a complex quasi energy spectrum via a multiple parametric resonance, in a ring topology (Born-von Karman periodic boundary conditions) an entirely real quasi energy spectrum can be found and the dynamics is pseudo-Hermitian. In the large $N$ limit, parametric instability and pseudo-Hermitian dynamics in the two different lattice topologies are physically explained on the basis of a simple picture of wave packet propagation.

abstract: We define the statistical quadrature evolution (QE) method for multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CVs) for information transmission. The QE scheme utilizes the theory of mathematical statistics and statistical information processing. The QE model is based on the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) framework to provide a minimal error estimate of the CV state quadratures. The QE block evaluates a unique and stable estimation of the non-observable continuous input from the measurement results and through the statistical inference method yielded from the GQI framework. The QE method minimizes the overall expected error by an estimator function and provides a viable, easily implementable, and computationally efficient way to maximize the extractable information from the observed data. The QE framework can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol and measurement setting and is implementable by standard low-complexity functions, which is particularly convenient for experimental CVQKD.

abstract: The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attractive properties for a number of quantum technologies that rely on the spin angular momentum of the electron and the nuclei adjacent to the center. The nucleus with the strongest interaction is the $^{13}$C nuclear spin of the first shell. Using this degree of freedom effectively hinges on precise data on the hyperfine interaction between the electronic and the nuclear spin. Here, we present detailed experimental data on this interaction, together with an analysis that yields all parameters of the hyperfine tensor, as well as its orientation with respect to the atomic structure of the center.

abstract: Analog quantum simulators (AQS) will likely be the first nontrivial application of quantum technology for predictive simulation. However, there remain questions regarding the degree of confidence that can be placed in the results of AQS since they do not naturally incorporate error correction. Specifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model will produce predictions that agree with the ideal model in the presence of inevitable imperfections? At the same time there is a widely held expectation that certain quantum simulation questions will be robust to errors and perturbations in the underlying hardware. Resolving these two points of view is a critical step in making the most of this promising technology. In this work we formalize the notion of AQS reliability by determining sensitivity of AQS outputs to underlying parameters, and formulate conditions for robust simulation. Our approach naturally reveals the importance of model symmetries in dictating the robust properties of a quantum simulation. To demonstrate the approach, we present analytical and numerical results that characterize the robust features of several quantum many-body models, including the transverse field Ising model and the Fermi-Hubbard model.

abstract: While the concept of the block universe has a most respectable scientific provenance, many physicists nevertheless do not accept that future events are just as embedded in spacetime as are those of the present and the past. This paper proposes an experiment to demonstrate the block universe using interplanetary distances and high relative speeds such as those accessible through the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The proposed experiment hinges on signals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of some tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the past of the Orbiter. Since this experiment can be performed at any time, and since the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in proportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer can always be found for whom the past is in the future of another observer. The only explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all events in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded into spacetime.

abstract: The phenomenon of duality reflects a link between the behaviour of a system in different regimes. The goal of this work is to expose the classical origins of such links, and to demonstrate how they come to life in some quasi-exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics. By studying the global properties of the Riemannian surface of the classical momentum, we reveal that the abbreviated classical action possesses a symmetry which holds also at the quantum level and underlies the energy reflection symmetry of the quantum energy levels.

abstract: There are successful applications of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence to high energy and condensed matter physics. We apply the holographic approach to photosynthesis that is an important example of nontrivial quantum phenomena relevant for life which is being studied in the emerging field of quantum biology. Light harvesting complexes of photosynthetic organisms are many-body quantum systems, in which quantum coherence has recently been experimentally shown to survive for relatively long time scales even at the physiological temperature despite the decohering effects of their environments. We use the holographic approach to evaluate the time dependence of entanglement entropy and quantum mutual information in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein-pigment complex in green sulfur bacteria during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center. It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the mutual information simulating the Lindblad master equation in some cases can be obtained by means of a dual gravity describing black hole formation in the AdS-Vaidya spacetime. The wake up and scrambling times for various partitions of the FMO complex are discussed.

abstract: We calculate the quantum state of the plasmon field excited by an ensemble of molecular emitters, which are driven by exchange of electrons with metallic nano-particle electrodes. Assuming identical emitters that are coupled collectively to the plasmon mode but are otherwise subject to independent relaxation channels, we show that symmetry constraints on the total system density matrix imply a drastic reduction in the numerical complexity. For $N_{\text{m}}$ three-level molecules we may thus represent the density matrix by a number of terms scaling as $(N_{\rm m}+8)!/(8!N_{\rm m}!)$ instead of $9^{N_{\text{m}}}$, and this allows exact simulations of up to $N_{\text{m}}=10$ molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that many emitters compensate strong plasmon damping and lead to the population of high plasmon number states and a narrowed linewidth of the plasmon field. For large $N_{\text{m}}$, our exact results are reproduced by an approximate approach based on the plasmon reduced density matrix. With this approach, we have extended the simulations to more than $50$ molecules and shown that the plasmon number state population follows a Poisson-like distribution. An alternative approach based on nonlinear rate equations for the molecular state populations and the mean plasmon number also reproduce the main lasing characteristics of the system.

abstract: The influence of spacetime foam on a broad class of bosonic fields with arbitrary numbers of particles in the low energy regime is investigated. Based on recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitational systems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to their mean frequencies. For the long time propagation, the Markov approximation is employed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. In this case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from the noisy spacetime, we show that such phenomena turn out to be completely suppressed for scalar bosons, photons, and gravitons, which are coupled to gravity but otherwise free. The short time effects are then recovered through the transient non-Markovian evolution. Focusing on scalar bosons in initially incoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation depend strongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. We further identify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for a large number of particles. The surprising new effect tends to "bundle" identical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a width inversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations, or its square root due to the vacuum fluctuations of spacetime.

abstract: We consider the nonlinear scattering theory for three-terminal thermoelectric devices, used for power generation or refrigeration. Such a system is a quantum phase-coherent version of a thermocouple, and the theory applies to systems in which interactions can be treated at a mean-field level. We consider an arbitrary three-terminal system in any external magnetic field, including systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as chiral thermoelectrics, as well as systems in which the magnetic field plays no role. We show that the upper bound on efficiency at given power output is of quantum origin and is stricter than Carnot's bound. The bound is exactly the same as previously found for two-terminal devices, and can be achieved by three-terminal systems with or without broken time-reversal symmetry. Thus the bound appears to be universal for two-terminal and three-terminal (chiral and non-chiral) thermoelectrics.

abstract: As experiments are increasingly able to probe the quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom, it is interesting to probe fundamental bounds on the dynamics of quantum information. We elaborate on the relationship between one such bound---the Lieb-Robinson bound---and the butterfly effect in strongly-coupled quantum systems. The butterfly effect implies the ballistic growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the "butterfly" velocity $v_B$. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that $v_B$ is a state-dependent effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that, depending on the way length and time scale, $v_B$ acquires a temperature dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental prospects and on the relationship between the butterfly velocity and signaling.

abstract: Motional ground state cooling and internal state preparation are important elements for quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS), a class of quantum information processing. Since QLS does not require the high gate fidelities usually associated with quantum computation and quantum simulation, it is possible to make simplifying choices in ion species and quantum protocols at the expense of some fidelity. Here, we report sideband cooling and motional state detection protocols for $^{138}$Ba$^+$ of sufficient fidelity for QLS without an extremely narrowband laser or the use of a species with hyperfine structure. We use the two S$_{1/2}$ Zeeman sublevels of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ to Raman sideband cool a single ion to the motional ground state. Because of the small Zeeman splitting, near-resonant Raman sideband cooling of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ requires only the Doppler cooling lasers and two additional AOMs. Observing the near-resonant Raman optical pumping fluorescence, we estimate a final average motional quantum number $\bar{n}\approx0.17$. We additionally employ a second, far-off-resonant laser driving Raman $\pi$-pulses between the two Zeeman sublevels to provide motional state detection for QLS and to confirm the sideband cooling efficiency, measuring a final $\bar{n} = 0.15(6)$.
