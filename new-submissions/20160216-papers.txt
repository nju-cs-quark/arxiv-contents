abstract: Entanglement between different regions in momentum space is studied for ground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in a transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases, entanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an anisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In the ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy between left- and right-moving modes which is independent on the external field. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space. In the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between energy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size, with a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth of the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size provides an explanation for the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum space.

abstract: The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum entanglement experiments is at best incomplete, since the intermediate state induced by collapse of the wave function apparently depends upon the inertial rest frame in which the experiment is observed. While the Many Worlds Interpretation of Everett, MWI, avoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the special theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past, present and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules out Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by postulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are identical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they diverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event then emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens divided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of such universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking of it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis proposed by Tegmark. However, while Tegmark wished to avoid contamination from Goedelian self referential knots, not only does such contamination appear to be inevitable, it brings an unexpected benefit. The mathematical hierarchy required by the enigmatic footnote 48a in the paper by Goedel leads to an explanation for a unitary evolution of deterministic quantum rules across the multiverse while accounting for quantum uncertainty within an individual universe. Other aspects of this structure, called here the Plexus, are discussed, including awareness of existence and other questions raised by the hypothesis.

abstract: The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum physics. It implies that the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables can not be predicted simultaneously. In quantum information theory, this principle can be expressed in terms of entropic measures. Berta \emph{et al}. [\href{this http URL}{ Nature Phys. 6, 659 (2010) }] have indicated that uncertainty bound can be altered by considering a particle as a quantum memory correlating with the primary particle. In this article, we obtain a new lower bound for entropic uncertainty in the presence of a quantum memory by adding an additional term depending to Holevo quantity and mutual information. We conclude that the Berta's uncertainty lower bound will be tighten when the accessible information about measurements outcomes is less than the mutual information of the joint state. We investigate some examples for which our lower bound is tighter than the Berta's et al. lower bound. Using our lower bound, we also obtain a lower bound for the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states and an upper bound for the regularized distillable common randomness.

abstract: The standard theory of quantum computation relies on the idea that the basic information quantity is represented by a superposition of elements of the canonical basis and the notion of probability naturally follows from the Born rule. In this work we consider three valued quantum computational logics. More specifically, we will focus on the Hilbert space C^3, we discuss extensions of several gates to this space and, using the notion of effect probability, we provide a characterization of its states.

abstract: A quantum flywheel is studied with the purpose of storing useful work in quantum levels, while additional power is extracted continuously from the device. The flywheel gains its energy form a quantum heat engine. Generally, when a work repository is quantized the work exchange with the engine is accompanied with heat exchange, which may degrade the charging efficiency. In the particular realization of a quantum harmonic oscillator work repository, quantum and thermal fluctuations dominates the dynamics. Quantum monitoring and feedback control are applied to the flywheel, as it is shown to be an essential part of stabilizing and regulating its state of operation, and bringing the system to a steady state. A particular balance between information gained by measuring the system and the information fed back to the system is found to maximize the charging efficiency. The dynamics of the flywheel are described by a stochastic master equation that accounts for the engine, the external driving, the measurement, and the feedback operations.

abstract: We propose a method to perform single-shot optical readout of a quantum bit (qubit) using cavity quantum electrodynamics. We selectively couple the optical transitions associated with different qubit basis states to the cavity, and utilize the change in cavity transmissivity to generate a qubit readout signal composed of many photons. We show that this approach enables single-shot optical readout even when the qubit does not have a good cycling transition required for standard resonance fluorescence measurements. We calculate the probability that the measurement detects the correct spin state using the example of a quantum dot spin under various experimental conditions and demonstrate that it can exceed 0.99.

abstract: We investigate the bias-modulated dynamics of a strongly driven two-level system using the counter-rotating-hybridized rotating-wave (CHRW) method. This CHRW method treats the driving field and the bias on equal footing by a unitary transformation with two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, and is nonperturbative in driving strength, tunneling amplitude or bias. In addition, this CHRW method is beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA) and yet by properly choosing the two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, the transformed Hamiltonian takes the RWA form with a renormalized energy splitting and a renormalized driving strength. The reformulated CHRW method possesses the same mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA approach and thus allows us to calculate analytically the dynamics and explore explicitly the effect of the bias. We show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics for a wide range of parameters as compared to the numerically exact results. When energy scales of the driving are comparable to the intrinsic energy scale of the two-level systems, the counter-rotating interactions and static bias profoundly influence the generalized Rabi frequency. In this regime, where ordinary perturbation approaches fail, the CHRW works very well and efficiently. We also demonstrate the dynamics of the system in the strong-driving and off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks down but the CHRW method remains valid. We obtain analytical expressions for the generalized Rabi frequency and bias-modulated Bloch-Siegert shift as functions of the bias, tunneling and driving field parameters. The CHRW approach is a mathematically simple and physically clear method. It can be applied to treat some complicated problems for which a numerical study is difficult to perform.

abstract: We show that any bipartite quantum state of rank four is distillable, when the partial transpose of the state has at least one negative eigenvalue, i.e., the state is NPT. For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a two-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues, then the state is distillable. We further construct a parametrized two-qutrit NPT entangled state of rank five which is not 1-distillable, and show that it is not $n$-distillable for any given $n$ when the parameter is sufficiently small. This state has the smallest rank among all 1-undistillable NPT states. We conjecture that the state is not distillable.

abstract: We investigate the preparation of a target initial state for a two-level (qubit) system from a system-environment equilibrium or correlated state by an external field. The system-environment equilibrium or correlated state results from the inevitable interaction of the system with its environment. An efficient method in an extended auxiliary Liouville space is introduced to describe the dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system in the presence of a strong field and an initial system-environment correlation. By using the time evolutions of the population difference, the state trajectory in the Bloch sphere representation and the trace distance between two reduced system states of the open quantum system, the effect of initial system-environment correlations on the preparation of a system state is studied. We introduce an upper bound and a lower bound for the trace distance within our perturbation formalism to describe the diverse behaviors of the dynamics of the trace distance between various correlated states after the system state preparation. These bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the literature give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the increase of the trace distance and are related to the witnesses of non-Markovianity and initial system-bath correlation.

abstract: Experimentalists seeking to improve the coherent lifetimes of quantum bits have generally focused on improvements to qubit designs, materials, and system isolation from environmental perturbations. In the case of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be preserved is ultimately that of the qubit relative to the system clock, rather than that of the qubit in isolation. In this manuscript we clarify the impact of clock instability on qubit dephasing and provide quantitative estimates of fidelity upper-bounds set by noisy phase fluctuations in the clock. We first indicate analytically that such phase fluctuations in the clock - typically referred to as the "local oscillator" (LO) - are indistinguishable from a pure dephasing field arising from other environmental mechanisms. Using these results, we apply commonly quoted LO phase-noise specifications to calculate the resultant performance bounds on qubit operational fidelities. We find that laboratory grade LOs contribute error probabilities beyond $10^{-4}$ for operation times $<1\;\mu$s, while the use of precision LOs can suppress error rates by $10^{4}$. We find that in either case phase fluctuations at frequencies far from the carrier dominate operational error rates, and due to their high-frequency spectral content, are difficult to mitigate using dynamic error suppression strategies. Further, we consider the importance of LO noise bandwidth and its impact on the degree to which thermal phase fluctuations in the LO contribute an effective error floor. These observations and analysis of the flow-down effects of such errors on the implementation of benchmarking and quantum error correction protocols highlight challenges and advantages that particular qubit technologies possess in the context of phase-noise-induced errors and motivate enhanced research in precision frequency metrology.

abstract: We propose some protocols to implement various classes of bipartite unitary operations on two remote parties with the help of repeater nodes in between. We also present a protocol to implement a single-qubit unitary with parameters determined by a remote party with the help of up to three repeater nodes. It is assumed that the neighboring nodes are connected by noisy photonic channels, and the local gates can be performed quite accurately, while the decoherence of memories is significant. A unitary is often a part of a larger computation or communication task in a quantum network, and to reduce the amount of decoherence in other systems of the network, we focus on the goal of saving the total time for implementing a unitary including the time for entanglement preparation. We review some previously studied protocols that implements bipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and prior shared entanglement, and apply them to the situation with repeater nodes. We find that the protocols using piecewise entanglement between neighboring nodes often require less total time compared to preparing entanglement between the two end nodes first and then performing the previously known protocols. Some of the protocols work for an arbitrary bipartite unitary, hence the time needed by these protocols provide upper bounds for the total time needed to implement an arbitrary bipartite unitary as a function of the number of repeater nodes. We also prove the corresponding lower bounds when there is a small number of repeater nodes. The application to position-based cryptography is discussed.

abstract: We theoretically investigate trapped ions interacting with atoms that are coupled to Rydberg states. The strong polarizabilities of the Rydberg levels increases the interaction strength between atoms and ions by many orders of magnitude, as compared to the case of ground state atoms, and may be mediated over micrometers. We calculate that such interactions can be used to generate entanglement between an atom and the motion or internal state of an ion. Furthermore, the ion could be used as a bus for mediating spin-spin interactions between atomic spins in analogy to much employed techniques in ion trap quantum simulation. The proposed scheme comes with attractive features as it maps the benefits of the trapped ion quantum system onto the atomic one without obviously impeding its intrinsic scalability. No ground state cooling of the ion or atom is required and the setup allows for full dynamical control. Moreover, the scheme is to a large extent immune to the micromotion of the ion. Our findings are of interest for developing hybrid quantum information platforms and for implementing quantum simulations of solid state physics.

Via this local probability model, we derive a new upper bound on the maximal violation by an N-qudit state of N-partite Bell inequalities of any type (either on correlation functions or on joint probabilities) for S observables per site. This new upper bound not only improves for all N, S and d the corresponding results available for general Bell inequalities in the literature but also, for the N-qubit case with two observables per site, reduces exactly to the attainable upper bound known for quantum violations of correlation 2x...x2-setting Bell inequalities in a dichotomic case.

abstract: We derive a model of quantum-classical hybrids for a simplified model of quantum electrodynamics in the framework of the stochastic variational method. In this model, charged particle trajectories are affected by the interaction with quantized electromagnetic fields, and this quantum-classical interaction induces a displacement current. We further investigate a geometric phase in the wave functional of the gauge field configuration, which is induced by adiabatic motions of the charged particles. This phase contains the quantum-classical backreaction effect and usual Berry's phase is reproduced in the vanishing limit of the fluctuation of the charged particle trajectories.

abstract: Coherent transport of excitations along chains of coupled quantum systems represents an interesting problem with a number of applications ranging from quantum optics to solar cell technology. A convenient tool for studying such processes are quantum walks. They allow to determine in a quantitative way all the process features. We study the survival probability and the transport efficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The propagation of excitation is modeled by a discrete-time (coined) quantum walk. For a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its actual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays exponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the survival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the evolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its present position, i.e. the propagation is modeled by a lazy quantum walk, then part of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never reaches the sink. In such a case, the survival probability does not vanish and the excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport efficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for some lazy quantum walks dynamical percolations of the ring eliminate the trapping effect and efficient excitation transport can be achieved.

abstract: The interplay between the singlet ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the experimentally measured N\'eel state of antiferromagnets is studied. To verify the hypothesis [M. I. Katsnelson et al., Phys. Rev. B 63, 212404 (2001)] that the latter can be considered to be a result of local measurements destroying the entanglement of the quantum ground state, we have performed systematic simulations of the effects of von Neumannmeasurements for the case of a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 system for various types and degrees of magnetic anisotropies. It is found that in the ground state, a magnetization measurement can create decoherence waves [M. I. Katsnelson et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 022118 (2000)] in the magnetic sublattices, and that a symmetry breaking anisotropy does not lead to alignment of the spins in a particular direction. However, for an easy-axis anisotropy of the same order magnitude as the exchange constant, a measurement on the singlet ground state can create N\'eel-ordering in finite systems of experimentally accessible size.

abstract: The stabilizer ZX-calculus is a rigorous graphical language for reasoning about stabilizer quantum mechanics. This language has been proved to be complete in two steps: first in a setting where scalars (diagrams with no inputs or outputs) are ignored and then in a more general setting where a new symbol and three additional rules have been added to keep track of scalars. Here, we introduce a simplified version of the stabilizer ZX-calculus: we give a smaller set of axioms and prove that meta-rules like `only the topology matters', `colour symmetry' and `upside-down symmetry', which were considered as axioms in previous versions of the stabilizer ZX-calculus, can in fact be derived. In particular, we show that the additional symbol and one of the rules introduced for proving the completeness of the scalar stabilizer ZX-calculus are not necessary. We furthermore show that the remaining two rules dedicated to scalars cannot be derived from the other rules, i.e. they are necessary.

abstract: We present an experimental method for creating and verifying photon-number states created by non-degenerate, third-order nonlinear-optical photon-pair sources. By using spatially multiplexed, thresholding single-photon detectors and inverting a conditional probability matrix, we determine the photon-number probabilities created through heralded spontaneous four-wave-mixing. The deleterious effects of noise photons on reliable heralding are investigated and shown to degrade the conditional preparation of two-photon number states more than they degrade conditional single-photon states. We derive the equivalence between the presence of unwanted noise in the herald channel and loss in the signal channel of heralded experiments. A procedure for characterizing the noise-photon contributions, and a means of estimating the herald noise-free photon-number distribution is demonstrated.

abstract: The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a "break-even" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.

It has been well accepted since decades that adiabaticity has to be obeyed by the atoms for successful magnetic trapping. We argue in the contrary that atoms can also be confined even beyond the adiabatic limit. Hence, our findings open new possibilities to relax the restrictions of atom trapping in the laboratories.

abstract: We demonstrate how quantum computation can provide non-trivial improvements in the computational and statistical complexity of the perceptron model. We develop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm exploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane using a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$, namely $O(\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound of $O(\frac{1}{\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}})$ through quantum means, where $\gamma$ denotes the margin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model.

abstract: In an interferometer, no interference happens if the quanta's path information is available in an ancillary system. One can erase this information by an appropriate measurement and recognize subensembles of the interferometry data showing interference. We consider symmetric Mach-Zehnder or Michelson interferometers in which a qudit, initially prepared in a pure state, provides the path information. We set measures of which-path information and which-phase information (knowledge about the phase difference between the interferometer's arms) by use of Shannon entropy and show that by erasing the which-path information, one can obtain the same amount of which-phase information. As an example, we propose a new modified Michelson interferometer, feasible by today's technology, in which a qubit (an atom trapped in a cavity) gathers the photon's path information. Erasing is done by measuring the atom's energy.

abstract: Integrated sources of indistinguishable photons have attracted a lot of attention because of their applications in quantum communication and optical quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-compact quantum splitter for degenerate single photons based on a monolithic chip incorporating Sagnac loop and a micro-ring resonator with a footprint of 0.011 mm2, generating and deterministically splitting indistinguishable photon pairs using time-reversed Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. The ring resonator provides enhanced photon generation rate, and the Sagnac loop ensures the photons travel through equal path lengths and interfere with the correct phase to enable the reversed HOM effect to take place. In the experiment, we observed a HOM dip visibility of 94.5 +- 3.3 %, indicating the photons generated by the degenerate single photon source are in a suitable state for further integration with other components for quantum applications, such as controlled-NOT gates.

The overhead of the widely used heuristic techniques is quickly proving to be a significant bottleneck for solving real-world applications. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a systematic and deterministic embedding method, exploiting the structures of both the input graph of the specific problem and the quantum annealer. We focus on the specific case of the Cartesian product of two complete graphs, a regular structure that occurs in many problems. We divide the embedding problem by first embedding one of the factors of the Cartesian product in a repeatable pattern. The resulting simplified problem consists of the placement and connecting together of these copies to reach a valid solution. Aside from the obvious advantage of a systematic and deterministic approach with respect to speed and efficiency, the embeddings produced are easily scaled for larger processors and show desirable properties for the number of qubits used and the chain length distribution. To conclude, we briefly address the problem of circumventing inoperable qubits by presenting possible extensions of the method.

abstract: The path probability of a particle undergoing stochastic motion is studied by the use of functional technique, and the general formula is derived for the path probability distribution functional. The probability of finding paths inside a tube/band, the center of which is stipulated by a given path, is analytically evaluated in a way analogous to continuous measurements in quantum mechanics. Then, the formalism developed here is applied to the stochastic dynamics of stock price in finance.

abstract: The recently demonstrated electroluminescence of color centers in diamond makes them one of the best candidates for room temperature single-photon sources. However, the reported emission rates are far off what can be achieved by state-of-the-art electrically driven epitaxial quantum dots. Since the electroluminescence mechanism has not yet been elucidated, it is not clear to what extent the emission rate can be increased. Here we develop a theoretical framework to study single-photon emission from color centers in diamond under electrical pumping. The proposed model comprises electron and hole trapping and releasing, transitions between the ground and excited states of the color center as well as structural transformations of the center due to carrier trapping. It provides the possibility to predict both the photon emission rate and the wavelength of emitted photons. Self-consistent numerical simulations of the single-photon emitting diode based on the proposed model show that the photon emission rate can be as high as 100 kcounts s$^{-1}$ at standard conditions. In contrast to most optoelectronic devices, the emission rate steadily increases with the device temperature achieving of more than 100 Mcount s$^{-1}$ at 500 K, which is highly advantageous for practical applications. These results demonstrate the potential of color centers in diamond as electrically driven non-classical light emitters and provide a foundation for the design and development of single-photon sources for optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks operating at room and higher temperatures.

abstract: We employ the quantum jump trajectory approach to construct a systematic framework to study the thermodynamics at the trajectory level in a nonequilibrium open quantum system under discrete feedback control. Within this framework, we derive the quantum versions of the generalized Jarzynski equalities, which are demonstrated in a coherently driven two-level open quantum system. A possible experimental scheme to test our ?ndings in superconducting qubits is discussed.

abstract: The premise of this note is the following observation: the formalism of Bohrification is a natural place for the interpretation of general non-signalling theories. We demonstrate it through an analysis of so-called box-worlds, a popular framework for the discussion of systems exhibiting super-quantum correlations. In particular, we show that non-signalling box-world states are precisely the internal probability valuations on an internal frame in a Kripke topos naturally associated with a given box world.

abstract: We introduce a quantum-like classical computational model, called affine computation, as a generalization of probabilistic computation. After giving the basics of affine computation, we define affine finite automata (AfA) and compare it with quantum and probabilistic finite automata (QFA and PFA, respectively) with respect to three basic language recognition modes. We show that, in the cases of bounded and unbounded error, AfAs are more powerful than QFAs and PFAs, and, in the case of nondeterministic computation, AfAs are more powerful than PFAs but equivalent to QFAs.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.04804
abstract: We consider topological phases in periodically driven (Floquet) systems exhibiting many-body localization, protected by a symmetry $G$. We argue for a general correspondence between such phases and zero-temperature phases of undriven systems protected by symmetry $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G$, where the additional $\mathbb{Z}$ accounts for the discrete time translation symmetry. Thus, for example, the bosonic phases in $d$ spatial dimensions without intrinsic topological order (SPT phases) are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G, \mathrm{U}(1))$. For unitary symmetries, we interpret the additional resulting Floquet phases in terms of the lower-dimensional SPT phases that are pumped to the boundary during one time step. These results also imply the existence of novel symmetry-enriched topological (SET) orders protected solely by the periodicity of the drive.
