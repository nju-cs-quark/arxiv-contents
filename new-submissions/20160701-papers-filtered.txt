abstract: We prove that quantum local Hamiltonians, whose local terms are independent random matrices or certain random projectors, are gapless. The results apply to local Hamiltonians with translational invariance in a disorder (i.e., probabilistic) sense with some assumptions on the local distributions. Local terms may be drawn from standard random matrix ensembles. The Hamiltonian can be on a lattice in any spatial dimension or on a graph with a bounded maximum vertex degree. As a corollary there exist finite size partitions with respect to which the ground state is arbitrarily close to a product state. In addition to the lack of an energy gap, we prove that the ground state is degenerate when the local eigenvalue distribution is discrete. This work excludes the important class of truly translationally invariant Hamiltonians where the local terms are all equal.
