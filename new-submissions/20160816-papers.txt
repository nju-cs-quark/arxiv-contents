abstract: We investigate coherent transport over a finite square lattice in which the growth of bond percolation clusters are subjected to an Achlioptas type selection process, i.e., whether a bond will be placed or not depends on the sizes of clusters it may potentially connect. Different than the standard percolation where the growth of discrete clusters are completely random, clusters in this case grow in correlation with one another. We show that certain values of correlation strength, if chosen in a way to suppress the growth of the largest cluster which actually results in an explosive growth later on, may lead to more efficient transports than in the case of standard percolation, satisfied that certain fraction of total possible bonds are present in the lattice. In this case transport efficiency obeys a power law in the vicinity of bond fraction where effective transport begins. It turns out that the higher correlation strengths may also reduce the efficiency as well. We also compare our results with those of the incoherent transport and examine the spreading of eigenstates of corresponing structures. We demonstrate that structural differences of discrete clusters due to different correlations result in different localization properties.

abstract: In this paper, a quantum Stern-Gerlach thought experiment is introduced where, in addition to the intrinsic angular momentum of an atom, the magnetic field is also treated quantum mechanically. A freely falling spin polarised Bose-Einstein condensate passes close to a flux-qubit and interacts with the quantum superimposed magnetic field of the flux-qubit. Such an interaction results a macroscopic quantum entanglement of the path of a Bose-Einstein condensate with the magnetic flux quantum state of the flux-qubit. In this paper, three regimes of coupling between the flux-qubit and a freely falling Bose-Einstein condensate are discussed. The decoherence time limit required to achieve a strong coupling regime is also estimated. This paper also explores, how to produce a path entangled Bose-Einstein condensate where, the condensate can be located at physically distinct locations simultaneously. Paper provides new fundamental insights about the foundations of the quantum Stern-Gerlach experiment.

abstract: The action of global unitary operations can have intriguing effects on the non-local manifestations of a quantum state. States which admit a local hidden variable model can violate Bell's inequality when transformed by a global unitary. This phenomena assumes significance when one exercises to augment non-local resources from these seemingly useless states(i.e., in terms of non-local tasks). However, equally intriguing is the existence of states from which no non-local resource can be generated with a global unitary.The present work confirms the existence of such a set, pertaining to states living in $H_{2} \otimes H_{2}$. The set exhibits counter intuitive features by containing within it some entangled states which remain local on the action of any unitary. Furthermore through an analytic characterization of the set we lay down a generic prescription through which one can operationally identify states which can generate non-local resources under the action of a unitary on the composite system.

abstract: Mixed states appear naturally in experiment over pure states. So for studying different notions of nonlocality and their relation with entanglement in realistic scenarios, one needs to consider mixed states. In a recent article [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 020502 (2012)], a complete characterization of entanglement of an entire class of mixed three qubit states with the same symmetry as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state known as GHZ-symmetric states, has been achieved. In this paper we investigate different notions of nonlocality of the same class of states. By finding the analytical expressions of maximum violation value of most efficient Bell inequalities we obtain the conditions of standard nonlocality and genuine nonlocality of this class of states. Also relation between entanglement and nonlocality is discussed for this class of states. Interestingly, genuine entanglement of GHZ-symmetric states is necessary to reveal standard nonlocality. However, it is not sufficient to exploit the same.

abstract: We address Gillis' recent criticism [arXiv:1506.05795] of a series of papers (by different combinations of the present authors) on formulations of Bell's theorem. Those papers intended to address an unfortunate gap of communication between two broad camps in the quantum foundations community that we identify as "operationalists" and "realists". Here, we once again urge the readers to approach the question from an unbiased standpoint, and explain that Gillis' criticism draws too heavily on the philosophical inclinations of one side of that debate -- the realist camp. As part of that explanation we discuss intuition versus proof, look again at Bell's formalizations of locality, and correct misstatements by Gillis of our views, and those of Bell and Einstein.

abstract: Motivated by correlated decay processes driving gain, loss and lasing in driven semiconductor quantum-dots, we develop a theoretical technique using Keldysh diagrammatic perturbation theory to derive a Lindblad master equation that goes beyond the usual second order perturbation theory. We demonstrate the method on the driven dissipative Rabi model, including terms up to fourth order in the interaction between the qubit and both the resonator and environment. This results in a large class of Lindblad dissipators and associated rates which go beyond the terms that have previously been proposed to describe similar systems. All of the additional terms terms contribute to the system behaviour at the same order of perturbation theory, and make substantial contributions to the behaviour of the system.

abstract: Heralded near-deterministic multi-qubit controlled phase gates with integrated error detection have recently been proposed by Borregaard {\it et al}. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 114}, 110502 (2015)]. This protocol is based on a single four-level atom (a heralding quartit) and $N$ three-level atoms (operational qutrits) coupled to a single-resonator mode acting as a cavity bus. Here we generalize this method for two distant resonators without the cavity bus between the heralded and operational atoms. Specifically, we analyze the two-qubit controlled-Z gate and its multi-qubit-controlled generalization (i.e., a Toffoli gate) acting on the two-lowest levels of $N$ qutrits inside one resonator, with their successful actions being heralded by an auxiliary microwave-driven quartit inside the other resonator. Moreover, we propose a circuit-quantum-electrodynamics realization of the protocol with flux and phase qudits in linearly-coupled transmission-line resonators with dissipation. These methods offer a quadratic fidelity improvement compared to cavity-assisted deterministic gates.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled quantum state is of special importance not only for fundamental researches in quantum mechanics, but also for information processing in quantum information field. Establishing EPR entanglement between two memory systems, such as atomic ensembles, Nitrogen-vacancy centers, rare-earth-ion-doped solids, etc, is very important for realizing quantum communication, quantum computation and quantum imaging. So far, there have been few reports on the realization of EPR entanglement in true position and momentum bases between two memory systems. Here we experimentally establish EPR entanglement between two separated atomic ensembles by using quantum storage, clearly proving the existence of EPR entanglement with position and momentum entities through demonstrating EPR-paradox inequality with the aid of quantum ghost imaging and ghost interference experiments. This work is very promising for realizing spatial-multimode based quantum communications and quantum imaging.

abstract: Quantum digital signatures apply quantum mechanics to the problem of guaranteeing message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, which are complementary to the confidentiality realized by quantum key distribution. Previous experimental demonstrations have been limited to transmission distances of less than 5-km of optical fiber in a laboratory setting. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum digital signatures over installed optical fiber as well as the longest transmission link reported to date. This demonstration used a 90-km long differential phase shift quantum key distribution system to achieve approximately one signed bit per second - an increase in the signature generation rate of several orders of magnitude over previous optical fiber demonstrations.

abstract: Here we show that noisy coupling can lead to diffusive lossless energy transfer between individual quantum systems retaining a quantum character leading to entangled stationary states. Coherence might flow diffusively while being summarily preserved even when energy exchange is absent. Diffusive dynamics persists even in the case when additional noise suppresses all the unitary excitation exchange: arbitrarily strong local dephasing, while destroying quantum correlations, is not affecting energy transfer.

abstract: Gossip algorithms is a common term to describe protocols for unreliable information dissemination in natural networks, which are not optimally designed for efficient communication between network entities. We consider application of gossip algorithms to quantum networks and show that any quantum network can be updated to optimal configuration with local operations and classical communication. This allows to seed-up -- in the best case exponentially -- the quantum information dissemination. Irrespective of the initial configuration of the quantum network, the update requiters at most polynomial number of local operations and classical communication.

abstract: Characterizing and understanding noise affecting quantum states has immense benefits in spectroscopy as well as in realizing quantum devices. Fourier analysis of transverse relaxation times under a set of dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences with varying inter-pulse delays was earlier used for obtaining the noise spectral densities of single-qubit coherences. In this work, using a pair of homonuclear spins and NMR techniques, we experimentally characterize noise in certain two-qubit states such as the long-lived state, long-lived coherence, and compare them with an ordinary state. We also explore the noise of similar states in a heteronuclear spin-pair. Further using a 10-qubit system, we investigate noise profiles of various multi-qubit coherences and study the scaling of noise with respect to the coherence order. Finally, using the experimental noise spectrum of the 10-qubit NOON state, we compare the performances of various orders of Uhrig DD sequences.

The latter combine the state of the system with that of the environment by means of a multi-mode beamsplitter.

abstract: Superposition, arguably the most fundamental property of quantum mechanics, lies at the heart of quantum information science. However, how to create the superposition of any two unknown pure states remains as a daunting challenge. Recently, it is proved that such a quantum protocol does not exist if the two input states are completely unknown, whereas a probabilistic protocol is still available with some prior knowledge about the input states [M. Oszmaniec \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 110403 (2016)]. The knowledge is that both of the two input states have nonzero overlaps with some given referential state. In this work, we experimentally realize the probabilistic protocol of superposing two pure states in a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by preparing a families of input states, and the average fidelity between the prepared state and expected superposition state is over 99%. Moreover, we experimentally illustrate the limitation of the protocol that it is likely to fail or yields very low fidelity, if the nonzero overlaps are approaching zero. Our experimental implementation can be extended to more complex situations and other quantum systems.

abstract: The model of a two-electron quantum dot, confined to move in a two dimensional flat space, is revisited. Generally, it is argued that the solutions of this model obtained by solving a biconfluent Heun equation have some limitations. In particular, some corrections are also made in previous theoretical calculations. The corrected polynomial solutions are confronted with numerical calculations based on the Numerov method, in a good agreement between both. Then, new solutions considering the $1/r$ and $\ln r$ Coulombian-like potentials in (1+2)D, not yet obtained, are discussed numerically. In particular, we are able to calculate the quantum dot eigenfunctions for a much larger spectrum of external harmonic frequencies as compared to previous results. Also the existence of bound states for such planar system in the case $l=0$ is predicted and the respective eigenvalues are determined.

abstract: We introduce a qauantitative measure of spin-charge separation, $\zeta (t)$ which is based on the difference between the fluctuations with respect to background of the spin and charge profiles at any time t and is suitable for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of excitations in strongly correlated systems. This quantity is not only a direct measure of the spin-charge separation in strongly correlated systems, but its long time behaviour can further serve as a possible order parameter for the interaction induced (Mott) insulating state. Within the nu- merically exact diagonzalization we calculate this quantity for the two dimensional Hubbard model away from Half filling. Our quantitative measure in chain, ladder and two-dimensional geometries gives the same order of magnitude for the quantity of spin-charge separation. Furthermore from the temporal behaviour of $\zeta (t)$ a threshold time can be identified that provides clues onto the breakdown of underlying Mott insulating phase.

abstract: We present experimental data and associated theory for correlations in a series of experiments involving repeated Landau-Zener sweeps through the crossing point of a singlet state and a spin aligned triplet state in a GaAs double quantum dot containing two conduction electrons, which are loaded in the singlet state before each sweep, and the final spin is recorded after each sweep. The experiments reported here measure correlations on time scales from 4 $\mu$s to 2 ms. When the magnetic field is aligned in a direction such that spin-orbit coupling cannot cause spin flips, the correlation spectrum has prominent peaks centered at zero frequency and at the differences of the Larmor frequencies of the nuclei, on top of a frequency-independent background. When the spin-orbit field is relevant, there are additional peaks, centered at the frequencies of the individual species. A theoretical model which neglects the effects of high-frequency charge noise correctly predicts the positions of the observed peaks, and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the size of the frequency-independent background, but gives peak areas that are larger than the observed areas by a factor of two or more. The observed peak widths are roughly consistent with predictions based on nuclear dephasing times of the order of 60 $\mu$s. However, there is extra weight at the lowest observed frequencies, which suggests the existence of residual correlations on the scale of 2 ms. We speculate on the source of these discrepancies.

abstract: Solid-state spin arrays are being engineered in varied systems, including gated coupled quantum dots and interacting dopants in semiconductor structures. Beyond quantum computation, these arrays are useful integrated analog simulators for many-body models. As entanglement between individual spins is extremely short ranged in these models, one has to measure the entanglement entropy of a block in order to truly verify their many-body entangled nature. Remarkably, the characteristic scaling of entanglement entropy, predicted by conformal field theory, has never been measured. Here we show that with as few as two replicas of a spin array, and capacitive double-dot singlet-triplet measurements on neighboring spin pairs, the above scaling of the entanglement entropy can be verified. This opens up the controlled simulation of quantum field theories, as we exemplify with uniform chains and Kondo-type impurity models, in engineered solid-state systems. Our procedure remains effective even in the presence of typical imperfections of realistic quantum devices and can be used for thermometry, and to bound entanglement and discord in mixed many-body states.

abstract: We study bipartite post measurement entanglement entropy after selective measurements in quantum chains. We first study the quantity for the critical systems that can be described by conformal field theories. We find a connection between post measurement entanglement entropy and the Casimir energy of floating objects. Then we provide formulas for the post measurement entanglement entropy for open and finite temperature systems. We also comment on the Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy in the context of the post measurement entanglement entropy. Finally, we also provide some formulas regarding modular hamiltonians and entanglement spectrum in the after measurement systems. After through discussion regarding CFT systems we also provide some predictions regarding massive field theories. We then discuss a generic method to calculate the post measurement entanglement entropy in the free fermion systems. Using the method we study the post measurement entanglement entropy in the XY spin chain. We check numerically the CFT and the massive field theory results in the transverse field Ising chain and the XX model. In particular, we study the post meaurement entanglement entropy in the infinite, periodic and open critical transverse field Ising chain and the critical XX model. The effect of the temperature and the gap is also discussed in these models.

abstract: Electron spins in semiconductors are promising qubits because their long coherence times enable nearly 10^9 coherent quantum gate operations. However, developing a scalable high-fidelity two-qubit gate remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an entangling gate between two double-quantum-dot spin qubits in GaAs by using a magnetic field gradient between the two dots in each qubit to suppress decoherence due to charge noise. When the magnetic gradient dominates the voltage-controlled exchange interaction between electrons, qubit coherence times increase by an order of magnitude. Using randomized benchmarking and self-consistent quantum measurement, state, and process tomography, we measure single-qubit gate fidelities of approximately 99% and an entangling gate fidelity of 90%. In the future, operating double quantum dot spin qubits with large gradients in nuclear-spin-free materials, such as Si, should enable a two-qubit gate fidelity surpassing the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

abstract: Topological insulators(TI) are a unique class of materials with exotic surface electronic properties. When a ferromagnetic (FM) layer is added on the top of a thin film 3D TI, the surface states gain magnetization. We point out here that the in-plane magnetization and the Fermi surface anisotropy due to hexagonal warping mediate changes in the quantum capacitance of the thin film warped FM/3D TI interface in the presence of an out of plane magnetic field. To first order, the quantum capacitance change due to hexagonal warping is always negative, and increases in magnitude monotonically with the energy difference from the charge neutrality point. In contrast, the change in the quantum capacitance due to in-plane magnetization oscillates with the energy, and can be zero for all energies for some combinations of the inter-surface coupling, and out of plane Zeeman energy splitting and magnetic field strength.

Considering the examples of a molecular dimer and a carbon nanotube double quantum dot, we here theoretically investigate transport through a two-site system that is strongly coupled to a single vibrational mode. Using a quantum master equation approach, we demonstrate that, depending on the relative positions of the two dots, electron-phonon interactions can lead to negative differential conductance and suppression of the current through the system. We also discuss the experimental relevance of the presented results and possible implementations of the studied system.

abstract: Excess energy absorbed by the light-harvesting antennas could be potentially harmful to the photosynthesis complexes. The biological system has developed various mechanisms, e.g. non-photon chemical quenching, to prevent these damages by dissipating energy into the surrounding environment. In additional to this well-known mechanism, we hypothesise a new protection mechanism of suppressing the probability of double excitation in photosynthesis system, where pigment-protein complexes form cyclic structures with dipole-dipole interaction between adjacent chlorophylls. We also demonstrate robustness of the photon blockade against the disorder in the ring structures. The photon blockade can explain the recent observation on the suppression of simultaneous emission of two photons in natural photosynthetic antennas.
