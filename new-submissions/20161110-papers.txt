abstract: We show that a laser pulse can always be found that induces a desired optical response from an arbitrary dynamical system. As illustrations, driving fields are computed to induce the same optical response from a variety of distinct systems (open and closed, quantum and classical). As a result, the observed induced dipolar spectra without detailed information on the driving field is not sufficient to characterize atomic and molecular systems. The formulation may also be applied to design materials with specified optical characteristics. These findings reveal unexplored flexibilities of nonlinear optics.

abstract: The qutrit comes next in complexity after qubit as a resource for quantum information processing. The qubit density matrix can be easily visualized using Bloch sphere representation of its states. In contrast, this simplicity is in general unavailable for the 8-dimensional state space of a qutrit. In this work a new way to visualize them in a 3-dimensional Cartesian space is presented and compared with earlier similar efforts.

abstract: We show that, as in classical statistical physics, the effect of a dissipative environment on a quantum probe can be described by a quantum statistical force. Using Operational Dynamic Modeling, an environment is designed to exert a desired quantum statistical force on a quantum probe. In particular, we simulate an environment tailored to enhance quantum tunneling. We also provide a possible experimental implementation for this environment. These findings highlight the flexibility offered by non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.

title: The Meaning of the Wave Function: In Search of the Ontology of Quantum Mechanics

abstract: The meaning of the wave function has been a hot topic of debate since the early days of quantum mechanics. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in this long-standing question. Is the wave function ontic, directly representing a state of reality, or epistemic, merely representing a state of (incomplete) knowledge, or something else? If the wave function is not ontic, then what, if any, is the underlying state of reality? If the wave function is indeed ontic, then exactly what physical state does it represent? In this book, I aim to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and find the ontological content of the theory. The book can be divided into three parts. The first part addresses the question of the nature of the wave function (Chapters 1-5). After giving a comprehensive and critical review of the competing views of the wave function, I present a new argument for the ontic view in terms of protective measurements. In addition, I also analyze the origin of the wave function by deriving the free Schroedinger equation. The second part analyzes the ontological meaning of the wave function (Chapters 6, 7). I propose a new ontological interpretation of the wave function in terms of random discontinuous motion of particles, and give two main arguments supporting this interpretation. The third part investigates whether the suggested quantum ontology is complete in accounting for our definite experience and whether it needs to be revised in the relativistic domain (Chapters 8, 9).

abstract: Non-destructive weak measurements (WM) made on a quantum particle allow to extract information as the particle evolves from a prepared state to a finally detected state. The physical meaning of this information has been open to debate, particularly in view of the apparent discontinuous trajectories of the particle recorded by WM. In this work we investigate the properties of vanishing weak values for projection operators as well as general observables. We then analyze the implications when inferring the past of a quantum particle. We provide a novel (non-optical) example for which apparent discontinuous trajectories are obtained by WM.\ Our approach is compared to previous results.

abstract: We analyze, in general terms, the evolution of energy levels in quantum mechanics, as a function of a coupling parameter, and demonstrate the possibility of level crossings in systems described by irreducible matrices. In long-range interactions, the coupling parameter is the interatomic distance. We demonstrate the utility of adjacency matrices and adjacency graphs in the analysis of "hidden" symmetries of a problem; these allow us to break reducible matrices into irreducible subcomponents. A possible breakdown of the no-crossing theorem for higher-dimensional irreducible matrices is indicated, and an application to the 2S-2S interaction in hydrogen is briefly described. The analysis of interatomic interactions in this system is important for further progress on optical measurements of the 2S hyperfine splitting.

abstract: Quantum optical states are fragile and can become corrupted when passed through a lossy communication channel. Unlike for classical signals, optical amplifiers cannot be used to recover quantum signals. Quantum repeaters have been proposed as a way of reducing errors and hence increasing the range of quantum communications. Current protocols target specific discrete encodings, for example quantum bits encoded on the polarization of single photons. We introduce a more general approach that can reduce the effect of loss on any quantum optical encoding, including those based on continuous variables such as the field amplitudes. We show that in principle the protocol incurs a resource cost that scales polynomially with distance. We analyse the simplest implementation and find that whilst its range is limited it can still achieve useful improvements in the distance over which quantum entanglement of field amplitudes can be distributed.

abstract: Optical telecommunication is at the heart of today's internet and is currently enabled by the transmission of intense optical signals between remote locations. As we look to the future of telecommunication, quantum mechanics promise new ways to be able to transmit and process that information. Demonstrations of quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation using multi-photon states have been performed, but only over ranges limited to one hundred kilometers. To go beyond this, we need repeaters that are compatible with these quantum multi-photon continuous variables pulses. Here we present a design for a continuous variable quantum repeaters that can distribute entangled and pure two-mode squeezed states over arbitrarily long distances with a success probability that scales only polynomially with distance. The proposed quantum repeater is composed from several basic known building blocks such as non-Gaussian operations for entanglement distillation and an iterative Gaussification protocol (for retaining the Gaussian character of the final state), but complemented with a heralded non-Gaussian entanglement swapping protocol, which allows us to avoid extensive iterations of quantum Gaussification. We characterize the performance of this scheme in terms of key rates for quantum key distribution and show a secure key can be generated over thousands of kilometers.

abstract: Steady-state manifolds of open quantum systems, such as decoherence-free subspaces and noiseless subsystems, are of great practical importance to the end of quantum information processing. Yet, it is a difficult problem to find steady-state manifolds of open quantum systems, especially of non-Markovian systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to find the steady-state manifolds, which is generally applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian systems. Our approach is based on an arbitrarily given steady state, and by following the standard steps of the approach, the steady-state manifold on the support subspace of the given state can be obtained. Our work reduces the problem of finding a manifold of steady states to that of finding only one steady state, which is indeed an interesting progress towards completely solving the difficult problem. Besides, in deriving our approach, we introduce the notions of the modified noise algebra and its commutant, and prove two theorems on the structure of steady-state manifolds of general open systems, which themselves are interesting findings too.

We consider in particular correlated dephasing, depolarising and amplitude damping channels. We show that the method is easily implementable, it does not require a priori knowledge about the channels, and it is very efficient, since it does not rely on full quantum process tomography.

abstract: Weak measurements done on a subsystem of a bipartite system having both classical and nonClassical correlations between its components can potentially reveal information about the other subsystem with minimal disturbance to the overall state. We use weak quantum discord and the fidelity between the initial bipartite state and the state after measurement to construct a cost function that accounts for both the amount of information revealed about the other system as well as the disturbance to the overall state. We investigate the behaviour of the cost function for families of two qubit states and show that there is an optimal choice that can be made for the strength of the weak measurement.

abstract: We apply reservoir engineering to construct a thermal environment with controllable temperature in an ultracold atomic Rydberg system. A Boltzmann distribution of the system's eigenstates is produced by optically driving a small environment of ultracold atoms, which is coupled to a photonic continuum through spontaneous emission. This technique provides a useful tool for quantum simulation of both equilibrium dynamics and dynamics coupled to a thermal environment. Additionally, we demonstrate that pure eigenstates, such as Bell states, can be prepared in the Rydberg atomic system using this method.

abstract: In the same way as the quantum no-cloning theorem and quantum key distribution in two preceding papers, entanglement-assisted quantum teleportation and Grover's search algorithm are generalized by transferring them to an abstract setting, including usual quantum mechanics as a special case. This again shows that a much more general and abstract access to these quantum mechanical features is possible than commonly thought. A non-classical extension of conditional probability and, particularly, a very special type of state-independent conditional probability are used instead of Hilbert spaces and wavefunctions.

abstract: We present numerical studies of quantum walks on \C60 and related graphene structures, to investigate their transport properties. Also known as a \emph{honeycomb lattice}, the lattice formed by carbon atoms in the graphene phase can be rolled up to form nanotubes of various dimensions. Graphene nanotubes have many important applications, some of which rely on their unusual electrical conductivity and related properties. Quantum walks on graphs provide an abstract setting in which to study such transport properties independent of the other chemical and physical properties of a physical substance. They can thus be used to further the understanding of mechanisms behind such properties. We find that nanotube structures are significantly more efficient in transporting a quantum walk than cycles of equivalent size, provided the symmetry of the structure is respected in how they are used. We find faster transport on zig-zag nanotubes compared to armchair nanotubes, which is unexpected given that for the actual materials the armchair nanotube is metallic, while the zig-zag is semiconducting.

abstract: In this work, quantum state transfer (QST) over binary-tree spin networks is studied by using advantages of partially collapsing measurements. To this aim, we perform initially a weak measurement (WM) on central qubit of the binary-tree network, which encoding the state of concern and after time evolution of the whole system, a quantum measurement reversal (QMR) on the destined qubit is performed. By taking the optimal value of the QMR, it is shown that the QST can be improved considerably by controlling the WM strength and by choosing it close enough to 1, near-perfect QST can be achieved. We also show that how entanglement distribution quality over the binary-tree spin network can be obviously improved by using this approach.

abstract: Organic semiconductors have the remarkable property that their optical excitation not only generates charge-neutral electron-hole pairs (excitons) but also charge-separated polaron pairs with high yield. The microscopic mechanisms underlying this charge separation have been debated for many years. Here we use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to study the dynamics of polaron pair formation in a prototypical polymer thin film on a sub-20-fs time scale. We observe multi-period peak oscillations persisting for up to about 1 ps as distinct signatures of vibronic quantum coherence at room temperature. The measured two-dimensional spectra show pronounced peak splittings revealing that the elementary optical excitations of this polymer are hybridized exciton-polaron-pairs, strongly coupled to a dominant underdamped vibrational mode. Coherent vibronic coupling induces ultrafast polaron pair formation, accelerates the charge separation dynamics and makes it insensitive to disorder. These findings open up new perspectives for tailoring light-to-current conversion in organic materials.

abstract: Single-photon detection with high efficiency, high time resolution, low dark counts and high photon detection-rates is required for a wide range of optical measurements. Although efficient detectors have been reported, combining all performances in a single device remains a challenge. Here, we show a broadband NbTiN superconducting nanowire detector with an efficiency over 92%, over 150MHz photon detection-rate and dark counts below 130Hz operated in a conventional Gifford-McMahon cryostat. Furthermore, with an optimized detector and readout electronics, we reach a record low jitter of 14.80ps while maintaining high efficiency.

abstract: The dynamics of a distinguished particle coupled to a dense and homogeneous ideal Fermi gas in two spatial dimensions is studied. We analyze the model in a strong coupling regime, i.e., for coupling parameter g of order one, and derive the validity of the mean field approximation for large densities of the gas and for long time scales of the order of some power of the density. Here, the mean field approximation holds although the fluctuations of the potential around its mean value can be arbitrarily large. Since the ideal Fermi gas is spatially homogeneous, the average potential is constant and the tracer particle moves effectively freely. This is in contrast to a dense bosonic gas in which the free motion of the tracer particle would be disturbed already on a very short time scale. The proof is based on the use of strong phase cancellations in the deviations of the microscopic dynamics from the mean field time evolution.

abstract: One of the most important task in physics today is to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity into one framework. And the main barrier in this task is that we lack quantum gravitational phenomena in experiments. An important way to get quantum gravitational phenomena is to study quantum effects in a macro-scale system in which gravity will play a role. In this article, we want to study dynamics of a possible macro-scale system: liquid helium droplets with radius of 100nm under low temperature and low pressure. Our idea is to observe the interference phenomenon of this system and find the similarities and difference between it and quantum system. We gave a practical experiment design to observe the interference, including a possible method to realize an approximate square barrier. We also gave an illustration on what a quantum or a classical interferogram of our system looks like theoretically.

abstract: A linear map between real symmetric matrix spaces is positive if it maps positive semidefinite matrices to positive semidefinite ones, and is called completely positive if all its ampliations are positive. In this article quantitative bounds on the fraction of positive maps that are completely positive are proved. A main tool are real algebraic geometry techniques developed by Blekherman to study the gap between positive polynomials and sums of squares. Finally, an algorithm to produce positive maps which are not completely positive is given.

abstract: Entanglement pre-thermalization (EP) is a quasi-stationary nonequilibrium state of a composite system in which each individual subsystem looks thermal but the entire system remains nonthermal due to quantum entanglement between subsystems. We theoretically study the dynamics of EP following a coherent split of a one-dimensional harmonic potential in which two interacting bosons are confined. This problem is equivalent to that of an interaction quench between two harmonic oscillators. We show that this simple model captures the bare essentials of EP; that is, each subsystem relaxes to an approximate thermal equilibrium, whereas the total system remains entangled. We find that a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which incorporates nonlocal conserved quantities, exactly describes the total system. In the presence of a symmetry-breaking perturbation, EP is quasi-stationary and eventually reaches thermal equilibrium. We analytically show that the lifetime of EP is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the perturbation.
