abstract: We introduce the local quantum thermal susceptibility (LQTS) functional, which quantifies the best achievable accuracy for the temperature estimation of a composite system via local measurements. In this way we provide an operative strategy to address the local thermal response of arbitrary quantum systems at equilibrium. Our method relies on basic concepts of quantum estimation theory and is irrespective of the structure of thermal states. At low temperatures LQTS is an indicator of the local distinguishability of the ground-state with respect to the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a powerful method to identify, for example, quantum phase transitions.
