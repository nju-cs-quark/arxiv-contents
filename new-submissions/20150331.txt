abstract: The gauge color code is a quantum error-correcting code with local syndrome measurements that, remarkably, admits a universal transversal gate set without the need for resource-intensive magic state distillation. A result of recent interest, proposed by Bomb\'{i}n, shows that the subsystem structure of the gauge color code admits an error-correction protocol that achieves tolerance to noisy measurements without the need for repeated measurements, so called single-shot error correction. Here, we demonstrate the promise of single-shot error correction by designing a two-part decoder and investigate its performance. We simulate fault-tolerant error correction with the gauge color code over long durations by repeatedly applying our proposed error-correction protocol. We estimate a sustainable error rate, i.e. the threshold for the long time limit, of $ \sim 0.31\%$ for a phenomenological noise model using a simple decoding algorithm.

abstract: We predict several effects associated with the optical response of systems prepared in a nonequilibrium state by impulsive optical excitations. The linear response depends on the phase of the electric field even if the initial nonequilirbium state has only populations, no coherences. Initial quantum coherences induce additional phase dependence which also shows new resonances in nonlinear wave mixing. In systems strongly driven by an external optical field, the field frequency generates a phase dependent probe absorption. This gives further control to manipulate the relative contribution to the linear signal due to initial populations and coherences.

abstract: Electron and vibrational dynamics of molecules are commonly studied by subjecting them to two interactions with a fast actinic pulse that prepares them in a nonstationary state and after a variable delay period $T$, probing them with a Raman process induced by a combination of a broadband and a narrowband pulse. This technique known as femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) can effectively probe time resolved vibrational resonances. We show how FSRS signals can be modeled and interpreted using the stochastic Liouville equations (SLE) originally developed for NMR lineshapes. The SLE provides a convenient simulation protocol that can describe complex dynamics due to coupling to collective coordinates at much lower cost that a full dynamical simulation. The origin of the dispersive features which appear when there is no separation of timescales between vibrational variations and dephasing is clarified.

abstract: We study the dynamics of the Rabi Hamiltonian in the medium coupling regime with $\left\vert g/\omega \right\vert \sim 0.07$, where $g$ is atom-field coupling constant, $\omega $ is the field frequency, for the quantum state with average photon number $\bar{n}\sim 10^{4}$. We map the original Hamiltonian to an effective one, which describes a tight-binding chain subjected to a staggered linear potential. It is shown that the photon probability distribution of a Gaussian-type state exhibits the amplitude modulated Bloch oscillation (BO), which is a superposition of two conventional BOs with a half-BO-period delay between them and is essentially another type of Bloch-Zener oscillation. The probability transition between the two BOs can be controlled and suppressed by the ratio $g\sqrt{\bar{n}}% /\omega $, as well as in-phase resonant oscillating atomic frequency $\Omega \left( t\right) $, leading to multiple zero-transition points.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the effect of optical feedback from a cavity containing an ultracold two level atomic ensemble, on the bistable behavior shown by mean intracavity optical field in an optomechanical cavity resonator. It turns out that the optical bistability can be controlled by tuning the frequency and power of the single driving laser as well as by varying different system parameters provided by the hybrid interaction. Significantly, even though the atomic cavity is not driven by any laser pump and there is no coupling with the mechanical oscillator directly, the intracavity optical field in the atomic cavity also exhibits bistability due to the optical coupling with the optomechanical cavity. In essence, our work emphasizes the possibility of realization of a better controllable optical switch depending on the hybrid interaction.

abstract: We show how a test of macroscopic realism based on Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGIs) can be performed in a macroscopic system. Using a continuous-variable approach, we consider quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements applied to atomic ensembles undergoing magnetically-driven coherent oscillation. We identify measurement schemes requiring only Gaussian states as inputs and giving a significant LGI violation with realistic experimental parameters and imperfections. The predicted violation is shown to be due to true quantum effects rather than to a classical invasivity of the measurement. Using QND measurements to tighten the "clumsiness loophole" forces the stubborn macrorealist to re-create quantum back action in his or her account of measurement.

abstract: Short-range interaction can give rise to particle pairing with a short-range correlation, which may be destroyed in the presence of an external field. We study the transition between correlated and uncorrelated particle states in the framework of one-dimensional Hubbard model driven by a field. We show that the long time-scale transfer rate from an initial correlated state to final uncorrelated particle states is sensitive to the quench field strength and exhibits a periodic behavior. This process involves an irreversible energy transfer from the field to particles, leading to a quantum electrothermal effect.

abstract: We propose and analyze a high fidelity readout scheme for a single instance approach to quantum computing in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. The scheme is based on using different species of qubit and readout ions, and it is shown that by allowing the closest qubit ion to act as a readout buffer, the readout error can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The scheme is shown to be robust against certain experimental variations, such as varying detection efficiencies, and we use the scheme to predict the expected quantum fidelity of a CNOT gate in these solid state systems. In addition, we discuss the potential scalability of the protocol to larger qubit systems. The results are based on parameters which we believed are experimentally feasible with current technology, and which can be simultaneously realized.

abstract: We consider an special dynamics of a quantum walk (QW) on a line. Initially, the walker localized at the origin of the line with arbitrary chirality, evolves to an asymptotic stationary state. In this stationary state a measurement is performed and the state resulting from this measurement is used to start a second QW evolution to achieve a second asymptotic stationary state. In previous works, we developed the thermodynamics associated with the entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom in the QW. Here we study the application of the ?rst and second laws of thermodynamics to the process between the two stationary states mentioned above. We show that: i) the entropy change has upper and lower bounds that are obtained analytically as a function of the initial conditions. ii) the energy change is associated to a heat-transfer process.

abstract: In this paper we investigate an implementation of a quantum gate for quantum information processing in a system of quantum dots in an optical cavity manipulated by collinear laser fields. For simplicity we give theoretical and numerical results only for simulations of two quantum dots in a cavity interacting with two collinear fields. Extension to the system of many quantum dots in a cavity can be done in similar manner as the two dots system. It is shown that due to the collinear fields are used, a two qubit gate operation can be acheived by choosing properly detunings and amplitudes of the collinear fields.

Interestingly, we find that one of these inequalities, Son-Lee-Kim inequality can be used to measure entanglement of a pure bipartite state. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of this measurement.

abstract: Herein, we present a feasible, general protocol for quantum communication within a network via generalized remote preparation of an arbitrary $m$-qubit entangled state designed with genuine tripartite Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger-type entangled resources. During the implementations, we construct novel collective unitary operations; these operations are tasked with performing the necessary phase transfers during remote state preparations. We have distilled our implementation methods into a five-step procedure, which can be used to faithfully recover the desired state during transfer. Compared to previous existing schemes, our methodology features a greatly increased success probability. After the consumption of auxiliary qubits and the performance of collective unitary operations, the probability of successful state transfer is increased four-fold and eight-fold for arbitrary two- and three-qubit entanglements when compared to other methods within the literature, respectively. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the presented scheme for state preparation, including: success probabilities, reducibility and generalizability.

abstract: This paper discusses a restriction of quantum theory, in which very complex states would be excluded. The toy theory is phrased in the language of the circuit model for quantum computing, its key ingredient being a limitation on the number of interactions that \textit{each} qubit may undergo. As long as one stays in the circuit model, the toy theory is consistent and may even match what we shall be ever able to do in a controlled laboratory experiment. The direct extension of the restriction beyond the circuit model conflicts with observed facts: the possibility of restricting the complexity of quantum state, while saving phenomena, remains an open question.

abstract: The Clifford+$T$ quantum computing gate library for single qubit gates can create all unitary matrices that are generated by the group $\langle H, T\rangle$. The matrix $T$ can be considered the fourth root of Pauli $Z$, since $T^4 = Z$ or also the eighth root of the identity $I$. The Hadamard matrix $H$ can be used to translate between the Pauli matrices, since $(HTH)^4$ gives Pauli $X$. We are generalizing both these roots of the Pauli matrices (or roots of the identity) and translation matrices to investigate the groups they generate: the so-called Pauli root groups. In this work we introduce a formalization of such groups, study finiteness and infiniteness properties, and precisely determine equality and subgroup relations.

Decoherence due to particle losses and finite detection efficiency are also considered.

abstract: We propose a quantum computer architecture which is robust against decoherence and scalable. As a qubit, we adopt rotational states of a nonpolar ionic molecule trapped in an ion-trap. It is revealed that the rotational-state qubits are much more immune to decoherence than the conventional electronic-state qubits of atomic ions. A complete method set for state preparation, single-qubit gate, controlled-NOT gate, and qubit-readout suitable for the rotational-state qubits is provided. Since the ionic molecules can be transported in an array of ion traps, the rotational-state qubits are expected to be a promising candidate to build a large-scale quantum computer.

abstract: Superposition and indistinguishablility between probability amplitudes have played an essential role in observing quantum interference effects of correlated photons. The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and interferences of the path-entangled photon number state are of special interest in the field of quantum information technologies. However, a fully generalized two-photon quantum interferometric scheme accounting for the Hong-Ou-Mandel scheme and path-entangled photon number states has not yet been proposed. Here we report the experimental demonstrations of the generalized two-photon interferometry with both the interferometric properties of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and the fully unfolded version of the path-entangled photon number state using photon-pair sources, which are independently generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our experimental scheme explains two-photon interference fringes revealing single- and two-photon coherence properties in a single interferometer setup. Using the proposed interferometric measurement, it is possible to directly estimate the joint spectral intensity of a photon pair source.

abstract: We propose and analyse a robust quantum state transfer protocol by the use of a combination of coherent quantum coupling and decoherence-free subspaces in a coupled quantum spin chain. Under decoherence, an arbitrary unknown quantum state embedded in a decoherence-free subspace can be perfectly transferred through a noisy channel being weakly coupled to two end registers. The method protects quantum information from both the channel noise and the environmental decoherence. A special case of utilizing two physical qubits to encode one logical qubit is considered as an example and the robustness is confirmed by numerical performances.

abstract: We provide a way of generating and observing molecular quantum gyroscopic motion that resembles gyroscopic motion of classical rotors. After producing a nonspreading rotational wavepacket called a cogwheel state, one can generate a gyroscopic precession motion by applying an external magnetic field interacting through a rotational magnetic dipole moment. The quantum rotors, realized with linear nonparamagnetic ionic molecules trapped in an ion trap, can keep their gyroscopic motion for a long time in a collectively synchronized fashion. A Coulomb-explosion technique is suggested to observe the gyroscopic motion. Despite limited molecular species, the observation of the gyroscopic motion can be adopted as a method to measure rotational g factors of molecules.

abstract: In this work we present a simple method to reconstruct the complex spectral wavefunction of a biphoton, and hence gain complete information about the spectral and temporal properties of a photon pair. The technique, which relies on quantum interference, is applicable to biphoton states produced with a monochromatic pump when a shift of the pump frequency produces a shift in the relative frequencies contributing to the biphoton. We demonstrate an example of such a situation in type-II parametric down-conversion (SPDC) allowing arbitrary paraxial spatial pump and detection modes. Moreover, our test cases demonstrate the possibility to shape the spectral wavefunction. This is achieved by choosing the spatial mode of the pump and of the detection modes, and takes advantage of spatiotemporal correlations.

abstract: Explicit separable density matrices, for mixed two qubits states, are derived by the use of Hilbert Schmidt decompositions and Peres Horodecki criterion. A strongly separable two qubits mixed state is defined by multiplications of two density matrices given with pure states while weakly separable two qubits state is defined by multiplications of two density matrices which includes non-pure states. We analyze these two cases relating them to certain physical properties.

abstract: We develop a theoretical model to describe the dissipative dynamics of singlet-triplet (S-T_0) qubits in GaAs quantum dots. Using the concurrence experimentally obtained as a guide, we show that each logical qubit is coupled to its own environment because the decoherence effect can be described by independent dephasing channels. Given the correct description of the environment, we study the dynamics of concurrence as a function of the temperature, the constant coupling between the system and the environment, the preparation time, and the exchange coupling. Although the reduction of the environment coupling constant modifies the entanglement dynamics, we demonstrate that temperature emerges as a crucial variable and a variation of millikelvins significantly modifies the generation of entangled states. Furthermore, we show that the exchange coupling together with the preparation time strongly affects the entanglement dissipative dynamics.

abstract: We present an alternative approach to modeling Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPRB)-type experiments. The basis for our approach will be to replace the conventional Kolmogorov theory of probability, with the more general Dempster-Schafer theory of evidence. This leads to the identification of a distinct type of epistemic uncertainty, which is not present in Kolmogorov theory, but which is relevant in modeling experiments with operationally incompatible observables. Our treatment naturally yields conditional relative frequencies, which are perfectly compatible with classical determinism and locality, but which do not satisfy Bell-type inequalities.

In the present paper we demonstrate that these line profiles are indeed well described by the Beutler-Fano formula, and thus are genuine Fano resonances. Also further away from the exceptional points excellent agreement can be found by introducing energy dependent Fano parameters.

abstract: Trapping ultracold atoms in optical lattices enabled numerous breakthroughs uniting several disciplines. Although the light is a key ingredient in such systems, its quantum properties are typically neglected, reducing the role of light to a classical tool for atom manipulation. Here we show how elevating light to the quantum level leads to novel phenomena, inaccessible in setups based on classical optics. Interfacing a many-body atomic system with quantum light opens it to the environment in an essentially nonlocal way, where spatial coupling can be carefully designed. The competition between typical processes in strongly correlated systems (local tunnelling and interaction) with global measurement backaction leads to novel multimode dynamics and the appearance of long-range correlated tunnelling capable of entangling distant lattices sites, even when tunnelling between neighbouring sites is suppressed by the quantum Zeno effect. We demonstrate both the break-up and protection of strongly interacting fermion pairs by different measurements.

Emergence of entanglement due to external magnetic field or magnetic entanglement is observed for weakly coupled spin pairs in the same dimer chain. Though closed dimerized isotropic XXX Heisenberg chains with different dimer strengths were mainly explored, analogous studies on open chains as well as closed anisotropic (XX interaction) chains with tilted external magnetic field have also been studied.

abstract: Theory of quantum measurements is often classified as decision theory. An event in decision theory corresponds to the measurement of an observable. This analogy looks clear for operationally testable simple events. However, the situation is essentially more complicated in the case of composite events. The most difficult point is the relation between decisions under uncertainty and measurements under uncertainty. We suggest a unified language for describing the processes of quantum decision making and quantum measurements. The notion of quantum measurements under uncertainty is introduced. We show that the correct mathematical foundation for the theory of measurements under uncertainty, as well as for quantum decision theory dealing with uncertain events, requires the use of positive operator-valued measure that is a generalization of projection-valued measure. The latter is appropriate for operationally testable events, while the former is necessary for characterizing operationally uncertain events. In both decision making and quantum measurements, one has to distinguish composite non-entangled events from composite entangled events. Quantum probability can be essentially different from classical probability only for entangled events. The necessary condition for the appearance of an interference term in the quantum probability is the occurrence of entangled prospects and the existence of an entangled strategic state of a decision maker or of an entangled statistical state of a measuring device.

abstract: Radiative corrections to an atom are calculated near a half-space with arbitrarily-shaped small depositions upon its surface. This is achieved by finding the Green's function of the macroscopic Maxwell equations near an arbitrarily perturbed half-space using a Born series expansion about the bare half-space Green's function. We then use results the formalism of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to carry this over into the quantum picture. We demonstrate the broad utility of the calculated Green's function by using it to calculate two quantities --- the spontaneous decay rate of an atom near a sharp surface feature, and the Casimir-Polder potential of a finite grating deposited on a substrate. We find qualitatively new behaviour in both cases, especially in the latter where it is found that the periodicity of the Casimir-Polder potential persists even outside the immediate vicinity of the grating.

abstract: Cavity-optomechanics, a rapidly developing area of research, has made a remarkable progress. A stunning manifestation of optomechanical phenomena is in exploiting the mechanical effects of light to couple the optical degree of freedom with mechanical degree of freedom. In this report, we investigate the controlled bistable dynamics of such hybrid optomechanical system composed of cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside high-finesse optical cavity with one moving-end mirror and is driven by a single mode optical field. The numerical results provide evidence for controlled optical bistability in optomechanics using transverse optical field which directly interacts with atoms causing the coupling of transverse field with momentum side modes, exited by intra-cavity field. This technique of transverse field coupling is also used to control bistable dynamics of both moving-end mirror and BEC. The report provides an understanding of temporal dynamics of moving-end mirror and BEC with respect to transverse field. Moreover, dependence of effective potential of the system on transverse field has also been discussed. To observe this phenomena in laboratory, we have suggested a certain set of experimental parameters. These findings provide a platform to investigate the tunable behavior of novel phenomenon like electromagnetically induced transparency and entanglement in hybrid systems.

A central question that is repeatedly asked is whether quantum features of the evolution can survive over the long time-scales used for quantum annealing relative to standard measures of the decoherence time. We reconsider the role of decoherence in adiabatic quantum computation and quantum annealing using the adiabatic quantum master equation formalism. We restrict ourselves to the weak-coupling and singular-coupling limits, which correspond to decoherence in the energy eigenbasis and in the computational basis, respectively. We demonstrate that decoherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis does not necessarily detrimentally affect adiabatic quantum computation, and in particular that a short single-qubit $T_2$ time need not imply adverse consequences for the success of the quantum adiabatic algorithm. We further demonstrate that boundary cancellation methods, designed to improve the fidelity of adiabatic quantum computing in the closed system setting, remain beneficial in the open system setting. To address the high computational cost of master equation simulations, we also demonstrate that a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that explicitly accounts for a thermal bosonic bath can be used to interpolate between classical and quantum annealing. Our study highlights and clarifies the significantly different role played by decoherence in the adiabatic and circuit models of quantum computing.

abstract: We design composite two-qubit gates, based on the Ising-type interaction. The gates are robust against systematic errors in the qubits' interaction strength and the gate's implementation time. We give composite sequences, which cancel the error up to 6th order, and give a method to achieve even higher accuracy. Our sequences can compensate either relative or absolute errors. For relative error compensation the number of the ingredient gates grows linearly with the desired accuracy, while for absolute compensation only two gates are required to achieve infinitely accurate gates. We also consider an ion-trap implementation of our composite gates, where our sequences achieve simultaneous cancellation of the error in both the pulse area and the detuning.

abstract: Two-level quantum systems, qubits, are not the only basis for quantum computation. Advantages exist in using qudits, d-level quantum systems, as the basic carrier of quantum information. We show that colour codes---a class of topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties---can be generalised to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in three spatial dimensions a qubit colour code can support a transversal non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K\"onig's bound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques, an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state distillation. We show that the qudit colour code can support the qudit analogues of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a colour code can support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be proven to saturate Bravyi and K\"onig's bound in all but a finite number of special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be of independent interest. For completeness, we show explicitly that the qudit colour codes generalise to gauge colour codes, and share the many of the favourable properties of their qubit counterparts.

abstract: We propose a simplified mathematical construction of the quantum Fourier transform which is suited for systems described by Ising-type Hamiltonians. By contrast to the standard scheme, which prescribes concatenated sequences of control phase gates, our implementation is based on one-qubit gates and a free evolution process. We show a realization of our method with homogeneous microwave driven ion traps in a magnetic field with gradient. In this setup our implementation presents a series of microwave $\pi$ or $\pi/2$ pulses applied at certain times.

abstract: Motivated by realistic scattering processes of composite systems, we study the dynamics of a two-particle bound system which is scattered at a mirror. The physics of the scattering process will be discussed in the cases when only one particle interacts directly with the mirror and when both particles are scattered directly. It is shown that the coherence between the transmitted and the reflected wave-packet becomes reduced due to the scattering process. When both particles interact directly with the mirror, the system exhibits long-lived resonances. The results should be of interest for interference experiments with composite systems.

abstract: Exact measurement of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(t)$ of a light source is essential when investigating the photon statistics and the light generation process of the source. For a stationary single-mode light source, Mandel Q factor is directly related to $g^{(2)}(t)$. For a large mean photon number in the mode, the deviation of $g^{(2)}(t)$ from unity is so small that even a tiny error in measuring $g^{(2)}(t)$ would result in an inaccurate Mandel Q. In this work, we have found that detector dead time can induce a serious error in $g^{(2)}(t)$ and thus in Mandel Q in those cases even in a two-detector configuration. Our finding contradicts the conventional understanding that detector dead time would not affect $g^{(2)}(t)$ in two-detector configurations. Utilizing the cavity-QED microlaser, a well-established sub-Poissonian light source, we measured $g^{(2)}(t)$ with two different types of photodetectors with different dead time. We also introduced prolonged dead time by intentionally deleting the photodetection events following a preceding one within a specified time interval. We found that the observed Q of the cavity-QED microlaser was underestimated by 19% with respect to the dead-time-free Q when its mean photon number was about 600. We derived an analytic formula which well explains the behavior of the $g^{(2)}(t)$ as a function of the dead time.

abstract: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a powerful tool for generating exactly solvable potentials departing from a given initial one. In this article the first- and second- order supersymmetric transformations will be used to obtain new exactly solvable potentials departing from the complex oscillator. The corresponding Hamiltonians turn out to be ruled by polynomial Heisenberg algebras. By applying a mechanism to reduce to second the order of these algebras, the connection with the Painlev\'{e} IV equation is achieved, thus giving place to new solutions for the Painlev\'{e} IV equation.

Here we extend on our previous work to discuss further details of the numerics and analysis methodology utilised, and compare the results directly to new tomographic photoelectron measurements, which provide a more sensitive test of the validity of the results. In so doing we discuss in detail the physics of the photoionziation process, and suggest various avenues and prospects for this coherent multiplexing methodology.

abstract: Photoelectron interferograms, manifested in photoelectron angular distributions (PADs), are a high-information, coherent observable. In order to obtain the maximum information from angle-resolved photoionization experiments it is desirable to record the full, 3D, photoelectron momentum distribution. Here we apply tomographic reconstruction techniques to obtain such 3D distributions from multiphoton ionization of potassium atoms, and fully analyse the energy and angular content of the 3D data. The PADs obtained as a function of energy indicate good agreement with previous 2D data and detailed analysis [Hockett et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 223001 (2014)] over the main spectral features, but also indicate unexpected symmetry-breaking in certain regions of momentum space, thus revealing additional continuum interferences which cannot otherwise be observed. These observations reflect the presence of additional ionization pathways and, most generally, illustrate the power of maximum information measurements of this coherent observable.

abstract: We introduce a hybrid qubit based on a semiconductor nanowire with an epitaxially grown superconductor layer. Josephson energy of the transmon-like device ("gatemon") is controlled by an electrostatic gate that depletes carriers in a semiconducting weak link region. Strong coupling to an on-chip microwave cavity and coherent qubit control via gate voltage pulses is demonstrated, yielding reasonably long relaxation times (0.8 {\mu}s) and dephasing times (1 {\mu}s), exceeding gate operation times by two orders of magnitude, in these first-generation devices. Because qubit control relies on voltages rather than fluxes, dissipation in resistive control lines is reduced, screening reduces crosstalk, and the absence of flux control allows operation in a magnetic field, relevant for topological quantum information.

abstract: We present a gauge-invariant effective action for the Abelian Higgs model (scalar electrodynamics) with a chemical potential $\mu$ on a 1+1 dimensional lattice. This formulation provides an expansion in the hopping parameter $\kappa$ which we test with Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of the inverse gauge coupling $\beta_{pl}$ and small values of the scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. In the opposite limit of infinitely large $\lambda$, the partition function can be written as a traced product of local tensors which allows us to write exact blocking formulas. Their numerical implementation requires truncations but there is no sign problem for arbitrary values of $\mu$. We show that the time continuum limit of the blocked transfer matrix can be obtained numerically and, in the limit of infinite $\beta_{pl}$ and with a spin-1 truncation, the small volume energy spectrum is identical to the low energy spectrum of a two-species Bose-Hubbard model in the limit of large onsite repulsion. We extend this procedure for finite $\beta_{pl}$ and derive a spin-1 approximation of the Hamiltonian. It involves new terms corresponding to transitions among the two species in the Bose-Hubbard model. We propose an optical lattice implementation involving a ladder structure.

abstract: Matter-wave interferometers utilizing non-identical elements intrinsically have different sensitivities, and the analysis tools available until now are insufficient for accurately estimating the atomic phase difference under many experimental conditions. In this work, we describe and demonstrate two new methods for extracting the differential phase between dual-species atom interferometers for precise tests of the weak equivalence principle. The first method is a generalized Bayesian analysis, which uses knowledge of the system noise to estimate the differential phase based on a statistical model. The second method utilizes a mechanical accelerometer to reconstruct single-sensor interference fringes based on measurements of the vibration-induced phase. An improved ellipse-fitting algorithm is also implemented as a third method for comparison. These analysis tools are investigated using both numerical simulations and experimental data from simultaneous $^{87}$Rb and $^{39}$K interferometers, and both new techniques are shown to produce bias-free estimates of the differential phase. We also report observations of phase correlations between atom interferometers composed of different elemental species. This correlation enables us to reject common-mode vibration noise by a factor of 730, and we study the level of rejection by varying the temporal overlap between interferometers in a symmetric timing sequence. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the new analysis methods for future applications of differential atom interferometry.

Our approach enables the study of the versatile coherence properties of the system. We apply the model to exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. Our results demonstrate the onset of macroscopic occupation in the lowest-energy mode accompanied by the establishment of both temporal and spatial coherence. We show that temporal coherence exhibits a transition from a thermal to coherent statistics and the spatial coherence reveals off-diagonal long-range order.

abstract: Ultra-precise optical clocks in space will allow new studies in fundamental physics and astronomy. Within an European Space Agency (ESA) program, the Space Optical Clocks (SOC) project aims to install and to operate an optical lattice clock on the International Space Station (ISS) towards the end of this decade. It would be a natural follow-on to the ACES mission, improving its performance by at least one order of magnitude. The payload is planned to include an optical lattice clock, as well as a frequency comb, a microwave link, and an optical link for comparisons of the ISS clock with ground clocks located in several countries and continents. Within the EU-FP7-SPACE-2010-1 project no. 263500, during the years 2011-2015 a compact, modular and robust strontium lattice optical clock demonstrator has been developed. Goal performance is a fractional frequency instability below 1x10^{-15}, tau^{-1/2} and a fractional inaccuracy below 5x10^{-17}. Here we describe the current status of the apparatus' development, including the laser subsystems. Robust preparation of cold {88}^Sr atoms in a second stage magneto-optical trap (MOT) is achieved.

abstract: We report the realization of quantum microwave circuits using hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson elements comprised of InAs nanowires contacted by NbTiN. Capacitively-shunted single elements behave as transmon qubits with electrically tunable transition frequencies. Two-element circuits also exhibit transmon-like behavior near zero applied flux, but behave as flux qubits at half the flux quantum, where non-sinusoidal current-phase relations in the elements produce a double-well Josephson potential. These hybrid Josephson elements are promising for applications requiring microwave superconducting circuits operating in magnetic field.

We obtain analytic results for free-fermion systems that not only confirm previous numerical results, but also elucidate the exact relationships between the various physical properties of the bulk and boundary systems. Our analytic results allow us to study the asymptotic properties that are difficult to probe numerically, such as the near horizon regime of the black hole geometry. We shall also explore a few interesting but hitherto unexplored bulk geometries, such as that corresponding to a boundary critical fermion with nontrivial dynamic critical exponent. Our analytic framework also allows us to study the holographic mapping of some of these boundary theories in dimensions 2+1 or higher.

abstract: We present a fully analytically solvable family of models with many-body cluster interaction and Ising interaction. This family exhibits two phases, dubbed cluster and Ising phases, respectively. The critical point turns out to be independent of the cluster size $n+2$ and is reached exactly when both interactions are equally weighted. For even $n$ we prove that the cluster phase corresponds to a nematic ordered phase and in the case of odd $n$ to a symmetry protected topological ordered phase. Though complex, we are able to quantify the multi-particle entanglement content of neighboring spins. We prove that there exists no bipartite or, in more detail, no $n+1$-partite entanglement. This is possible since the non-trivial symmetries of the Hamiltonian restrict the state space. Indeed, only if the Ising interaction is strong enough (local) genuine $n+2$-partite entanglement is built up. Due to their analytically solvableness the $n$-cluster-Ising models serve as a prototype for studying non trivial-spin orderings and due to their peculiar entanglement properties as a potential reference system for the performance of quantum information tasks.

abstract: We experimentally test the fractal Weyl law by counting whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in the transmission spectrum of a deformed microcavity, as a function of the openness of the system. These high-Q WGMs are excited indirectly but efficiently by a laser beam via dynamical tunneling, and provide information on the number of chaotic states that live inside the cavity, while the openness is controlled by varying the size of a high-index silicon pillar underneath the low-index silica microtoroid. A fractal Weyl law describing the number of quasibound chaotic states well captures our data, whereas we find significant deviations from a Random-Matrix-Theory-based prediction, which is ascribed to the ballistic decay of the rays occurring within Ehrenfest time.

abstract: Combating the effects of disorder on light transport in micro- and nano-integrated photonic devices is of major importance from both fundamental and applied viewpoints. In ordinary waveguides, imperfections and disorder cause unwanted back-reflections, which hinder large-scale optical integration. Topological photonic structures, a new class of optical systems inspired by quantum Hall effect and topological insulators, can realize robust transport via topologically-protected unidirectional edge modes. Such waveguides are realized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a two-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable one-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route toward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices, in which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the non-Hermitian nature of transport. While a forward propagating mode in the lattice is amplified, the corresponding backward propagating mode is damped, thus resulting in an asymmetric transport that is rather insensitive to disorder in the structure. The idea of non-Hermitian robust transport is exemplified in the simplest case of an 'imaginary' gauge field for photons using an engineered coupled-resonator optical waveguide (CROW) structure.

Using this system we have demonstrated trap lifetimes exceeding several days, attonewton force detection capability, and wide tunability in trapping and cooling parameters. Measurements have been performed with charged and neutral beads to calibrate the sensitivity of the detector. This work establishes the suitability of dual beam optical dipole traps for precision force measurement in high vacuum with long averaging times, and enables future applications including the study of gravitational inverse square law violations at short range, Casimir forces, acceleration sensing, and quantum opto-mechanics.
