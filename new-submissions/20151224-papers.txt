abstract: We theoretically investigate the probe field transmission in an optomechanical cavity setup with Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), where the standing wave that forms in the cavity results in an one-dimensional optical lattice potential. We report that in the presence of atom-atom interactions, the coupling of the cavity field with condensate (Bogoliubov mode), the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations leads to the emergence of the tunable Fano resonances in the probe absorption spectrum. Within the experimental reach, based on analytical and numerical simulations, we find that the optomechanical system with BEC provides great flexibility to tune the Fano resonances, as the width of the resonance is controllable by the coupling field and additionally, with the atom-atom interaction. Moreover, Fano resonances are analyzed for the fluctuations of the cavity field and the fluctuations of the condensate with finite atomic two-body interaction, which shows an excellent compatibility with the original Fano resonances as discovered by Ugo Fano. Furthermore, the occurrence of slow light in the probe transmission is explained. It is shown that slow light effect can be enhanced by increasing the atom-atom interaction, It is shown that slow light effect can be enhanced by increasing the atom-atom interaction, which offers a road map towards the realization of on-demand quantum optomechanical memories.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of a weak probe field in hybrid optomechanics with a single three-level ($\Lambda$-type) atomic system. We report that, in the presence of optomechanical coupling and two transition coupling parameters of three-level atom (TLA), there occurs three distinct multiple EIT windows in the probe absorption spectrum. Moreover, the switching of multiple windows into double and single EIT windows can be obtained by suitably tuning the system parameters. Furthermore, the probe transmission spectrum have been studied. Based on our analytical and numerical work, we explain the occurrence of slow and fast light (superluminal) regimes, and enhancement of superluminal behaviour in the probe field transmission. This work demonstrates great potential in multi-channel waveguide, fiber optics and classical communication networks, multi-channel quantum information processing, real quality imaging, cloaking devices and delay lines & optical buffers for telecommunication.

abstract: We present a model of discrete quantum evolution based on quantum correlations between the evolving system and a reference quantum clock system. A quantum circuit for the model is provided, which in the case of a constant Hamiltonian is able to represent the evolution over $2^n$ time steps in terms of just $n$ time qubits and $n$ control gates. We then introduce the concept of system-time entanglement as a measure of distinguishable quantum evolution, based on the entanglement between the system and the reference clock. This quantity vanishes for stationary states and is maximum for systems jumping onto a new orthogonal state at each time step. In the case of a constant Hamiltonian it is a measure of the spread over distinct energy eigenstates, satisfying an energy-time uncertainty relation. The evolution of mixed states is also examined. Simple analytical expressions for the basic case of a qubit clock are as well provided.

abstract: Both simulated quantum annealing and physical quantum annealing have shown the emergence of "heavy tails" in their performance as optimizers: The total time needed to solve a set of random input instances is dominated by a small number of very hard instances. Classical simulated annealing, in contrast, does not show such heavy tails. Here we explore the origin of these heavy tails, which appear for inputs with high local degeneracy---large isoenergetic clusters of states in Hamming space. This category includes the low-precision Chimera-structured problems studied in recent benchmarking work comparing the D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor with simulated annealing. On similar inputs designed to suppress local degeneracy, performance of a quantum annealing processor on hard instances improves by orders of magnitude at the 512-qubit scale, while classical performance remains relatively unchanged. Simulations indicate that perturbative crossings are the primary factor contributing to these heavy tails, while sensitivity to Hamiltonian misspecification error plays a less significant role in this particular setting.

abstract: We report on image processing techniques and experimental procedures to determine the lattice-site positions of single atoms in an optical lattice with high reliability, even for limited acquisition time or optical resolution. Determining the positions of atoms beyond the diffraction limit relies on parametric deconvolution in close analogy to methods employed in super-resolution microscopy. We develop a deconvolution method that makes effective use of the prior knowledge of the optical transfer function, noise properties, and discreteness of the optical lattice. We show that accurate knowledge of the image formation process enables a dramatic improvement on the localization reliability. This is especially relevant for closely packed ensembles of atoms where the separation between particles cannot be directly optically resolved. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimental methods to precisely reconstruct the point spread function with sub-pixel resolution from fluorescence images of single atoms, and we give a mathematical foundation thereof. We also discuss discretized image sampling in pixel detectors and provide a quantitative model of noise sources in electron multiplying CCD cameras.

We show that the problem can be mapped in effective Schrodinger equations for a component of the DKP spinor. An oscillatory transmission coefficient is found and there is total reflection. Additionally, the energy spectrum of bound states is obtained and reveals the Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect, for specific conditions the potential lodges bound states of particles and antiparticles. Comments about the vector bosons problem subject to square potentials are present.

abstract: Here we study how the optical response of cold atomic environments is transformed by the motion of atoms at room temperature and consequently characterize the optimal performance of room temperature quantum light-matter interfaces. Our findings enable us to attain complete quantum memory operation for polarization qubits in a warm $^{87}$Rb atomic vapor with an average fidelity of $86.6\pm 0.6\%$, thereby defeating any classical strategy exploiting the non-unitary character of the memory efficiency. Our system significantly decreases the technological overhead required to achieve quantum memory operation and will serve as a building block for scalable and technologically simpler many-memory quantum machines.

Here we demonstrate coupling of erbium dopant ions in yttrium orthosilicate to a photonic crystal cavity fabricated directly in the host crystal using focused ion beam milling. The coupling leads to reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and enhancement of the optical depth in microns-long devices, which will enable on-chip quantum memories.

abstract: Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two parties, when measured suitably achieve the maximum non-local correlations allowed by quantum mechanics. Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013) proved the converse. They showed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated measurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor product of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured according to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a high price, it requires a large overhead in the number of entangled pairs and measurements. In this paper we prove an analogous statement for quantum steering correlations, where in this case, the device of one side is trusted. We first demonstrate a practical one-sided device-independent version of self-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of two parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to constant factors leading to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As an application of this result we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable delegated quantum computation, with quadratic overhead, and compare it to other existing protocols. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification protocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.

abstract: We present a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a hierarchical approach to mapping a quantum algorithm while sharing physical and logical ancilla qubits. Each core is capable of performing any quantum instruction. Moreover, we introduce a scalable quantum mapper, called Squash 2, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of quantum modules---each module is divided into k parts such that each part will run on one of k available cores. Experimental results demonstrate that Squash~2 can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.

abstract: Incompatible observables can be approximated by compatible observables in joint measurement or measured sequentially, with constrained accuracy as implied by Heisenberg's original formulation of the uncertainty principle. Recently, Busch, Lahti, and Werner proposed inaccuracy trade-off relations based on statistical distances between probability distributions of measurement outcomes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 160405 (2013); Phys. Rev. A 89, 012129 (2014)]. Here we reform their theoretical framework, derive an improved relation for qubit measurement, and perform an experimental test on a spin system. The relation reveals that the worst-case inaccuracy is tightly bounded from below by the incompatibility of target observables, and is verified by the experiment employing joint measurement in which two compatible but typically non-commutative observables on one qubit are measured simultaneously.

abstract: We study electric quantum walks in two dimensions considering Grover, Alternate, Hadamard, and DFT quantum walks. In the Grover walk the behaviour under an electric field is easy to summarize: when the field direction coincides with the x or y axes, it produces a transient trapping of the probability distribution along the direction of the field, while when it is directed along the diagonals, a perfect 2D trapping is frustrated. The analysis of the alternate walk helps to understand the behaviour of the Grover walk as both walks are partially equivalent; in particular, it helps to understand the role played by the existence of conical intersections in the dispersion relations, as we show that when these are removed a perfect 2D trapping can occur for suitable directions of the field. We complete our study with the electric DFT and Hadamard walks in 2D, showing that the latter can exhibit perfect 2D trapping.

abstract: The implementation and engineering of bright and coherent solid state quantum light sources is key for the realization of both on chip and remote quantum networks. Despite tremendous efforts for more than 15 years, the combination of these two key prerequisites in a single, potentially scalable device is a major challenge. Here, we report on the observation of bright and coherent single photon emission generated via pulsed, resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot (QD) deterministically centered in a micropillar cavity device via cryogenic optical lithography. The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the pillar, leading to an overall device efficiency of $\eta=(74\pm4)~\%$ for a single photon emission as pure as $g^{(2)}(0)=0.0092\pm0.0004$. The combination of large Purcell enhancement and resonant pumping conditions allows us to observe a two-photon wave packet overlap up to $\nu=(88\pm3)~\%$

abstract: We consider the usage of dynamical decoupling in quantum metrology, where the joint evolution of system plus environment is described by a Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that by ultra-fast unitary control operations acting locally only on system qubits, essentially all kinds of noise can be eliminated. This is done in such a way that the desired evolution is reduced by at most a constant factor, leading to Heisenberg scaling. The only exception is noise that is generated by the Hamiltonian to be estimated itself. However, even for such parallel noise, one can achieve an improved scaling as compared to the standard quantum limit for any local noise by means of symmetrization.

abstract: Control at the interface between the classical and the quantum world is fundamental in quantum physics. In particular, how classical control is enhanced by coherence effects is an important question both from a theoretical as well as from a technological point of view. In this work, we establish a resource theory describing this setting and explore relations to the theory of coherence, entanglement and information processing. Specifically, for the coherent control of quantum systems the relevant resources of entanglement and coherence are found to be equivalent and closely related to a measure of discord. The results are then applied to the DQC1 protocol and the precision of the final measurement is expressed in terms of the available resources.

Due to optical interference, extremely large optomechanical coupling of the membrane relative motion is achieved when the two membranes are placed very close to a resonance of the inner cavity formed by the two membranes, and in the limit of highly reflective membranes. The upper bound of the coupling strength is given by the optomechanical coupling associated with the much shorter inner cavity, consistently with the analysis of A. Xuereb et al., Phys. Rev.

abstract: $ $In its usual form, Grover's quantum search algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries and $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$ other elementary gates to find a solution in an $N$-bit database. Grover in 2002 showed how to reduce the number of other gates to $O(\sqrt{N}\log\log N)$ for the special case where the database has a unique solution, without significantly increasing the number of queries. We show how to reduce this further to $O(\sqrt{N}\log^{(r)} N)$ gates for any constant $r$, and sufficiently large $N$. This means that, on average, the gates between two queries barely touch more than a constant number of the $\log N$ qubits on which the algorithm acts. For a very large $N$ that is a power of 2, we can choose $r$ such that the algorithm uses essentially the minimal number $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ of queries, and only $O(\sqrt{N}\log(\log^{\star} N))$ other gates.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.07605
abstract: The so-called NOON states are quantum optical resources known to be useful especially for quantum lithography and metrology. At the same time, they are known to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce experimentally. Concerning the former, here we present a scheme where NOON states are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes against photon losses, thus demonstrating that such resources can also be useful to suppress the effect of loss. Our NOON-code is an exact code that can be systematically extended from one-photon to higher-number losses. Its loss scaling depending on the codeword photon number is the same as for some existing, exact loss codes such as bosonic and quantum parity codes, but its codeword mode number is intermediate between that of the other codes. Another generalisation of the NOON-code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead of logical qubits. While, in general, the final codewords are always obtainable from multi-mode NOON states through application of beam splitters, both codewords for the one-photon-loss qubit NOON-code can be simply created from single-photon states with beam splitters. We give various examples and also discuss a potential application of our qudit code for quantum communication.

abstract: Quantum superposition in mechanical systems is not only a key evidence of macroscopic quantum coherence, but can also be utilized in modern quantum technology. Here we propose an efficient approach for creating macroscopically distinct mechanical superposition states in a two-mode optomechanical system. Photon hopping between the two cavity modes is modulated sinusoidally. The modulated photon tunneling enables an ultrastrong radiation-pressure force acting on the mechanical resonator, and hence significantly increases the mechanical displacement induced by a single photon. We present systematic studies on the generation of the Yurke-Stoler-like states in the presence of system dissipations. The state generation method is general and it can be implemented with either optomechanical or electromechanical systems.

abstract: We show that the magnetic component of the photon field produced by dark matter axions via the two-photon coupling mechanism in a Sikivie Haloscope is an important parameter passed over in previous analysis and experiments. The interaction of the produced photons will be resonantly enhanced as long as they couple to the electric or magnetic mode structure of the Haloscope cavity. For typical Haloscope experiments the electric and magnetic coupling is the same and implicitly assumed in past sensitivity calculations. However, for future planned searches such as those at high frequency, which synchronize multiple cavities, the sensitivity will be altered due to different magnetic and electric couplings. We discuss the implications of the full electromagnetic form factor and propose new experiments using lumped 3D LC resonators (or re-entrant cavities) with separated electric and magnetic fields to probe currently unbounded regions of the axion mass parameter space.

abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is notorious for the absence of gradient corrections to the two-dimensional (2D) Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy functional; it is widely accepted that the 2D analog of the 3D von Weizs\"acker correction vanishes, together with all higher-order corrections. Contrary to this long-held belief, we show that the leading correction to the kinetic energy does not vanish, is unambiguous, and contributes perturbatively to the total energy. This insight emerges naturally in a simple extension of standard DFT, which has the effective potential energy as a functional variable on equal footing with the single-particle density.

abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) is currently a hot issue of interacting systems, in which quantum mechanics overcomes thermalization of statistical mechanics. Like Anderson localization of non-interacting electrons, disorders are usually crucial in engineering the quantum interference in MBL. For a translation invariant system, however, the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) due to a \emph{pure} many-body quantum effect is still unclear. Here we demonstrate an MBL phenomenon without disorder, which emerges in a lightly doped Hubbard model at very strong interaction. By means of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) numerical calculation on a square lattice two-leg ladder, we show that whereas a single hole can induce a mobile Nagaoka polaron with a very large mass, two holes, three holes, and many holes, will form bound pair/droplets which are all localized excitations with flat bands. We further identify the underlying mechanism for this MBL as due to a novel `Berry phase' of the doped Mott insulator, and show that by turning off this Berry phase either by increasing the anisotropy of the model or by hand, an eigenstate transition from the MBL to a conventional quasiparticle phase can be realized in the charge sector.

abstract: Since its introduction by Hastings in [10], the technique of quasi-adiabatic continuation has become a central tool in the discussion and classification of ground state phases. It connects the ground states of self-adjoint Hamiltonians in the same phase by a unitary quasi-local transformation. This paper takes a step towards extending this result to non- self adjoint perturbations, though, for technical reason, we restrict ourselves here to weak perturbations of non-interacting spins. The extension to non-self adjoint perturbation is important for potential applications to Glauber dynamics (and its quantum analogues). In contrast to the standard quasi-adiabatic transformation, the transformation constructed here is exponentially local. Our scheme is inspired by KAM theory, with frustration-free operators playing the role of integrable Hamiltonians.
