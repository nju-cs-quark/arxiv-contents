abstract: Every finite-time transformation results in some production of entropy, which signals the occurrence of irreversibility. Quantifying the amount of irreversible entropy produced is a goal of paramount importance: it is a key quantity for the characterisation of non-equilibrium processes, and its minimisation improves the efficiency of thermal machines. So far, nanoscale systems have been used for the experimental study of classical out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, irreversible entropy production arising from quantum dynamics in mesoscopic quantum systems has not been experimentally investigated yet. In this work we measure the rate of entropy produced by an open quantum system in a non-equilibrium steady state for two different experimental setups: a micro-mechanical resonator and a Bose-Einstein condensate. Each of them is coupled to a high finesse cavity and hence subject also to optical losses. We find excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions of a framework that we develop for the open dynamics of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. Key features of our setups, such as the cooling of the mechanical resonator and signatures of a structural quantum phase transition in the condensate are reflected in the entropy production rates. Our work demonstrates the possibility to explore non-equilibrium thermodynamics in driven mesoscopic quantum systems, and paves the way to a systematic experimental assessment of the implications of out-of-equilibrium processes on such systems.

abstract: Considerable work has recently been directed toward developing resource theories of quantum coherence. In most approaches, a state is said to possess quantum coherence if it is not diagonal in some specified basis. In this letter we establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory in terms of physical implementation of the free operations, and we show that all currently proposed basis-dependent theories of coherence fail to satisfy this criterion. We further characterize the physically consistent resource theory of coherence and find its operational power to be quite limited. After relaxing the condition of physical consistency, we introduce the class of dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, present a number of new coherent monotones based on relative R\'{e}nyi entropies, and study incoherent state transformations under different operational classes. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for qubit state transformations and show these conditions hold for all classes of incoherent operations.

abstract: The difficulty of explaining non-local correlations in a fixed causal structure sheds new light on the old debate on whether space and time are to be seen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has a number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on a causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic, physically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length minus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov complexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing machine generate this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for the example of non-local correlations: We end up with a reasoning that leads to similar conclusions but is more direct than in the probabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually all be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same context-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Refining this, we end up with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings in terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical consistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a constraint than the latter in the multi-party case.

abstract: We design and analyze a simple on-chip photonic circuit that can form a universal building block of a quantum network. The circuit consists of a single-photon source, and two quantum emitters positioned in two arms of an on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer composed of waveguides with chiral light--matter interfaces. The efficient chiral light--matter interaction allows the emitters to act as photon sources to herald internode entanglement, and to perform high-fidelity intranode two-qubit gates within a single chip without any need for reconfiguration. We show that by connecting multiple circuits of this kind into a quantum network, it is possible to perform universal quantum computation with heralded two-qubit gate fidelities ${\cal F} \sim 0.998$ achievable in state-of-the-art quantum dot systems.

abstract: Quantum teleportation faithfully transfers a quantum state between distant nodes in a network, enabling revolutionary information processing applications. Here we report teleporting quantum states over a 30 km optical fiber network with the input single photon state and the EPR state prepared independently. By buffering photons in 10 km coiled optical fiber, we perform Bell state measurement after entanglement distribution. With active feed-forward operation, the average quantum state fidelity and quantum process fidelity are measured to be 0.85 and 0.77, exceeding classical limits of 0.67 and 0.5, respectively. The statistical hypothesis test shows that the probability of a classical process to predict an average state fidelity no less than the one observed in our experiment is less than 2.4E-14, confirming the quantum nature of our quantum teleportation experiment. Our experiment marks a critical step towards the realization of quantum internet in the future.

abstract: Sextic polynomial oscillator is probably the best known quantum system which is partially exactly {\it alias} quasi-exactly solvable (QES), i.e., which possesses closed-form, elementary-function bound states $\psi(x)$ at certain couplings and energies. In contrast, the apparently simpler and phenomenologically more important quartic polynomial oscillator is {\em not\,} QES. A resolution of the paradox is proposed: The one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation is shown QES after the analyticity-violating symmetrization $V(x)=A|x|+B x^2+C|x|^3+x^4$ of the quartic polynomial potential.

abstract: Quantum estimation theory can be divided into state estimation, noiseless channel estimation and noisy channel estimation. Furthermore, estimation strategies can be classified as either one-step or two-step strategies. The quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has often been used as a figure of merit for quantum metrological schemes, is not attainable for noiseless channel estimation problems by two-step strategy. Hence the figures of merit for noiseless channel estimation problems and the optimal strategy to attain the minimum error are yet to be investigated thoroughly. In this manuscript, we investigate noiseless channel estimation using a periodic error function, and present optimal states. We propose the experimental generation of the optimal states for enhanced metrology using squeezing transformations.

abstract: Thermodynamics of trajectories promises a path to thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of an open quantum system, a sought-after goal in modern physics. Unfortunately, calculation of the relevant quantities presents severe challenges. Determining the large-deviation function that gives access to the full counting statistics associated with a dynamical order parameter is challenging, if not impossible, even for systems evolving in a restricted Liouville space. Acting on the realizaion that the salient features of most dynamical systems are encoded in the first few moments of the counting statistics, in this article we present a method that gives sequential access to these moments. Our method allows for obtaining analytical result in several cases, as we illustrate, and allows using large deviation theory to reinterpret certain well-known results.

abstract: Quantum steering enables one party to communicate with another remote party even if the sender is untrusted. Such characteristics of quantum systems not only provide direct applications to quantum information science, but are also conceptually important for distinguishing between quantum and classical resources. While concrete illustrations of steering have been shown in several experiments, how steering effects vary with the system dimensionality (d) has never been experimentally investigated. Here, we introduce a simple method to experimentally certify two different kinds of quantum steering: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and single-system (SS) steering, for dimensionality up to d=16. The former reveals the steerability among bipartite systems, whereas the latter manifests itself in single quantum objects. We use multidimensional steering witnesses to verify EPR steering of polarization-entangled pairs and SS steering of single photons. The ratios between the measured witnesses and the maximum values achieved by classical mimicries are observed to increase with d for both EPR and SS steering. The designed scenario offers a new method to study further the genuine multipartite steering of large dimensionality and potential uses in quantum information processing.

abstract: The accumulation of quantum phase in response to a signal is the central mechanism of quantum sensing, as such, loss of phase information presents a fundamental limitation. For this reason approaches to extend quantum coherence in the presence of noise are actively being explored. Here we experimentally protect a room-temperature hybrid spin register against environmental decoherence by performing repeated quantum error correction whilst maintaining sensitivity to signal fields. We use a long-lived nuclear spin to correct multiple phase errors on a sensitive electron spin in diamond and realize magnetic field sensing beyond the timescales set by natural decoherence. The universal extension of sensing time, robust to noise at any frequency, demonstrates the definitive advantage entangled multi-qubit systems provide for quantum sensing and offers an important complement to quantum control techniques. In particular, our work opens the door for detecting minute signals in the presence of high frequency noise, where standard protocols reach their limits.

abstract: Despite the impressive amount of literature on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the relevance of symmetry in interpretation is not properly acknowledged. In fact, although it is usually said that quantum mechanics is invariant under the Galilean group, the invariance is usually not discussed in the case of the interpretation of the theory. This situation is particularly pressing for realist positions, which want to know how reality would be if quantum mechanics were true. From a realist perspective, it seems reasonable to require that an interpretation of quantum mechanics, to be admissible, preserves the same symmetries of the theory. In this paper we will take a realist standpoint in order to study what physical constraints the Galilean group imposes on interpretation, and we will extrapolate the conclusions drawn for quantum mechanics to the case of quantum field theory.

abstract: The occurrence of entanglement sudden death in the evolution of a bipartite system depends on both the initial state and the channel responsible for the evolution. An extreme case is that of entanglement braking channels, which are channels that acting on only one of the subsystems drives them to full disentanglement regardless of the initial state. In general, one can find certain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both subsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the channel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this effect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when entanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an effective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our results allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death or not for a given evolution. An experiment with polarization entangled photons demonstrates the utility of this result in a variety of cases.

abstract: Experiments involving single or few elementary particles are completely described by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that quantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and the statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart from the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the microscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of uncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal variable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a symmetric role in the wave-function \Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built and analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \Psi (x,t) |^2, where the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is equivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of the discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \Psi (x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then we discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal wavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving single and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the spread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in two-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and temporal wavepackets.

This state plays an essential role in thermodynamics and serves as the initial condition for non-equilibrium dynamical simulations. We solve a long standing problem for computing the Gibbs state Wigner function with nearly machine accuracy by solving the Bloch equation directly in the phase space. Furthermore, the algorithm is provided yielding high quality Wigner distributions of pure stationary states. The developed numerical methods furnish a long-sought efficient computation framework for non-equilibrium quantum simulations directly in the Wigner representation.

abstract: Generating non-reciprocal radio frequency transduction plays important roles in a wide range of research and applications, and an aspiration is to integrate this functionality into micro-circuit without introducing magnetic field, which, however, remains challenging. By designing a 1D artificial lattice structure with neighbor-interaction engineered parametrically, we predicted a non-reciprocity transduction with giant unidirectionality. We then experimentally demonstrated the phenomenon on a nano-electromechanical chip fabricated by conventional complementary metal-silicon processing. A unidirectionality with isolation as high as 24dB is achieved and several different transduction schemes are realized by programming the control voltages topology. Apart from being used as a radio frequency isolator, the system provides a way to build practical on-chip programmable device for many researches and applications in radio frequency domain.

In particular, we explain how a curvature dependence of the collapse rate of such models could offer a dynamical justification for Penrose's conjecture. The present essay constitutes an extension of a previous proposal of ours that uses collapse theories in dealing with open problems in contemporary physical theories.

abstract: For some crystalline materials, a regime can be found where continuous ductile cutting is feasible. Using precision diamond turning, such materials can be cut into complex optical components with high surface quality and form accuracy. In this work we use diamond-turning to machine a monolithic, square-shaped, doubly-resonant $LiNbO_3$ cavity with two flat and two convex facets. When additional mild polishing is implemented, the Q-factor of the resonator is found to be limited only by the material absorption loss. We show how our monolithic square resonator may be operated as an optical parametric oscillator that is evanescently coupled to free-space beams via birefringent prisms. The prism arrangement allows for independent and large tuning of the fundamental and second harmonic coupling rates. We measure $2.6\pm0.5$ dB of vacuum squeezing at 1064 nm using our system. Potential improvements to obtain higher degrees of squeezing are discussed.

abstract: Integrated optics has brought unprecedented levels of stability and performance to quantum photonic circuits. However, integrated devices are not merely micron-scale equivalents of their bulk-optics counterparts. By exploiting the inherently dispersive characteristics of the integrated setting, such devices can play a remarkably more versatile role in quantum circuit architectures. We show this by examining the implications of linear dispersion in an ordinary directional coupler. Dispersion unlocks several novel capabilities for this device, including in-situ control over photon spectral and polarization entanglement, tunable photon time-ordering, and entanglement-sensitive two-photon coincidence generation. Also revealed is an ability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while tuning the interference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk-optics. The outcome of this work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that benefit from the advantages of integration. It also paves the way for re-evaluating the possibilities offered by dispersion in other on-chip devices.

abstract: The ability to transport quantum information across some distance can facilitate the design and operation of a quantum processor. One-dimensional spin chains provide a compact platform to realize scalable spin transport for a solid-state quantum computer. Here, we model odd-sized donor chains in silicon under a range of experimental non-idealities, including variability of donor position within the chain. We show that the tolerance against donor placement inaccuracies is greatly improved by operating the spin chain in a mode where the electrons are confined at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. We then estimate the required timescales and exchange couplings, and the level of noise that can be tolerated to achieve high fidelity transport. We also propose a protocol to calibrate and initialize the chain, thereby providing a complete guideline for realizing a functional donor chain and utilizing it for spin transport.

abstract: We present a new numerical system using classical finite elements with mesh adaptivity for computing stationary solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The programs are written as a toolbox for FreeFem++ (www.freefem.org), a free finite-element software available for all existing operating systems. This offers the advantage to hide all technical issues related to the implementation of the finite element method, allowing to easily implement various numerical algorithms.Two robust and optimised numerical methods were implemented to minimize the Gross-Pitaevskii energy: a steepest descent method based on Sobolev gradients and a minimization algorithm based on the state-of-the-art optimization library Ipopt. For both methods, mesh adaptivity strategies are implemented to reduce the computational time and increase the local spatial accuracy when vortices are present. Different run cases are made available for 2D and 3D configurations of Bose-Einstein condensates in rotation. An optional graphical user interface is also provided, allowing to easily run predefined cases or with user-defined parameter files. We also provide several post-processing tools (like the identification of quantized vortices) that could help in extracting physical features from the simulations. The toolbox is extremely versatile and can be easily adapted to deal with different physical models.

New results on the structure of the generalized scattering operators are derived. Interesting interrelations between dynamical and stationary cases are found for radial Schr\"odinger and Dirac equations, and for Dirac-type equations as well. For some important examples we explain why the well-known divergences in the higher order approximations of the scattering matrices do not appear in the "generalized wave operator" approach.

abstract: Bosons hopping across sites and interacting on-site are the essence of the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM). Inspired by the success of BHM simulators with atoms in optical lattices, proposals for implementing the BHM with photons in coupled nonlinear cavities have emerged. Two coupled semiconductor microcavities constitute a model system where the hopping, interaction, and decay of exciton polaritons --- mixed light-matter quasiparticles --- can be engineered in combination with site-selective coherent driving to implement the driven-dissipative two-site optical BHM. Here we explore the interplay of interference and nonlinearity in this system, in a regime where three distinct density profiles can be observed under identical driving conditions. We demonstrate how the phase acquired by polaritons hopping between cavities can be controlled through effective polariton-polariton interactions. Our results open new perspectives for synthesizing density-dependent gauge fields for polaritons in two-dimensional multicavity systems.

We investigate the spectrum of this dual operator with a focus on the different parameter regimes (chaotic, regular) of the spin chain. We present applications of this duality relation to spectral statistics in an accompanying paper.
