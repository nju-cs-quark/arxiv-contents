abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been extensively studied in various systems. However, it is not easy to observe in superconducting quantum circuits (SQCs), because the Rabi frequency of the strong controlling field corresponding to EIT is limited by the decay rates of the SQCs. Here, we show that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting circuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such a driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are approximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates of the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit states. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and so-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the qubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving field, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed. We choose a three-level system with $\Lambda$-type transitions in such a driven circuit QED system, and demonstrate how EIT and ATS can be realized in this compound system. We believe that this study will be helpful for EIT experiments using SQCs.

abstract: We report on efficient generation of second harmonic laser and single-mode vacuum squeezed light of 795 nm with periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystals. We achieved 111 mW of ultra-violet (UV) light at 397.5 nm from 191 mW of fundamental light with a PPKTP crystal in a doubling cavity, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 58.1%. Using the UV light to pump an optical parametric oscillator with a PPKTP crystal, we realized -5.6 dB of a maximum squeezing. We analyzed the pump power dependence of the squeezing level and concluded that the UV light induced losses limit the improvement of the squeezing level. The generated squeezed light has huge potential application in quantum memory and ultra-precise measurement.

abstract: We study decoherence in an interacting qubit system described by infinite range Heisenberg model (IRHM) in a situation where the system is coupled to a bath of local optical phonons. Using perturbation theory in polaron frame of reference, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that is valid in the regime of strong spin-phonon coupling under non-adiabatic conditions. It is shown that the effective Hamiltonian commutes with the IRHM upto leading orders of perturbation and thus has the same eigenstates as the IRHM. Using a quantum master equation with Markovian approximation of dynamical evolution, we show that the off diagonal elements of the density matrix donot decay in the energy eigen basis of IRHM.

title: Quantum measurements as weighted symmetry breaking processes: the hidden measurement perspective
authors: Diederik Aerts, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi
comments: 9 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.05222
abstract: The purpose of the present note is twofold. Firstly, we highlight the similarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional interpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's transactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement interpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry breaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of incipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain why the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born rule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a quantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure state to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently derived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI - precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative description of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden measurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of the values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of probabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide the missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However, EBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific notion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical mechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.

abstract: We investigate the influence of the photon statistics on the excitation dynamics of a single two level system. A single semiconductor quantum dot represents the two level system and is resonantly excited either with coherent laser light, or excited with chaotic light, with photon statistics corresponding to that of thermal radiation. Experimentally, we observe a reduced absorption cross-section under chaotic excitation in the steady-state. In the transient regime, the Rabi oscillations observable under coherent excitation disappear under chaotic excitation. Likewise, in the emission spectrum the well-known Mollow triplet, which we observe under coherent drive, disappears under chaotic excitation. Our observations are fully consistent with theoretical predictions based on the semi-classical Bloch equation approach. They represent a landmark in the resonant excitation of the quantum mechanical two level system.

abstract: Two well-known mechanisms, one-axis twisting (OAT) and two-axis countertwisting (TACT), generate spinsqueezed states dynamically. The latter provides better spin squeezing (SS) but has not been demonstrated as the form of its interaction does not occur naturally in known physical systems. Several proposals for realizing effective TACT transformed from OAT require stringent experimental conditions in order to overcome the resulting nonstationary (oscillating) SS and continuously varying mean spin directions. This work presents a simple scheme that solves both problems by freezing SS at an optimal point and realizing effectively persistent SS by inhibiting further squeezing dynamics. Explicit procedures are outlined for persistent SS of the TACT limit. Protocols based on our scheme favorably relax experimental demands, which significantly brighten the prospects for realizing TACT.

abstract: Measuring the thermodynamic properties of open quantum systems poses a major challenge. A calorimetric detection has been proposed as a feasible experimental scheme to measure work and fluctuation relations in open quantum systems. However, the detection requires a finite size for the environment, which influences the system dynamics. This process cannot be modeled with the standard stochastic approaches. We develop a quantum jump model suitable for systems coupled to a finite-size environment. With the method we study the common fluctuation relations and prove that they are satisfied.

abstract: We study the problem of detecting multipartite entanglement among indistinguishable fermionic particles. A multipartite concurrence for pure states of $N$ identical fermions, each one having a $d$-dimensional single-particle Hilbert space, is introduced. Such entanglement measure, in particular, is optimized for maximally entangled states of three identical fermions that play a role analogous to the usual (qubit) GHZ-state. In addition, it is shown that the fermionic multipartite concurrence can be expressed as the mean value of an observable, provided two copies of the composite state are available.

abstract: We examine the problem of finding the minimum number of Pauli measurements needed to uniquely determine an arbitrary $n$-qubit pure state among all quantum states. We show that only $11$ Pauli measurements are needed to determine an arbitrary two-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum state tomography with $16$ measurements, and only $31$ Pauli measurements are needed to determine an arbitrary three-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum state tomography with $64$ measurements. We demonstrate that our protocol is robust under depolarizing error with simulated random pure states. We experimentally test the protocol on two- and three-qubit systems with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. We show that the pure state tomography protocol saves us a number of measurements without considerable loss of fidelity. We compare our protocol with same-size sets of randomly selected Pauli operators and find that our selected set of Pauli measurements significantly outperforms those random sampling sets. As a direct application, our scheme can also be used to reduce the number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in quantum optical systems.

abstract: Various models have been proposed in which the Schr\"odinger equation is modified to account for a decay of spatial coherences of massive objects. While optomechanical systems and matter-wave interferometry with large clusters are promising candidates to test these models, we here show that using available techniques for atoms in optical lattices, some of these models can be efficiently tested. In particular, we compare unconventional decoherence due to quantum gravity as introduced by Ellis and co-workers [Phys. Lett. B ${\bf 221}$, 113 (1989)] and conventional decoherence due to scattering of the lattice photons and conclude that optimal performances are achieved with a few atoms in the realistic case where product atomic states are prepared. A detailed analysis shows that a single atom delocalized on a scale of 10 cm for about a second can be used to test efficiently the hypothetical quantum gravity induced decoherence.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous photon emission and absorption processes of two two-level atoms trapped close to the focal points of an ellipsoidal cavity, thereby taking into account the full multimode scenario. In particular, we calculate the excitation probabilities of the atoms by describing the field modes semiclassically. Based on this approach, we express the excitation probabilities by a semiclassical photon path representation. Due to the special property of an ellipsoidal cavity of having two focal points, we are able to study interesting intermediate instances between well-known quantum-optical scenarios. Furthermore, the semiclassical photon path representation enables us to address the corresponding retardation effects and causality questions in a straightforward manner.

abstract: We propose an approach to probe Higgs boson couplings to the building blocks of matter: the electron and the up and down quarks, with precision measurement of isotope shifts in atomic clock transitions. We show that the attractive Higgs force between nuclei and their bound electrons induces measurable non-linearities in a King plot of two isotope shifts. We present an experimental method which, given state-of-the-art accuracy in frequency comparison, competes with and potentially surpasses the Large Hadron Collider in bounding the Higgs-to-light-fermion couplings. Better knowledge of the latter is an important test of the Standard Model which could lead, besides the establishment of new physics above the weak scale, to an alternative understanding of the flavor puzzle.

abstract: We analyze the one dimensional scattering produced by all variations of the P\"oschl-Teller potential, i.e., potential well, low and high barriers. We show that the P\"oschl-Teller well and low barrier potentials have no resonance poles, but an infinite number of simple poles along the imaginary axis corresponding to bound and antibound states. A quite different situation arises on the P\"oschl-Teller high barrier potential, which shows an infinite number of resonance poles and no other singularities. We have obtained the explicit form of their associated Gamow states. We have also constructed ladder operators connecting wave functions for bound and antibound states as well as for resonance states. Finally, using wave functions of Gamow and antibound states in the factorization method, we construct some examples of supersymmetric partners of the P\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonian.

abstract: We review the design, theory, and applications of two dimensional periodic lattices hosting conical intersections in their energy-momentum spectrum. The best known example is the Dirac cone, where propagation is governed by an effective Dirac equation, with electron spin replaced by a "fermionic" half-integer pseudospin. However, in many systems such as metamaterials, modal symmetries result in the formation of higher order conical intersections with integer or "bosonic" pseudospin. The ability to engineer lattices with these qualitatively different singular dispersion relations opens up many applications, including superior slab lasers, generation of orbital angular momentum, zero-index metamaterials, and quantum simulation of exotic phases of relativistic matter.

abstract: Photosynthetic reaction centres are pigment-protein complexes that can transform photo-induced electronic excitations into stable charge separated states with near-unit quantum efficiency. Here we consider a theoretical photovoltaic device that places a single photosystem II reaction centre between electrodes to investigate how the mean photo-current and its fluctuations depend on the vibrational environment that assists energy and electron transfer. Our results indicate that selective coupling to well resolved vibrational modes does not necessarily offer an advantage in terms of power output but does lead to photo-currents with suppressed noise levels. The exciton manifold and the structured vibrations assisting electron transfer can also support the emergence of a phenomenon akin to dynamical channel blockade, whereby excitonic traps can impose competing routes for population transfer under steady state operation. Our results help characterizing the device-like functionality of these complexes for their potential integration into molecular-scale photovoltaics.

abstract: Through proving the correspondence principle of work distributions, recent work [C. Jarzynski, H. T. Quan, and S. Rahav, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031038 (2015)] gives some justification to the definition of quantum work via two point energy measurements in one-dimensional (1D) integrable systems. In a chaotic system, however, the correspondence principle of work distributions has not been explored so far. In this paper we numerically study the work distribution in a chaotic system, and examine the relationship between the quantum and the classical work. Our numerical results suggest that there exists the correspondence principle of work distributions in a chaotic system as well. Our investigation further justifies the definition of quantum work via two point energy measurements in a chaotic system.

abstract: We present experimental results in which the unexpected zero-two transition of a circuit composed of two inductively coupled transmons is observed. This transition shows an unusual magnetic flux dependence with a clear disappearance at zero magnetic flux. In a transmon qubit the symmetry of the wave functions prevents this transition to occur due to selection rule. In our circuit the Josephson effect introduces strong couplings between the two normal modes of the artificial atom. This leads to a coherent superposition of states from the two modes enabling such transitions to occur.

abstract: We report on the optical properties of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots emitting near the telecommunication O-band, probed via Coulomb blockade and non-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy, in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields. We extract the physical properties of the electron and hole wavefunctions, including the confinement energies, interaction energies, wavefunction lengths, and $g$-factors. For excitons, we measure the permanent dipole moment, polarizability, diamagnetic coefficient, and Zeeman splitting. The carriers are determined to be in the strong confinement regime. Large range electric field tunability, up to 7 meV, is demonstrated for excitons. We observe a large reduction, up to one order of magnitude, in the diamagnetic coefficient when rotating the magnetic field from Faraday to Voigt geometry due to the unique dot morphology. The complete spectroscopic characterization of the fundamental properties of long-wavelength dot-in-a-well structures provides insight for the applicability of quantum technologies based on quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths.
