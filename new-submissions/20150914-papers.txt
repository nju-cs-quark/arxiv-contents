abstract: We propose an experimentally accessible scheme to determine lower bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which ascertains multipartite entanglement or usefulness for quantum metrology. The scheme is based on comparing the measurement statistics of a state before and after a small unitary rotation. We argue that, in general, limited resolution of collective observables prevents the detection of large QFI. This can be overcome by performing an additional operation prior to the measurement. We illustrate the power of this protocol for present-day spin-squeezing experiments, where the same operation used for the preparation of the initial spin-squeezed state improves the lower bound on the QFI by two orders of magnitude. We also establish a connection to Leggett-Garg inequalities. We show how to simulate a variant of the inequalities with our protocol and demonstrate that a large QFI is necessary for their violation with coarse-grained detectors.

abstract: We propose a quantitative criterion to determine whether the coupled quantum systems can achieve complete synchronization or phase synchronization in the process of analyzing quantum synchronization. Adopting the criterion, we discuss the quantum synchronization effects between optomechanical systems and find that the error between the systems and the fluctuation of error are sensitive to coupling intensity by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent of the model and quantum fluctuation, respectively. Through taking the appropriate coupling intensity, we can control quantum synchronization even under different logical relationship between switches. Finally, we simulate the dynamical evolution of the system to verify the quantum synchronization criterion and to show the ability of synchronization control.

abstract: Atomic-scale logic and the minimization of heating (dissipation) are both very high on the agenda for future computation hardware. An approach to achieve these would be to replace networks of transistors directly by classical reversible logic gates built from the coherent dynamics of a few interacting atoms. As superpositions are unnecessary before and after each such gate (inputs and outputs are bits), the dephasing time only needs to exceed a single gate operation time, while fault tolerance should be achieved with low overhead, by classical coding. Such gates could thus be a spin-off of quantum technology much before full-scale quantum computation. Thus motivated, we propose methods to realize the 3-bit Toffoli and Fredkin gates universal for classical reversible logic using a single time-independent 3-qubit Hamiltonian with realistic nearest neighbour two-body interactions. We also exemplify how these gates can be composed to make a larger circuit. We show that trapped ions may soon be scalable simulators for such architectures, and investigate the prospects with dopants in silicon.

abstract: We propose an implementation of a universal quantum gate between pairs of spatially separated atoms in a microwave cavity at finite temperature. The gate results from reversible laser excitation of Rydberg states of atoms interacting with each other via exchange of virtual photons through a common cavity mode. Quantum interference of different transition paths between the two-atom ground and double-excited Rydberg states makes both the transition amplitude and resonance largely insensitive to the excitations in the microwave cavity "quantum bus" which can therefore be in any superposition or mixture of photon number states. Our scheme for attaining ultralong-range interactions and entanglement also applies to mesoscopic atomic ensembles in the Rydberg blockade regime and is scalable to many ensembles trapped within a centimeter sized microwave resonator.

abstract: We engineer the fast rotation of a quantum particle confined in an effectively one-dimensional, harmonic trap, for a predetermined rotation angle and time, avoiding final excitation. Different schemes are proposed with different speed limits that depend on the control capabilities. We also make use of trap rotations to create squeezed states without manipulating the trap frequencies.

abstract: In non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics the universe is represented by a probability space whose sample space is composed of the Bohmian trajectories. In relativistic Bohmian mechanics an entire class of empirically equivalent probability spaces can be defined, one for every foliation of spacetime. In the literature the hypothesis has been advanced that a single preferred foliation is allowed, and that this foliation derives from the universal wave function by means of a covariant law. In the present paper the opposite hypothesis is advanced, i.e., no law exists for the foliations and therefore all the foliations are allowed. The resulting model of the universe is basically the "union" of all the probability spaces associated with the foliations. This hypothesis is mainly motivated by the fact that any law defining a preferred foliation is empirically irrelevant. It is also argued that the absence of a preferred foliation may reduce the well known conflict between Bohmian mechanics and Relativity.

abstract: For the classical mind, quantum mechanics is boggling enough; nevertheless more bizarre behavior could be imagined, thereby concentrating on propositional structures (empirical logics) that transcend the quantum domain. One can also consistently suppose predictions and probabilities which are neither classical nor quantum, but which are subject to subclassicality; that is, the additivity of probability for mutually exclusive, co-measurable observables, as formalized by admissibility rules and frame functions.

abstract: Optical access networks connect multiple endpoints to a common network node via shared fibre infrastructure. They will play a vital role to scale up the number of users in quantum key distribution (QKD) networks. However, the presence of power splitters in the commonly used passive network architecture makes successful transmission of weak quantum signals challenging. This is especially true if QKD and data signals are multiplexed in the passive network. The splitter introduces an imbalance between quantum signal and Raman noise, which can prevent the recovery of the quantum signal completely. Here we introduce a method to overcome this limitation and demonstrate coexistence of multi-user QKD and full power data traffic from a gigabit passive optical network (GPON). The dual feeder implementation is compatible with standard GPON architectures and can support up to 128 users, highlighting that quantum protected GPON networks could be commonplace in the future.

abstract: A long-lived and multimode quantum memory is a key component needed for the development of quantum communication. Here we present temporally multiplexed storage of 5 photonic polarization qubits encoded onto weak coherent states in a rare-earth-ion doped crystal. Using spin refocusing techniques we can preserve the qubits for more than half a millisecond. The temporal multiplexing allows us to increase the effective rate of the experiment by a factor of 5, which emphasizes the importance of multimode storage for quantum communication. The fidelity upon retrieval is higher than the maximum classical fidelity achievable with qubits encoded onto single photons and we show that the memory fidelity is mainly limited by the memory signal-to-noise ratio. These results show the viability and versatility of long-lived, multimode quantum memories based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.

abstract: We introduce a coherence susceptibility method, based on the fact that coherence susceptibility signals quantum fluctuation, for identifying quantum phase transition points without prior knowledge of local order parameters. Different from other quantumness-oriented method, e.g. quantum entanglement et al., the coherence susceptibility method has no trouble of delicately choosing system bipartition. The influence of thermal fluctuation at finite temperatures is also discussed. The coherence susceptibility method performs well for identifying different types of quantum phase transition points even at finite temperature.

abstract: We consider a central system which is coupled via dephasing to an open system, i.e. an intermediate system which in turn is coupled to another environment. Considering intermediate and far environment as one composite system, the coherences in the central system are given in the form of fidelity amplitudes for a certain perturbed echo dynamics in the composite environment. On the basis of the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a master equation for the reduction of that dynamics to the intermediate system alone. In distinction to an earlier paper [arXiv: 1502.04143 (2015)] where we discussed the stabilizing effect of the far environment on the decoherence in the central system, we focus here on the possibility to use the measurable coherences in the central system for probing the open quantum dynamics in the intermediate system. We illustrate our results for the case of chaotic dynamics in the near environment, where we compare random matrix simulations with our analytical result.

abstract: We investigate a possibility to generate non-classical states in light-matter coupled noisy quantum systems - the Rabi and Dicke models. In these hybrid quantum systems a competing influence of coherent internal dynamics and environment induced dissipation drives the system into non-equilibrium steady states. Explicitly, for the Rabi model the steady state is given by an incoherent mixture of two states of opposite parities, but as each parity state displays light-matter entanglement we also find that the full state is entangled. Furthermore, we also propose to combine an all-optical feedback strategy for quantum state protection and for establishing quantum control in these systems. Our present work further elucidates the relevance of such hybrid open quantum systems for potential applications in quantum architectures.

abstract: We present closed-form analytic solutions to non-secular Bloch-Redfield master equations for quantum dynamics of a V-type system driven by weak coupling to a thermal bath. We focus on noise-induced Fano coherences among the excited states induced by incoherent driving of the V-system initially in the ground state. For suddenly turned-on incoherent driving, the time evolution of the coherences is determined by the damping parameter $\zeta=\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1+\gamma_2)/\Delta_p$, where $\gamma_i$ are the radiative decay rates of the excited levels $i=1,2$, and $\Delta_p=\sqrt{\Delta^2 + (1-p^2)\gamma_1\gamma_2}$ depends on the excited-state level splitting $\Delta>0$ and the angle between the transition dipole moments in the energy basis. The coherences oscillate as a function of time in the underdamped limit ($\zeta\gg1$), approach a long-lived quasi-steady state in the overdamped limit ($\zeta\ll 1$), and display an intermediate behavior at critical damping ($\zeta= 1$). The sudden incoherent turn-on generates a mixture of excited eigenstates $|e_1\rangle$ and $|e_2\rangle$ {\it and their in-phase coherent superposition} $|\phi_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\bar{r}}}(\sqrt{r_1} |e_1\rangle + \sqrt{r_2}|e_2\rangle)$, which is remarkably long-lived in the overdamped limit (where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the incoherent pumping rates). Formation of this coherent superposition {\it enhances} the decay rate from the excited states to the ground state. In the strongly asymmetric V-system where the coupling strengths between the ground state and the excited states differ significantly, we identify additional asymptotic quasistationary coherences, which arise due to slow equilibration of one of the excited states. Finally, we demonstrate that noise-induced Fano coherences are maximized with respect to populations when $r_1=r_2$ and the transition dipole moments are fully aligned.

abstract: In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, quantum models for semiconductor materials are generally not exactly solvable. As a result, understanding of the strong spin-orbit coupling effects in these systems remains poor. Here we develop an analytical method to solve the one-dimensional hard-wall quantum dot problem in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, which allows us to obtain exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of a single electron. With the help of the exact solution, we demonstrate some unique effects from the strong spin-orbit coupling in a semiconductor quantum dot, in particular the anisotropy of the electron g-factor and its tunability.

abstract: We develop the worldline formalism for computations of composite operators such as the fluctuation induced energy-momentum tensor. As an example, we use a fluctuating real scalar field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The resulting worldline representation can be evaluated by worldline Monte-Carlo methods in continuous spacetime. We benchmark this worldline numerical algorithm with the aid of analytically accessible single-plate and parallel-plate Casimir configurations, providing a detailed analysis of statistical and systematic errors. The method generalizes straightforwardly to arbitrary Casimir geometries and general background potentials.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of constructing Kochen-Specker uncolorable sets of idempotent matrices whose entries lie in various rings, including the rational numbers, the integers, and finite fields. Most notably, we show that there is no Kochen-Specker coloring of the $n \times n$ idempotent integer matrices for $n \geq 3$, thereby illustrating that Kochen-Specker contextuality is an inherent feature of pure matrix algebra. We apply this to generalize recent no-go results on noncommutative spectrum functors, showing that any contravariant functor from rings to sets (respectively, topological spaces or locales) that restricts to the Zariski prime spectrum functor for commutative rings must assign the empty set (respectively, empty space or locale) to the matrix ring $M_n(R)$ for any integer $n \geq 3$ and any ring $R$. An appendix by Alexandru Chirvasitu shows that Kochen-Specker colorings of idempotents in partial subalgebras of $M_3(F)$ for a perfect field $F$ can be extended to partial algebra morphisms into the algebraic closure of $F$.

abstract: This paper attempts to establish the connection among classifications of gapped boundaries in topological phases of matter, bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates in quantum error-correcting codes. We begin by presenting constructions of gapped boundaries for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycles functions ($d\geq 2$). We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional excitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are superpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional bosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges or magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when accompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$ fluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, involving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by taking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find that excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized by trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the Lagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the $d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level, if cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products.
