<p>
Classical optics can be used to efficiently implement certain quantum information processing tasks with a high degree of control, for example, one-dimensional quantum walks through the space of orbital angular momentum of light directed by its polarization. To explore the potential of quantum information processing with classical light we here suggest a method to realize d-dimensional quantum walks with classical optics -- an important step towards robust implementation of certain quantum algorithms. In this scheme different degrees of freedom of light, such as frequency, orbital angular momentum and time bins represent different directions for the walker while the coin to decide which direction the walker takes is realized employing the polarization combined with different light paths.
