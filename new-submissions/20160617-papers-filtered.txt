abstract: Open, non-equilibrium systems with balanced gain and loss, known as parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric systems, exhibit properties that are absent in closed, isolated systems. A key property is the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition, which occurs when the gain-loss strength, a measure of the openness of the system, exceeds the intrinsic energy-scale of the system. We analyze the fate of this transition in disordered lattices with non-Hermitian gain and loss potentials $\pm i\gamma$ at reflection-symmetric sites. Contrary to the popular belief, we show that the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase is protected in the presence of a correlated (periodic) disorder which leads to a positive $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking threshold. We uncover a veiled symmetry of such disordered systems that is instrumental for the said protection, and show that this symmetry leads to new localization behavior across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition. We elucidate the interplay between such localization and the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking phenomena in disordered $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, and support our conclusions with a beam-propagation-method analysis. Our theoretical predictions provide avenues for experimental realizations of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with engineered disorder.

abstract: We present a Mathematica package, QSWalk, to simulate the time evaluation of Quantum Stochastic Walks (QSWs) on arbitrary directed and weighted graphs. QSWs are a generalization of continuous time quantum walks that incorporate both coherent and incoherent dynamics and as such, include both quantum walks and classical random walks as special cases. The incoherent component allows for quantum walks along directed graph edges. The dynamics of QSWs are expressed using the Lindblad formalism, originally developed for open quantum systems, which frames the problem in the language of density matrices. For a QSW on a graph of $N$ vertices, we have a sparse superoperator in an $N^2$-dimensional space, which can be solved efficiently using the built-in MatrixExp function in Mathematica. We illustrate the use of the QSWalk package through several example case studies.
