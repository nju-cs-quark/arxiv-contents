**1.    Effects of system-bath coupling on Photosynthetic heat engine: A polaron master equation approach**

<p>
In this paper, we apply the polaron master equation, which offers the possibilities to interpolate between weak and strong system-bath coupling, to study how system-bath couplings affect charge transfer processes in Photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) inspired quantum heat engine (QHE) model in a wide parameter range. The effects of bath correlation and temperature, together with the combined effects of these factors are also discussed in details. The results show a variety of dynamical behaviours. We interpret these results in terms of noise-assisted transport effect and dynamical localization which correspond to two mechanisms underpinning the transfer process in photosynthetic complexes: One is resonance energy transfer and the other is dynamical localization effect captured by the polaron master equation. The effects of system-bath coupling and bath correlation are incorporated in the effective system-bath coupling strength determining whether noise-assisted transport effect or dynamical localization dominates the dynamics and temperature modulates the balance of the two mechanisms. Furthermore, these two mechanisms can be attributed to one physical origin: bath-induced fluctuations. The two mechanisms is manifestations of dual role played by bath-induced fluctuations within respective parameter range. In addition, we find that the effec- tive voltage of QHE exhibits superior robustness with respect to the bath noise as long as the system-coupling strength is not too large.

**2.    Field Induced Oscillation of Two Majorana Modes for a finite Quantum Wire**  
Yue Yu, Kwok Yip Szeto

<blockquote>
<p>
The evolution of quantum walk on a finite wire under a small increment of vector potential $\alpha$ can exhibit intrinsic quantum oscillation of the two topologically protected bound states corresponding to the Majorana modes. By tuning an external electric field corresponding to the addition of an $\alpha$ impulse at the end of each intrinsic period, the intrinsic oscillation is enveloped by a beat modulation with a longer period. This beat oscillation is useful in the preparation of decoherence-free qubit in trapped ion chain and may be observed in several experiments.
