abstract: In this work we study various notions of uncertainty for angular momentum in the spin-s representation of SU(2). We characterize the "uncertainty regions" given by all vectors, whose components are the variances of the three angular momentum components. A basic feature of this set is a lower bound for the sum of the three variances. We give a method for obtaining optimal lower bounds for uncertainty regions for general operator triples, and evaluate these for small s. Further lower bounds are derived by generalizing the technique by which Robertson obtained his state-dependent lower bound. These are optimal for large s, since they are saturated by states taken from the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that, for all s, all variances are consistent with the so-called vector model, i.e., they can also be realized by a classical probability measure on a sphere of radius sqrt(s(s+1)). Entropic uncertainty relations can be discussed similarly, but are minimized by quite different states from the variance minimizing ones for small s. For large s the Maassen-Uffink bound becomes sharp, again being saturated by Holstein-Primakoff states. Measurement uncertainty, as recently discussed by Busch, Lahti and Werner for position and momentum, is introduced and a generalized observable (POVM) which minimizes the worst case measurement uncertainty of all angular momentum components is explicitly determined. Its outputs are angular momentum vectors whose absolute value r(s) depends only on s. The function r is determined explicitly, and r(s)/s approaches 1 from below.

abstract: In recent years, several hacking attacks have broken the security of quantum cryptography implementations by exploiting the presence of losses and the ability of the eavesdropper to tune detection efficiencies. We present a simple attack of this form that applies to any protocol in which the key is constructed from the results of untrusted measurements performed on particles coming from an insecure source or channel. Because of its generality, the attack applies to a large class of protocols, from standard prepare-and-measure to device-independent schemes. The derived critical detection efficiencies for security imply that the implementation of most partly device independent solutions is, from the point of view of detection efficiency, almost as demanding as fully device-independent ones. We also show how our attack implies the existence of a form of bound randomness, namely non-local correlations in which a non-signalling eavesdropper can find out a posteriori the result of any implemented measurement.

abstract: The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem shows that noncontextual hidden variable models of reality that allow random choice are inconsistent with quantum mechanics. Such noncontextual models predict certain outcomes for specific experiments that are never observed in practice, and this is how the theorem is proved. A realist model suggested by the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz reformulation of quantum mechanics is introduced to explain why those outcomes are never observed. Just as the KS theorem requires them due to noncontextuality, this model requires independent truth-value assignments for each observable, but now allows that the entire set of assignments depends on both the pre-selected and post-selected quantum states in a time-symmetric manner. The truth-values assigned to the observables of this model are at least partially consistent with the weak values of those observables. Using sets that prove the KS theorem, along with pre- and post-selected states, we find that particular projectors within the set cannot be assigned logically consistent truth-values, and furthermore that the weak values of these projectors have a corresponding signature. This inconsistency is never observed because it is never in the pre-selected or post-selected quantum state, but its signature can be experimentally revealed through weak measurements. We also show that for specific cases where the logical inconsistency is in a `classical basis,' this gives rise to the quantum pigeonhole effect. As a related issue, we show using weak values that any KS set can be used to ensure that the Mean King always wins the game.

abstract: We show that it needs a more delicate potential to confine particles inside a well. The original model containing a vague notation of infinity in the potential energy is ambiguous. Using the Heaviside step function and the Dirac delta-function, we give a precise form for the confining potential. Although such form appears unusual, the ambiguities are resolved. This form also shows that the infinite square well is not the limit of a finite square well.

abstract: Continuous measurements play a pivotal role in the study of dynamical open quantum systems. `Dyne' detections are among the most widespread and efficient measurement schemes, and give rise to quantum diffusion of the conditioned state. In this work we study under what conditions the detector dependency of the conditional state of a quantum system subject to diffusive monitoring can be demonstrated experimentally, in the sense of ruling our any detector-independent pure-state dynamical model for the system. We consider an arbitrary number L of environments to which the system is coupled, and an arbitrary number K of different types of dyne detections. We prove that non-trivial necessary conditions for such a demonstration can be determined efficiently by semi-definite programming. To determine sufficient conditions, different physical environmental couplings and Hamiltonians for a qubit, and different sets of diffusive monitorings are scrutinized. We compare the threshold efficiencies that are sufficient in the various cases, as well as cases previously considered in the literature, to suggest the most feasible experimental options.

abstract: The $k$'th frequency moment of a sequence of integers is defined as $F_k = \sum_j n_j^k$, where $n_j$ is the number of times that $j$ occurs in the sequence. Here we study the quantum complexity of approximately computing the frequency moments in two settings. In the query complexity setting, we wish to minimise the number of queries to the input used to approximate $F_k$ up to relative error $\epsilon$. We give quantum algorithms which outperform the best possible classical algorithms up to quadratically. In the multiple-pass streaming setting, we see the elements of the input one at a time, and seek to minimise the amount of storage space, or passes over the data, used to approximate $F_k$. We describe quantum algorithms for $F_0$, $F_2$ and $F_\infty$ in this model which outperform the best possible classical algorithms almost quadratically.

abstract: We propose a simple method for constructing POVMs using any set of matrices which form an orthonormal basis for the space of complex matrices. Considering the orthonormal set of irreducible spherical tensors, we examine the properties of the construction on the $N+1$-dimensional subspace of the $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ qubits comprising the permutationally symmetric states. Similar in spirit to Neumark's result on realization of a POVM as a projective measurement, we present a method to physically realize the constructed POVMs for symmetric states using the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition of the tensor product of irreducible representations of the rotation group. We illustrate the proposed construction on a spin-1 system, and show that it is possible to generate entangled states from separable ones.

abstract: Quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing have garnered much attention recently as possible models for achieving a quantum advantage over classical approaches to optimization and other special purpose computations. Both techniques are probabilistic in nature and the minimum gap between the ground state and first excited state of the system during evolution is a major factor in determining the success probability. In this work we investigate a strategy for increasing the minimum gap and success probability by introducing intermediate Hamiltonians that modify the evolution path between initial and final Hamiltonians. We focus on an optimization problem relevant to recent quantum annealing implementations and present numerical evidence for the existence of a purely local intermediate Hamiltonian that achieve the optimum performance in terms of pushing the minimum gap to one of the end points of the evolution. We further study the effectiveness of random intermediate Hamiltonians on the minimum gap and success probability, and empirically find that random Hamiltonians have a significant probability of increasing the success probability, but only by a modest amount.

abstract: An example of exceptional points in the continuous spectrum of a real, pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian of von Neumann-Wigner type is presented and discussed. Remarkably, these exceptional points are associated with a double pole in the normalization factor of the Jost eigenfunctions normalized to unit flux at infinity. At the exceptional points, the two unnormalized Jost eigenfunctions are no longer linearly independent but coalesce to give rise to two Jordan cycles of generalized bound state eigenfunctions embedded in the continuum and a Jordan block representation of the Hamiltonian. The regular scattering eigenfunction vanishes at the exceptional point and the irregular scattering eigenfunction has a double pole at that point. In consequence, the time evolution of the regular scattering eigenfunction is unitary, while the time evolution of the irregular scattering eigenfunction is pseudounitary. The scattering matrix is a regular analytical function of the wave number $k$ for all $k$ including the exceptional points.

abstract: Hybrid architectures integrating mesoscopic electronic conductors with resonant microwave cavities have a great potential for investigating unexplored regimes of electron-photon coupling. In this context, producing nonclassical squeezed light is a key step towards quantum communication with scalable solid-state devices. Here we show that parametric driving of the electronic conductor induces a squeezed steady state in the cavity. We find that squeezing properties of the cavity are essentially determined by the electronic noise correlators of the quantum conductor. In the case of a tunnel junction, we predict that squeezing is optimized by applying a time-periodic series of quantized $\delta-$peaks in the bias voltage. For an asymmetric quantum dot, we show that a sharp Leviton pulse is able to achieve perfect cavity squeezing.

abstract: Coherent control over photoelectron wavepackets, via the use of polarization-shaped laser pulses, can be understood as a time and polarization-multiplexed process. In this work, we investigate this multiplexing via computation of the observable photoelectron angular interferograms resulting from multi-photon atomic ionization with polarization-shaped laser pulses. We consider the polarization sensitivity of both the instantaneous and cumulative continuum wavefunction; the nature of the coherent control over the resultant photoelectron interferogram is thus explored in detail. Based on this understanding, the use of coherent control with polarization-shaped pulses as a methodology for a highly multiplexed coherent quantum metrology is also investigated, and defined in terms of the information content of the observable.

abstract: The numerical study of anyonic systems is known to be highly challenging due to their non-bosonic, non-fermionic particle exchange statistics, and with the exception of certain models for which analytical solutions exist, very little is known about their collective behaviour as a result. Meanwhile, the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) algorithm is an exceptionally powerful numerical technique for calculating the ground state of a low-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian, and has been applied to the study of bosonic, fermionic, and group-symmetric systems. The recent development of a tensor network formulation for anyonic systems opened up the possibility of studying these systems using algorithms such as DMRG, though this has proved challenging both in terms of programming complexity and computational cost. This paper presents the implementation of DMRG for finite anyonic systems, including a detailed scheme for the implementation of anyonic tensors with optimal scaling of computational cost. The anyonic DMRG algorithm is demonstrated by calculating the ground state energy of the Golden Chain, which has become the benchmark system for the numerical study of anyons, and is shown to produce results comparable to those of the anyonic TEBD algorithm and superior to the variationally optimised anyonic MERA, at far lesser computational cost.

abstract: The control of light transmission through a Fabry-Perot cavity containing atoms is theoretically investigated, when the cavity mode beam and an intersecting control beam are both close to specific atomic resonances. A four-level atomic system is considered and its interaction with the cavity mode is studied by solving for the time dependent cavity field and atomic state populations. The conditions for optical bistability of the atom-cavity system are obtained in steady state limit. For an ensemble of atoms in the cavity mode, the response of the intra-cavity light intensity to the intersecting resonant beam is understood for stationary atoms (closed system) and non-static atoms (open system). The open system is modelled by adjusting the atomic state populations to represent the exchange of atoms in the cavity mode, with the thermal environment. The solutions to the model are used to qualitatively explain the observed steady state and transient behaviour of the light in the cavity mode, in Sharma et. al. [1]. The control behaviour with three- and two-level atomic systems is also studied, and the rich physics arising out of these systems, for closed and open atomic systems is discussed.

abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo, we study the non-equilibrium transport of magnetization in large open strongly correlated quantum spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems driven by purely dissipative processes that conserve the uniform or staggered magnetization. We prepare both a low-temperature Heisenberg ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet in two parts of the system that are initially isolated from each other. We then bring the two subsystems in contact and study their real-time dissipative dynamics for different geometries. The flow of the uniform or staggered magnetization from one part of the system to the other is described by a diffusion equation that can be derived analytically.

abstract: This thesis contributes to ongoing research related to the categorical compositional model for natural language of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark in three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract framework based on Frobenius algebras (joint work with Sadrzadeh). The theory improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results. The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models that find intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work with Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in particular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum mechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different meanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and linguistics.

abstract: Following the sudden creation of a single ion in a quasi one-dimensional trapped ultracold ensemble of bosonic atoms, the major part of the atoms is captured in the vicinity of the ion, while the remaining fraction is emitted towards the outer regions of the trap. Subsequently, the two energy scales stemming from the trapping potential and the atom-ion interaction give rise to two major density oscillations. While the first one corresponds to a dipole oscillation, the second one results from a coherent superposition of an atom-ion bound and a trap state which causes spatial coherence and population transfer between the two density fractions. Induced by the dynamical build-up of correlations, this second oscillation exhibits a collapse and revival behavior. We apply the ab initio multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons to explore the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and analyze it via a cluster expansion approach. The latter is adapted to bosonic systems of fixed particle number which provides us with a thorough understanding of the complicated many-body processes.

abstract: We review recent developments concerning non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and many-body physics with light, in superconducting circuits and Josephson analogues. We start with quantum impurity models summarizing the effect of dissipation and of driving the system. We mention theoretical and experimental efforts to characterize these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how Josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect with microwave photons. The Kondo effect is characterized by a renormalized light-frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot devices coupled to an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing to engineer the Jaynes-Cummings lattice and Rabi lattice models. This opens the door to novel many-body physics with light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition observed with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent theoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic gauge fields and spin-orbit couplings have been successfully implemented with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet perturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice systems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose-Hubbard models in ladder and two-dimensional geometries. The Bose-Hubbard model is related to the Jaynes-Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit between light and matter. In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show that Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.
