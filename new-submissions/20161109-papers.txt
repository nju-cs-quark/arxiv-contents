abstract: Many-body systems constructed of quantum-optical building blocks can now be realized in experimental platforms ranging from exciton-polariton fluids to ultracold gases of Rydberg atoms, establishing a fascinating interface between traditional many-body physics and the driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium setting of cavity-QED. At this interface, the standard techniques and intuitions of both fields are called into question, obscuring issues as fundamental as the role of fluctuations, dimensionality, and symmetry on the nature of collective behavior and phase transitions. Here, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, a minimal description of numerous atomic, optical, and solid-state systems in which particle loss is countered by coherent driving. Despite being a lattice version of optical bistability---a foundational and patently non-equilibrium model of cavity-QED---the steady state possesses an emergent equilibrium description in terms of a classical Ising model. We establish this picture by identifying a limit in which the quantum dynamics is asymptotically equivalent to non-equilibrium Langevin equations, which support a phase transition described by model A of the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Numerical simulations of the Langevin equations corroborate this picture, producing results consistent with the behavior of a finite-temperature Ising model.

abstract: A scheme for active temporal-to-spatial demultiplexing of single-photons generated by a solid-state source is introduced. The scheme scales quasi-polynomially with photon number, providing a viable technological path for routing n photons in the one temporal stream from a single emitter to n different spatial modes. The active demultiplexing is demonstrated using a state-of-the-art photon source---a quantum-dot deterministically coupled to a micropillar cavity---and a custom-built demultiplexer---a network of electro-optically reconfigurable waveguides monolithically integrated in a lithium niobate chip. The measured demultiplexer performance can enable a six-photon rate three orders of magnitude higher than the equivalent heralded SPDC source, providing a platform for intermediate quantum computation protocols.

abstract: The "dynamical mismatch" observed in quantum systems in the semiclassical regime challenge the Pilot wave model. Indeed the dynamics and properties of such systems depend on the trajectories of the classically equivalent system, whereas the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories are generically non-classical.\ In this work we examine the situation for the model favoured by de Broglie, the theory of the Double Solution (DS). We will see that the original DS model applied to semiclassical systems is also prone to the dynamical mismatch.\ However we will argue that the DS theory can be modified in order to yield propagation of the singularity in accord with the underlying classical dynamics of semiclassical systems.

abstract: We study theoretically the teleportation of controlled-phase (CZ) gate through measurement-based quantum information processing for continuous-variable systems. We examine the degree of entanglement in the output modes of the teleported CZ-gate for two classes of resource states: the canonical cluster states that are constructed via direct implementations of two-mode squeezing operations, and the linear-optical version of cluster states which are built from linear-optical networks of beam splitters and phase shifters. In order to reduce the excess noise arising from finite-squeezed resource states, teleportation through resource states with different multi-rail designs will be considered and the enhancement of entanglement in the teleported CZ-gates will be analyzed. For multi-rail cluster with an arbitrary number of rails, we are able to obtain analytical results for the entanglement in the output modes. At the same time, we also show that for uniformly squeezed clusters the multi-rail noise reduction can be optimized when the excess noise is allocated uniformly to the rails. To facilitate the analysis, we develop a trick with manipulations of quadrature operators that can reveal rather efficiently the measurement sequence and corrective operations needed for the measurement-based gate teleportation, which will also be explained in detail.

abstract: Quantum technologies based on adiabatic techniques can be highly effective, but often at the cost of being very slow. Here we introduce a set of experimentally realistic, non-adiabatic protocols for spatial state preparation, which yield the same fidelity as their adiabatic counterparts, but on fast timescales. In particular, we consider a charged particle in a system of tunnel-coupled quantum wells, where the presence of a magnetic field can induce a geometric phase during the tunnelling processes. We show that this leads to the appearance of complex tunnelling frequencies and allows for the implementation of spatial non-adiabatic passage. We demonstrate the ability of such a system to transport a particle between two different wells and to generate a delocalised superposition between the three traps with high fidelity in short times.

abstract: Interaction of light with media often occurs with a femtosecond response time. Its measurement by conventional techniques requires the use of femtosecond lasers and sophisticated time-gated optical detection1-3. Here we demonstrate that by exploiting quantum interference of entangled photons it is possible to measure the phase relaxation time of a media on the femtosecond time scale (down to 100 fs) using accessible continuous wave laser and single-photon counting. We insert the sample in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer4 and infer the phase relaxation time from the modification of the two-photon interference pattern. In addition to its simplicity and ease of use, the technique does not require compensation of group velocity dispersion5-8 and does not induce photo-damage of the samples. This technique will be useful for characterization of ultrafast phase relaxation processes in material science, chemistry, and biology.

abstract: "Quantum sensing" describes the use of a quantum system, quantum properties or quantum phenomena to perform a measurement of a physical quantity. Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors, or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities - especially with regard to high sensitivity - in applied physics and other areas of science. In this review, we provide an introduction to the basic principles, methods and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.

Here we experimentally demonstrate the violation of two simultaneous CHSH inequalities by exploiting a two-photon polarization maximally entangled state. Our results demonstrate that large double violation is experimentally achievable. Our demonstration may have impact for Quantum Key Distribution or certification of Quantum Random Number generators based on weak measurements.

abstract: Localizability of entanglement in fully inseparable states is a key ingredient of assisted quantum information protocols as well as measurement-based models of quantum computing. We investigate the existence of fully inseparable states with nonlocalizable entanglement, that is, with entanglement which cannot be localized between any pair of subsystems by any measurement on the remaining part of the system. It is shown, that the nonlocalizable entanglement occurs already in suitable mixtures of a three-qubit GHZ state and white noise. Further, we generalize this set of states to a two-parametric family of fully inseparable three-qubit states with nonlocalizable entanglement. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the existence of nonlocalizable entanglement by preparing and characterizing one state from the family using correlated single photons and linear optical circuit.

abstract: We investigate the propagation of a local perturbation in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with a time-dependent application of mean-field theory based on the BBGKY hierarchy. We show that the perturbation propagates through the system with a finite velocity and that there is transition from Manhattan to Euclidian metric, resulting in a light cone with an almost circular shape at sufficiently large distances. The propagation velocity of the perturbation defining the front of the light cone is discussed with respect to the parameters of the Hamiltonian and compared to exact results for the transverse-field Ising model in one dimension.

abstract: We review a time-dependent version of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation that accounts for real-time control of system parameters, soon to be rendered possible on a broad basis due to technical progress. The dispersive regime of $N$ multilevel systems coupled to a cavity via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction is extended to the most general case. As a concrete example we rigorously apply the technique to dispersive two-qubit gates in a superconducting architecture, showing that fidelities based on previous models are off by up to $10^{-2}$, which is certainly relevant for high-fidelity gates compatible with fault-tolerant quantum information devices. A closed analytic form for the error depending on the target evolution closes our work.

abstract: Quantum nature of light has complex properties that are required for many key efforts in quantum optical technology. Sixty years ago, the basic properties of ideal coherent light have been recognized as only classical, while quantum theory allowed reaching more engaging states of light. Nowadays, generating nonclassical light has become a routine for optical laboratories, but quantum states with precise number of photons (Fock states) still pose a challenge. We introduce an experimental criterion for quantum non-Gaussianity, a feature of Fock states which imposes requirements that are more strict than for nonclassical light. Our approach is generally applicable to all multi-photon states, whereas previous efforts covered only the particular case of single photons. Using a 10-channel detector, we demonstrate generation of quantum non-Gaussian light with the mean number of photons up to 5 despite detection efficiency of 50 %.

abstract: A well-known feature of quantum mechanics is the secure exchange of secret bit strings which can then be used as keys to encrypt messages transmitted over any classical communication channel. It is demonstrated that this quantum key distribution allows a much more general and abstract access than commonly thought. The results include some generalizations for the Hilbert space version of quantum key distribution,but base upon a general non-classical extension of conditional probability. A special state-independent conditional probability is identified as origin of the superior security of quantum key distribution and may have more profound implications for the foundations and interpretation of quantum mechanics,quantum information theory, and the philosophical question what actually constitutes physical reality.

abstract: The geometry of quantum states provides a unifying framework for estimation processes based on quantum probes, and it allows to derive the ultimate bounds of the achievable precision. We show a relation between the statistical distance between infinitesimally close quantum states and the second order variation of the coherence of the optimal measurement basis with respect to the state of the probe. In Quantum Phase Estimation protocols, this leads to identify coherence as the relevant resource that one has to engineer and control to optimize the estimation precision. Furthermore, the main object of the theory i.e., the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, in many cases allows to identify a proper factorization of the whole Hilbert space in two subsystems. The factorization allows: to discuss the role of coherence vs correlations in estimation protocols; to show how certain estimation processes can be completely or effectively described within a single-qubit subsystem; and to derive lower bounds for the scaling of the estimation precision with the number of probes used. We illustrate how the framework works for both noiseless and noisy estimation procedures, in particular those based multi-qubit GHZ-states. Finally we succinctly analyze estimation protocols based on zero-temperature critical behaviour. We identify the coherence that is at the heart of their efficiency, and we show how it exhibits the non-analyticities and scaling behaviour proper of a large class of quantum phase transitions.

abstract: The decoy-state scheme is the most widely implemented quantum key distribution protocol in practice. In order to account for the finite-size key effects on the achievable secret key generation rate, a rigorous statistical fluctuation analysis is required. Originally, a heuristic Gaussian-approximation technique was used for this purpose, which, despite of its analytical convenience, was not sufficiently rigorous. The fluctuation analysis has recently been made rigorous by using the Chernoff bound. There is a considerable gap, however, between the key rate bounds obtained from these new techniques and that obtained from the Gaussian assumption. Here, we develop a tighter bound for the decoy-state method, which yields a smaller failure probability. This improvement results in a higher key rate and increases the maximum distance over which secure key exchange is possible. By optimizing the system parameters, our simulation results show that our new method almost closes the gap between the two previously proposed techniques and achieves a similar performance to that of conventional Gaussian approximations.

abstract: Quantum annealing is guaranteed to find the ground state of optimization problems in the adiabatic limit. Recent work [Phys. Rev. X 6, 031010 (2016)] has found that for some barrier tunneling problems, quantum annealing can be run much faster than is adiabatically required. Specifically, an $n$-qubit optimization problem was presented for which a non-adiabatic, or diabatic, annealing algorithm requires only constant runtime, while an adiabatic annealing algorithm requires a runtime polynomial in $n$. Here we show that this non-adiabatic speed-up is a direct result of a specific symmetry in the studied problems. In the more general case, no such non-adiabatic speed-up occurs. We furthermore show why the special case achieves this speed-up compared to the general case. We conclude with the observation that the adiabatic annealing algorithm has a necessary and sufficient runtime that is quadratically better than the standard quantum adiabatic condition suggests.

abstract: There is a significant ongoing effort in realizing quantum annealing with different physical platforms. The challenge is to achieve a fully programmable quantum device featuring coherent adiabatic quantum dynamics. Here we show that combining the well-developed quantum simulation toolbox for Rydberg atoms with the recently proposed Lechner-Hauke-Zoller~(LHZ) architecture allows one to build a prototype for a coherent adiabatic quantum computer with all-to-all Ising interactions and, therefore, a novel platform for quantum annealing. In LHZ a infinite-range spin-glass is mapped onto the low energy subspace of a spin-1/2 lattice gauge model with quasi-local 4-body parity constraints. This spin model can be emulated in a natural way with Rubidium and Cesium atoms in a bipartite optical lattice involving laser-dressed Rydberg-Rydberg interactions, which are several orders of magnitude larger than the relevant decoherence rates. This makes the exploration of coherent quantum enhanced optimization protocols accessible with state-of-the-art atomic physics experiments.

abstract: We reveal a novel topological property of the exceptional points in a two-level parity-time symmetric system and then propose a scheme to detect the topological exceptional points in the system, which is embedded in a larger Hilbert space constructed by a four-level cold atomic system. We show that a tunable parameter in the presented system for simulating the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can be tuned to swept the eigenstates through the exceptional points in parameter space. The non-trivial Berry phases of the eigenstates obtained in this loop from the exceptional points can be measured by the atomic interferometry. Since the proposed operations and detection are experimentally feasible, our scheme may pave a promising way to explore the novel properties of non-Hermitian systems.

abstract: We propose an energy-driven stochastic master equation for the density matrix as a dynamical model for quantum state reduction. In contrast, most previous studies of state reduction have considered stochastic extensions of the Schr\"odinger equation, and have introduced the density matrix as the expectation of the random pure projection operator associated with the evolving state vector. After working out properties of the reduction process we construct a general solution to the energy-driven stochastic master equation. The solution is obtained by the use of nonlinear filtering theory and takes the form of a completely positive stochastic map.

abstract: For an unknown eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ of a unitary operator $U$, suppose we have an estimate of the corresponding eigenvalue which is separated from all other eigenvalues by a minimum gap of magnitude $\Delta$. In the eigenstate-marking problem (EMP), the goal is to implement a selective phase transformation of the $|\psi\rangle$ state (known as \emph{marking} the $|\psi\rangle$ state in the language of the quantum search algorithms). The EMP finds important applications in the construction of several quantum algorithms. The best known algorithm for the EMP combines the ideas of the phase estimation algorithm and the majority-voting. It uses $\Theta(\frac{1}{\Delta}\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ applications of $U$ where $\epsilon$ is the tolerable error. It needs $\Theta\left(\ln \frac{1}{\Delta}\right)$ ancilla qubits for the phase estimation and another $\Theta\left(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ ancilla qubits for the majority-voting. In this paper, we show that the majority-voting is not a crucial requirement for the EMP and the same purpose can also be achieved using the fixed-point quantum search algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubits. In the case of majority-voting, these ancilla qubits were needed to do controlled transformations which are harder to implement physically. Using fixed-point quantum search, we get rid off these $\Theta\left(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ ancilla qubits and same number of controlled transformations. Thus we get a much simpler algorithm for marking the unknown eigenstates. However, the required number of applications of $U$ increases by the factor of $\Theta \left(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$. This tradeoff can be beneficial in typical situations where spatial resources are more constrained or where the controlled transformations are very expensive.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of single- and multi-photon emission from detuned strongly coupled systems based on the quantum-dot-photonic-crystal resonator platform. Transmitting light through such systems can generate a range of non-classical states of light with tunable photon counting statistics due to the nonlinear ladder of hybridized light-matter states. By controlling the detuning between emitter and resonator, the transmission can be tuned to strongly enhance either single- or two-photon emission processes. Despite the strongly-dissipative nature of these systems, we find that by utilizing a self-homodyne interference technique combined with frequency-filtering we are able to find a strong two-photon component of the emission in the multi-photon regime. In order to explain our correlation measurements, we propose rate equation models that capture the dominant processes of emission both in the single- and multi-photon regimes. These models are then supported by quantum-optical simulations that fully capture the frequency filtering of emission from our solid-state system.

abstract: Nanophotonics focuses on the control of light and the interaction with matter by the aid of intricate nanostructures. Typically, a photonic nanostructure is carefully designed for a specific application and any imperfections may reduce its performance, i.e., a thorough investigation of the role of unavoidable fabrication imperfections is essential for any application. However, another approach to nanophotonic applications exists where fabrication disorder is used to induce functionalities by enhancing light-matter interaction. Disorder leads to multiple scattering of light, which is the realm of statistical optics where light propagation requires a statistical description. We review here the recent progress on disordered photonic nanostructures and the potential implications for quantum photonics devices.

abstract: In a previous paper we have shown that Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the non-analytic attractive exponential potential $V(x)= -g^2\exp (-|x|)$ is exactly solvable. It has finitely many discrete eigenstates described by the Bessel function of the first kind $J_{\nu}(z)$ and the eigenvalues are specified by the positive zeros of $J_{\nu}(g)$ and $J'_{\nu}(g)$ as a function of the order $\nu$ with fixed $g>0$. Now we show the corresponding results for the {\em confining\/} non-analytic exponential potential $V(x)= g^2\exp (2|x|)$. This has infinitely many discrete eigenstates described by the modified Bessel function of the second kind $K_{i\nu}(z)$. The eigenvalues are specified by the {\em pure imaginary zeros\/} $K_{i\nu}(g)$ and $K'_{i\nu}(g)$ as a function of the order with fixed $g>0$.

abstract: We present a new method for evaluating the response of a moving qubit detector interacting with a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. We treat the detector as an open quantum system, but we do not invoke the Markov approximation. The evolution equations for the qubit density matrix are valid at all times, for all qubit trajectories and they incorporate non-Markovian effects. We analyze in detail the case of uniform acceleration, providing a detailed characterization of all regimes where non-Markovian effects are significant. We argue that the most stable characterization of acceleration temperature refers to the late time behavior of the detector, because interaction with the field vacuum brings the qubit to a thermal state at the Unruh temperature. In contrast, the early-time transition rate, that is invoked in most discussions of acceleration temperature, does not exhibit a thermal behavior when non-Markovian effects are taken into account. Finally, we note that the non-Markovian evolution derived here also applies to the mathematically equivalent problem of a static qubit interacting with a thermal field bath.

abstract: Next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain plays important roles in solid state physics, such as predicting exotic electric properties of two-dimensional materials or magnetic properties of organic compounds. Direct experimental studies of the many-body electron systems or spin systems associating to these materials are challenging tasks, while optical simulation provides an effective and economical way for immediate observation. Comparing with bulk optics, integrated optics are more of fascinating for steady, large scale and long-time evolution simulations. Photonic crystal is an artificial microstructure material with multiple methods to tune the propagation properties, which are essential for various simulation tasks. Here we report for the first time an experimental simulation of next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with an integrated optical chip of photonic crystal waveguide array. The use of photonic crystal enhances evanescent field thus allows coupling between next-nearest-neighbor waveguides in such a planar waveguide array, without breaking the weak coupling condition of the coupled mode equation. Particularly, similarities between the model and coherent light propagation could reach 0.99 in numerical simulations and 0.89 in experiment. Localization effect induced by second-order coupling and coupling strengthening with increasing wavelengths were also revealed in both numerical simulations and experiments. The platform proposed here is compatible with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology thus possesses the potential for larger-scale problems and photonic crystals further allows simulations of specific target Hamiltonians.

abstract: Given the time-evolution of an electron charge density, the local potential in Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory (KS-TDDFT) can be modeled as a sum of instantaneous and dynamic contributions by assuming a certain form of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TD-KS) orbitals. The instantaneous part is obtained numerically using methods from ground-state density functional theory (DFT) and the dynamic part is expressed in terms of a velocity potential that depends on the electron current density. The suggested form of the TD-KS orbitals satisfies several known constraints (orthonormality, N-representability, J-representability), and the domain of validity is shown to depend on the evolution of the instantaneous quantities. Through this decomposition, we can relate time-dependent and ground -state V-representability. The resulting potentials are shown numerically to approximate the exact time-dependent Kohn-Sham potentials for a set of 3 non-singlet two-particle systems (a Kohn-mode, a Coulomb explosion, and a double quantum well) where the exact solutions and reference densities are known or obtained through configuration interaction (CI) approaches.
