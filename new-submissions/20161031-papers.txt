abstract: A novel prediction is derived by the Two-State-Vector-Formalism (TSVF) for a particle superposed over three boxes. Under appropriate pre- and postselections, and with tunneling enabled between two of the boxes, it is possible to derive not only one, but three predictions for three different times within the intermediate interval. These predictions are moreover contradictory: The particle (when looked for using a projective measurement) seems to disappear from the first box where it would have been previously found with certainty, appearing instead within the third box, to which no tunneling is possible, and later re-appearing within the second. When examined closer during the "disappearance" time, it turns out that local measurement (i.e. opening one of the boxes) fails to indicate the particle's presence, but subtler measurements performed on the two boxes together reveal the particle's nonlocal modular momentum spatially separated from its mass. Another advance of this setting is that, unlike other predictions of the TSVF that rely on weak and/or counterfactual measurements, the present one uses actual projective measurements. This outcome is then corroborated by adding weak measurements and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results strengthen the recently suggested time-symmetric Heisenberg ontology based on nonlocal deterministic operators.

abstract: In this article, by considering Bell-diagonal two-qubit initial states submitted to local dynamics generated by the phase damping, bit flip, phase flip, bit-phase flip, and depolarizing channels, we report some elegant direct-dynamical relations between geometric measures of entanglement and discord. The complex scenario appearing already in this simplified case study indicates that similarly simple relation shall hardly be found in more general situations.

abstract: We discuss a novel framework for physical theories that is based on the principles of locality and operationalism. It generalizes and unifies previous frameworks, including the standard formulation of quantum theory, the convex operational framework and Segal's approach to quantum field theory. It is capable of encoding both classical and quantum (field) theories, implements spacetime locality in a manifest way and contains the complete modern notion of measurement in the quantum case. Its mathematical content can be condensed into a set of axioms that are similar to those of Atiyah and Segal. This is supplemented by two basic rules for extracting probabilities or expectation values for measurement processes. The framework, called the positive formalism, is derived in three completely different ways. One derivation is from first principles, one starts with classical field theory and one with quantum field theory. The latter derivation arose previously in the programme of the general boundary formulation of quantum theory. As in the convex operational framework, the difference between classical and quantum theories essentially arises from certain partially ordered vector spaces being either lattices or anti-lattices. If we add the ad hoc ingredient of imposing anti-lattice structures, the derivation from first principles may be seen as a reconstruction of quantum theory. Among other things, the positive formalism suggests a statistical approach to classical field theories with dynamical metric, provides a common ground for quantum information theory and quantum field theory, introduces a notion of local measurement into quantum field theory, and suggests a new perspective on quantum gravity by removing the incompatibility with general relativistic principles.

abstract: We study the evolution of higher-order nonclassicality and entanglement criteria in atmospheric fluctuating-loss channels. By formulating input-output relations for the matrix of moments, we investigate the influence of such channels on the corresponding quantumness criteria. This generalization of our previous work on Gaussian entanglement [Phys. Rev. A 94, 010302(R) (2016)] not only exploits second-order based scenarios, but it also provides a detailed investigation of nonclassicality and entanglement in non-Gaussian and multimode radiation fields undergoing a fluctuating attenuation. That is, various examples of criteria and states are studied in detail, unexpected effects, e.g., the dependency of the squeezing transfer on the coherent displacement, are discovered, and it is demonstrated that non-Gaussian entanglement can be more robust against atmospheric losses than Gaussian one. Additionally, we propose a detection scheme for measuring the considered moments after propagation through the atmosphere. Therefore, our results may help to develop, improve, and optimize non-Gaussian sources of quantum light for applications in free-space quantum communication.

abstract: We investigate the super and sub-radiance characteristics of the radiation emitted from a system of three two-level atoms, in the GHZ and W-states. The dipolar coupling between atoms leads to two distinct configurations, one in which the three atoms are on a line, and the other in a closed loop form, wherein each atom interacts with both its neighbours. The quantum statistical properties of the emitted radiation show distinctly different characteristics for the GHZ and W-states resulting from the above configurations. The far-field radiation pattern also shows distinct differences between differently entangled states, making it possible for optical probing of entangled states.

abstract: The superposition principle forms the heart of all modern applications and properties of Quantum Mechanics including Quantum Computing and Quantum Entanglement. However, its usual application to slit based interference experiments has caveat in both Optics and Quantum Mechanics where it is often incorrectly assumed that the boundary condition represented by slits opened individually is same as them being opened together. Error entailed by this assumption is quantified by a parameter which has been calculated by recent theoretical works to be non-zero under correct boundary conditions. No experiment till date has reported a non-zero value for this quantity $\kappa$ yet. Here we report the first measurement of a non-zero $\kappa$ of the order $10^{-2}$ in the microwave domain using antennas as sources and detectors of the electromagnetic waves. With remarkable agreement between experiment and theory, we convincingly demonstrate the deviation from the usual application of the superposition principle. We also show that our results can have potential applications in formulating better error models in observational radio astronomy data in studies of the epoch of reionization of the early universe where similar naive assumptions are sometimes made about the application of the superposition principle.

abstract: We study universal uncertainty relations and present a method called joint probability distribution diagram to improve the majorization bounds constructed independently in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 230401 (2013)] and [J. Phys. A. 46, 272002 (2013)]. The results give rise to state independent uncertainty relations satisfied by any nonnegative Schur-concave functions. On the other hand, a remarkable recent result of entropic uncertainty relation is the direct-sum majorization relation. In this paper, we illustrate our bounds by showing how they provide a complement to that in [Phys. Rev. A. 89, 052115 (2014)].

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.09206
abstract: We propose a method to induce strong effective interactions between photons mediated by an atomic ensemble. To achieve this, we use the stationary light effect, which makes the atomic ensemble behave as an optical cavity and thereby increases the interaction strength. Regardless of the optical depth per atom, the interaction strength between the photons can be enhanced by increasing the total number of atoms (total optical depth). For sufficiently many atoms, the setup can be viable as a controlled-phase gate for photons. We derive analytical expressions for the fidelities for two modes of gate operation: deterministic and heralded conditioned on the presence of two photons at the output. The latter mode can be used to improve the secret key rate for quantum repeaters compared to using only linear optics.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.09273
abstract: We propose a scheme to deal with certain time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian operators $H(t)$ that generate a real phase in their time-evolution. This involves the use of invariant operators $I_{PH}(t)$ that are pseudo-Hermitian with respect to the time-dependent metric operator and which implies that the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. Furthermore, $H(t)$ is not generally quasi-Hermitian and does not define an observable of the system but $I_{PH}(t)$ obeys a quasi-hermiticity transformation as in the completely time-independent Hamiltonian systems case. The harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency under the action of a complex time-dependent linear potential is considered as an illustrative example.

abstract: We report the discovery of two new invariants for three-qubit states which, similarly to the 3-tangle, are invariant under local unitary transformations and permutations of the parties. These quantities have a direct interpretation in terms of the anisotropy of pairwise spin correlations. Applications include a universal ordering of pairwise quantum correlation measures for pure three-qubit states; tradeoff relations for anisotropy, 3-tangle and Bell nonlocality; strong monogamy relations for Bell inequalities, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering inequalities, geometric discord and fidelity of remote state preparation (including results for arbitrary three-party states); and a statistical and reference-frame-independent form of quantum secret sharing.

abstract: We explore quantum many-body physics of a driven Bose-Einstein condensate and present exact results for the Rabi-Bogoliubov spectrum and amplitudes of the condensate. We find a gap in the spectrum of elementary excitations that amounts to the effective Rabi frequency of the laser field. Compared to phonon-mediated Landau damping in a scalar BEC at low temperatures, the collective mode decay rate in a driven condensate is proportional to the density of the roton mode. Thus, the laser-induced roton mode significantly slows down Landau damping of the collective modes in a driven condensate.

abstract: We theoretically analyze the energy spectrum of a quantum ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene with radius $R$ for a zero width subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field $B$. An analytical approach, using the Dirac equation, is implemented to obtain the energy spectrum by freezing out the carrier radial motion. The obtained spectrum exhibits different symmetries and for a fixed total angular momentum $m$, it has a hyperbolic dependence of the magnetic field. In particular, the energy spectra are not invariant under the transformation $B \longrightarrow -B$. The application of a potential, on the upper and lower layer, allows to open a gap in the energy spectrum and the application of a non zero magnetic field breaks all symmetries. We also analyze the basics features of the energy spectrum to show the main similarities and differences with respect to ideal quantum ring in monolayer, AB-stacked bilayer graphene and a quantum ring with finite width in AB-stacked bilayer graphene.

abstract: We demonstrate the Bloch-Siegert effect in a dispersively coupled qubit-cavity system which is driven through a quantum-to-classical transition. The observed dispersive shift of the resonance frequency displays strongly non-monotonic dependence on the number of cavity photons and escapes the scope of the analytic results obtained with either a simple rotating-wave approximation, or with a more refined counter-rotating hybridized rotating wave approach. We measured the transition energy with a weak resonant probe, and the obtained data is in a good agreement with our numerical simulations of the quasienergy spectrum.

abstract: In this set of lectures, we will start with a brief pedagogical introduction to abelian anyons and their properties. This will essentially cover the background material with an introduction to basic concepts in anyon physics, fractional statistics, braid groups and abelian anyons. The next topic that we will study is a specific exactly solvable model, called the toric code model, whose excitations have (mutual) anyon statistics. Then we will go on to discuss non-abelian anyons, where we will use the one dimensional Kitaev model as a prototypical example to produce Majorana modes at the edge. We will then explicitly derive the non-abelian unitary matrices under exchange of these Majorana modes.

abstract: We study the details of the distribution of the entanglement spectrum (eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix) of a disordered spin chain exhibiting a many-body localization (MBL) transition. In the thermalizing region we identify the evolution under increasing system size of the eigenvalues distribution function, whose thermodynamic limit is close (but possibly different from) the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. From the analysis we extract a correlation length $L_s(h)$ determining the minimum system size to enter the asymptotic region. We find that $L_s(h)$ diverges at the MBL transition. We discuss the nature of the subleading corrections to the entanglement spectrum distribution and to the entanglement entropy.

abstract: Nonequilibrium quasiparticles represent a significant source of decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits. Here we investigate the mechanism of quasiparticle poisoning in devices subjected to local quasiparticle injection. We find that quasiparticle poisoning is dominated by the propagation of pair-breaking phonons across the chip. We characterize the energy dependence of the timescale for quasiparticle poisoning. Finally, we observe that incorporation of extensive normal metal quasiparticle traps leads to a more than order of magnitude reduction in quasiparticle loss for a given injected quasiparticle power.
