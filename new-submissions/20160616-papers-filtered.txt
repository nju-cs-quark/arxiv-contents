abstract: Wave function collapse models postulate a fundamental breakdown of the quantum superposition principle at the macroscale. Therefore, experimental tests of collapse models are also fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. Therefore, experimental tests of collapse models can be regarded as fundamental tests of the quantum superposition principle. Here, we compute the upper bounds on the collapse parameters, which can be inferred by the gravitational wave detectors AURIGA, LIGO and LISA Pathfinder. We consider the most widely used collapse model, the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model. We show that these experiments exclude a huge portion of the CSL parameter space, the strongest bound being set by the recently launched space mission LISA Pathfinder.
