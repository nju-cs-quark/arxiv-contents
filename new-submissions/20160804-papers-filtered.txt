abstract: An asymmetric double-well potential is considered, assuming that the wells are parabolic around the minima. The WKB wave function of a given energy is constructed inside the barrier between the wells. By matching the WKB function to the exact wave functions of the parabolic wells on both sides of the barrier, for two almost degenerate states, we find a quantization condition for the energy levels which reproduces the known energy splitting formula between the two states. For the other low-lying non-degenerate states, we show that the eigenfunction should be primarily localized in one of the wells with negligible magnitude in the other. Using Dekker's method [Physica 146A (1987) 375], the present analysis generalizes earlier results for weakly biased double-well potentials to systems with arbitrary asymmetry.

abstract: In the present paper, we establish a connection between Open Quantum Random Walks and the Quantum Markov Chains. In particular, we construct two kinds of Quantum Markov Chains associated with Open Quantum Random Walks. Moreover, we study the recurrence and the property of accessibility associated to these Quantum Markov Chains.
