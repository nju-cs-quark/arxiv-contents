abstract: We report the formation of a general superposition of coherent states in exact analytical solution of the Schrodingers equatin for atom-photon interaction by taking into account the role of virtual photons. Despite some known superposition of quantum states, the general superposition state introduced in this letter constructed without any nonlinear effect. The Yurke- Stoler state and its special cases, the even and odd cat states, obtained as some simple examples of the method. A general experimental setup is proposed to realize a variety of superposition states.

abstract: We study photon correlations generated by scattering from three-level systems (3LS) in one dimension. The two systems studied are a 3LS in a semi-infinite waveguide (3LS plus a mirror) and two 3LS in an infinite waveguide (double 3LS). Our scattering approach naturally connects photon correlation effects with inelastically scattered photons; it corresponds to input-output theory in the weak-probe limit. At the resonance where electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) occurs, we find that no photons are scattered inelastically and hence there are no induced correlations. Slightly away from EIT, the total inelastically scattered flux is large, being substantially enhanced due to the additional interference paths. This enhancement carries over to the two-photon correlation function, which exhibits non-classical behavior such as strong bunching with a very long time-scale. The long time scale originates from the slow-light effect associated with EIT.

abstract: We study the twist defects in the toric code model introduced by Bombin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 030403 (2010)]. Using a generalized 2D Jordan-Wigner transformation, we show explicitly the twist defects carry unpaired Majorana zero modes. We also draw the same conclusion using two alternative approaches of a perturbation theory and a projective construction. We propose a quantum non-demolition measurement scheme of the parity of Majorana modes. Such a scheme provides an alternative avenue to demonstrate the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions with measurement-based braidings.

abstract: We show that the second order traps in the control landscape for a three-level $\Lambda$-system found in our previous work {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 106}, 120402 (2011) are not local maxima: there exist directions in the space of controls in which the objective grows. The growth of the objective is slow --- at best 4th order for weak variations of the control. This implies that simple gradient methods would be problematic in the vicinity of second order traps, where more sophisticated algorithms that exploit the higher order derivative information are necessary to climb up the control landscape efficiently. The theory is supported by a numerical investigation of the landscape in the vicinity of the $\varepsilon(t)=0$ second order trap, performed using the GRAPE and BFGS algorithms.

abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition on a time-independent Hamiltonian and arbitrary initial state of a two-level quantum system which guarantees that the initial state will time evolve to another state from which it can be distinguished with an a priori established minimal error probability $\delta \in [0,1/2]$. The time required for the initial state to evolve to such a probabilistically distinguishable state is compared to previously established quantum speed limits giving lower bounds on the time required for evolution between nonorthogonal states. We use the explicit distinguishability time to provide a succinct derivation of the quantum brachistochrone, i.e., the Hamiltonian generating shortest time evolution between two states having equal magnitude Bloch vectors. As a consequence of the distinguishability condition, we find that if a given unitary does not evolve a given pure state to an orthogonal state, then there exist mixed states in the Bloch ball that time evolve faster than the given pure state and that reach a greater level of distinguishability under the given unitary. We show that such mixed states exist even in the case of nonunitary evolution by considering a two-level system resonantly coupled to a single mode electromagnetic field.

abstract: We demonstrate a robust experimental method for determining the depth of individual shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with $\sim1$ nm uncertainty. We use a confocal microscope to observe single NV centers and detect the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal produced by objective immersion oil, which has well understood nuclear spin properties, on the diamond surface. We determine the NV center depth by analyzing the NV NMR data using a model that describes the interaction of a single NV center with the statistically-polarized proton spin bath. We repeat this procedure for a large number of individual, shallow NV centers and compare the resulting NV depths to the mean value expected from simulations of the ion implantation process used to create the NV centers, with reasonable agreement.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04212
abstract: Recent advances in quantum technology have led to the development and manufacturing of experimental programmable quantum annealers that could potentially solve certain quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems faster than their classical analogues. The applicability of such devices for many theoretical and practical optimization problems, which are often constrained, is severely limited by the sparse, rigid layout of the devices' quantum bits. Traditionally, constraints are addressed by the addition of penalty terms to the Hamiltonian of the problem, which in turn requires prohibitively increasing physical resources while also restricting the dynamical range of the interactions. Here we propose a method for encoding constrained optimization problems on quantum annealers that eliminates the need for penalty terms and thereby removes many of the obstacles associated with the implementation of these. We argue the advantages of the proposed technique and illustrate its effectiveness. We then conclude by discussing the experimental feasibility of the suggested method as well as its potential to boost the encodability of other optimization problems.

abstract: Many phenomena of strongly correlated materials are encapsulated in the Fermi-Hubbard model whose thermodynamical properties can be computed from its grand canonical potential according to standard procedures. In general, there is no closed form solution for lattices of more than one spatial dimension, but solutions can be approximated with cluster perturbation theory. To model long-range effects such as order parameters, a powerful method to compute the cluster's Green's function consists in finding its self-energy through a variational principle of the grand canonical potential. This opens the possibility of studying various phase transitions at finite temperature in the Fermi-Hubbard model. However, a classical cluster solver quickly hits an exponential wall in the memory (or computation time) required to store the computation variables. Here it is shown theoretically that that the cluster solver can be mapped to a subroutine on a quantum computer whose quantum memory scales as the number of orbitals in the simulated cluster. A quantum computer with a few tens of qubits could therefore simulate the thermodynamical properties of complex fermionic lattices inaccessible to classical supercomputers.

abstract: We study the evolution of the quantum state of $n$ photons in $m$ different modes when they go through a lossless linear optical system. We show that there are quantum evolution operators $U$ that cannot be built with linear optics alone unless the number of photons or the number of modes is equal to one. The evolution for single photons can be controlled with the known realization of any unitary proved by Reck, Zeilinger, Bernstein and Bertani. The evolution for a single mode corresponds to the trivial evolution in a phase shifter. We analyze these two cases and prove that any other combination of the number of photons and modes produces a Hilbert state too big for the linear optics system to give any desired evolution.

abstract: We have studied the role of thermalization in lifetime reduction of quantum memory based on multi-atomic ensembles. Herein, it is shown impossibility to remove the thermaization-caused decoherence in such systems using the methods of dynamical decoupling. We have analyzed the existing models of the thermalization and have proposed a new understanding of the thermalization as a result of the internal processes which are not described in the unitary quantum dynamics formalism. The possible ways for reducing the negative influence of thermalization on the quantum memory lifetime are also discussed.

abstract: CMOS-compatible photonic chips are highly desirable for real-world quantum optics devices due to their scalability, robustness, and integration with electronics. Despite impressive advances using Silicon nanostructures, challenges remain in reducing their linear and nonlinear losses and in creating narrowband photons necessary for interfacing with quantum memories. Here we demonstrate the potential of the silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform by realizing an ultracompact, bright, entangled photon-pair source with selectable photon bandwidths down to 30 MHz, which is unprecedented for an integrated source. Leveraging Si3N4's moderate thermal expansion, simple temperature control of the chip enables precise wavelength stabilization and tunability without active control. Single-mode photon pairs at 1550 nm are generated at rates exceeding 107 s-1 with mW's of pump power and are used to produce time-bin entanglement. Moreover, Si3N4 allows for operation from the visible to the mid-IR, which make it highly promising for a wide range of integrated quantum photonics applications.

abstract: We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$. We choose measurement settings adaptively and stochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm divides the estimation in two distinct steps: (i) Before the first detection of vacuum state, the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to detecting vacuum with the setting, which makes using too similar measurement settings twice unlikely and (ii) after the first detection of vacuum, we focus measurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step (i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of $\alpha$. Compared to nonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots required to achieve certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of $\alpha$ in phase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against readout errors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in the step (i).

abstract: Quantum spin models have been studied extensively in one and higher dimensions. Furthermore, these systems have been doped with holes to study $t$--$J$ models of $SU(2)$ spin-1/2. Their anyonic counterparts can be built from non-Abelian anyons, such as Fibonacci anyons described by $SU(2)_3$ theories, which are quantum deformations of the $SU(2)$ algebra. Inspired by the physics of $SU(2)$ spins, several works have explored ladders of Fibonacci anyons and also one-dimensional (1D) $t$--$J$ models. Here we aim to explore the combined effects of extended dimensionality and doping by studying ladders composed of coupled chains of interacting itinerant Fibonacci anyons. We show analytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be mapped onto effective 1D models. These effective models can either be gapped models of hole pairs, or gapless models described by $t$--$J$ (or modified $t$--$J$--$V$) chains of Fibonacci anyons, whose spectrum exhibits a fractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom. By using exact diagonalizations for two-leg and three-leg ladders, we show that indeed the doped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of $t$--$J$ chains. In the strong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two different kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\tau$'s and light $\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian) topological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map the two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and light $\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the appearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological gapped phase is suggested for another density regime.

abstract: We analyze the power output of a quantum dot machine coupled to two electronic reservoirs via thermoelectric contacts, and to two thermal reservoirs - one hot and one cold. This machine is a nanoscale analogue of a conventional thermocouple heat-engine, in which the active region being heated is unavoidably also exchanging heat with its cold environment. Heat exchange between the dot and the thermal reservoirs is treated as a capacitive coupling to electronic fluctuations in localized levels, modeled as two additional quantum dots. The resulting multiple-dot setup is described using a master equation approach. We observe an "exotic" power generation, which remains finite even when the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs is zero (in other words the heat coming from the hot reservoir all escapes into the cold environment). This effect can be understood in terms of a non-local effect in which the heat flow from heat source to the cold environment generates power via a mechanism which we refer to as Coulomb heat drag. It relies on the fact that there is no relaxation in the quantum dot system, so electrons within it have a non-thermal energy distribution. More poetically, one can say that we find a spatial separation of the first-law of thermodynamics (heat to work conversion) from the second-law of thermodynamics (generation of entropy). We present circumstances in which this non-thermal system can generate more power than any conventional macroscopic thermocouple (with local thermalization), even when the latter works with Carnot efficiency.

A model for the representations of these Heisenberg groups and automorphism groups is constructed. A pseudo-differential operator enables a parallel treatment of spaces defined over finite and real fields.

abstract: Many-body systems relaxing to equilibrium can exhibit complex dynamics even if their steady state is trivial. At low temperatures or high densities their evolution is often dominated by steric hindrances affecting particle motion [1,2,3]. Local rearrangements are highly constrained, giving rise to collective - and often slow - relaxation.This dynamics can be difficult to analyse from first principles, but the essential physical ingredients are captured by idealized lattice models with so- called kinetic constraints [4]. Here we experimentally realize a many-body system exhibiting manifest kinetic constraints and measure its dynamical properties. In the cold Rydberg gas used in our experiments, the nature of the constraints can be tailored through the detuning of the excitation lasers from resonance [5,6,7,8], which controls whether the system undergoes correlated or anti- correlated dynamics. Our results confirm recent theoretical predictions [5,6], and highlight the analogy between the dynamics of interacting Rydberg gases and that of soft-matter systems.

abstract: We consider non-equilibrium time evolution after a quench of a global Hamiltonian parameter in a system described by a Hamiltonian with local interactions. Within this background, we propose a protocol that allows to change global properties of the state by flipping a switch that modifies a local term of the Hamiltonian. A light-cone that separates two globally different regions originates from the switch. The expectation values of macroscopic observables, that is to say local observables that are spatially averaged within a subsystem, experience a characteristic linear time evolution. Remarkably, the process is almost reversible: flipping again the switch produces a new light-cone with the same morphology. Finally, we test the protocol under repeated projective measurements. As explicit example we study the dynamics in a simple exactly solvable model, but the same description applies to more general situations.
