abstract: A critical ingredient for realizing large-scale quantum information processors will be the ability to make economical use of qubit control hardware. We demonstrate an extensible strategy for reusing control hardware on same-frequency transmon qubits in a circuit QED chip with surface-code-compatible connectivity. A vector switch matrix enables selective broadcasting of input pulses to multiple transmons with individual tailoring of pulse quadratures for each, as required to minimize the effects of leakage on weakly anharmonic qubits. Using randomized benchmarking, we compare multiple broadcasting strategies that each pass the surface-code error threshold for single-qubit gates. In particular, we introduce a selective-broadcasting control strategy using five pulse primitives, which allows independent, simultaneous Clifford gates on arbitrary numbers of qubits.

abstract: Magnonics is an emerging field with potential applications in classical and quantum information processing. Freely propagating magnons in two-dimensional media suffer from dispersion, which limits their effective range and fidelity. We show the design of controllable magnonic circuitry, that utilise surface current carrying wires to create magnonic waveguides. We also show the design of a magnonic directional coupler and controllable Michelson interferometer to demonstrate its utility for information processing tasks.

abstract: The initial state of a system-bath composite is needed as the input for prediction from any quantum evolution equation to describe, for example, the noise on the system from joint evolution of the system-bath interaction dynamics. The conventional wisdom is to simply write down an uncorrelated state as if the system and bath were prepared in the absence of each other; or one uses a symbolic system-bath state, allowing for possible arbitrary correlations--quantum or classical--between the system and the bath, but the latter approach lacks predictive power unless one can say something about that symbolic state. Here, we show how one uses ideas from quantum tomography or state estimation to deduce an initial system-bath state consistent with the available information. In typical experimentally relevant situations, such a state turns out to be uncorrelated or almost uncorrelated between the system and the bath. This has implications on the subject of subsequent non-Markovian or non-completely-positive dynamics of the system, where the non-complete-positivity stems from initial nontrivial correlations between the system and the bath. Deviation from predictions based on such an almost uncorrelated state can be indicative of accidental control of hidden degrees of freedom in the bath.

abstract: Stopping light via an electromagnetically induced transparency setup for x-ray pulses in a thin film planar x-ray cavity is investigated theoretically. The pulse is nearly resonant to the 14.4 keV M\"ossbauer transition in $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$, with one nm-thin layer of the latter embedded in the thin-film x-ray cavity. Via a moderate hyperfine magnetic field which takes over the role of the control field, electromagnetically induced transparency and slowing down of the x-ray pulse occurs in the cavity setup. We show that by switching off the control magnetic field, a narrowband x-ray pulse can be completely stored in the cavity for approx. hundred ns. Coherent storage occurs in this scenario by imprinting the x-ray field onto nuclear coherences in a controllable and robust manner. Additional manipulation of the external magnetic field can lead to both group velocity and phase control of the pulse in the x-ray cavity sample.

abstract: Future photonic quantum networks will require interfaces between different photon frequency regimes. Here we envisage for the first time an optomechanical system that bridges optical photons and x-rays with the aim to control the latter and exploit their unique properties regarding large momentum transfer, focusability, penetration, robustness and detection efficiency. The x-ray-optical interface system comprises of an optomechanical cavity and a movable microlever interacting with both an optical laser and with x-rays via resonant nuclear scattering. We develop a theoretical model for this system and show that x-ray absorption spectra of nuclei can be tuned optomechanically. In particular, our theoretical simulations predict optomechanically induced transparency of x-rays.

abstract: Quantum teleportation, which depends on entangled states, is a fascinating subject and an important branch of quantum information processing. The present work reports the use of a dipolar spin thermal system as a quantum channel to perform quantum teleportation. Non-locality, tested by violation of Bell's inequality and thermal entanglement, measured by negativity, unquestionably show that even entangled states that do not violate Bell's inequality can be useful for teleportation.

abstract: We consider retarded settings in the context of a Bell-type experiment. The retarded setting is defined as the value the setting would have taken were it not for some external intervention (for example, by a human). We derive retarded Bell inequalities that explicitly take into account the retarded settings. These inequalities are not violated by Quantum Theory (or any other theory) when the retarded settings are equal to the actual settings. We construct a simple model that reproduces Quantum Theory when the retarded and actual settings are equal, but violates it when they are not. We discuss using humans to choose the settings in this type of experiment and the implications of a violation of Quantum Theory (in agreement with the retarded Bell inequalities) in this context.

abstract: Coherent control of quantum systems has far-reaching implications in quantum engineering. In this context, coherent population trapping (CPT) involving dark resonances has played a prominent role, leading to a wealth of major applications including laser cooling of atoms and molecules, optical magnetometry, light storage and highly precise atomic clocks. Extending CPT methods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in cryogenic environments for electron spin impurities and superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrate efficient CPT of a single nuclear spin in a room temperature solid. To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a $\Lambda$-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin states addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a relaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by spontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally controlled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from consecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin $\Lambda$-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us (i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state and (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of dark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences. This work offers new prospects for quantum state preparation, information storage in hybrid quantum systems and metrology.

abstract: The existence of higher order entanglement in the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes is established using the perturbative solutions of the Heisenberg equations of motion for various field modes that are obtained using the Sen-Mandal technique and a fully quantum mechanical Hamiltonian that describes the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes. Specifically, the perturbative Sen-Mandal solutions are exploited here to show the signature of the higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement. In some special cases, we have also observed higher order entanglement in the partially spontaneous Raman processes. Further, it is shown that the depth of the nonclassicality indicators (parameters) can be manipulated by the specific choice of coupling constants, and it is observed that the depth of nonclassicality parameters increases with the order.

abstract: Direct detection of vacuum fluctuations and analysis of sub-cycle quantum properties of the electric field are explored by a paraxial quantum theory of ultrafast electro-optic sampling. The feasibility of such experiments is demonstrated by realistic calculations adopting a thin ZnTe electro-optic crystal and stable few-femtosecond laser pulses. We show that nonlinear mixing of a short near-infrared probe pulse with multi-terahertz vacuum field modes leads to an increase of the signal variance with respect to the shot noise level. The vacuum contribution increases significantly for appropriate length of the nonlinear crystal, short probe pulse durations, tight focusing, and sufficiently large number of photons per probe pulse. If the vacuum input is squeezed, the signal variance depends on the probe delay. Temporal positions with noise level below the pure vacuum may be traced with a sub-cycle accuracy.

abstract: High contrast matter-wave interferometry is essential in various fundamental quantum mechanical experiments as well as for technical applications. Thereby, contrast and sensitivity are typically reduced by decoherence and dephasing effects. While decoherence accounts for a general loss of quantum information in a system due to entanglement with the environment, dephasing is due to collective time-dependent external phase shifts, which can be related to temperature drifts, mechanical vibrations or electromagnetic oscillations. In contrast to decoherence, dephasing can in principle be reversed. Here, we demonstrate in experiment and theory a method for the analysis and reduction of the influence of dephasing noise and perturbations consisting of several external frequencies in an electron interferometer. This technique uses the high spatial and temporal resolution of a delay line detector to reveal and remove dephasing perturbations by second order correlation analysis. It allows matter-wave experiments under perturbingly lab conditions and can be applied in principle to electron, atom, ion, neutron and molecule interferometers.

abstract: The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool for quantum many-body effects is explored. It is demonstrated that an array of electrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the Bose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon regime to the Anderson tight-binding model. Employing a density matrix formalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the interplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization process. It is found that the phonon population remains localized for low enough temperatures even if the total population of excitations is lost from the array due to dissipative effects; with increasing temperatures the localization is lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing in the steady regime a fully thermalized system. Finally, we consider a possible experimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a superconducting qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators. We also consider the possibility of using the proposed quantum simulator for realizing continuous-time quantum walks.

abstract: Theoretical prediction of phonon transport in modern semiconductor nanodevices requires atomic resolution of device features and quantum transport models covering coherent and incoherent effects. The nonequilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) is known to serve this purpose very well, but is numerically very expensive. This work extends the very efficient B\"uttiker probe concept to phonon NEGF and discusses all implications of this method. B\"uttiker probe parameters are presented that reproduce within NEGF experimental phonon conductances of Si and Ge between 10K and 1000K. Results of this method in SiGe heterojunctions illustrate the impact of interface relaxation on the device heat conductance and the importance of inelastic scattering for the phonon distribution.

abstract: Manipulating the flow of energy in nanoscale and molecular photonic devices is of both fundamental interest and central importance for applications in light harvesting optoelectronics. Under erratic solar irradiance conditions, unregulated power fluctuations in a light harvesting photocell lead to inefficient energy storage in conventional solar cells and potentially fatal oxidative damage in photosynthesis. Here, we show that regulation against these fluctuations arises naturally within a two-channel quantum heat engine photocell, thus enabling the efficient conversion of varying incident solar spectrum at Earth's surface. Remarkably, absorption in the green portion of the spectrum is avoided, as it provides no inherent regulatory benefit. Our findings illuminate a quantum structural origin of regulation, provide a novel optoelectronic design strategy, and may elucidate the link between photoprotection in photosynthesis and the predominance of green plants on Earth.

abstract: We realize tunable coupling between two superconducting transmission line resonators. The coupling is mediated by a non-hysteretic rf SQUID acting as a flux-tunable mutual inductance between the resonators. From the mode distance observed in spectroscopy experiments, we derive a coupling strength ranging between -320MHz and 37 MHz. In the case where the coupling strength is about zero, the microwave power cross transmission between the two resonators can be reduced by almost four orders of magnitude compared to the case where the coupling is switched on. In addition, we observe parametric amplification by applying a suitable additional drive tone.

abstract: The spin current and spin conductivity is computed through thermally driven stochastic process. By evaluating the Kramers equation and with the help of $\vec{k}.\vec{p}$ method we have studied the spin Hall scenario. Due to the thermal assistance, the Kane model parameters get modified, which consequently modulate the spin orbit coupling(SOC). This modified SOC causes the spin current to change in a finite amount.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.06857
abstract: It is will known that quantum field theory at the formal level is gauge invariant. However a calculation of the vacuum polarization tensor will include non-gauge invariant terms. These terms must be removed from the calculation in order to get a physically correct result. One common way to do this today is the technique of "dimensional regularization". It has recently been noted [2] that at one time a supersymmetric-like solution to the problem was explored - that is, the right combination of fields would cause the offending terms to cancel out. I will examine some of this early work and pose the question - why do the non-gauge invariant terms appear in the first place? I will show that this is due to an improper mathematical step in the formulation of the pertubative expansion. I will then show that when this step is corrected the result is gauge invariant. However a supersymmetric-like solution is still required to cancel out a divergent term.
