abstract: I distinguish two types of reduction within the context of quantum-classical relations, which I designate "formal" and "empirical". Formal reduction holds or fails to hold solely by virtue of the mathematical relationship between two theories; it is therefore a two-place, a priori relation between theories. Empirical reduction requires one theory to encompass the range of physical behaviors that are well-modeled in another theory; in a certain sense, it is a three-place, a posteriori relation connecting the theories and the domain of physical reality that both serve to describe. Focusing on the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, I argue that while certain formal results concerning singular limits as Planck's constant goes to zero have been taken to preclude the possibility of reduction between these theories, such results at most block reduction in the formal sense; little if any reason has been given for thinking that they block reduction in the empirical sense. I then briefly outline a strategy for empirical reduction that is suggested by work on decoherence theory, arguing that this sort of account remains a fully viable route to the empirical reduction of classical to quantum mechanics and is unaffected by such singular limits.

abstract: I show explicitly how concerns about wave function collapse and ontology can be decoupled from the bulk of technical analysis necessary to recover localized, approximately Newtonian trajectories from quantum theory. In doing so, I demonstrate that the account of classical behavior provided by decoherence theory can be straightforwardly tailored to give accounts of classical behavior on multiple interpretations of quantum theory, including the Everett, de Broglie-Bohm and GRW interpretations. I further show that this interpretation-neutral, decoherence-based account conforms to a general view of inter-theoretic reduction in physics that I have elaborated elsewhere, which differs from the oversimplified picture that treats reduction as a matter of simply taking limits. This interpretation-neutral account rests on a general three-pronged strategy for reduction between quantum and classical theories that combines decoherence, an appropriate form of Ehrenfest's Theorem, and a decoherence-compatible mechanism for collapse. It also incorporates a novel argument as to why branch-relative trajectories should be approximately Newtonian, which is based on a little-discussed extension of Ehrenfest's Theorem to open systems, rather than on the more commonly cited but less germane closed-systems version. In the Conclusion, I briefly suggest how the strategy for quantum-classical reduction described here might be extended to reduction between other classical and quantum theories, including classical and quantum field theory and classical and quantum gravity.

abstract: Quantum error correction protects the quantum state against noise and decoherence in quantum communication and quantum computation, which enables one to perform fault-torrent quantum information processing. We experimentally demonstrate a quantum error correction scheme with a five-wave-packet code against a single stochastic error, the original theoretical model of which is firstly proposed by S. L. Braunstein and T. A. Walker. Five submodes of a continuous variable cluster entangled state of light are used for five encoding channels. Especially, in our encoding scheme the information of the input state is only distributed on three of the five channels and thus any error appearing in the remained two channels never affects the output state, i.e. the output quantum state is immune from the error in the two channels. The stochastic error on a single channel is corrected for both vacuum and squeezed input states and the achieved fidelities of the output states are beyond the corresponding classical limit.

abstract: This is a Bachelor's thesis on quantum key distribution in the non-asymptotic regime submitted to the Leibniz Universit\"at Hannover, Germany. It deals with the question how to generate a key to encrypt messages between two honest parties that an eavesdropper does not gain any information about. The purpose of this thesis is to give an overview over the current state of the prepare and measure quantum key distribution protocol and its security proof with a specific focus on the non-asymptotic case. Therefore, we present the different steps of the protocol and retrace them with the help of the BB84-protocol. Afterwards, the security proof of this protocol is introduced and in the end, we have a closer look at the quantum capacity and calculate it for the amplitude damping channel.

abstract: We provide general sufficient conditions for the efficient classical simulation of quantum-optics experiments that involve inputting states to a quantum process and making measurements at the output. The first condition is based on the negativity of phase-space quasiprobability distributions (PQDs) of the output state of the process and the output measurements; the second one is based on the negativity of PQDs of the input states, the output measurements, and the transition function associated with the process. We apply these conditions to implementations of boson sampling that use single-photon or spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion sources. We show that above some threshold for loss and noise, the boson-sampling experiments are classically simulatable.

abstract: We propose a scheme to prepare optical Schr\"odinger-cat states in a traveling wave setting. Two states are similarly prepared via the self-Kerr effect and after mixing them, one mode is measured by homodyne detection. In the other mode a superposition of coherent states is conditionally prepared. The advantage of the scheme is that assuming a small Kerr effect one can prepare with high probability one from a set of Schr\"odinger-cat states. The measured value of the quadrature provides the information, which state from the set is actually prepared.

abstract: While traditional thermodynamics concerns itself with the behavior of macroscopic observables of systems composed of many particles, the thermodynamics of nanoscale or quantum systems is the study of the manipulation of microscopic degrees of freedom of single or very small systems. In traditional thermodynamics, one does not have full control of devices and one can only manipulate macroscopic properties of the system or heat engine. On the other hand, for small systems, we imagine that we can manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom. Allowing such fine-grained control of microscopic degrees of freedom of the system and bath, one still obtains constraints on what state transformations are possible, akin to a set of second laws. These constraints are not only necessary, but one can also achieve them if one is allowed to manipulate system-bath microstates. Nonetheless, if one wants to experimentally manipulate a thermodynamical system, implementing an arbitrary operation which controls all microscopic degrees of freedom is infeasible in the foreseeable future, especially if the control over microstates of the heat bath is required. Here we show that arbitrary operations between the system and bath can be replaced by two very simple operations - changing the energy levels of the system and thermalising any two system energy levels. Using these two simple operations, one can distill the optimal amount of work from a system, as well as perform the reverse formation process. Even more surprisingly, using only these two operations and one ancilla qubit in a thermal state, one can transform any state into any other state allowable by the second laws. We thus have the remarkable result that the second laws hold for fine-grained control of system-bath, but can be achieved using very coarse control. This brings the full array of thermal operations into a regime accessible by experiment.

abstract: Recently, a series of articles by Combes et al. has shown that it was possible to greatly improve the measurement rate of a register of qubits for given detector resources by means of a clever feedback control scheme. However, this speed-up came at an exponential cost in terms of complexity and memory use. In this article, I propose a simple efficient algorithm --exponentially more frugal in memory and less complex to implement-- which is asymptotically as fast. I use extensively the implicit classicality of the situation to provide a slightly more straightforward interpretation of the results. I compute the speed-up rates exactly in the case of the proposed model and in the case of the open-loop scheme of Combes et al. and prove that they indeed provide the same asymptotic speed-up.

abstract: We determine the relevant spinor valued wave functions for a two-dimensional quantum ring in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The case of constant SOI strength is considered first, then we investigate the physical consequences of time-dependent (oscillating) SOI strength. Floquet's method is applied to find time-dependent eigenspinors, and it is shown that the Floquet quasienergies and thus their differences (the generalized Rabi frequencies) are determined by the radial boundary conditions. Time evolution of various initial states is calculated.

abstract: In this work we address the problem of realizing a reliable quantum memory based on zero-energy Majorana modes in the presence of experimental constraints on the operations aimed at recovering the information. In particular, we characterize the best recovery operation acting only on the zero-energy Majorana modes and the memory fidelity that can be therewith achieved. In order to understand the effect of such restriction, we discuss two examples of noise models acting on the topological system and compare the amount of information that can be recovered by accessing either the whole system, or the zero-modes only, with particular attention to the scaling with the size of the system and the energy gap. We explicitly discuss the case of a thermal bosonic environment inducing a parity-preserving Markovian dynamics in which the introduced memory fidelity decays exponentially in time, independent from system size, thus showing the impossibility to retrieve the information by acting on the zero-modes only. We argue, however, that even in the presence of experimental limitations, the Hamiltonian gap is still beneficial to the storage of information.

abstract: Currently available separability criteria for continuous-variable states are generally focused on Gaussian bosonic states. The well-know separability criterion of Duan et al. and Simon, for example, gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a two-mode Gaussian state to be separable. Here, we introduce an improvement of this criterion that enables a stronger entanglement detection for non-Gaussian states. The improved condition is based on the knowledge of an additional parameter, namely the degree of Gaussianity of the state, and exploits a connection with Gaussianity-bounded uncertainty relations [Phys. Rev. A 86, 030102 (2012)]. We exhibit families of non-Gaussian entangled states whose entanglement remains undetected by the Duan-Simon criterion.

abstract: The problem of entanglement detection for arbitrary spin systems is analyzed. We demonstrate how a single measurement of the squared total spin can probabilistically discern separable from entangled many-particle states. For achieving this goal, we construct a tripartite analogy between the degeneracy of entanglement witness eigenstates, tensor products of SO(3) representations and classical lattice walks with special constraints. Within this framework, degeneracies are naturally given by generalized Catalan numbers and determine the fraction of states that are decidedly entangled. In addition, we introduce the concept of a "sterile entanglement witness", which detects entanglement without affecting much the system's dynamics. We show that our proposed witness is sterile when the system becomes large enough.

abstract: We present a proposal for a probing scheme utilizing Dicke superradiance to obtain information about ultracold atoms in optical lattices. A probe photon is absorbed collectively by an ensemble of lattice atoms generating a Dicke state. The lattice dynamics (e.g., tunneling) affects the coherence properties of that Dicke state and thus alters the superradiant emission characteristics -- which in turn provides insight into the lattice (dynamics). Comparing the Bose-Hubbard and the Fermi-Hubbard model, we find similar superradiance in the strongly interacting Mott insulator regime, but crucial differences in the weakly interacting (superfluid or metallic) phase. Furthermore, we study the possibility to detect whether a quantum phase transition between the two regimes can be considered adiabatic or a quantum quench.

abstract: For systems analogous to a linear harmonic oscillator, the simplest way to characterize the state is by a covariance matrix containing the symmetrically-ordered moments of position and momentum. We show that without direct access to either position or momentum, the estimation of the covariance matrix of non-classical states is still possible using interference with a classical noisy and low- intensity reference and linear detection of energy. Such a detection technique will allow to estimate macroscopic quantum states of electromagnetic radiation without a coherent high-intensity local oscillator. It can be directly applied to estimate the covariance matrix of macroscopically bright squeezed states of light.

abstract: Ultracold neutrons confined in the Earth's gravitational field display quantized energy levels that have been observed for over a decade. In recent resonance spectroscopy experiments [T. Jenke et al., Nature Phys. 7, 468 (2011)], the transition between two such gravitational quantum states was driven by the mechanical modulation of one of the plates that confines the neutrons. Here we show that, by applying a sinusoidal modulation with slowly varying frequency (chirp), the neutrons can be brought to any excited state, however large its energy, by climbing the energy levels one by one. This technique should make it possible to observe the quantum-classical transition that occurs at high energies. The proposed experiment is realizable using current technology and could significantly improve the sensitivity of future tests of gravitational physics.

abstract: The quantum-mechanical counterpart of a classical random walk offers a rich dynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound states (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a topological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of nonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that combines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes of opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear dynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and trap it there.

abstract: The optimal measurement configuration, i.e., the optimal input quantum state and measurement in the form of a POVM with two elements, is investigated in this paper for qubit and generalized Pauli channels. The channel directions are defined as the contracting directions of the channel with an arbitrary fixed basis of Pauli- matrices. In the qubit Pauli channel case with known channel directions it is shown that the optimal configuration that maximizes the Fisher information of the estimated parameters consists of three von Neumann measurements together with pure input states directed to the appropriate channel directions. Extensions of these results for generalized Pauli channels are also given. Furthermore, a computationally efficient estimation method is proposed for estimating the channel directions in the qubit Pauli channel case. The efficiency of this method is illustrated by simulations: it is shown that its variance is of order 1/N, where N is the number of used measurements.

We investigate the same problem only in the case when there are some a priori information about the state, specifically when some parameters are known. In this paper we mainly focus on solving a 3-dimensional optimization problem, which gives us a non-trivial example for the so-called conditional SIC- POVMs, a straightforward generalization of the concept of SIC-POVMs. We also present other special cases to show further applications of the proposed numerical methods and to illustrate the complexity of this topic.

abstract: We investigate the continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit undergoing fluorescence. The fluorescence of the qubit is detected via a phase-preserving heterodyne measurement, giving the fluorescence quadrature signals as two continuous qubit readout results. By using the stochastic path integral approach to the measurement physics, we derive most likely paths between boundary conditions on the state, and compute approximate time correlation functions between all stochastic variables via diagrammatic perturbation theory. We focus on paths that increase in energy during the continuous measurement. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo numerical simulation of the trajectories, and we find close agreement between direct simulation and theory. We generalize this analysis to arbitrary diffusive quantum systems that are continuously monitored.

abstract: Real world quantum systems are open to perpetual influence from the wider environment. Vacuum gravitational fluctuations provide a most fundamental source of the environmental influence through their universal interactions with all forms of energy and matter causing decoherence. This may have subtle implications on precision laboratory experiments and astronomical observations and could limit the ultimate capacities for quantum technologies prone to decoherence. To establish the essential physical mechanism of decoherence under weak spacetime fluctuations, we carry out a sequence of analytical steps utilizing the Dirac constraint quantization and gauge invariant influence functional techniques, resulting in a general master equation of a compact form, that describes an open quantum gravitational system with arbitrary bosonic fields. An initial application of the theory is illustrated by the implied quantum gravitational dissipation of light as well as (non)relativistic massive or massless scalar particles. Related effects could eventually lead to important physical consequences including those on a cosmological scale and for a large number of correlated particles.

abstract: We evaluate the coupling of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold, paramagnetic atoms to the magnetic field of the current in a mechanically vibrating carbon nanotube within the frame of a full quantum theory. We find that the interaction is strong enough to sense quantum features of the nanowire current noise spectrum by means of hyperfine-state-selective atom counting. Such a non-destructive measurement of the electric current via its magnetic field corresponds to the classical galvanometer scheme, extended to the quantum regime of charge transport. The calculated high sensitivity of the interaction in the nanowire-BEC hybrid systems opens up the possibility of quantum control, which may be further extended to include other relevant degrees of freedom.

We also provide an approximate form of rejection sampling that makes rejection filtering tractable in cases where exact rejection sampling is not efficient. Finally, we present several numerical examples of rejection filtering that show its ability to track time dependent parameters in online settings and also benchmark its performance on MNIST classification problems.

abstract: The electron spin in semiconductor quantum dot can be coherently controlled by an external electric field, an effect called electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR). There are several mechanisms underlie the EDSR effect, among which there is a hyperfine mechanism, where the spin-electric coupling is mediated by the electron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. Here, we investigate the influence of the frequency modulation (FM) on the spin-flip efficiency. Our results reveal that FM plays an important role in the hyperfine mechanism. Without FM, the electric field almost cannot flip the electron spin, the spin-flip probability is only about 20%. While under the FM, the spin- flip probability can be improved approximately to 70%. Especially, we find that the modulation amplitude has a lower bound, which is related to the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field.

abstract: Electron transport through mesoscopic, one-dimensional rings with asymmetric injection into the arms of the ring is studied, in the presence of a Aharonov-Bohm flux, by means of an appropriate $\boldsymbol{S}$ matrix. This matrix is expressed in terms of two parameters one of which ($\lambda$) accounts phenomenologically for this asymmetric injection into the arms of the ring. In addition, the effect of a scatterer placed in one arm of the ring is considered. Explicit expressions are obtained for the transmission as a function of the incident electron energy, the magnetic field, the asymmetry parameter $\lambda$, and the strength of the scatterer. Results of the literature for symmetric rings are described by $\lambda=1$ and readily recovered. We relate our results to rings of finite width.

abstract: The standard uncertainty relations (UR) in quantum mechanics are typically used for unbounded operators (like the canonical pair). This implies the need for the control of the domain problems. On the other hand, the use of (possibly bounded) functions of basic observables usually leads to more complex and less readily interpretable relations. Also, UR may turn trivial for certain states if the commutator of observables is not proportional to a positive operator. In this letter we consider a generalization of standard UR resulting from the use of two, instead of one, vector states. The possibility to link these states to each other in various ways adds additional flexibility to UR, which may compensate some of the above mentioned drawbacks. We discuss applications of the general scheme, leading not only to technical improvements, but also to interesting new insight.

abstract: Superfluidity is a remarkable manifestation of quantum many-body effects at the macroscopic scale. Various features of superfluidity in liquid He and Bose-Einstein condensates remain challenging to study, limited by the complexity of the experiments or difficulty in measuring in situ all parameters of the wave function. There is therefore a continuous search for alternative superfluids to address these challenges. We demonstrate superfluid behaviour in a room-temperature system that relies on photons rather than atoms for the supporting fluid medium. The repulsive photon- photon interaction is mediated by a thermal optical nonlinearity and is inherently nonlocal. We experimentally observe the nucleation of quantised vortices from an extended physical obstacle and the nonlocal nature of the fluid is shown to deform the vortex geometry. Our results show that photon fluids provide a valid alternative to other superfluids with applications from the study of nonlinear wave turbulence and analogue gravity to artificial gauge fields.

These two approaches has different but overlapping areas of validity, phenomenology and set of physical outcomes. In this paper we discuss the relation between CT and ETH and propose a formulation of ETH in terms of the reduced density matrix. We provide strong numerical evidences for the proposal.

title: What is realism and how can it be non-local?
authors: Sofia Wechsler
comments: This paper was withdrawn by the author because since its publication, new facts and conclusions appeared, s.t. part of the arguments presented here are no more tenable. An updated account of the realism hypothesis in QM vs. non-locality can be found at arXiv:1009.2986v2 [physics.gen-ph]
