**1.    Discrete-time quantum walks as generators of multipartite entanglement**  
Joshua Lockhart, Mauro Paternostro

<blockquote>
<p>
We present an extension of the discrete time quantum walk on a graph to include a qubit at each vertex of the graph, with which the walker interacts at each time step. We show that allowing for a controlled-Z interaction between the walker and the vertex qubits generates multipartite entanglement between the qubits. We demonstrate that for particular coin operators the system generates a highly entangled cluster state, of use in one way quantum computation.
