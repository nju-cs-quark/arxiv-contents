abstract: Logical non-locality is completely characterised by Hardy's 'paradox' in (2,2,l) and (2,k,2) scenarios. We consider a variety of consequences and applications of this fact. (i) Polynomial algorithms may be given for deciding logical non-locality. (ii) Bell states are the only entangled two-qubit states which are not logically non-local under projective measurements. (iii) It is possible to witness Hardy non-locality with certainty in a simple tripartite quantum system. (iv) Non-commutativity of observables is necessary and sufficient for enabling logical non-locality.

abstract: We study a nanofabricated silicon rod levitated in an optical trap. By manipulating the polarization of the light we gain full control over the ro-translational dynamics of the rod. We are able to trap both its centre-of-mass and align it along the linear polarization of the laser field. The rod can be set into rotation at a tuned frequency by exploiting the radiation pressure exerted by elliptically polarized light. The rotational motion of the rod dynamically modifies the optical potential, which allows tuning of the rotational frequency over hundreds of Kilohertz. This ability to trap and control the motion and alignment of nanoparticles opens up the field of rotational optomechanics, rotational ground state cooling and the study of rotational thermodynamics in the underdamped regime.

abstract: We present a new approach to engineering broadband sources of entangled photon pairs for quantum interferometry. The source is based on quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down conversion in a titanium diffused periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a strongly-chirped poling period. The proposed non-standard asymmetric poling mitigates phase distortions associated with the process of chirping. Asymmetric poling significantly broadens the entangled source bandwidth while preserving high visibility quantum interferometric sensing.

abstract: There are various physical scenarios in which one can only implement operations with a certain symmetry. Under such restriction, a system in a symmetry-breaking state can be used as a catalyst, e.g. to prepare another system in a desired symmetry-breaking state. This sort of (approximate) catalytic state transformations are relevant in the context of (i) state preparation using a bounded-size quantum clock or reference frame, where the clock or reference frame acts as a catalyst, (ii) quantum thermodynamics, where again a clock can be used as a catalyst to prepare states which contain coherence with respect to the system Hamiltonian, and (iii) cloning of unknown quantum states, where the given copies of state can be interpreted as a catalyst for preparing the new copies. Using a recent result of Fawzi and Renner on approximate recoverability, we show that the achievable accuracy in this kind of catalytic transformations can be determined by a single function, namely the relative entropy of asymmetry, which is equal to the difference between the entropy of state and its symmetrized version: if the desired state transition does not require a large increase of this quantity, then it can be implemented with high fidelity using only symmetric operations. Our lower bound on the achievable fidelity is tight in the case of cloners, and can be achieved using the Petz recovery map, which interestingly turns out to be the optimal cloning map found by Werner.

abstract: We propose a new practical approach towards ultrasensitive measurements in chemical and biological systems based on the so-called virtual-state spectroscopy technique. The proposed scheme makes use of intense twin beams generated by pump pulses with different frequency chirps to successfully extract information about the virtual states that contribute to the two-photon excitation of an absorbing medium. Interestingly, we show that our approach may enable entangled-photon absorption rates up to four orders of magnitude larger than previously reported. Because of its simplicity, our method paves the way towards the first experimental implementation of the virtual-state spectroscopy technique.

abstract: The goal of this paper is to calculate exactly the average of uncertainty-product of observables and to establish its typicality over the whole set of finite dimensional quantum pure states. Firstly, we investigate the average uncertainty of an observable over isospectral density matrices with a fixed spectrum. By letting the isospectral density matrices be of rank-one, we get the average uncertainty of an observable restricted to pure quantum states. Physically, ensemble of particles of large number as a closed system is represented by mixed state $\rho$. When we measure observable $A$ at a mixed state $\rho$ with many repetitions, we suggest that each time we measure $A$ at a point within the isospectral density matrices, i.e. the unitary orbit $\mathcal{U}_\rho$ of $\rho$. Thus it is suitable for taking average of uncertainty of observable $A$ over the whole unitary orbit $\mathcal{U}_\rho$. Based on this result, we finally get the calculation of the average of uncertainty-product over the whole set of mixed quantum states.

abstract: We consider a bipartite quantum system S (including parties A and B), interacting with an environment E through a localized quantum dynamics $\mathcal{F}_{SE}$ . We call a quantum dynamics $\mathcal{F}_{SE}$ localized if, e.g., the party A is isolated from the environment and only B interacts with the environment: $\mathcal{F}_{SE}=id_{A}\otimes \mathcal{F}_{BE}$, where $id_{A}$ is the identity map on the part A and $\mathcal{F}_{BE}$ is a completely positive (CP) map on the both B and E. Finding the general structure of states of the system-environment for which, after tracing over the environment, the reduced dynamics of the system is even localized as $\mathcal{E}_{S}=id_{A}\otimes \bar{\mathcal{E}}_{B}$, where $\bar{\mathcal{E}}_{B}$ is a CP map on B, is the subject of this paper. As we will see, this also allows us to have a discussion on the validity of the CP-ness of quantum dynamics.

abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation provides means to perform fast and robust quantum gates by utilizing the resilience of non-Abelian geometric phases to fluctuations of the path in state space. While the original scheme [New J. Phys. {\bf 14}, 103035 (2012)] needs two loops in the Grassmann manifold (i.e., the space of computational subspaces of the full state space) to generate an arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gate, we propose single-loop one-qubit gates that constitute an efficient universal set of holonomic gates when combined with an entangling holonomic two-qubit gate. Our one-qubit gate is realized by dividing the loop into path segments, each of which generated by a $\Lambda$-type Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that two path segments is sufficient to realize arbitrary single-loop holonomic one-qubit gates. We describe how our scheme can be implemented experimentally in a generic atomic system exhibiting a three-level $\Lambda$-coupling structure, by utilizing carefully chosen laser pulses.

abstract: We show that the technique known as concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling (CCD) can be applied to a trapped-ion setup for a robust implementation of the quantum Rabi model in a variety of parameter regimes. These include the case where the Dirac equation emerges, and the limit in which a quantum phase transition takes place. We discuss the applicability of the CCD scheme in terms of the fidelity between different initial states evolving under an ideal quantum Rabi model and their corresponding trapped-ion realization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of noise suppression of our method.

abstract: We prove that there is a trade-off relation between the entanglement cost and the number of rounds of communication, for two distant parties to accomplish a bidirectional quantum information task by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We consider an implementation of a class of two-qubit controlled-unitary gate by LOCC assisted by shared entanglement, in an information theoretical scenario of asymptotically many input pairs and vanishingly small error. We prove the trade-off relation by showing that one ebit of entanglement per pair is necessary to be consumed for implementing the unitary by any two-round protocol, whereas the entanglement cost by a four-round protocol is strictly smaller than one ebit per pair.

abstract: Mobile devices have become an inseparable part of our everyday life. They are used to transmit an ever-increasing amount of sensitive health, financial and personal information. This exposes us to the growing scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional and future-proof data security but implementing it for handheld mobile devices comes with specific challenges. To establish security, secret keys of sufficient length need to be transmitted during the time of a handheld transaction (~1s) despite device misalignment, ambient light and user's inevitable hand movements. Transmitters and receivers should ideally be compact and low-cost, while avoiding security loopholes. Here we demonstrate the first QKD transmission from a handheld transmitter with a key-rate large enough to overcome finite key effects. Using dynamic beam-steering, reference-frame-independent encoding and fast indistinguishable pulse generation, we obtain a secret key rate above 30kb/s over a distance of 0.5m under ambient light conditions.

abstract: Broadly speaking, this thesis is about nonlinear optics, quantum mechanics, and computing. More specifically, it covers four main topics: Coherent LQG Control, Free-Carrier Oscillations, Optical Ising Machines and Pulsed OPO Dynamics. Tying them all together is a theory of open quantum systems called the SLH model, which I introduce in Chapters 1-2. The SLH model is a general framework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is the basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG control is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent feedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's simultaneous utilization of both light quadratures. Semiclassical truncated-Wigner techniques for quantum-optical networks are discussed in Chapter 5, leading to a thorough discussion of quantum noise in systems with free-carrier nonlinearities (Chapter 6), comparison to the Kerr nonlinearity, and potential applications for analog computing based on limit cycles and amplification (Chapters 7-8). Ising machines based on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are discussed in Chapters 9-10, the former focusing on large 1D and 2D networks of OPOs, and the latter on the dynamics of a single OPO in the ultrafast, synchronously-pumped regime. Optical properties and design considerations for silicon photonic waveguides are are treated in Chapter 11.

abstract: We prove new quantitative limitations on the existence of an approximate simultaneous cloning or broadcasting of mixed states. The results are based on information-theoretic (entropic) considerations and generalize the well known no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems. In the special case when one of the states involved is the maximally mixed state of the symmetric subspace of $n$ qudits, we prove entropy inequalities which show how universal cloning machines and symmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice versa.

abstract: Light induced processes in nature occur by irradiation with slowly turned-on incoherent light. The general case of time-dependent incoherent excitation is solved here analytically for V-type systems using a newly developed master equation method. Clear evidence emerges for the disappearance of radiatively induced coherence as turn-on times of the radiation exceed characteristic system times. The latter is the case, in nature, for all relevant dynamical time scales for other than nearly degenerate energy levels. We estimate that, in the absence of non-radiative relaxation and decoherence, turn-on times slower than 1 ms (still short by natural standards) induce Fano coherences between energy eigenstates that are separated by less than 0.9 cm$^{-1}$.

abstract: In approximate density functional theory (DFT), the self-interaction error is a pervasive electron delocalization associated with underestimated insulating gaps. It exhibits a predominantly quadratic energy-density curve that is amenable to correction using computationally efficient, constraint-resembling methods such as DFT + Hubbard U (DFT+U). Constrained DFT (cDFT) exactly enforces conditions on DFT by means of self-consistently optimized Lagrange multipliers, and its use to automate DFT+U type corrections is a compelling possibility. We show that constraints beyond linear order are incompatible with cDFT. For DFT+U, we overcome this by separating its Hubbard U parameters into linear and quadratic terms. For a one-electron system, the resulting generalized DFT+U method can recover the exact subspace occupancy and free-energy, but neither the exact total-energy nor the exact ionization potential, for reasonable parameters. Approximate functionals thus cannot be systematically corrected by constraining their ground-states.

abstract: In spin-based quantum information processing devices, the presence of control and detection circuitry can change the local environment of a spin by introducing strain and electric fields, altering its resonant frequencies. These resonance shifts can be large compared to intrinsic spin line-widths and it is therefore important to study, understand and model such effects in order to better predict device performance. Here we investigate a sample of bismuth donor spins implanted in a silicon chip, on top of which a superconducting aluminium micro-resonator has been fabricated. The on-chip resonator provides two functions: first, it produces local strain in the silicon due to the thermal contraction of the aluminium, and second, it enables sensitive electron spin resonance spectroscopy of donors close to the surface that experience this strain. Through finite-element strain simulations and effective mass theory calculations of the donor electron wavefunction, we are able to reconstruct key features of our experiments, including the electron spin resonance spectra. Our results reveal a large strain-induced quadrupole interaction in the bismuth donors, of order 100 MHz.

abstract: Supersymmetrical (SUSY) intertwining relations are generalized to the case of quantum Hamiltonians in Minkowski space. For intertwining operators (supercharges) of second order in derivatives the intertwined Hamiltonians correspond to completely integrable systems with the symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta. In terms of components, the itertwining relations correspond to the system of nonlinear differential equations which are solvable with the simplest - constant - ansatzes for the "metric" matrix in second order part of the supercharges. The corresponding potentials are built explicitly both for diagonalizable and nondiagonalizable form of "metric" matrices, and their properties are discussed.

abstract: The thesis contains theoretical study of number of systems in low dimension, which are related to quantum Ising model. The main results are emergence of Majorana fermions in condensed matter system. We discuss an array of cavity-QED system, describing atom-photon (spin-boson) interacting problem, namely Rabi lattice model, and calculated its phase diagram. More importantly we showed that in any dimension, the system has Ising dynamics in strong atom-photon coupling limit. For 1D, a special relation between end-to-end spin-spin correlation is presented, which is very much different form the bulk spin-spin correlation. The entanglement between cavities is calculated and shown to have maximum value at the phase transition point. Other problems we studied were the frustrated quantum Ising model and its phase diagram as well as existence of Majorana like edge modes in different phases of the model. The fermionic version of the frustrated quantum Ising problem is also presented. On a different but related note, we present some beautiful results on Falicov Kimball (FK) model, a fermionic model similar to Hubbard model, on a square lattice. Using a canonical representation for electrons (invented by Brijesh Kumar), the FK model is mapped to classical Ising model (at infinite Hubbard interaction limit) on 2D lattice. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulation to study magnetization as a function of Hubbard interaction and also as a function of temperature. The motivation was to study (quantum) charge fluctuation (thus, quantum fluctuation of top of classical Ising thermodynamics) due to finite Hubbard interaction term. We also devote a chapter for basic numerical techniques, such as Density matrix Renormalization Group method, Exact diagonalization for spin system and classical Monte Carlo simulation (for classical 2D Ising model), which we have used in this thesis.

abstract: Spatial adiabatic passage represents a new way to design integrated photonic devices. In conventional adiabatic passage designs require smoothly varying waveguide separations. Here we show modelling of adiabatic passage devices where the waveguide separation is varied digitally. Despite digitisation, our designs show robustness against variations in the input wavelength and refractive index contrast of the waveguides relative to the cladding. This approach to spatial adiabatic passage opens new design strategies and hence the potential for new photonics devices.

Strongly asymmetric behaviour was observed, devices operated with high fidelity in the counter-intuitive scheme while strongly suppressing transmission in the intuitive. The low differential loss of the digital adiabatic passage designs potentially offers additional functionality for adiabatic passage based devices. These devices operate with a high contrast ($>\!90\%$) over a 60~nm bandwidth, centered at $\sim 823$~nm.

abstract: The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with a position-dependent (effective) mass is studied in the framework of Supersymmetrical (SUSY) Quantum Mechanics. The general solution of SUSY intertwining relations with first order supercharges is obtained without any preliminary constraints. Several forms of coefficient functions of the supercharges are investigated and analytical expressions for the mass function and partner potentials are found. As usual for SUSY Quantum Mechanics with nonsingular superpotentials, the spectra of intertwined Hamiltonians coincide up to zero modes of supercharges, and the corresponding wave functions are connected by intertwining relations. All models are partially integrable by construction: each of them has at least one second order symmetry operator.

abstract: Plasmonics, the science and technology of the interaction of light with metallic objects, is fundamentally changing the way we can detect, generate and manipulate light at the nanoscale. While the field is progressing swiftly thanks to the availability of nanoscale manufacturing and analysis methods, fundamental properties such as the symmetries of the plasmonic excitations cannot be accessed by direct measurements, leading to a partial and sometimes incorrect understanding of their properties. Here we overcome this limitation by deliberately shaping the wave--function of a free electron beam to match the symmetry of the plasmonic excitations in a modified transmission electron microscope. We show experimentally and theoretically that this offers selective detection of specific plasmon modes within metallic nanoparticles while filtering out modes with other symmetries. This method shows some resemblance to the widespread use of polarised light for the selective excitation of plasmon modes but adds the advantage of locally probing the response of individual plasmonic objects and, in principle, a far wider range of symmetry selection criteria.

abstract: We measured the isotope shift in the $^2$S$_{1/2}$-$^2$P$_{3/2}$ (D2) transition in singly-ionized calcium ions using photon recoil spectroscopy. The high accuracy of the technique enables us to resolve the difference between the isotope shifts of this transition to the previously measured isotopic shifts of the $^2$S$_{1/2}$-$^2$P$_{1/2}$ (D1) line. This so-called splitting isotope shift is extracted and exhibits a clear signature of field shift contributions. From the data we were able to extract the small difference of the field shift coefficient and mass shifts between the two transitions with high accuracy. This J-dependence is of relativistic origin and can be used to benchmark atomic structure calculations. As a first step, we use several ab initio atomic structure calculation methods to provide more accurate values for the field shift constants and their ratio. Remarkably, the high-accuracy value for the ratio of the field shift constants extracted from the experimental data is larger than all available theoretical predictions.
