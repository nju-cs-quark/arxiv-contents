abstract: Motivated by some recent news, a journalist asks a group of physicists: "What's the meaning of the violation of Bell's inequality?" One physicist answers: "It means that non-locality is an established fact". Another says: "There is no non-locality; the message is that measurement outcomes are irreducibly random". A third one says: "It cannot be answered simply on purely physical grounds, the answer requires an act of metaphysical judgement". Puzzled by the answers, the journalist keeps asking questions about quantum theory: "What is teleported in quantum teleportation?" "How does a quantum computer really work?" Shockingly, for each of these questions, the journalist obtains a variety of answers which, in many cases, are mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, the journalist asks: "How do you plan to make progress if, after 90 years of quantum theory, you still don't know what it means? How can you possibly identify the physical principles of quantum theory or expand quantum theory into gravity if you don't agree on what quantum theory is about?" Here we argue that it is becoming urgent to solve this too long lasting problem. For that, we point out that the interpretations of quantum theory are, essentially, of two types and that these two types are so radically different that there must be experiments that, when analyzed outside the framework of quantum theory, lead to different empirically testable predictions. Arguably, even if these experiments do not end the discussion, they will add new elements to the list of strange properties that some interpretations must have, therefore they will indirectly support those interpretations that do not need to have all these strange properties.

abstract: We study the spectral properties of a family of quantum antiferromagnets on two-dimensional (2D) lattices. This family of models is obtained by a deformation of the well-studied 2D quantum antiferromagnetic model of Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT); they are described by two-body, frustration-free Hamiltonians on a three-colourable lattice of spins, and with ground states that are resources for universal quantum computation. Although the existence of a spectral gap in the 2D AKLT model remains an open question, we rigorously prove the existence of a gap for a subset of this family of quantum antiferromagnets. This result provides a family of two-body Hamiltonians for which the ground state is a resource for universal quantum computation and for which a spectral gap is proven to exist.

abstract: Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols allow for the establishment of a secret key between two users Alice and Bob, when one of the two users (typically Bob) is limited or "classical" in nature. Recently it was shown that protocols exists when both parties are limited/classical in nature if they utilize the services of a quantum server. These protocols are called mediated SQKD protocols. This server, however, is untrusted and, in fact, adversarial. In this paper, we reconsider a mediated SQKD protocol and derive a new proof of unconditional security for it. In particular, we derive a new lower bound on its key rate in the asymptotic scenario. Furthermore, we show this new lower bound is an improvement over prior work, thus showing that the protocol in question can tolerate higher rates of error than previously thought.

abstract: We examine the effect of adding PT-symmetric gain and loss terms to quasi 1D lattices (ribbons) that possess flat bands. We focus on three representative cases: (a) The Lieb ribbon, (b) The kagome ribbon, and (c) The stub Ribbon. In general we find that the effect on the flat band depends strongly on the geometrical details of the lattice being examined. One interesting and novel result that emerge from an analytical calculation of the band structure of the Lieb ribbon including gain and loss, is that its flat band survives the addition of PT-symmetry for any amount of gain and loss, while for the other two lattices, any presence of gain and loss destroys the flat bands. For all three ribbons, there are finite stability windows whose size decreases with the strength of the gain and loss parameter. For the Lieb and kagome cases, the size of this window converges to a finite value. The existence of finite stability windows, plus the constancy of the Lieb flat band are in marked contrast to the behavior of a pure one-dimensional lattice.

abstract: We present a parameter estimation technique based on performing joint measurements of a weak interaction away from the weak-value-amplification approximation. Two detectors are used to collect full statistics of the correlations between two weakly entangled degrees of freedom. Without the need of postselection, the protocol resembles the anomalous amplification of an imaginary-weak-value-like response. The amplification is induced in the difference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of technical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals for precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of interest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed technique by measuring polarization rotations in a linearly polarized laser pulse. The effective sensitivity and precision of a split detector is increased when compared to a conventional continuous-wave balanced detection technique.

abstract: We study the ground state quantum correlation of Ising model in a transverse field by implementing the quantum renormalization group (QRG) theory. It is shown that various quantum correlation measures and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality will highlight the critical point related with quantum phase transitions, and demonstrate nonanalytic phenomenon and scaling behavior when the size of the system becomes large. Our results also indicate a universal behavior of the critical exponent of Ising model under QRG that the critical exponent will not change with the variation of different quantities, even when the quantities vary from entanglement measures to quantum correlation measures. This means that the two kinds of quantum correlation criterion, including the entanglement/separability paradigm and the information-theoretic paradigm, have some connections between them. These remarkable behaviors may have important implications on condensed matter physics because the critical exponent directly associates with the correlation length exponent.

abstract: We invoke an efficient search algorithms as a key challenge in multi-qubit quantum systems. An original algorithm called dynamical quantum search algorithm from which Grover algorithm is obtained at a specified time is presented. This algorithm is distinguished by accuracy in obtaining high probability of finding any marked state in a shorter time than Grover algorithm time. The algorithm performance can be improved with respect to the different values of the controlled phase. A new technique is used to generate the dynamical quantum gates in the presence of dissipation effect that helps in implementing the current algorithm.

abstract: Three recent results on weak measurements are presented. They are: i) repeated measurements on a single copy can not provide any information on it and further, that in the limit of very large such measurements, weak measurements have exactly the same characterstics as strong measurements, ii) the apparent non-invasiveness of weak measurements is \emph{illusory} and they are no more advantageous than strong measurements even in the specific context of establishing Leggett-Garg inequalities, when errors are properly taken into account, and, finally, iii) weak value measurements are optimal, in the precise sense of Wootters and Fields, when the post-selected states are mutually unbiased with respect to the eigenstates of the observable whose weak values are being measured. Notion of weak value coordinates for state spaces are introduced and elaborated.

abstract: The readings of a highly inaccurate "weak" quantum meter, employed to determine the value of a dichotomous variable $S$ without destroying the interference between the alternatives,may take arbitrary values. We show that the expected values of its readings may take any real value, depending on the the choice of the states in which the system is pre- and post-selected. Some of these values must fall outside the range of eigenvalues of $A$, in which case they may be expressed as "anomalous" averages obtained with negative probability weights, constructed from available probability amplitudes. This behaviour is a natural consequence of the Uncertainty Principle. The phenomenon of "anomalous weak values" has no non-trivial analogue in classical statistics.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04941
abstract: The quantum wave-function of a massive particle with small initial uncertainties (consistent with the uncertainty relation) is believed to spread very slowly, so that the dynamics is deterministic. This assumes that the classical motions for given initial data are unique. In fluid turbulence non-uniqueness due to "roughness" of the advecting velocity field is known to lead to stochastic motion of classical particles. Vanishingly small random perturbations are magnified by Richardson diffusion in a "nearly rough" velocity field so that motion remains stochastic as the noise disappears, or classical spontaneous stochasticity, . Analogies between stochastic particle motion in turbulence and quantum evolution suggest that there should be quantum spontaneous stochasticity (QSS). We show this for 1D models of a particle in a repulsive potential that is "nearly rough" with $V(x) \sim C|x|^{1+\alpha}$ at distances $|x|\gg \ell$ , for some UV cut-off $\ell$, and for initial Gaussian wave-packet centered at 0. We consider the WKB limit with $\hbar/m \to 0$, then position-spread $\sigma\to 0$. The limit of the position density is non-deterministic, with equal probabilities of the particle following either of two, non-unique classical solutions and with "Richardson-like" spreading of the wave-packet. The splitting of the wave-packet occurs in a very short time $t\sim(\ell^{1+\alpha}/C)^{1/2}$ for small $\ell$. QSS also occurs in the scattering of a wave-packet off the rough potential, for careful fine-tuning. We also consider other semi-classical limits by a numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, observing QSS both in position- and momentum-space. Although the wave-function remains split into two widely separated branches in the classical limit, rapid phase oscillations within each branch prevent any coherent superposition. These effects should be observable in laboratory experiments.

abstract: A quantum particle subjected to a constant force undergoes an accelerated motion following a parabolic path, which differs from the classical motion just because of wave packet spreading (quantum diffusion). However, when a periodic potential is added (such as in a crystal) the particle undergoes Bragg scattering and an oscillatory (rather than accelerated) motion is found, corresponding to the famous Bloch oscillations. Here we introduce an exactly-solvable quantum Hamiltonian model, corresponding to a generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, in which a quantum particle shows an intermediate dynamical behavior, namely an oscillatory motion superimposed to an accelerated one. Such a novel dynamical behavior is referred to as {\it accelerated Bloch oscillations}. Analytical expressions of the spectrum, improper eigenfunctions and propagator of the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ are derived. Finally, it is shown that acceleration and quantum diffusion in the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian are prevented for Airy wave packets, which undergo a periodic breathing dynamics that can be referred to as {\it Airy-Bloch oscillations}.

abstract: We investigate some particular completely positive maps which admit a stable commutative Von Neumann subalgebra. The restriction of such maps to the stable algebra is then a Markov operator. In the first part of this article, we propose a recipe in order to find a quantum extension of a given Markov operator in the above sense. We show that the existence of such an extension is linked with the existence of a special form of dilation for the Markov operator studied by Attal in \cite{Att1}, reducing the problem to the extension of dynamical system. We then apply our method to the same problem in continuous time, proving the existence of a quantum extension for L\'evy processes. In the second part of this article, we focus on the case where the commutative algebra is isomorphic to $\Acal=l^\infty(1,...,N)$ with $N$ either finite or infinite. We propose a classification of the CP maps leaving $\Acal$ stable, producing physical examples of each classes.

abstract: We consider the question whether electromagnetism can be derived from quantum physics of measurements. It turns out that this is possible, both for quantum and classical electromagnetism, if we use more recent innovations such as smearing of observables and simultaneous measurability. In this way we justify the use of von Neumann-type measurement models for physical processes. We apply operational quantum measurement theory to gain insight in fundamental aspects of quantum physics. Interactions of von Neumann type make the Heisenberg evolution of observables describable using explicit operator deformations. In this way one can obtain quantized electromagnetism as a measurement of a system by another. The relevant deformations (Rieffel deformations) have a mathematically well-defined "classical" limit which is indeed classical electromagnetism for our choice of interaction.

abstract: We show how to exploit algebraic relations of operators (or matrices) which constitute the non-equilibrium matrix product steady state of a boundary driven quantum spin chain to find partial differential equations determining all the $m$-point correlation functions in the continuum limit. These partial differential equations, the order of which is determined by scaling of the non-equilibrium partition function, are readily solved if we also know the boundary conditions. In this way we can avoid resorting to representation theory of the matrix product algebra. We apply our methods to study the distributions, or moments, of the magnetization and the spin current observables in boundary driven open XXZ spin chains, as well as some connected correlation functions and find that the transverse connected correlation functions are thermodynamically non-decaying and long-range at the isotropic point $\Delta=1$.

abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the non equilibrium steady state of an open quantum system described by a Lindblad master equation becomes pure in the Zeno regime, i.e., for infinitely large dissipative coupling. The criterion we obtain replaces Yamamoto's criterion [Phys. Rev. A 72, 024104 (2005)] formulated for arbitrary coupling strength. Using our criterion, we investigate an open $XXZ$ spin $1/2$ chain driven out of equilibrium by boundary reservoirs targeting different spin orientations. In the Zeno regime we find two families of pure nonequilibrium steady states, both in the critical and gapped $XXZ$ regimes. These solutions correspond to particular values of the anisotropy parameter measuring the spin orientation difference between two consecutive sites. In the thermodynamic limit, the set of parameters corresponding to the existence of pure solutions becomes dense in a subset of anisotropies.

abstract: Quantum adiabatic evolution is perceived as useful for binary quadratic programming problems that are a priori unconstrained. For constrained problems, it is a common practice to relax linear equality constraints as penalty terms in the objective function. However, there has not yet been proposed a method for efficiently dealing with inequality constraints using the quantum adiabatic approach. In this paper, we give a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a binary quadratic programming (BQP) problem in the presence of inequality constraints and employ this procedure within a branch-and-bound framework for constrained BQP (CBQP) problems.
