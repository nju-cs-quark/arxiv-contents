abstract: This study was started to know mysterious classicality of nuclei. Using three particles model without external environments, it is found that decisions of respective state of three particles by decoherence are not simultaneous. Furthermore, in this model, wave function of total three body system collapses spontaneously without any external environments. Therefore we may able to insist that a wavefunction of our universe has already collapsed spontaneously without any external observer, because of the same mechanism with this model.

abstract: We show that a particle detector can distinguish the interior of a hollow shell from flat space for switching times much shorter than the light-crossing time of the shell, even though the local metrics are indistinguishable. This shows that a particle detector can read out information about the non-local structure of spacetime even when switched on for scales much shorter than the characteristic scale of the non-locality.

abstract: Tensor network states are for good reasons believed to capture ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians arising in the condensed matter context, states which are in turn expected to satisfy an entanglement area law. However, the computational hardness of contracting projected entangled pair states in two and higher dimensional systems is often seen as a significant obstacle when devising higher-dimensional variants of the density-matrix renormalisation group method. In this work, we show that for those projected entangled pair states that are expected to provide good approximations of such ground states of local Hamiltonians - in a sense made precise in readings of the so-called PEPS conjecture - one can compute local expectation values in quasi-polynomial time. We therefore provide a complexity-theoretic justification of why state-of-the-art numerical tools work so well in practice. We comment on how the transfer operators of such projected entangled pair states have a gap and the latter exhibit local topological quantum order. We finally turn to the computation of local expectation values on quantum computers, contributing to the discussion why this would be a meaningful application for a small-scale quantum computer.

abstract: The desire to produce high-quality single photons for applications in quantum information science has lead to renewed interest in exploring solid-state emitters in the weak excitation regime. Under these conditions it is expected that photons are coherently scattered, and so benefit from a substantial suppression of detrimental interactions between the source and its phonon environment. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here that this reasoning is incomplete, and phonon interactions continue to play a crucial role in determining solid-state emission characteristics even for very weak excitation. We find that the sideband resulting from non-Markovian relaxation of the phonon environment leads to a fundamental limit to the fraction of coherently scattered light and to the visibility of two-photon coalescence at weak driving, both of which are absent for atomic systems or within simpler Markovian treatments.

abstract: We introduce two potentials explicitly given by the Lambert-W function for which the exact solution of the one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation is written through the first derivative of a double-confluent Heun function. One of these potentials is a singular potential that behaves as the inverse square root in the vicinity of the origin and vanishes exponentially at the infinity. The exact solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for this potential is given through fundamental solutions each of which presents an irreducible linear combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions. Since the potential is effectively a short-range one it supports only a finite number of bound states.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.06403
abstract: We propose a complete superradiant and subradiant states that can be manipulated and prepared in a three-dimensional atomic array. These subradiant states can be realized by absorbing a single photon and imprinting the spatially-dependent phases on the atomic system. We find that the collective decay rates and associated cooperative Lamb shifts are highly dependent on the phases we manage to imprint, and the subradiant state of long lifetime can be found for various lattice spacings and atom numbers. We also investigate both optically thin and thick atomic arrays, which can serve for systematic studies of super- and sub-radiance. Our proposal offers an alternative scheme for quantum memory of light in a three-dimensional array of two-level atoms, which is applicable and potentially advantageous in quantum information processing.

abstract: We present a scheme for obtaining steady-state optomechanical entanglement in an optomechanical system, in which the mechanical mirror is perturabatively coupled to an auxiliary qubit. The coupling between the mechanical oscillator and the single qubit results in a quadratic mechanical nonlinear term in the Hamiltonian describing the system. We find that the mechanical nonlinearity not only enhances the degree of optomechanical entanglement but also generate it at a considerably lower optomechanical coupling strength. We observe that the degree of entanglement decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. However, the maximum temperature up to which entanglement persists increase with increasing nonlinear amplitude. Thus, the bipartite entanglement in presence of the mechanical nonlinearity becomes more robust against thermal phonon fluctuations.

abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of a disorderd Ising model with uniform transverse field on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a glassy phase that is induced by reducing the intensity of the transverse field. We use a combination of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms and exact diagonalization to compute R\'enyi entropies, quantum Fisher information, correlation functions and order parameter. We locate the transition by means of the peak of the R\'enyi entropy and we find agreement with the transition point estimated from the emergence of finite values of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and from the peak of the correlation length. We interpret the results by means of a mean-field theory in which quantum fluctuations are treated as massive particles hopping on the interaction graph. We see that the particles are delocalized at the transition, a fact that points towards the existence of possibly another transition deep in the glassy phase where these particles localize, therefore leading to a many-body localized phase.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.06467
abstract: Verifiable blind quantum computing is a secure delegated quantum computing where a client with a limited quantum technology delegates her quantum computing to a server who has a universal quantum computer. The client's privacy is protected (blindness) and the correctness of the computation is verifiable by the client in spite of her limited quantum technology (verifiability). There are mainly two types of protocols for verifiable blind quantum computing: the protocol where the client has only to generate single-qubit states, and the protocol where the client needs only the ability of single-qubit measurements. The latter is called the measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum computing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known to the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the correctness of the input. Here we introduce a new protocol of measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing where the correctness of the quantum input is also verifiable.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.06507
abstract: We compare the performance of continuous coherent feedback, implemented using an ideal single-qubit controller, to that of continuous measurement-based feedback for the task of controlling the state of a single qubit. Here the basic dynamical resource is the ability to couple the system to a traveling-wave field (for example, a transmission line) via a system observable, and the fundamental limitation is the maximum rate that is available for this coupling. We focus on the question of the best achievable control given ideal controllers. To obtain a fair comparison we acknowledge that the amplification involved in measurement-based control allows the controller to use macroscopic fields to apply feedback forces to the system, so it is natural to allow these feedback forces to be much larger than the mesoscopic coupling to the transmission line that mediates both the measurement for measurement-based control and the coupling to the mesoscopic controller for coherent control. Interestingly our numerical results indicate that under the above platform for comparison, coherent feedback is able to exactly match the performance of measurement-based feedback given ideal controllers. We also discuss various properties of, and control mechanisms for, coherent feedback networks.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.06549
abstract: For a number of non-interacting identical particles entering a multi-channel scatterer in various wave packet states, we construct a generating function for the probabilities of various scattering outcomes. This is used to evaluate the mean numbers of particles $\overline{n}_m$ scattered into a given ($m$-th) channel, single-channel statistics, and inter-channel correlations. We show that for initially uncorrelated particles, indistinguishability changes single channel statistics without altering the the value of $\overline{n}_m$. For uncorrelated bosons and fermions, bunching and anti-bunching behaviour can be detected in the extreme-case probabilities, to have all particles scattered into the same channel, or none of particles scattered into a channel, or channels. As an example, we consider a cavity with a single long-lived resonance accessible to the particles, which allows them to "pile up" inside the scatterer.

abstract: We demonstrate precise control of the room-temperature charge, orbital, and spin dynamics of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond using combinations of visible and near-infrared (NIR) optical excitation. Non-monotonic variations in the equilibrium charge state as a function of optical power are attributed to competing multiphoton ionization and recombination processes. In certain regimes, multicolor illumination enhances the steady-state population of the NV's negative charge state above 90%. At higher NIR intensities, orbital-selective ionization of the singlet manifold facilitates a protocol for spin-to-charge conversion that dramatically enhances the spin readout efficiency. We demonstrate a 16-fold increase in the signal-to-noise ratio for spin measurements and a pathway towards high-fidelity, single-shot readout of NV spins at room temperature.

abstract: We propose algebraic geometry as a natural language to study multipartite entanglement classification, and develop the case of the symmetric subspace. We show that the class of symmetric separable states has the structure of a Veronese variety and that its $k$-secant varieties are SLOCC invariants. This provides an entanglement classification of SLOCC classes into families, showing relevant properties such as a linear growth of the number of families with the number of particles. This correspondence also attaches mathematical and physical meaning to the classification in families, by means of a parent Hamiltonian construction. Additionally, we show that the states $W_N$ and GHZ$_N$ are in the same family and that, effectively, the former can be obtained in a limit from the latter. This paves the way to further use projective varieties in algebraic geometry to solve open problems in entanglement theory.

abstract: Classical stationary points of an analytic Hamiltonian induce singularities of the density of quantum energy levels and their flow with a control parameter in the system's infinite-size limit. We show that for a system with $f$ degrees of freedom, a non-degenerate stationary point with index $r$ causes a discontinuity (for $r$ even) or divergence ($r$ odd) of the $(f-1)$ th derivative of both density and flow of the spectrum. An increase of flatness for a degenerate stationary point shifts the singularity to lower derivatives. The findings are verified in an $f=3$ toy model.

abstract: We study the quantum behaviour of a particle moving in a one-dimensional double well potential. This double well is obtained by gluing together, at the origin, two shifted harmonic oscillator potentials. The Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solvable. The requirement that discontinuities, in the wavefunction and its first derivative, are absent at the origin, leads to the quantisation of the energy eigenvalues. We also show that oscillations in time take place between two nearby single harmonic oscillator ground states. Finally, the double well potential is augmented by a Dirac delta-function potentials at the origin and the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is solved.

abstract: Quantum illumination consists in shining with quantum light on a target region immersed in a bright thermal bath with the aim of detecting the presence of a possible low-reflective object. If the signal is entangled with the receiver, then a suitable choice of the measurement offers a gain with respect to the optimal classical protocol employing coherent states. Here, we consider local strategies in which the receiver measures independently the single copies of the entangled signal. Regarding the quantum estimation of the reflectivity parameter, we show that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect the classical case is limited to 3 dB. We relate these results to the object detection problem, showing that the gain in the error probability exponent for strategies based on the estimation of the reflectivity parameter is ruled by the quantum Fisher information. Finally, we discuss two paradigmatic examples with Gaussian and Schrodinger's cat states.

abstract: We use a single squeezed state to represent a qubit, which can be coherently processed in a deconvolution picture (DP) in the presence of noise. We avail ourselves of the fact that when evolution is governed by a quadratic dissipative equation, there exists a basis of squeezed states that evolves to another basis of such states in the DP. An operator acts as an impurity filter, restoring the coherence lost from the inexorable interactions of the qubit with its surroundings.

abstract: In recent quantum optical continuous-variable experiments, the number of fully inseparable light modes has drastically increased by introducing a multiplexing scheme either in the time domain or in the frequency domain. Here, modifying the time-domain multiplexing experiment reported in Nature Photonics 7, 982 (2013), we demonstrate successive generation of fully inseparable light modes for more than one million modes. The resulting multi-mode state is useful as a dual-rail CV cluster state. We circumvent the previous problem of optical phase drifts, which has limited the number of fully inseparable light modes to around ten thousands, by continuous feedback control of the optical system.

abstract: Dynamics induced by a change of boundary conditions reveals rate-dependent signatures associated with topological properties in one-dimensional Kitaev chain and SSH model. While the perturbation from a change of the boundary propagates into the bulk, the density of topological edge modes in the case of transforming to open boundary condition reaches steady states. The steady-state density depends on the transformation rate of the boundary and serves as an illustration of quantum memory effects in topological systems. Moreover, while a link is physically broken as the boundary condition changes, some correlation functions can remain finite across the broken link and keep a record of the initial condition. By testing those phenomena in the non-topological regimes of the two models, none of the interesting signatures of memory effects can be observed. Our results thus contrast the importance of topological properties in boundary-induced dynamics.

It allowed us to evaluate the first and second sound independently resulting in consistent values from the quantum to classical regime, in good agreement with previous results found in the literature. We also provide some insight on the dominant mode, either thermal or superfluid, on each sound velocity depending on the temperature range

abstract: In this paper the Hartree equation is derived from the N-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation uniformly in the Planck constant in two different cases, specifically (a) for T{\"o}plitz initial data and Lipschitz interaction force, and (b) for analytic initial data and interaction potential, and over short time intervals, independent of the Planck constant. The convergence rates in these two cases are 1/ log log N and 1/N respectively. The treatment of the second case is entirely self-contained and all the constants appearing in the final estimate are explicit. Moreover it provides a derivation of the Vlasov equation out of the N-body classical dynamics using hierarchies and not empirical measures.

abstract: This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July 2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation. The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and, in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems. Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.

abstract: Topological quantum phases cannot be characterized by local order parameters in the bulk. In this work however, we show that signatures of a topological quantum critical point do remain in local observables in the bulk, and manifest themselves as non-analyticities in their expectation values taken over a family of non-equilibrium states generated using a quantum quench protocol. The signature can be used for precisely locating the critical points in parameter space. A large class of initial states can be chosen for the quench (including finite temperature states), the sufficient condition being existence of a finite occupation-gradient with respect to energy for the single-particle critical mode. We demonstrate these results in tractable models of non-interacting fermions exhibiting topological phase transitions in one and two spatial dimensions. We also show that the non-analyticities can be absent if the gap-closing is non-topological, i.e., when it corresponds to no phase transition.
