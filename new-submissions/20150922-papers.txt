abstract: We propose an implementation of a quantum router for microwave photons in a superconducting qubit architecture consisting of a transmon qubit, SQUIDs and a nonlinear capacitor. We model and analyze the dynamics of operation of the quantum switch using quantum Langevin equations in a scattering approach and compute the photon reflection and transmission probabilities. For parameters corresponding to up-to-date experimental devices we predict succesful operation of the router with probabilities above 94%.

abstract: Motivated by a connection, described here for the first time, between the hidden normal subgroup problem (HNSP) and abelian hypergroups (algebraic objects that model collisions of physical particles), we develop a stabilizer formalism using abelian hypergroups and an associated classical simulation theorem (a la Gottesman-Knill). Using these tools, we develop the first provably efficient quantum algorithm for finding hidden subhypergroups of nilpotent abelian hypergroups and, via the aforementioned connection, a new, hypergroup-based algorithm for the HNSP on nilpotent groups. We also give efficient methods for manipulating non-unitary, non-monomial stabilizers and an adaptive Fourier sampling technique of general interest.

abstract: Superconducting microresonators have been successfully utilized as detection elements for a wide variety of applications. With multiplexing factors exceeding 1,000 detectors per transmission line, they are the most scalable low-temperature detector technology demonstrated to date. For high-throughput applications, fewer detectors can be coupled to a single wire but utilize a larger per-detector bandwidth. For all existing designs, fluctuations in fabrication tolerances result in a non-uniform shift in resonance frequency and sensitivity, which ultimately limits the efficiency of band-width utilization. Here we present the design, implementation, and initial characterization of a superconducting microresonator readout integrating two tunable inductances per detector. We demonstrate that these tuning elements provide independent control of both the detector frequency and sensitivity, allowing us to maximize the transmission line bandwidth utilization. Finally we discuss the integration of these detectors in a multilayer fabrication stack for high-speed readout of the D-Wave quantum processor, highlighting the use of control and routing circuitry composed of single flux-quantum loops to minimize the number of control wires at the lowest temperature stage.

abstract: We present an extension of the discrete time quantum walk on a graph to include a qubit at each vertex of the graph, with which the walker interacts at each time step. We show that allowing for a controlled-Z interaction between the walker and the vertex qubits generates multipartite entanglement between the qubits. We demonstrate that for particular coin operators the system generates a highly entangled cluster state, of use in one way quantum computation.

In the proposed device, a superconducting qubit is coupled dispersively to two resonators: one is used to form an impedance-matched $\Lambda$ system that deterministically captures incoming photons, and the other is used for continuous monitoring of the event. The present scheme enables efficient photon detection: for realistic system parameters, the detection efficiency reaches 0.9 with a bandwidth of about ten megahertz.

Recently, many BQC protocols have been proposed with the intention to make the ability of client more classical. In this paper, we propose two BQC protocols, in which the client does not have to generate photons, but only has to perform either rotation or reorder on the received photons.

We report an efficient protocol to realize CQSDC using Cluster state and then go on to construct a (2-3)-CQSDC using Brown state, where a coalition of any two of the three controllers is required to retrieve the complete message. We argue both protocols to be unconditionally secure and analyze the efficiency of the protocols to show it to outperform the existing schemes while maintaining the same security specifications.

A close correlation between the classical Lyapunov exponents and the quantum Participation Ratio of coherent states on the eigenenergy basis is exhibited for different points in the phase space. It is also shown that the Participation Ratio scales linearly with the number of atoms in chaotic regions, and with its square root in the regular ones.

abstract: Moving cavities promise to be a suitable system for relativistic quantum information processing. It has been shown that an inertial and a uniformly accelerated one-dimensional cavity can become entangled by letting an atom emit an excitation while it passes through the cavities, but the acceleration degrades the ability to generate entanglement. We show that in the two-dimensional case the entanglement generated is affected not only by the cavity's acceleration but also by its transverse dimension which plays the role of an effective mass.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05968
abstract: We consider some of the methods that can be used to reveal the general features of how wave functions evolve with time in the harmonic oscillator. We first review the periodicity properties over each multiple of a quarter of the classical period of oscillation. Then we show that any wave function can be simply transformed so that its centroid, defined by the expectation values of position and momentum, remains at rest at the center of the oscillator. This implies that we need only consider the evolution of this restricted class of wave functions; the evolution of all others can be reduced to these. The evolution of the spread in position $\Delta_x$ and momentum $\Delta_p$ throws light on energy and uncertainty and on squeezed and coherent states. Finally we show that any wave function can be transformed so that $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_p$ do not change with time and that the evolution of all wave functions can easily be found from the evolution of those at rest at the origin with unchanging $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_p$.

abstract: We analyze the problem of quantifying entanglement in pure and mixed states of fermionic systems with fixed number parity yet not necessarily fixed particle number. The "mode entanglement" between one single-particle level and its orthogonal complement is first considered, and an entanglement entropy for such a partition of a particular basis of the single-particle Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ is defined. The sum over all single-particle modes of this entropy is introduced as a measure of the total entanglement of the system with respect to the chosen basis and it is shown that its minimum over all bases of $\mathcal H$ is a function of the one-body density matrix. Furthermore, we show that if minimization is extended to all bases related through a Bogoliubov transformation, then the entanglement entropy is a function of the generalized one-body density matrix. These results are then used to quantify entanglement in fermion systems with four single-particle levels. For general pure states of such a system a closed expression for the fermionic concurrence is derived, which generalizes the Slater correlation measure defined in [J. Schliemann et al, Phys. Rev. A 64, 022303 (2001)], implying that "particle entanglement" may be seen as minimum "mode entanglement". It is also shown that the entanglement entropy defined before is related to this concurrence by an expression analogous to that of the two-qubit case. For mixed states of this system the convex roof extension of the previous concurrence and entanglement entropy are evaluated analytically, extending the results of previous ref. to general states.

However, the uncertainty relation is usually applied to two incompatible measurements. We present tighter bounds on both entropic uncertainty relation and information exclusion principle for multiple measurements in the presence of quantum memory. As applications, three incompatible measurements on Werner state and Horodecki's bound entangled state are investigated in details.

abstract: We analyze the photon statistics of a weakly driven cavity quantum electrodynamics system and discuss the effects of photon blockade and photon-induced tunneling by effectively utilizing instead of avoiding the center-of-mass motion of a two-level atom trapped in the cavity. With the resonant interaction between atom, photon and phonon, it is shown that the bunching and anti-bunching of photons can occur with properly driving frequency. Our study shows the influence of the imperfect cooling of atom on the blockade and provides an attempt to take advantage of the center-of-mass motion.

However, we can show that so does every original type non-contextuality inequality, especially the SIC ones. Here we take YO-13-ray [3] and KCBS inequality [4] for example.

abstract: One of Feynman's greatest contributions to physics was the interpretation of negative energies as antimatter in quantum field theory. A key component of this interpretation is the Feynman propagator, which seeks to describe the behavior of antimatter at the virtual particle level. Ironically, it turns out that one can dispense with the Feynman propagator in a direct-action theory of fields, while still retaining the interpretation of negative energy solutions as antiparticles.

abstract: When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity, the two systems can exchange a single photon through a coherent Rabi oscillation. This process enables precise quantum-state engineering and manipulation of atoms and photons in a cavity, which play a central role in quantum information and measurement. Recently, a new regime of cavity QED has been reached experimentally where the strength of the interaction between light and artificial atoms (qubits) becomes comparable to the atomic transition frequency or the resonance frequency of the cavity mode. Here we show that this regime can strongly modify the concept of vacuum Rabi oscillations, enabling multiphoton exchanges between the qubit and the resonator. We find that experimental state-of-the-art circuit- QED systems can undergo two- and three-photon vacuum Rabi oscillations. These anomalous Rabi oscillations can be exploited for the realization of efficient Fock-state sources of light and complex entangled states of qubits.

abstract: Non-linearity of the current-phase relationship of a Josephson junction is the key resource for a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), the only device in which the quantum limit has so far been achieved at microwave frequencies. A standard approach to describe JPA takes into account only the lowest order (cubic) non-linearity resulting in a Duffing-like oscillator equation of motion or in a Kerr-type non-linearity term in the Hamiltonian. In this paper we derive the quantum expression for the gain of JPA including all orders of the Josephson junction non-linearity in the linear response regime. We then analyse gain saturation effect for stronger signals within semi-classical approach. Our results reveal non-linear effects of higher orders and their implications for operation of a JPA.

abstract: Fast control of quantum systems is essential in order to make use of quantum properties before they are degraded by decoherence. This is important for quantum-enhanced information processing, as well as for pushing quantum systems into macroscopic regimes at the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Bang-bang control attains the ultimate speed limit by making large changes to control fields on timescales much faster than the system can respond, however these methods are often challenging to implement experimentally. Here we demonstrate bang-bang control of a trapped-ion oscillator using nano-second switching of the trapping potentials. We perform controlled displacements which allow us to realize quantum states with up to 10,000 quanta of energy. We use these displaced states to verify the form of the ion-light interaction at high excitations which are far outside the usual regime of operation. These methods provide new possibilities for quantum-state manipulation and generation, alongside the potential for a significant increase in operational clock speed for ion-trap quantum information processing.

abstract: Many-qubit entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing although its exploitation is hindered by the detrimental effects of the environment surrounding the many-qubit system. It is thus of importance to study the dynamics of general multipartite nonclassical correlation, including but not restricted to entanglement, under noise. We did this study for four-qubit GHZ state under most common noises in an experiment and found that nonclassical correlation is more robust than entanglement except when it is imposed to dephasing channel. Quantum discord presents a sudden transition in its dynamics for Pauli-X and Pauli-Y noises as well as Bell-diagonal states interacting with dephasing reservoirs and it decays monotonically for Pauli-Z and isotropic noises.

abstract: Quantum advantage is notoriously hard to find and even harder to prove. For example the class of functions computable with classical physics actually exactly coincides with the class computable quantum-mechanically. It is strongly believed, but not proven, that quantum computing provides exponential speed-up for a range of problems, such as factoring. Here we address a computational scenario of "randomness processing" in which quantum theory provably yields, not only resource reduction over classical stochastic physics, but a strictly larger class of problems which can be solved. Beyond new foundational insights into the nature and malleability of randomness, and the distinction between quantum and classical information, these results also offer the potential of developing classically intractable simulations with currently accessible quantum technologies.

The a posteriori evolution of the system is conditioned by the results of a single or double homodyne measurements. The system interacting with the Bose field is a single cavity mode taken initially in a Gaussian state. We show explicit solutions using the method of characteristic functions to the filtering equations exploiting the linear Gaussian nature of the problem.

abstract: Teleportation is the most widely discussed application of the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Fundamentally, this process describes the transmission of information, which involves transport of neither matter nor energy. The implicit assumption, however, is that this scheme is of inherently nonlocal nature, and therefore exclusive to quantum systems. Here, we show that the concept can be readily generalized beyond the quantum realm. We present an optical implementation of the teleportation protocol solely based on classical entanglement between spatial and modal degrees of freedom, entirely independent of nonlocality. Our findings could enable novel methods for distributing information between different transmission channels and may provide the means to leverage the advantages of both quantum and classical systems to create a robust hybrid communication infrastructure.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06289
abstract: Abstract When quantum heat engines or refrigerators operate in the over-thermalization regime, quantum effects are not expected as the thermal baths eliminates all coherences. In this work we show that even in this seemingly non-quantum regime, it is possible to harvest coherence before it is erased, and obtain non classical effects. While the engine is not affected by the coherence harvesting, the extracted coherence can be used to cool external particles and reduce their entropy (the energy of the auxiliary particles is not modified). On top of cooling the extracted coherence can activate passive states. Coherence extraction also has an impact on the basic theory of heat machines. With coherence extraction, the standard expression for the total entropy production -Qc/Tc-Qh/Th is replaced by a simple relative entropy expression, that is orders of magnitude smaller in the regime of interest. Consequently, coherence extraction enables reversibility that is otherwise impossible. In addition, we present a collective engine operation scheme where coherence is recycled and shared between engines. This leads to an interesting performance boost where the total power scales quadratically with the number of engines, rather than linearly. Finally, a scheme for resource accounting is presented. It is demonstrated that coherence extraction and coherence injection extend the scope of known quantum thermal machines and add new modes of operation.

abstract: In this article we argue that thermal reservoirs (baths) are potentially useful resources in processes involving atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic fields and their applications to quantum technologies. One may try to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such control does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take advantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate "quantumness" in the system-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued by us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the bath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal quasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest by the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical control methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the quantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring quantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful for fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling of quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom coupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows to drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the mediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to achieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the conventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii) Engineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a prerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum heat machines (engines and refrigerators). We may thus conclude that often thermal baths are "more friends than foes" in quantum technologies.

The pump governing the upconversion process is produced and utilized inside the physical receiver, making its access or control unrealistic for an external adversary (Eve). This pump facilitates several properties which permit Bob to define and control the modes that can participate in the quantum measurement. Furthermore, by manipulating and monitoring the characteristics of the pump pulses, Bob can detect a wide range of quantum hacking attacks launched by Eve.

abstract: Hastings established exponential decay of correlations for ground states of gapped quantum many-body systems. A ground state of a (geometrically) local Hamiltonian with spectral gap $\epsilon$ has correlation length $\xi$ upper bounded as $\xi=O(1/\epsilon)$. In general this bound cannot be improved. Here we study the scaling of the correlation length as a function of the spectral gap in frustration-free local Hamiltonians, and we prove a tight bound $\xi=O(1/\sqrt\epsilon)$ in this setting. This highlights a fundamental difference between frustration-free and frustrated systems near criticality. The result is obtained using an improved version of the combinatorial proof of correlation decay due to Aharonov et al.

abstract: A detailed study of the anharmonicity-induced resonances caused by the coupling of center-of-mass and relative motion is presented for a system of two ultracold atoms in single-well potentials. As has been confirmed experimentally, these inelastic confinement-induced resonances are of interest, since they can lead to coherent molecule formation, losses, and heating in ultracold atomic gases. A perturbative model is introduced to describe the resonance positions and the coupling strengths. The validity of the model and the behavior of the resonances for different confinement geometries are analyzed in comparison with exact numerical ab initio calculations. While such resonances have so far only been detected for large positive values of the $s$-wave scattering length, it is found that they are present also for negative $s$-wave scattering lengths, i. e. for attractive interactions. The possibility to coherently tune the resonances by a variation of the external confinement geometry might pave the way for coherent molecule association where magnetic Feshbach resonances are inaccessible.

abstract: We report a cascaded optical link of 1100 km for ultra-stable frequency distribution over an Internet fiber network. The link is composed of four spans for which the propagation noise is actively compensated. The robustness and the performance of the link are ensured by five fully automated optoelectronic stations, two of them at the link ends, and three deployed on the field and connecting the spans. This device coherently regenerates the optical signal with the heterodyne optical phase locking of a low-noise laser diode. Optical detection of the beat-note signals for the laser lock and the link noise compensation are obtained with stable and low-noise fibered optical interferometer. We show 3.5 days of continuous operation of the noise-compensated 4-span cascaded link leading to fractional frequency instability of 4x10-16 at 1-s measurement time and 1x10-19 at 2000 s. This cascaded link was extended to 1480-km with the same performance. This work is a significant step towards a sustainable wide area ultra-stable optical frequency distribution and comparison network at a very high level of performance.

abstract: We report branches of explicit expressions for nonlinear modes in parity-time (PT) symmetric potentials of several types. For the single-well and double-well potentials the found solutions are two-parametric and appear to be stable even when the PT-symmetry of respective underlying linear models is broken. Based on the examples of these solutions we describe an algorithm of excitation of a stable nonlinear mode in a model, whose linear limit is unstable. The method is based on the adiabatic change of the control parameter driving the mode along a branch bifurcating from a stable linear mode. The suggested algorithm is confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.

abstract: We consider a partial order on positive vectors induced by elementary symmetric polynomials. As a corollary we obtain a short proof of the SSLI inequality of Neff et al. (2012), which was first obtained via a more elaborate approach.\footnote{Added 18/9/2015: It has been brought to our attention~\citep{neff.private} that a line of approach closely related to ours has been developed by M. \v{S}ilhav\'y, who considers a rich generalization based on Pick functions. This idea is natural and elegant (This idea is natural and elegant (and was also suggested by the author to P. Neff on June 1, 2015. Completely independent of us, M. \v{S}ilhav\'y has recently developed the Pick function approach fully~\citep{neff.private}), and parts of it are even implicit in the recent article of Jozsa and Mitchison (2015). The key contribution of \v{S}ilhav\'y's work is presentation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the E-monotonicity studied in this paper.} Our proofs are based on a simple observation that uses suitable integral representations and yields a family of monotonicity inequalities under a partial order determined by elementary symmetric polynomials, and thereby yields elementary proofs of the inequality of Neff et al. (2012) as well as related entropy inequalities of Jozsa and Mitchison (2015).

abstract: We present a unified theoretical study of the bright solitons governed by self-focusing and defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations with generalized parity-time (PT)-symmetric Scarff II potentials. Particularly, a PT-symmetric k-wavenumber Scarff II potential and a multi-well Scarff II potential are considered, respectively. For the k-wavenumber Scarff II potential, the parameter space can be divided into different regions, corresponding to unbroken and broken PT-symmetry and the bright solitons for self-focusing and defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. For the multi-well Scarff II potential the bright solitons can be obtained by using a periodically space-modulated Kerr nonlinearity. The linear stability of bright solitons with PT-symmetric k-wavenumber and multi-well Scarff II potentials is analyzed in details using numerical simulations. Stable and unstable bright solitons are found in both regions of unbroken and broken PT-symmetry due to the existence of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the bright solitons in three-dimensional self-focusing and defocusing NLS equations with a generalized PT-symmetric Scarff II potential are explored. This may have potential applications in the field of optical information transmission and processing based on optical solitons in nonlinear dissipative but PT-symmetric systems.

subjects: Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05984
abstract: This thesis is divided into two mainly independent parts: In the first part, we derive a criterion to determine when a translationally invariant Matrix Product State (MPS) has long range localizable entanglement, which indicates that the corresponding state has some kind of non-local hidden order. We give examples fulfilling this criterion and eventually use it to obtain all such MPS with bond dimension 2 and 3. In the second part, we show that Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) in two spatial dimensions can describe chiral topological states by explicitly constructing a family of such states with a non-trivial Chern number. We demonstrate that such free fermionic PEPS must necessarily be non-injective and have gapless parent Hamiltonians. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence that they can nevertheless approximate well the physical properties of Chern insulators with local Hamiltonians at arbitrary temperatures. We also construct long range, topological Hamiltonians with a flat energy spectrum for which those PEPS are unique ground states. As for non-chiral topological PEPS, the non-trivial, topological properties can be traced down to the existence of a symmetry on the virtual level of the PEPS tensor that is used to build the state. We use the special properties of PEPS to build the boundary theory and show how the symmetry results in the appearance of chiral modes, a ground state degeneracy of the parent Hamiltonian on the torus and a universal correction to the area law for the zero R\'enyi entropy. Finally, we show that PEPS can also describe chiral topologically ordered phases. For that, we construct a simple PEPS for spin-1/2 particles in a two-dimensional lattice. We reveal a symmetry of the PEPS tensor that gives rise to the global topological character. We also extract characteristic quantities of the edge Conformal Field Theory using the bulk-boundary correspondence.

abstract: Recent experiments have shown that (quasi-)crystalline phases of Rydberg-dressed quantum many-body systems in optical lattices (OL) are within reach. While conventional neutral atomic OL gases lack strong long-range interactions, these arise naturally in Rydberg systems, due to the large polarizability of Rydberg atoms. Combined with the bosonic character of the systems considered in our work, a wide range of quantum phases have been predicted. Among them are a devil's staircase of lattice incommensurate density wave phases as well as more exotic supersolid lattice order. High experimental tunability opens up a wide range of parameters to be studied. Guided by results in the "frozen" gas limit, we study the ground state phase diagram at finite hopping amplitudes and in the vicinity of resonant Rydberg driving. Simulations within real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (RB-DMFT) yield an extension of the devil's staircase into the supersolid regime where the competition of condensation and interaction leads to a sequence of crystalline phases.

title: Quantum Query Complexity of Subgraph Isomorphism and Homomorphism

abstract: Let $H$ be a fixed graph on $n$ vertices. Let $f_H(G) = 1$ iff the input graph $G$ on $n$ vertices contains $H$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. Let $\alpha_H$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set of $H$. In this paper we show: \[Q(f_H) = \Omega\left(\sqrt{\alpha_H \cdot n}\right),\] where $Q(f_H)$ denotes the quantum query complexity of $f_H$. As a consequence we obtain a lower bounds for $Q(f_H)$ in terms of several other parameters of $H$ such as the average degree, minimum vertex cover, chromatic number, and the critical probability. We also use the above bound to show that $Q(f_H) = \Omega(n^{3/4})$ for any $H$, improving on the previously best known bound of $\Omega(n^{2/3})$. Until very recently, it was believed that the quantum query complexity is at least square root of the randomized one. Our $\Omega(n^{3/4})$ bound for $Q(f_H)$ matches the square root of the current best known bound for the randomized query complexity of $f_H$, which is $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ due to Gr\"oger. Interestingly, the randomized bound of $\Omega(\alpha_H \cdot n)$ for $f_H$ still remains open. We also study the Subgraph Homomorphism Problem, denoted by $f_{[H]}$, and show that $Q(f_{[H]}) = \Omega(n)$. Finally we extend our results to the $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In particular, we show an $\Omega(n^{4/5})$ bound for quantum query complexity of the Subgraph Isomorphism, improving on the previously known $\Omega(n^{3/4})$ bound. For the Subgraph Homomorphism, we obtain an $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ bound for the same.
