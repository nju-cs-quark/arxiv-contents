abstract: We use non-standard analysis to define a category $^\star\!\operatorname{Hilb}$ suitable for categorical quantum mechanics in arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces, and we show that standard bounded operators can be suitably embedded in it. We show the existence of unital special commutative $\dagger$-Frobenius algebras, and we conclude $^\star\!\operatorname{Hilb}$ to be compact closed, with partial traces and a Hilbert-Schmidt inner product on morphisms. We exemplify our techniques on the textbook case of 1-dimensional wavefunctions with periodic boundary conditions: we show the momentum and position observables to be well defined, and to give rise to a strongly complementary pair of unital commutative $\dagger$-Frobenius algebras.

abstract: Motivated by the recent efforts to describe the gravitational interaction as a classical channel arising from continuous quantum measurements, we study what types of dynamics can emerge from a model of repeated short interactions of a system with a set of ancillae. We show that contingent on the model parameters the resulting dynamics ranges from exact unitarity to arbitrary fast decoherence (quantum Zeno effect). For a series of measurements the effective dynamics includes feedback-control, which for a composite system yields effective interactions between the subsystems. We quantify the amount of decoherence accompanying such induced interactions, generalizing the lower bound of the gravitational example. However, by allowing multipartite measurements, the interactions can be induced with arbitrary low decoherence. Our results have implications for gravity-inspired decoherence models and the simple framework used in the present study can find applications in devising novel quantum control protocols, or quantum simulations.

abstract: Quasi-probability distributions are an essential tool in analyzing the properties of quantum systems, especially in quantum optics. The Glauber-Sudarshan P-function $P(\alpha)$ is especially useful for calculating the density matrix of a system, but it is often assumed that $P(\alpha)$ may not exist for highly quantum-mechanical systems due to its singular nature. Here we define a generalized delta function with a complex argument and derive its properties, which are very different from those of a conventional Dirac delta function. The generalized delta function is then used to calculate $P(\alpha)$ for a Schrodinger cat state in a surprisingly simple form. The generalized delta function effectively converts the diagonal elements that appear in $P(\alpha)$ into off-diagonal elements in the density operator. Similar techniques can be used for more general quantum states.

title: Quantizing the Vector Potential Reveals Alternative Views of the Magnetic Aharonov-Bohm Phase Shift

abstract: A complete quantum analysis of Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) magnetic phase shift involves three entities, the electron, the charges constituting the solenoid current, and the vector potential. The usual calculation supposes that the solenoid's vector potential may be well-approximated as classical. The A-B shift is then acquired by the quantized electron moving in this vector potential. Recently, Vaidman presented a semi-classical calculation, later confirmed by a fully quantum calculation of Pearle and Rizzi, where it is supposed that the electron's vector potential may be well-approximated as classical. The A-B shift is then acquired by the quantized solenoid charges moving in this vector potential. Here we present a third calculation, which supposes that the electron and solenoid currents may be well-approximated as classical sources. The A-B phase shift is then shown to be acquired by the quantized vector potential. We regard these as three equivalent alternative ways of calculating the A-B shift. To show this, consider the exact problem where all three entities are quantized. But, as in the first two cases above, make the supposition that it is a good approximation to take the vector potential as classical. With both the electron phase shift and the solenoid phase shift mechanisms operating, this gives twice the A-B phase shift. Thus, this is a faulty supposition. We make a better approximation. We take the wave function for the exact problem as the product of a vector potential wave function and an electron/solenoid wave function, and apply a variational principle. This leads to a Schr\"odinger equation for the electron/solenoid wave function with an additional term. The additional term can be written so as to cancel the electron phase shift mechanism, or to cancel the solenoid phase shift mechanism. This leads to three alternative views.

abstract: We study the effects of long-range hopping and long-range inter-particle interactions on quantum walk of hard-core bosons in ideal and disordered one-dimensional lattices. We find that the range of hopping has a much more significant effect on the particle correlation dynamics than the range of interactions. We illustrate that long-range hopping makes the correlation diagrams asymmetric with respect to the sign of the interaction and examine the relative role of repulsive and attractive interactions on the dynamics of scattering by isolated impurities and Anderson localization in dis- ordered lattices. We show that weakly repulsive interactions increase the probability of tunnelling through isolated impurities and decrease the localization length.

abstract: Phase-space distributions are widely applied in quantum optics to access the nonclassical features of radiations fields. In particular, the inability to interpret the Glauber-Sudarshan distribution in terms of a classical probability density is the fundamental benchmark for quantum light. However, this phase-space distribution cannot be directly reconstructed for arbitrary states, because of its singular behaviour. In this work, we perform a characterization of the Glauber-Sudarshan representation in terms of distribution theory. We address important features of such distributions: (i) the maximal degree of their singularities is studied; (ii) the ambiguity of representation is shown; and (iii) their dual space for nonclassicality tests is specified. In this view, we reconsider the methods for regularizing the Glauber-Sudarshan distribution for verifying its nonclassicality. This treatment is supported with comprehensive examples and counter-examples.

abstract: Removing exactly one photon from an arbitrary input pulse is an elementary operation in quantum optics and enables applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation. Here we demonstrate a deterministic single-photon absorber based on the saturation of an optically thick free-space medium by a single photon due to Rydberg blockade. Single-photon subtraction adds a new component to the Rydberg quantum optics toolbox, which already contains photonic logic building-blocks such as single-photon sources, switches, transistors, and conditional $\pi$-phase shifts. Our approach is scalable to multiple cascaded absorbers, essential for preparation of non-classical light states for quantum information and metrology applications, and, in combination with the single-photon transistor, high-fidelity number-resolved photon detection.

abstract: We introduce a model of non-Gaussian quantum channel that stems from the combination of two physically relevant processes occurring in open quantum systems, namely amplitude damping and dephasing. For it we find input states approaching zero output entropy, while respecting the input energy constraint. These states fully exploit the infinite dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Upon truncation of the latter, the minimum output entropy remains finite and optimal input states for such a case are conjectured thanks to numerical evidences.

abstract: Compared with two-level quantum key distribution (QKD), highdimensional QKD enable two distant parties to share a secret key at a higher rate. We provide a finite-key security analysis for the recently proposed practical highdimensional decoy-state QKD protocol based on time-energy entanglement. We employ two methods to estimate the statistical fluctuation of the postselection probability and give a tighter bound on the secure-key capacity. By numerical evaluation, we show the finite-key effect on the secure-key capacity in different conditions. Moreover, our approach could be used to optimize parameters in practical implementations of highdimensional QKD.

abstract: Quantum computation strongly relies on the realisation, manipulation and control of qubits. A central method for realizing qubits is by creating a double-well potential system with a significant gap between the first two eigenvalues and the rest. In this work we first revisit the theoretical grounds underlying the double-well qubit dynamics, then proceed to suggest novel extensions of these principles to a triple-well qutrit with periodic boundary conditions, followed by a general d-well analysis of qudits. These analyses are based on representations of the special unitary groups SU(d) which expose the systems' symmetry and employ them for performing computations. We conclude with a few notes on coherence and scalability of d-well systems.

abstract: Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum simulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic physics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.

abstract: Correlation boxes are hypothetical systems capable of producing the maximal algebraic violation of Bell inequalities, beyond the quantum bound and without superluminal signaling. The fact that these systems show stronger correlations than those presented by maximally entangled quantum states has been regarded as a demonstration that the former are more nonlocal than the latter. By employing an alternative, consistent measure of nonlocality, we show that this conclusion is not necessarily true. In addition, we find a class of correlation boxes that are less nonlocal than the quantum singlet with respect to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, being, at the same time, more nonlocal with respect to the 3322 inequality.

With space division multiplexing, we demonstrate that weak QKD signals can coexist with classical data signals launched at full power in a 53 km 7-core fiber, while showing negligible degradation in performance. Based on a characterization of intercore crosstalk, we perform additional simulations highlighting that classical data bandwidths beyond 1Tb/s can be supported with high speed QKD on the same fiber.

abstract: The art of imparting information onto a light wave by optical signal modulation is fundamental to all forms of optical communication. Among many schemes, direct modulation of laser diodes stands out as a simple, robust, and cost effective method. However, the simultaneous changes in intensity, frequency and phase are a drawback which has prevented its application in the field of secure quantum communication. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a directly phase-modulated light source which overcomes the main disadvantages associated with direct modulation and is suitable for diverse applications such as coherent communications and quantum cryptography. The source separates the tasks of phase preparation and pulse generation between a pair of semiconductor lasers leading to very pure phase states. Moreover, the cavity enhanced electro-optic effect enables the first example of sub-volt halfwave phase modulation at high signal rates. The source is compact, stable and versatile, and we show its potential to become the standard transmitter for future quantum communication networks.

abstract: Data compression is a fundamental problem in quantum and classical information theory. A typical version of the problem is that the sender Alice receives a (classical or quantum) state from some known ensemble and needs to transmit it to the receiver Bob with average error below some specified bound. We consider the case in which the message can have a variable length and goal is to minimize its expected length. For classical case this problem has a well-known solution given by the Huffman coding. In this scheme, expected length of the message is equal to the Shannon entropy of the source (with a constant additive factor) and the protocol succeeds with zero error. This is a single-shot scheme from which the asymptotic result, viz. Shannon's source coding theorem, can be recovered by encoding each input state sequentially. For the quantum case, the asymptotic compression rate is given by the von-Neumann entropy. However, we show that there is no one-shot scheme which is able to match this rate, even if interactive communication is allowed. This is a relatively rare case in quantum information theory where the cost of a quantum task is significantly different from its classical analogue. Our result has implications for direct sum theorems in quantum communication complexity and one-shot formulations of Quantum Reverse Shannon theorem.

abstract: Logic-qubit entanglement has attracted much attention in both quantum communication and quantum computation. Here, we present an efficient protocol to distill the logic-qubit entanglement with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity. This protocol not only can purify the logic bit-flip error and logic phase-flip error, but also can correct the physical bit-flip error completely. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition detectors. Our distillation protocol for logic-qubit entanglement may be useful for the practical applications in quantum information, especially in long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: The maximum operation range of continuous variable quantum key distribution systems is constrained by the efficiency of the forward error correction post processing step. In this paper, we show that the current definition of this forward error correction efficiency can exceed unity when employing fixed-rate error correction codes operating at high word error rates. For efficiencies greater than unity, we show that it is possible achieve a positive secret key over an entanglement breaking channel, equivalent to an intercept and resend attack, a condition in which no secret key is possible. We subsequently propose a new definition of error correction efficiency and show that this new efficiency is bounded from above by unity. We apply this new efficiency to the secret key rate of a continuous variable quantum key distribution system. The net result is a reduction in the operational range of such continuous variable quantum key distribution systems.

abstract: The ultimate goal of quantum information science is to build a global quantum network, which enables quantum resources to be distributed and shared between remote parties. Such quantum network can be realized by all fiber elements, which takes advantage of low transmission loss,low cost, scalable and mutual fiber communication techniques such as dense wavelength division multiplexing. Therefore high quality entangled photon sources based on fibers are on demanding for building up such kind of quantum network. Here we report multiplexed polarization and timebin entanglement photon sources based on dispersion shifted fiber operating at room temperature. High qualities of entanglement are characterized by using interference, Bell inequality and quantum state tomography. Simultaneous presence of entanglements in multichannel pairs of a 100GHz DWDM shows the great capacity for entanglements distribution over multi-users. Our research provides a versatile platform and moves a first step toward constructing an all fiber quantum network.

abstract: Quantum coherence (QC) is a fundamental aspect of quantum systems which is generally smeared due to their interaction with the surroundings. In this article we study the spreading of QC, as quantified by the $l_{1}$-norm QC, when a qubit is subjected to noise channels commonly appearing in quantum information science. We report several interesting aspects of this environment-induced QC flow. For instance, we notice that QC is generally not conserved and that even incoherent initial states can lead to transitory system-environment and/or environment QC. We show that for the amplitude damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of local and non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On the other hand, for the phase damping channel entanglement does not account for all non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and also on the qubit initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and conditions for time invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase, and bit-phase flip channels. The depolarizing channel is also considered, with the qubit's ability to act as a catalyst for the creation of joint QC and entanglement being noticed.

abstract: It is known that Schr\"odinger equation fails in describing the dynamics of highly energetic particles. We propose to quantify this lack of Lorentz covariance by evaluating the probability for a particle to be measured outside the set of light cones which are compatible to its initial wave function. We consider a simple case of a particle released from a box, which, in turn, is inside a larger container. It is shown that besides the increasing error at relativistic energies, there may be a complete breakdown, with Schr\"odinger dynamics implying in deterministic, superluminal signaling for Lorentz factors above 129. In addition, we give an exact asymptotic expression for the violation in local causality by employing the stationary exponent method, from which the Compton wave length of the particle naturally arises as the relevant scale for the stationary points.

abstract: We drastically improve the mode overlap between independently seeded, gain-switched laser diodes operating at gigahertz repetition rates by implementing a pulsed light seeding technique. Injecting pulsed light reduces the emission time jitter and enables frequency chirp synchronization while maintaining random optical phases of the emitted laser pulses. We measure interference of these pulsed sources both in the macroscopic regime, where we demonstrate near perfect mode overlap, and in the single photon regime, where we achieve a Hong-Ou-Mandel dip visibility of 0.499+/-0.004, thus saturating the theoretical limit of 0.5. The measurement results are reproduced by Monte-Carlo simulations with no free parameters. Our light source is an ideal solution for generation of high rate, indistinguishable coherent pulses for quantum information applications.

abstract: The resources needed to conventionally characterize a quantum system are overwhelmingly large for high- dimensional systems. This obstacle may be overcome by abandoning traditional cornerstones of quantum measurement, such as general quantum states, strong projective measurement, and assumption-free characterization. Following this reasoning, we demonstrate an efficient technique for characterizing high-dimensional, spatial entanglement with one set of measurements. We recover sharp distributions with local, random filtering of the same ensemble in momentum followed by position---something the uncertainty principle forbids for projective measurements. Exploiting the expectation that entangled signals are highly correlated, we use fewer than 5,000 measurements to characterize a 65, 536-dimensional state. Finally, we use entropic inequalities to witness entanglement without a density matrix. Our method represents the sea change unfolding in quantum measurement where methods influenced by the information theory and signal-processing communities replace unscalable, brute-force techniques---a progression previously followed by classical sensing.

abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNG) represent an advanced solution for randomness generation, essential in every cryptographic applications. In this context, integrated arrays of single photon detectors have promising applications as QRNGs based on the spatial detection of photons. For the employment of QRNGs in Cryptography, it is necessary to have efficient methods to evaluate the so called quantum min-entropy that corresponds to the amount of the true extractable quantum randomness from the QRNG. Here we present an efficient method that allow to estimate the quantum min-entropy for a multi-detector QRNG. In particular, we will consider a scenario in which an attacker can control the efficiency of the detectors and knows the emitted number of photons. Eventually, we apply the method to a QRNG with $10^3$ detectors.

abstract: For a fixed average energy, the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases can provide a better total precision than estimating them individually. We show this for a multimode interferometer with a phase in each mode, using Gaussian inputs and passive elements, by calculating the covariance matrix. The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound provides a lower bound to the covariance matrix via the quantum Fisher information matrix, whose elements we derive to be the covariances of the photon numbers across the modes. We find our simultaneous strategy to yield no more than a factor of two improvement in total precision. In spite of the Gaussian nature of the problem, these elements require the calculation of non-Gaussian integrals, which we accomplish analytically. We prove that this bound can be saturated. Our work shows that no modal entanglement is necessary for simultaneous quantum-enhanced estimation of multiple phases.

abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks are natural tools for spatial search, where one searches for a marked vertex in a graph. Sometimes, the structure of the graph causes the walker to get trapped, such that the probability of finding the marked vertex is limited. We give an example with two linked cliques, proving that the captive probability can be liberated by increasing the weights of the links. This allows the search to succeed with probability 1 without increasing the energy scaling of the algorithm. Further increasing the weights, however, slows the runtime, so the optimal search requires weights that are neither too weak nor too strong.

abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic quantum problem of a particle constrained to a double cone surface. For this purpose, we build the Dirac equation in a curved space using the tetrads formalism. Two cases are analysed. First, we consider a free particle on a double cone surface, and then we add an uniform magnetic field. The energy spectrum is obtained and the instability of the motion is discussed. We show that the magnetic field breaks the nappe degeneracy, inducing different energy spectra for each nappe. The results obtained here can be applied, for instance, in he investigation of the electronic and transport properties of condensed matter systems that can be described by an effective Dirac equation, such as graphene and topological insulators.

We put forward a thermodynamically consistent alternative by explicitly considering parts of the reaction center/electric circuit and by employing a Hamiltonian transfer. The predicted energy transfer by the new scheme differs from the one found using a decay rate, casting doubts on the validity of the conclusions obtained by models which include the latter.

abstract: In 1862, George Boole derived an inequality for variables, now known as Boolean variables, that in his opinion represents a demarcation line between possible and impossible experience. This inequality forms an important milestone in the epistemology of probability theory and probability measures. In 1985 Leggett and Garg derived a physics related inequality, mathematically identical to Boole's, that according to them represents a demarcation between macroscopic realism and quantum mechanics. Their formalism, constructed for the magnetic flux of SQUIDS, includes general features and applies also to many other quantum experiments. We show that a wide gulf, a wide divide, separates the "sense impressions" and corresponding data, as well as the postulates of macroscopic realism, from the mathematical abstractions that are used to derive the inequality of Leggett-Garg. If the gulf can be bridged, one may indeed derive the said inequality, which is then clearly a demarcation between possible and impossible experience: it cannot be violated and is not violated by quantum theory. We deduce from this fact that a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality does not mean that the SQUID-flux is not there when nobody looks, as Leggett-Garg suggest, but instead that the probability measures may not be what Leggett-Garg have assumed them to be, when no data can be secured that directly relate to them. We show that similar considerations apply to other well known quantum interpretation-puzzles including that of the two-slit experiment.

abstract: Counterfactual definiteness must be used as at least one of the postulates or axioms that are necessary to derive Bell-type inequalities. It is considered by many to be a postulate that is not only commensurate with classical physics (as for example Einstein's special relativity), but also separates and distinguishes classical physics from quantum mechanics. It is the purpose of this paper to show that Bell's choice of mathematical functions and independent variables implicitly includes counterfactual definiteness and reduces the generality of the physics of Bell-type theories so significantly that no meaningful comparison of these theories with actual Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments can be made.

abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model is a paradigm of exactly-solvable models, showing non-trivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, abelian and non-abelian anyons, and chirality. Its solution is one of the most beautiful examples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN) description of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic limit, and in particular for its ground state. In our setting, eigenstates are naturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary operators, corresponding to the unitary quantum circuit building up the many-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different "solution ingredients" of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in the TN language, namely: Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana modes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN built in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the model. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both at zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector. Finally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to a 2d Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The results in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model, e.g., to other lattices, spins, and dimensions.

abstract: Quantum critical points are traditionally associated with non-analyticity of the ground state energy reflecting fundamental differences between phases of a system undergoing a quantum phase transition. We discuss how this non-analyticity is passed onto ground state expectation values of different terms of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate our results in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model that can be realized in cold atomic systems. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that one can easily extract the position of the critical point in this model from the on-site atom number fluctuations and nearest-neighbor tunnelling. Our results provide a simple experimentally-relevant way of locating critical points in numerous systems undergoing a quantum phase transition.

abstract: The quantum entanglement measure is determined, for the first time, for a collection of spin-1/2 arranged in a infinite chain with finite temperature and applied to a single-crystal \beta-\mathrm{T_eVO_4}. The physical quantity proposed here to measure the entanglement is the distance between states by adopting the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We relate the distance between states with the magnetic susceptibility. The decoherence temperature, above which the entanglement is suppressed, is determined for a system. A correlation among their decoherence temperatures and their respective exchange coupling constants is established, moreover, it is conjectured that the exchange coupling protects the system from decoherence as temperature increases.

abstract: We investigate the distribution and temperature-dependent optical properties of sharp, zero-phonon emission from defect-based single photon sources in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flakes. We observe sharp emission lines from optically active defects distributed across an energy range that exceeds 500 meV. Spectrally-resolved photon-correlation measurements verify single photon emission, even when multiple emission lines are simultaneously excited within the same h-BN flake. We also present a detailed study of the temperature-dependent linewidth, spectral energy shift, and intensity for two different zero-phonon lines centered at 575 nm and 682 nm, which reveals a nearly identical temperature dependence despite a large difference in transition energy. Our temperature-dependent results are best described by a lattice vibration model that considers piezoelectric coupling to in-plane phonons. Finally, polarization spectroscopy measurements suggest that whereas the 575 nm emission line is directly excited by 532 nm excitation, the 682 nm line is excited indirectly.

abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb lattice spin model is a remarkable exactly solvable model which has a spin-liquid ground state. Although its possible realization in iridates and RuCl$_3$ has been vigorously discussed recently, these materials are dominated by non-Kitaev direct exchange interactions and do not have a spin liquid ground state. We propose metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with Ru$^{3+}$ (or Os$^{3+}$) forming the honeycomb (or other tricoordinated) lattice as new candidates for more ideal realization of Kitaev-type spin model where the direct exchange interaction is strongly suppressed. We argue that, in this class of materials, the degeneracy of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the organic ligand implies a suppression of non-Kitaev interactions. As concrete examples, we estimate interactions in MOFs with oxalate-based or tetraaminopyrazine-based ligands, and show that they are promising candidates to realize Kitaev spin liquids.

abstract: The main aim of the present paper is to prove the existence of a phase transition in quantum Markov chain (QMC) scheme for the Ising type models on a Cayley tree. Note that this kind of models do not have one-dimensional analogous, i.e. the considered model persists only on trees. In this paper, we provide a more general construction of forward QMC. In that construction, a QMC is defined as a weak limit of finite volume states with boundary conditions, i.e. QMC depends on the boundary conditions. Our main result states the existence of a phase transition for the Ising model with competing interactions on a Cayley tree of order two. By the phase transition we mean the existence of two distinct QMC which are not quasi-equivalent and their supports do not overlap. We also study some algebraic property of the disordered phase of the model, which is a new phenomena even in a classical setting.

abstract: A common approach to evaluate entropy in quantum systems is to solve a master-Bloch equation to determine density matrix and substitute it in entropy definition. However, this method has been recently understood to lack many energy correlators. The new correlators make entropy evaluation to be different from the substitution method described above. The reason for such complexity lies in the nonlinearity of entropy. In this paper we present a pedagogical approach to evaluate the new correlators and explain their contribution in the analysis. We show that the inherent nonlinearity in entropy makes the second law of thermodynamics to carry new terms associated to the new correlators. Our results show important new remarks on quantum black holes. Our formalism reveals that the notion of degeneracy of states at the event horizon makes an indispensable deviation from black hole entropy in the leading order.

abstract: The classical approach to spacetime singularities leads to a simplified dynamics in which spatial derivatives become unimportant compared to time derivatives, and thus each spatial point essentially becomes uncoupled from its neighbors. This uncoupled dynamics leads to sharp features (called "spikes") as follows: particular spatial points follow an exceptional dynamical path that differs from that of their neighbors, with the consequence that in the neighborhood of these exceptional points the spatial profile becomes ever more sharp. Spikes are consequences of the BKL-type oscillatory evolution towards generic singularities of spacetime. Do spikes persist when the spacetime dynamics are treated using quantum mechanics? To address this question, we treat a Hamiltonian system that describes the dynamics of the approach to the singularity and consider how to quantize that system. We argue that this particular system is best treated using an affine quantization approach (rather than the more familiar methods of cannonical quantization) and we set up the formalism needed for this treatment.

abstract: We introduce multiscale invariant dictionaries to estimate quantum chemical energies of organic molecules, from training databases. Molecular energies are invariant to isometric atomic displacements, and are Lipschitz continuous to molecular deformations. Similarly to density functional theory (DFT), the molecule is represented by an electronic density function. A multiscale invariant dictionary is calculated with wavelet scattering invariants. It cascades a first wavelet transform which separates scales, with a second wavelet transform which computes interactions across scales. Sparse scattering regressions give state of the art results over two databases of organic planar molecules. On these databases, the regression error is of the order of the error produced by DFT codes, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

abstract: Microwave cavities have been widely used to investigate the behavior of closed few-level systems. Here, we show that they also represent a powerful probe for the dynamics of charge transfer between a discrete electronic level and fermionic continua. We have combined experiment and theory for a carbon nanotube quantum dot coupled to normal metal and superconducting contacts. In equilibrium conditions, where our device behaves as an effective quantum dot-normal metal junction, we approach a universal photon dissipation regime governed by a quantum charge relaxation effect. We observe how photon dissipation is modified when the dot admittance turns from capacitive to inductive. When the fermionic reservoirs are voltage biased, the dot can even cause photon emission due to inelastic tunneling to/from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer peak in the density of states of the superconducting contact. We can model these numerous effects quantitatively in terms of the charge susceptibility of the quantum dot circuit. This validates an approach that could be used to study a wide class of mesoscopic QED devices.

abstract: We develop a Floquet approach to solve time-periodic quantum Langevin equations in steady state. We show that two-time correlation functions of system operators can be expanded in a Fourier series and that a generalized Wiener-Khinchin theorem relates the Fourier transform of their zeroth Fourier component to the measured spectrum. We apply our framework to bichromatically driven cavity optomechanical systems, a setting in which mechanical oscillators have recently been prepared in quantum-squeezed states. Our method provides an intuitive way to calculate the power spectral densities for time-periodic quantum Langevin equations in arbitrary rotating frames.

abstract: We explore the modification of the entropic formulation of uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics which measures the incompatibility of measurements in terms of Shannon entropy. The deformation in question is the type so called generalized uncertainty principle that is motivated by thought experiments in quantum gravity and string theory and is characterized by a parameter of Planck scale. The corrections are evaluated for small deformation parameters by use of the Gaussian wave function and numerical calculation. As the generalized uncertainty principle has proven to be useful in the study of the quantum nature of black holes, this study would be a step toward introducing an information theory viewpoint to black hole physics.

abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a two-level system under ultrastrong driving when the frequency and strength of the exciting field exceed significantly the transition frequency. We find three qualitatively different regimes of such dynamics: 1) the collapse and revival of oscillations in the population difference, 2) the simple exponential decay of the oscillations resulting in their steady state with the finite amplitude, and 3) the steady-state stabilization of the equally populated levels. The nonmonotonic Bessel-function-like dependence on the driving strength is also predicted for the decay rate of these oscillations. The features of this dependence are determined by the relative rates of energetic relaxation and pure dephasing.

title: Exact canonic eigenstates of the truncated Bogoliubov Hamiltonian in an interacting bosons gas

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.04826
abstract: In a gas of $N$ weakly interacting bosons \cite{Bogo1, Bogo2}, a truncated canonic Hamiltonian $\widetilde{h}_c$ follows from dropping all the interaction terms between free bosons with momentum $\hbar\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}$. Bogoliubov Canonic Approximation (BCA) is a further manipulation, replacing the number \emph{operator} $\widetilde{N}_{in}$ of free particles in $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, with the total number $N$ of bosons. BCA transforms $\widetilde{h}_c$ into a different Hamiltonian $H_{BCA}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}}\epsilon(k)B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}B_\mathbf{k}+const$, where $B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}$ and $B_\mathbf{k}$ create/annihilate non interacting pseudoparticles. The problem of the \emph{exact} eigenstates of the truncated Hamiltonian is completely solved in the thermodynamic limit (TL) for a special class of eigensolutions $|\:S,\:\mathbf{k}\:\rangle_{c}$, denoted as \textquoteleft s-pseudobosons\textquoteright, with energies $\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$ and \emph{zero} total momentum. Some preliminary results are given for the exact eigenstates (denoted as \textquoteleft $\eta$-pseudobosons\textquoteright), carrying a total momentum $\eta\hbar\mathbf{k}$ ($\eta=\:1,\:2,\: \dots$). A comparison is done with $H_{BCA}$ and with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory (GPT), showing that some differences between exact and BCA/GPT results persist even in the TL. Finally, it is argued that the emission of $\eta$-pseudobosons, which is responsible for the dissipation $\acute{a}$ \emph{la} Landau \cite{L}, could be significantly different from the usual picture, based on BCA pseudobosons.

abstract: We theoretically study transport of time-bin entangled photon pairs in a two-dimensional topological photonic system of coupled ring resonators. This system implements the integer quantum Hall model using a synthetic gauge field and exhibits topologically robust edge states. We show that the topological edge states provide a robust channel for on-chip quantum communication when the information is encoded in temporal correlations of photons. In contrast to edge states, transport through bulk states does not preserve these correlations and can lead to significant unwanted temporal bunching or anti-bunching of photons. We also compare the transport of entangled two-photon states to separable two-photon states and show that the entangled states are more fragile. Furthermore, we study the effect of disorder on the quantum transport properties; while the edge transport remains robust, bulk transport is very susceptible, and in the limit of strong disorder, bulk states become localized. We show that this localization is manifested as an enhanced bunching/anti-bunching of photons.
