abstract: Huw Price has proposed an argument that suggests a time-symmetric ontology for quantum theory must necessarily be retrocausal, i.e. it must involve influences that travel backwards in time. One of Price's assumptions is that the quantum state is a state of reality. However, one of the reasons for exploring retrocausality is that it offers the potential for evading the consequences of no-go theorems, including recent proofs of the reality of the quantum state. Here, we show that this assumption can be replaced by a different assumption, called $\lambda$-mediation, that plausibly holds independently of the status of the quantum state. We also reformulate the other assumptions behind the argument to place them in a more general framework and pin down the notion of time symmetry involved more precisely. We show that our assumptions imply a timelike analogue of Bell's local causality criterion and, in doing so, give a new interpretation of timelike violations of Bell inequalities. Namely, they show the impossibility of a (non-retrocausal) time-symmetric ontology.

abstract: We present a new implementation of quantum computation that treats quantum computers as a special type of Bayesian Network called a QuDot Net. QuDot Nets allow for the efficient representation of some qubit systems. Single qubit quantum gates can be implemented as edge transformations on QuDot Nets. The X, H, R(k), M and SWAP gates are discussed in detail and results show linear scaling as the number of qubits are increased. We show that measurement and semi-quantum control gates can be efficiently implemented using QuDot Nets and present results from a QuDot Net implementation of the terminal Quantum Fourier Transform. We show how QuDot Nets can implement coherent control gates using multi-digraphs by labelling parallel edges. Lastly, we discuss implications to quantum foundations if a classical implementation of quantum computation is realized.

abstract: We report the measurement of the acoustic quality factor of a gram-scale, kilo-hertz frequency superfluid resonator, detected through the parametric coupling to a superconducting niobium microwave cavity. For temperature between 400mK and 50mK, we observe a $T^{-4}$ temperature dependence of the quality factor, consistent with a 3-phonon dissipation mechanism. We observe Q factors up to $1.4\cdot10^8$, consistent with the dissipation due to dilute $^3$He impurities, and expect that significant further improvements are possible. These experiments are relevant to exploring quantum behavior and decoherence of massive macroscopic objects, the laboratory detection of continuous wave gravitational waves from pulsars, and the probing of possible limits to physical length scales.

abstract: We develop a quantum theory describing the input-output properties of Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers. This allows us to show how such a device can be used as a source of nonclassical radiation, and how dispersion engineering can be used to tailor gain profiles and squeezing spectra with attractive properties, ranging from genuinely broadband spectra to "squeezing combs" consisting of a number of discrete entangled quasimodes. The device's output field can be used to generate a multi-mode squeezed bath--a powerful resource for dissipative quantum state preparation. In particular, we show how it can be used to generate continuous variable cluster states that are universal for measurement based quantum computing. The favourable scaling properties of the preparation scheme makes it a promising path towards continuous variable quantum computing in the microwave regime.

abstract: A proposal for the generation of singlet states of three $\Lambda$-type Rydberg atoms is presented. The singlet state is prepared through the combination of a Rydberg state and an EPR pair, and the scheme relies on the Rydberg blockade effect which prevents the simultaneous excitation of the two atoms to a Rydberg state. In addition, some frequency detuning between lasers and atomic transitions is set to eliminate the degenerate of the two ground states. And finally, a series of numerical simulations are made to show the feasibility of the scheme.

In this proposal, the system may be robust both parameter fluctuations and dissipation along a dark state. In addition, quantum information is only stored in atomic ground states and there is no energy exchanged between atoms and photons in a cavity so as to reduce the influence of atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decays.

abstract: Detecting and weighing the individual nanoparticles is an important approach to study the behavior and properties of single particles. Here we illustrate an effective mass sensing scheme using optomechanical resonator system. Based on the optomechanically induced transparency phenomenon, a Stokes field reference approach is used to sense the mass of the particle on the microresonator. The field intensity of the transmission field will be changed by the effect of the particle which avoids the limits of decay induced spectral width in the resonance shift detection. Exploiting the perturbation method, we theoretically evaluated the dynamical behavior of the system, and achieved the femtogram level mass sensing without the need for high cavity Q-value, and strong coupling strength in the optomechanically system.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of entanglement swapping between two distinct qubits coupled to their own (in general) non-Markovian environments. This is done via Bell state measurement performing on the photons leaving the dissipative cavities. In the continuation, we introduce the concept of entangling power to measure the average of swapped entanglement over all possible pure initial states. Then, we present our results in two strong and weak coupling regimes and discuss the role of detuning parameter in each regime on the amount of swapped entanglement. We also determine the conditions in which the maximum amount of entanglement can be swapped between two qubits. It is revealed that despite of the presence of dissipation, it is possible to create long-living stationary entanglement between two qubits.

abstract: Synthesis of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state --- the primary entangled resource in continuous-variable quantum-optical information processing --- is a technological challenge of great importance. Here we propose and implement a new scheme of generating this state. Two nonlinear optical crystals, positioned back-to-back in the waist of a pump beam, function as single-pass degenerate optical parametric amplifiers and produce single-mode squeezed vacuum states in orthogonal polarization modes, but in the same spatiotemporal mode. A subsequent pair of waveplates acts as a beam splitter, entangling the two polarization modes to generate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. This technique takes advantage of the strong nonlinearity associated with type-I phase-matching configuration while at the same time eliminating the need for actively stabilizing the optical phase between the two squeezers, which typically arises if these squeezers are spatially separated. We demonstrate our method in an experiment, preparing a 1.4 dB two-mode squeezed state and characterizing it via two-mode homodyne tomography.

abstract: Quantum coherence is the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The usual understanding of it depends on the choice of the basis, that is, the coherence of the same quantum state is different within different reference framework. To reveal all the potential coherence, we present the total quantum coherence measures in terms of two different methods. One is optimizing maximal basis-dependent coherence with all potential bases considered and the other is quantifying the distance between the state and the incoherent state set. Interestingly, the coherence measures based on relative entropy and $l_2$ norm have the same form in the two different methods. In particular, we show that the measures based on the non-contractive $l_2$ norm is also a good measure different from the basis-dependent coherence. In addition, we show that all the measures are analytically calculable and have all the good properties. The experimental schemes for the detection of these coherence measures are also proposed by multiple copies of quantum states instead of reconstructing the full density matrix. By studying one type of quantum probing schemes, we find that both the normalized trace in the scheme of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1) and the overlap of two states in quantum overlap measurement schemes (QOM) can be well described by the change of total coherence of the probing qubit. Hence the nontrivial probing always leads to the change of the total coherence.

abstract: The standard deviation (SD) quantifies the spread of the observed values on a measurement of an observable. In this paper, we study the distribution of SD among the different components of a superposition state. It is found that the SD of an observable on a superposition state can be well bounded by the SDs of the superposed states. We also show that the bounds also serve as good bounds on coherence of a superposition state. As a further generalization, we give an alternative definition of incompatibility of two observables subject to a given state and show how the incompatibility subject to a superposition state is distributed.

abstract: Witnessing entanglement is crucial in quantum information processing. With properly preparing ancillary states, it has been shown previously that genuine entanglement can be witnessed without trusting measurement devices. In this work, we generalize the scenario and show that generic multipartite entanglement structures, including entanglement of subsystems and entanglement depth, can be witnessed via measurement-device-independent means. As the original measurement-device-independent entanglement witness scheme exploits only one out of four Bell measurement outcomes for each party, a direct generalization to multipartite quantum states will inevitably cause inefficiency in entanglement detection after taking account of statistical fluctuations. To resolve this problem, we also present a way to utilize all the measurement outcomes. The scheme is efficient for multipartite entanglement detection and can be realized with state-of-the-art technologies.

abstract: We investigate the effect of variations in beam splitter transmissions and path length differences in the nonlinear sign gate that is used for linear optical quantum computing. We identify two implementations of the gate, and show that the sensitivity to variations in their components differs significantly between them. Therefore, circuits that require a precision implementation may benefit from additional circuit analysis of component variations to identify the most practical implementation. We suggest possible routes to efficient circuit analysis in terms of quantum parameter estimation.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08039
abstract: When the weak value of a projector is 1, a quantum system behaves as in that eigenstate with probability 1. By definition, however, the weak value may take an anomalous value lying outside the range of probability like -1. From the viewpoint of a physical effect, we show that such a negative weak value of -1 can be regarded as the counterpart of the ordinary value of 1. Using photons, we experimentally verify it as the symmetrical shift in polarization depending on the weak value given by pre-postselection of the path state. Unlike observation of a weak value as an ensemble average via weak measurements, the effect of a weak value is definitely confirmed in two photon interference: the symmetrical shift corresponding to the weak value can be directly observed as the rotation angle of a half wave plate.

abstract: It is well known that a state with complex energy cannot be the eigenstate of a self-adjoint operator, like the Hamiltonian. Resonances, i.e. states with exponentially decaying observables, are not vectors belonging to the conventional Hilbert space. One can describe these resonances in an unusual mathematical formalism, based on the so-called Rigged Hilbert Space (RHS). In the RHS, the states with complex energy are denoted as Gamow Vectors (GV), and they model decay processes. We study GV of the Reversed Harmonic Oscillator (RHO), and we analytically and numerically investigate the unstable evolution of wave packets. We introduce the background function to study initial data not composed only by a summation of GV and we analyse different wave packets belonging to specific function spaces. Our work furnishes support to the idea that irreversible wave propagations can be investigated by means of Rigged Hilbert Space Quantum Mechanics and provides insights for the experimental investigation of irreversible dynamics.

abstract: Over the last years, Projected Entangled Pair States have demonstrated great power for the study of many body systems, as they naturally describe ground states of gapped many body Hamiltonians, and suggest a constructive way to encode and classify their symmetries. The PEPS study is not only limited to global symmetries, but has also been extended and applied for local symmetries, allowing to use them for the description of states in lattice gauge theories. In this paper we discuss PEPS with a local, SU(2) gauge symmetry, and demonstrate the use of PEPS features and techniques for the study of a simple family of many body states with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. We present, in particular, the construction of fermionic PEPS able to describe both two-color fermionic matter and the degrees of freedom of an SU(2) gauge field with a suitable truncation.

abstract: We propose a general scheme for a digital construction of lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermions. In this method, the four-body interactions arising in models with $2+1$ dimensions and higher, are obtained stroboscopically, through a sequence of two-body interactions with ancillary degrees of freedom. This yields stronger interactions than the ones obtained through pertubative methods, as typically done in previous proposals, and removes an important bottleneck in the road towards experimental realizations. The scheme applies to generic gauge theories with Lie or finite symmetry groups, both Abelian and non-Abelian. As a concrete example, we present the construction of a digital quantum simulator for a $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical fermionic matter in $2+1$ dimensions, using ultracold atoms in optical lattices, involving three atomic species, representing the matter, gauge and auxiliary degrees of freedom, that are separated in three different layers. By moving the ancilla atoms with a proper sequence of steps, we show how we can obtain the desired evolution in a clean, controlled way.

abstract: Stators, which may be intuitively defined as "half states, half operators" are mathematical objects which act on two Hilbert spaces and utilize entanglement to create remote operations and exchange information between two physical systems. In particular, they allow to induce effective dynamics on one physical system by acting on the other one, given they have properly been connected with the right stator. In this work, the concept of stators generalized and formalized in a way that allows the utilization of stators for some physical problems based on symmetry groups, and in particular digital quantum simulation.

abstract: Quantum communication is at the forefront of quantum technology, enabling the development of absolutely secure encryption, distributed quantum computing, teleportation and more. Whilst quantum communication has been experimentally demonstrated at distances on the order of hundreds of kilometers, the establishment of high-fidelity pairs shared over larger distances remains a formidable technical challenge due to attenuation. However, this may be overcome with the use of quantum repeaters. Here we propose a method to construct a robust quantum repeater network using only existing technology. Our protocol is able to perform all parts of the procedure in a way that is highly tolerant to photon loss and imperfections in detectors, and it achieves secure bit rates on the order of kilohertz over intercontinental distances.

comments: 28 pages, 8 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08168
abstract: We prove a general relation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in the quantum setting, i.e., between strategies where the adversary can or cannot adaptively base its action on some auxiliary quantum side information. Our relation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can control the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its "information content". Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in the analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very powerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks. We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with two examples. The first is a quantum bit commitment scheme based on 1-bit cut-and-choose. Since bit commitment implies oblivious transfer (in the quantum setting), and oblivious transfer is universal for two-party computation, this implies the universality of 1-bit cut-and-choose, and thus solves the main open problem of [FKSZZ13]. The second example is a quantum bit commitment scheme proposed in 1993 by Brassard et al. It was originally suggested as an unconditionally secure scheme, back when this was thought to be possible. We partly restore the scheme by proving it secure in (a variant of) the bounded quantum storage model. In both examples, the fact that the adversary holds quantum side information obstructs a direct analysis of the scheme, and we circumvent it by analyzing a non-adaptive version, which can be done by means of known techniques, and applying our main result.

abstract: Classical and quantum physics provide fundamentally different predictions about experiments with separate observers that do not communicate, a phenomenon known as quantum nonlocality. This insight is a key element of our present understanding of quantum physics, and also enables a number of information processing protocols with security beyond what is classically attainable. Relaxing the pivotal assumption of no communication leads to new insights into the nature quantum correlations, and may enable new applications where security can be established under less strict assumptions. Here, we study such relaxations where different forms of communication are allowed. We consider communication of inputs, outputs, and of a message between the parties. Using several measures, we study how much communication is required for classical models to reproduce quantum or general no-signalling correlations, as well as how quantum models can be augmented with classical communication to reproduce no-signalling correlations.

abstract: In this paper, we provide an operational criterion for controlled dense coding with a general class of three-qubit non-trivial pure entangled states. A general three-qubit pure entangled state can be classified into two inequivalent classes according to their genuine tripartite entanglement. We claim that if a three-qubit state shows entanglement characteristic similar to $GHZ$-class then such non-trivial tripartite states are useful in {\it controlled dense coding} whereas states belonging to $W$-class are not useful for that. We start with a particular class of non-trivial partially entangled states belonging to $GHZ$-class and show that they are effective in controlled dense coding. Then we cite several other examples of different types of tripartite entangled states to support our claim.

abstract: We consider the 2D alternate quantum walk on a cylinder. We concentrate on the study of the motion along the open dimension, in the spirit of looking at the closed coordinate as a small or "hidden" extra dimension. If one starts from localized initial conditions on the lattice, the dynamics of the quantum walk that is obtained after tracing out the small dimension shows the contribution of several components, which can be understood from the study of the dispersion relations for this problem. In fact, these components originate from the contribution of the possible values of the quasi-momentum in the closed dimension. In the continuous space-time limit, the different components manifest as a set of Dirac equations, with each quasi-momentum providing the value of the corresponding mass. We briefly discuss the possible link of these ideas to the simulation of high energy physical theories that include extra dimensions.

abstract: Quantum position verification (QPV) is the art of verifying the geographical location of an untrusted party. Recently, it has been shown that the widely studied Bennett & Brassard 1984 (BB84) QPV protocol is insecure after the 3 dB loss point assuming local operations and classical communication (LOCC) adversaries. Here, we propose a time-reversed entanglement swapping QPV protocol (based on measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography) that is highly robust against quantum channel loss. First, assuming ideal qubit sources, we show that the protocol is secure against LOCC adversaries for any quantum channel loss, thereby overcoming the 3 dB loss limit. Then, we analyze the security of the protocol in a more practical setting involving weak laser sources and linear optics. In this setting, we find that the security only degrades by an additive constant and the protocol is able to verify positions up to 47 dB channel loss.

abstract: We utilize quantum superposition principle to establish the upper and lower bounds on the stronger uncertainty relation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 260401 (2014)], i.e., the "weighted-like" sum of the variances of observables. Our bounds include some free parameters which not only guarantee the nontrivial bounds but also can effectively control the bounds as tightly as one expects. Especially, these parameters don't obviously depend on the state and observables. It also implies one advantage of our method that any nontrivial bound can always be tight enough. In addition, we generalize both bounds to the uncertainty relation with multiple observables, but the perfect tightness is not changed. Examples are given to illustrate the tightness of our bounds in each case.

abstract: We experimentally study a periodically driven many-body localized system realized by interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-disordered optical lattice. By preparing the system in a far-from-equilibrium state and monitoring the remains of an imprinted density pattern, we identify a localized phase at high drive frequencies and an ergodic phase at low ones. These two distinct phases are separated by a dynamical phase transition which depends on both the drive frequency and the drive strength. Our observations are quantitatively supported by numerical simulations and are directly connected to the change in the statistical properties of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian.

abstract: Dynamical back-action cooling of phonons in optomechanical systems having one optical mode is well studied. Systems with two optical modes have the potential to reach significantly higher cooling rate through resonant enhancement of both pump and scattered light. Here we experimentally investigate the role of dual optical densities of states on optomechanical cooling, and the deviation from theory caused by thermal locking to the pump laser. Using this, we demonstrate a room temperature system operating very close to the strong coupling regime, where saturation of cooling is anticipated.

abstract: We demonstrate continuous measurement and coherent control of the collective spin of an atomic ensemble undergoing Larmor precession in a high-finesse optical cavity. The coupling of the precessing spin oscillator to the cavity field yields phenomena similar to those observed in cavity optomechanics, including cavity amplification, damping, and optical spring shifts. These effects arise from autonomous optical feedback onto the atomic spin dynamics, conditioned by the cavity spectrum. We use this feedback to stabilize the spin in either its high- or low-energy state, where it achieves a steady-state temperature in equilibrium with measurement back-action. We measure the effective spin temperature from the asymmetry between the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands and show that, for sufficiently large Larmor frequency, such a feedback-stabilized spin ensemble remains in a nearly pure quantum state, in spite of continuous interaction with the probe field.

abstract: We present, experimentally and theoretically, a scheme for dressed-state electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a three-step cascade system where a four-level system is mapped into an effective three-level system. Theoretical analysis reveals that the scheme provides coherent state control via adiabatic following and provides a generalized protocol for light storage in uniform phase spin-waves that are insensitive to motional dephasing. The three-step driving enables a number of other features including spatial selectivity of the excitation region within the atomic medium, and kick-free and Doppler-free excitation that produces narrow resonances in thermal vapor. As a proof of concept we present an experimental demonstration of the generalized EIT scheme using the $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 6P_{3/2} \rightarrow 7S_{1/2} \rightarrow 8P_{1/2}$ excitation path in thermal cesium vapor. This technique could be applied to cold and thermal ensembles to enable longer storage times for Rydberg polaritons.

title: Benchmarking of dynamically corrected gates for the exchange-only spin qubit in 1/f noise environment

abstract: We study theoretically the responses of the dynamically corrected gates to time-dependent noises in the exchange-only spin qubit system. We consider $1/f$ noises having spectra proportional to $1/\omega^\alpha$, where the exponent $\alpha$ indicates the strength of correlation within the noise. The quantum gate errors due to noises are extracted from a numerical simulation of Randomized Benchmarking, and are compared between the application of uncorrected operations and that of dynamically corrected gates robust against the hyperfine noise. We have found that for $\alpha\gtrsim1.5$, the dynamically corrected gates offer considerable reduction in the gate error and such reduction is approximately two orders of magnitude for the experimentally relevant noise exponent. On the other hand, no improvement of the gate fidelity is provided for $\alpha\lesssim1.5$. This critical value $\alpha_c\approx1.5$ is comparatively larger than that for the cases for the singlet-triplet qubits. The filter transfer functions corresponding to the dynamically corrected gates are also computed and compared to those derived from uncorrected pulses. Our results suggest that the dynamically corrected gates are useful measures to suppress the hyperfine noise when operating the exchange-only qubits.

abstract: We study the continuous variable entanglement of a system of two particles under the influence of Earth's gravitational field. We determine a phase-space description of this bipartite system by calculating its Wigner function and verify its entanglement by applying a generalization of the PPT criterion for non-Gaussian states. We also examine the influence of gravity on an idealized entanglement protocol to be shared between stations at different potentials based on the correlation of states of the gravitational quantum well.

abstract: Strongly driving a two-level quantum system with light leads to a ladder of Floquet states separated by the photon energy. Nanoscale quantum devices allow the interplay of confined electrons, phonons, and photons to be studied under strong driving conditions. Here we show that a single electron in a periodically driven DQD functions as a "Floquet gain medium," where population imbalances in the DQD Floquet quasi-energy levels lead to an intricate pattern of gain and loss features in the cavity response. We further measure a large intra-cavity photon number n_c in the absence of a cavity drive field, due to equilibration in the Floquet picture. Our device operates in the absence of a dc current -- one and the same electron is repeatedly driven to the excited state to generate population inversion. These results pave the way to future studies of non-classical light and thermalization of driven quantum systems.
