abstract: The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics is a realistic interpretation of quantum theory. It shares the same ontology of classical mechanics: particles following continuous trajectories in space through time. For this ontological continuity, it seems to be a good candidate for recovering the classical limit of quantum theory. Indeed, in a Bohmian framework, the issue of the classical limit reduces to showing how classical trajectories can emerge from Bohmian ones, under specific classicality assumptions. In this paper, we shall focus on a technical problem that arises from the dynamics of a Bohmian system in bounded regions; and we suggest that a possible solution is supplied by the action of environmental decoherence. However, we shall show that, in order to implement decoherence in a Bohmian framework, a stronger condition is required (disjointness of supports) rather than the usual one (orthogonality of states).

abstract: We have obtained general expressions for the intensity of radiation and tangential force of a small polarizable particle in the process of translational-rotational motion in equilibrium radiation background (thermalized photon gas) of certain temperature at an arbitrary relative orientation of the linear and angular velocity vectors. It is shown that in cold vacuum background the translational velocity of particle is independent of time and the intensity of its spontaneous emission is determined by the angular velocity and imaginary part of the polarizability.

abstract: Physical vacuum is a special superfluid medium populated by enormous amount of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. Its motion is described by the modified Navier-Stokes equation: (a)~the pressure gradient divided by the mass density is replaced by the gradient from the quantum potential; (b)~time-averaged the viscosity vanishes, but its variance is not zero. Vortex structures arising in this medium show infinitely long lifetime owing to zero average viscosity. The nonzero variance is conditioned by exchanging the vortex energy with zero-point vacuum fluctuations. The vortex has a non-zero core where the orbital speed vanishes. The speed reaches a maximal value on the core wall and further it decreases monotonically. The vortex trembles around some average value and possesses by infinite life time. The vortex ball resulting from topological transformation of the vortex ring is considered as a model of a particle with spin. Anomalous magnetic moment of electron is computed.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of an atom with a magnetic quadrupole moment that interacts with an external field subject to a harmonic and a linear confining potentials is investigated. It is shown that the interaction between the magnetic quadrupole moment and an electric field gives rise to an analogue of the Coulomb potential and, by confining this atom to a harmonic and a linear confining potentials, a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of the angular frequency on the quantum numbers of the system is obtained. In particular, it is shown that the possible values of the angular frequency associated with the ground state of the system are determined by a third-degree algebraic equation.

abstract: We present a method to optimize qubit control parameters during error detection which is compatible with large-scale qubit arrays. We demonstrate our method to optimize single or two-qubit gates in parallel on a nine-qubit system. Additionally, we show how parameter drift can be compensated for during computation by inserting a frequency drift and using our method to remove it. We remove both drift on a single qubit and independent drifts on all qubits simultaneously. We believe this method will be useful in keeping error rates low on all physical qubits throughout the course of a computation. Our method is O(1) scalable to systems of arbitrary size, providing a path towards controlling the large numbers of qubits needed for a fault-tolerant quantum computer

abstract: We find a sufficient condition to imprint the single-mode bosonic phase-space nonclassicality onto a bipartite state as modal entanglement and vice versa using an arbitrary beam splitter. Surprisingly, the entanglement produced or detected in this way depends only on the nonclassicality of the marginal input or output states, regardless of their purity and separability. In this way, our result provides sufficient condition for generating entangled states of arbitrary high temperature and arbitrary large number of particles. We also study the evolution of the entanglement within a lossy Mach-Zehnder interferometer and show that unless both modes are totally lost, the entanglement does not diminish.

abstract: Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware. The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than can be solved directly on current hardware.

abstract: This paper presents formulae for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement generated from $N$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs) interconnected in a linear coherent feedback (CFB) chain in the idealized lossless scenario and infinite bandwidth limit. The lossless scenario sets the ultimate EPR entanglement (two-mode squeezing) that can be achieved by this linear chain of NOPAs while the infinite bandwidth limit simplifies the analysis but gives an accurate approximation to the EPR entanglement at low frequencies of interest. Two adjustable phase shifts are placed at the outputs of the system to achieve the best EPR entanglement by selecting appropriate quadratures of the output fields.

abstract: The role of the side channels in the continuous-variable quantum key distribution is studied. It is shown how the information leakage through a side channel from the trusted sender station increases the vulnerability of the protocols to the eavesdropping in the main quantum communication channel. Moreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted receiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum channel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage on the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the side-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light on the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation on the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case of the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side channel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving side, the method of optimal monitoring of the residual noise from the side-channel noise infusion is suggested and shown to be able to completely eliminate the presence of the noisy side channel. We therefore prove that the side-channel effects can be completely removed using feasible operations if the trusted parties access the respective parts of the side channels.

abstract: We construct an amplifier that interpolates between a nondeterministic, immaculate linear amplifier and a deterministic, ideal linear amplifier and beyond to nonideal linear amplifiers. The construction involves cascading an immaculate linear amplifier that has amplitude gain $g_1$ with a (possibly) nonideal linear amplifier that has gain $g_2$. With respect to normally ordered moments, the device has output noise $\mu^2(G^2-1)$ where $G=g_1 g_2$ is the overall amplitude gain and $\mu^2$ is a noise parameter. When $\mu^2\ge1$, our devices realize ideal ($\mu^2=1$) and nonideal ($\mu^2>1$) linear amplifiers. When $0\le\mu^2<1$, these devices work effectively only over a restricted region of phase space and with some subunity success probability $p_{\checkmark}$. We investigate the performance of our $\mu^2$-amplifiers in terms of a gain-corrected probability-fidelity product and the ratio of input to output signal-to-noise ratios corrected for success probability.

abstract: The need for secrecy and security is essential in communication. Secret sharing is a conventional protocol to distribute a secret message to a group of parties, who cannot access it individually but need to cooperate in order to decode it. While several variants of this protocol have been investigated, including realizations using quantum systems, the security of quantum secret sharing schemes against eavesdroppers and dishonest participants remained unproven. Here we establish an unconditional security proof for continuous variable entanglement-based quantum secret sharing schemes, in the limit of asymptotic keys and for an arbitrary number of players, by utilizing ideas from the recently developed one-sided device-independent approach to quantum key distribution. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our scheme, which can be implemented by Gaussian states and homodyne measurements, with no need for ideal single-photon sources or quantum memories. Our results establish quantum secret sharing as a viable and practically relevant primitive for quantum communication technologies.

abstract: The control of quantum correlations in solid state systems by means of material engineering is a broad avenue to be explored, since it makes possible steps toward the limits of quantum mechanics and the design of novel materials with applications on emerging quantum technologies. In this context, this Letter explores the potential of molecular magnets to be prototypes of materials for quantum information technology. More precisely, we engineered a material and from its geometric quantum discord we found significant quantum correlations up to 9540 K (even without entanglement); and, in addition, a pure singlet state occupied up to around 80 K (above liquid nitrogen temperature). These results could only be achieved due to the carboxylate group promoting a metal-to-metal huge magnetic interaction.

abstract: Entanglement depth characterizes the minimal number of particles in a system that are mutually entangled. For symmetric states, we show that there is a dichotomy for entanglement depth: an $N$-particle symmetric state is either fully separable, or fully entangled---the entanglement depth is either $1$ or $N$. This property is even stable under non-symmetric noise. We propose an experimentally accessible method to detect entanglement depth in atomic ensembles based on a bound on the particle number population of Dicke states, and demonstrate that the entanglement depth of some Dicke states, for example the twin Fock state, is very stable even under a large arbitrary noise. Our observation can be applied to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to infer that these systems can be highly entangled with the entanglement depth that is of the order of the system size (i.e. several thousands of atoms).

The structure of the corresponding invariant polynomial ring for the special subclass of states, the so-called mixed X-states, is established. It is shown that for the X-states there is an injective ring homomorphism of the quotient ring of SU(2)xSU(2) invariant polynomials modulo its syzygy ideal and the SO(2)xSO(2)-invariant ring freely generated by five homogeneous polynomials of degrees 1,1,1,2,2.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize a topological insulator with optical-passive elements, and analyze the effects of Kerr-nonlinearities in its topological behavior. In the linear regime, our design gives rise to an optical spectrum with topological features and where the bandwidths and bandgaps are dramatically broadened. The resulting edge modes cover a very wide frequency range. We relate this behavior to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian describing the system's amplitudes is long-range. We also develop a method to analyze the scheme in the presence of a Kerr medium. We assess robustness and stability of the topological features, and predict the presence of chiral squeezed fluctuations at the edges in some parameter regimes.

abstract: Repeated observations inhibit the coherent evolution of quantum states through the quantum Zeno effect. In multi-qubit systems this effect provides new opportunities to control complex quantum states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that repeatedly projecting joint observables of multiple spins creates coherent quantum Zeno subspaces and simultaneously suppresses dephasing caused by the environment. We encode up to two logical qubits in these subspaces and show that the enhancement of the dephasing time with increasing number of projections follows a scaling law that is independent of the number of spins involved. These results provide new insights into the interplay between frequent multi-spin measurements and non-Markovian noise and pave the way for tailoring the dynamics of multi-qubit systems through repeated projections.

abstract: Trapped ions are a promising tool for building a large-scale quantum computer. The number of required radiation fields for the realisation of quantum gates in any proposed ion-based architecture scales with the number of ions inside the quantum computer, posing a major challenge when imagining a device with millions of qubits. Here we present a fundamentally different approach, where this scaling entirely vanishes. The method is based on individually controlled voltages applied to each logic gate location to facilitate the actual gate operation analogous to a traditional transistor architecture within a classical computer processor. We demonstrate the key principle of this approach by implementing a versatile quantum gate method based on long-wavelength radiation where we generate a maximally entangled two-qubit state with fidelity 0.985(12). This quantum gate also constitutes a simple-to-implement tool for quantum metrology, sensing and simulation.

title: The super-indeterminism in orthodox quantum mechanics does not implicate the reality of experimenter free will

abstract: The concept of 'super-indeterminism' captures the notion that the free choice assumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following requirement: an agent's free-choice performance in the selection of measurement settings must not represent an exception to the rule of irreducible quantum indeterminism in the physical universe (i.e, "universal indeterminism"). Any additional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism, i.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter "freedom", "free will", or "free choice", is redundant in relation to the predictive success of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views as redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a negative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a necessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts, for example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will theorem by Conway and Kochen. The concept of super-indeterminism is of great assistance in clarifying the often misunderstood meaning of the concept of "free variables" as used by John Bell. The present work argues that Bell sought an operational, effective free will theorem, one based upon the notion of "determinism without predetermination", i.e., one wherein "free variables" represent universally uncomputable variables. In conclusion, the standard interpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer in order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of whether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to free-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents in quantum mechanics.

abstract: Recently the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, especially methods of quantum probability theory, started to be widely used in a variety of applications outside of physics, e.g., cognition and psychology as well as economy and finances. To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical models, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak about, e.g., "quantum cognition"). These novel applications generate a number of foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science - foundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was mainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the probabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive psychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical probability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by the formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another question attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications, there are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover completely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability models have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in foundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check Sorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note we present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of this test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum probability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional quantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting experimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition.

abstract: We have proposed a unified framework towards the dynamics of optical and electron vortex beams from the perspective of geometric phase and the associated Hall effects. The unification is attributed to the notion that the spin degrees of freedom of a relativistic particle, either massive or massless, is associated with a vortex line. %The formulation in cylindrical coordinates leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum(OAM). Based on cylindrical corodinate formulation, which leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum (OAM), it can be shown that when electron vortex beams (EVBs) move in an external electric field paraxial beams give rise to OAM Hall effect and non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices initiate spin Hall effect in free space as well as in an external field. A similar analysis reveals that the paraxial optical vortex beams(OVBs) in an inhomogeneous medium induce OAM Hall effect whereas non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices drive the spin Hall effect. Moreover, both OVBs and EVBs with tilted vortices give rise to OAM states with arbitrary fractional value.

abstract: Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers [1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast to the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to be performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near zero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have identified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic chains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of Majoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire segment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced superconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy splitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred nanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied, as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor of about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices longer than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs through a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum, yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling of topological protection with end-mode separation.

abstract: The spectrum of 1-state and 2-states per line quantum buses is used to determine the effective $V_{ab}(N)$ electronic coupling between emitter and receiver states through the bus as a function of the number $N$ of parallel lines in the bus. When the calculation of $V_{ab}(N)$ is spectrally difficult, an Heisenberg-Rabi time dependent quantum exchange process can be triggered through the bus by preparing a specific initial non-stationanry state and identifying a target state to capture the effective oscillation frequency $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ between those. For $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ (for $V_{ab}(N)$), two different regimes are observed as a function of $N$: linear and $\sqrt{N}$ more moderate increases. This state preparation was remplaced by electronically coupling the quantum bus to two semi-infinite electrodes. The native quantum transduction process at work in this tunnel junction is not faithfully following the $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ variations with $N$. Due to normalisation to unity of the electronic transparency of the quantum bus and to the low pass filter character of the transduction, large $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ cannot be followed by the tunnel junction. At low coupling and when $N$ is small enough not to compensate the small through line coupling, an $N^2$ power law is preserved for $\Omega_{ab}(N)$. The limitations of the quantum transduction in a tunnel junction is pointing how the broadly used concept of electrical contact between a metallic nanopad and a molecular wire can be better described as a quantum transduction process.

abstract: The past few decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to manipulate and coherently control matter-waves. Although the duality between particles and waves has been well tested since de Broglie introduced the matter-wave analog of the optical wavelength in 1924, manipulating atoms with a level of coherence that enables one to use these properties for precision measurements has only become possible with our ability to produce atomic samples exhibiting temperatures of only a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. Since the initial experiments a few decades ago, the field of atom optics has developed in many ways, with both fundamental and applied significance. The exquisite control of matter waves offers the prospect of a new generation of force sensors exhibiting unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy, for applications from navigation and geophysics to tests of general relativity. Thanks to the latest developments in this field, the first commercial products using this quantum technology are now available. In the future, our ability to create large coherent ensembles of atoms will allow us an even more precise control of the matter-wave and the ability to create highly entangled states for non-classical atom interferometry.

abstract: Sound waves in and dielectric liquid, that consists of subsystems of valency electrons with effective mass and ions which interact through the long-wave potential electric field are considered, on analogies with and metallic liquid, but with the requirement, that electric current is absent. It is shown that usual description of sound wave in an ideal liquid as wave of mass density and mass velocity follows from the offered consideration. It is also shown that sound waves with other side can be considered as waves of potential electric field in an environment. Introduction of phonons in both cases is considered.
