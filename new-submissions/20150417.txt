abstract: A common assumption in analyses of error thresholds and quantum computing in general is that one applies fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) after every gate. This, however, is known not to always be optimal if the FTQEC procedure itself can introduce errors. We investigate the effect of varying the number of logical gates between FTQEC operations, and in particular the case where failure of a postselection condition in FTQEC may cause FTQEC to be skipped with high probability. By using a simplified model of errors induced in FTQEC, we derive an expression for the logical error rate as a function of error-correction frequency, and show that in this model the optimal frequency is relatively insensitive to postselection failure probability for a large range of such probabilities. We compare the model to data derived from Monte Carlo simulation for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code.

abstract: Invisible cloaks provide a way to hide an object under the detection of waves. A perfect cloak guides the incident waves through the cloaking shell without any distortion. In most cases, some important quantum degrees of freedom, e.g. electron spin or photon polarization, are not taken into account when designing a cloak. Here, we propose to use the temporal steering inequality of these degrees of freedom to detect the existence of an invisible cloak.

abstract: The envelope theory, also known as the auxiliary field method, is a simple technique to compute approximate solutions of Hamiltonians for $N$ identical particles in $D$ dimensions. The quality of the approximate eigenvalues can be improved by adding a free parameter in the characteristic global quantum number of the solutions. A method is proposed to determine the value of this parameter by comparing the eigenvalues computed with the envelope theory to the corresponding ones computed with a $N$-body generalization of the dominantly orbital state method. The accuracy of the procedure is tested with several systems.

abstract: We describe a criterion for the detection of entanglement between two multi-boson systems. The criterion is based on calculating correlations of Gell-Mann matrices with a fixed boson number on each subsystem. This applies naturally to systems such as two entangled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. We apply our criterion to several experimentally motivated examples, such as an $ S^z S^z $ entangled BECs, ac Stark shift induced two-mode squeezed BECs, and photons under parametric down conversion. We find that entanglement can be detected for all parameter regions for the most general criterion. Alternative criteria based on a similar formalism are also discussed together with their merits.

abstract: We consider one particle confined to a deformed one-dimensional wire. The quantum mechanical equivalent of the classical problem is not uniquely defined. We describe several possible hamiltonians and corresponding solutions for a finite wire with fixed endpoints and non-vanishing curvature. We compute and compare the disparate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from different quantization prescriptions. The JWKB approximation without potential leads precisely to the square well spectrum and the coordinate dependent stretched or compressed box related eigenfunctions. The geometric potential arising from an adiabatic expansion in terms of curvature is at best only valid for very small curvature.

abstract: In recent years, a close connection between the description of open quantum systems, the input-output formalism of quantum optics, and continuous matrix product states in quantum field theory has been established. So far, however, this connection has not been extended to the condensed-matter context. In this work, we substantially develop further and apply a machinery of continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to perform tomography of transport experiments. We first present an extension of the tomographic possibilities of cMPS by showing that reconstruction schemes do not need to be based on low-order correlation functions only, but also on low-order counting probabilities. We show that fermionic quantum transport settings can be formulated within the cMPS framework. This allows us to present a reconstruction scheme based on the measurement of low-order correlation functions that provides access to quantities that are not directly measurable with present technology. Emblematic examples are high-order correlations functions and waiting times distributions (WTD). The latter are of particular interest since they offer insights into short-time scale physics. We demonstrate the functioning of the method with actual data, opening up the way to accessing WTD within the quantum regime.

abstract: Information-theoretic definitions for noise and disturbance in quantum measurements were given in Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 050401 (2014) and a state-independent noise-disturbance uncertainty relation was obtained. Here, we derive a tight noise-disturbance uncertainty relation for complementary qubit observables and carry out an experimental test. Successive projective measurements on the neutron's spin-1/2system, together with a correction procedure which reduces the disturbance, are performed. Our experimental results saturate the tight noise-disturbance uncertainty relation for qubits when an optimal correction procedure is applied.

abstract: We focus on a family of quantum coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the analysis for the quantum case. We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming models on the optimization side. Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum and classical protocols, we show that only "classical" protocols can saturate Kitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of Alice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from attaining the optimal level of security.

abstract: A long-standing problem on the classical capacity of bosonic Gaussian channels has recently been resolved by proving the minimum output entropy conjecture. It is also known that the ultimate capacity quantified by the Holevo bound can be achieved asymptotically by using an infinite number of channels. However, it is less understood to what extent the communication capacity can be reached if one uses a finite number of channels, which is a topic of practical importance. In this paper, we study the capacity of Gaussian communication, i.e. employing Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements to encode and decode information under a single-channel use. We prove that the optimal capacity of single-channel Gaussian communication is achieved by one of two well-known protocols, i.e., coherent-state communication or squeezed-state communication, depending on the energy (number of photons) as well as the characteristics of the channel. Our result suggests that the coherent-state scheme known to achieve the ultimate information-theoretic capacity is not a practically optimal scheme for the case of using a finite number of channels. We find that overall the squeezed-state communication is optimal in a small photon-number regime whereas the coherent-state communication performs better in a large photon-number regime.

Starting from a ground state condensate, we investigate how the measurement back action leads to squeezing and entanglement of the quantized density oscillations. In particular, we show that properly timed, stroboscopic imaging and feedback can be used to selectively address specific eigenmodes and avoid excitation of non-targeted modes of the system.

abstract: High precision macroscopic quantum control in interacting light-matter systems remains a signi?cant goal toward novel information processing and ultra-precise metrology. We show that the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a paradigmatic light-matter system (Dicke model) reveals two successive stages of enhanced quantum correlations beyond the traditional schemes of near-adiabatic and sudden quenches. The fi?rst stage features magni?cation of matter-only and light-only entanglement and squeezing due to e?ective non linear self-interactions. The second stage results from a highly entangled light-matter state, with enhanced superradiance and signatures of chaotic and highly quantum states. We show that these new e?ects scale up consistently with matter system size, and are reliable even in dissipative environments.

abstract: The non-relativistic hydrogen atom enjoys an accidental $SO(4)$ symmetry, that enlarges the rotational $SO(3)$ symmetry, by extending the angular momentum algebra with the Runge-Lenz vector. In the relativistic hydrogen atom the accidental symmetry is partially lifted. Due to the Johnson-Lippmann operator, which commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian, some degeneracy remains. When the non-relativistic hydrogen atom is put in a spherical cavity of radius $R$ with perfectly reflecting Robin boundary conditions, characterized by a self-adjoint extension parameter $\gamma$, in general the accidental $SO(4)$ symmetry is lifted. However, for $R = (l+1)(l+2) a$ (where $a$ is the Bohr radius and $l$ is the orbital angular momentum) some degeneracy remains when $\gamma = \infty$ or $\gamma = \frac{2}{R}$. In the relativistic case, we consider the most general spherically and parity invariant boundary condition, which is characterized by a self-adjoint extension parameter. In this case, the remnant accidental symmetry is always lifted in a finite volume. We also investigate the accidental symmetry in the context of the Pauli equation, which sheds light on the proper non-relativistic treatment including spin. In that case, again some degeneracy remains for specific values of $R$ and $\gamma$.

abstract: Optics and interferometry with matter waves is the art of coherently manipulating the translational motion of particles like neutrons, atoms and molecules. Coherent atom optics is an extension of techniques that were developed for manipulating \emph{internal} quantum states. Applying these ideas to translational motion required the development of techniques to localize atoms and transfer population coherently between distant localities. In this view position and momentum are (continuouse) quantum mechanical degree of freedom analogous to discrete internal quantum states. In our contribution we start with an introduction into matter-wave optics in section 1, discuss coherent atom optics and atom interferometry techniques for molecular beams in section 2 and for trapped atoms in section 3. In section 4 we then describe tools and experiments that allow us to probe the evolution of quantum states of many-body systems by atom interference.

abstract: Here we demonstrate quantum interference of photons on a Silicon chip produced from a single ring resonator photon source. The source is seamlessly integrated with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which path entangles degenerate bi-photons produced via spontaneous four wave mixing in the Silicon ring resonator. The resulting bi-photon N00N state is controlled by varying the relative phase of the integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer, resulting in high two-photon interference visibilities of V~96%. Furthermore, we show that the interference can be produced using pump wavelengths tuned to all of the ring resonances accessible with our tunable lasers (C+L band). This work is a key demonstration towards the simplified integration of multiple photon sources and quantum circuits together on a monolithic chip, in turn, enabling quantum information chips with much greater complexity and functionality.

abstract: In earlier papers we showed unpredictability beyond quantum uncertainty in atomic clocks, ensuing from a proven gap between given evidence and explanations of that evidence. Here we reconceive a clock, not as an isolated entity, but as enmeshed in a self-adjusting communications network adapted to one or another particular investigation, in contact with an unpredictable environment. From the practical uses of clocks, we abstract a clock enlivened with the computational capacity of a Turing machine, modified to transmit and to receive numerical communications. Such "live clocks" phase the steps of their computations to mesh with the arrival of transmitted numbers. We lift this phasing, known in digital communications, to a principle of \emph{logical synchronization}, distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in special relativity. Logical synchronization elevates digital communication to a topic in physics, including applications to biology. One explores how feedback loops in clocking affect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of unpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of investigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live clocks extends information theory by expressing the need to actively maintain communications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them. We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of coordinates in a spacetime. A network serves as an organizing principle, even when the concept of the rigid body that anchors a special-relativistic coordinate system is inapplicable, as is the case, for example, in a generic curved spacetime.

abstract: Exact synthesis is a tool used in algorithms for approximating an arbitrary qubit unitary with a sequence of quantum gates from some finite set. These approximation algorithms find asymptotically optimal approximations in probabilistic polynomial time, in some cases even finding the optimal solution in probabilistic polynomial time given access to an oracle for factoring integers. In this paper, we present a common mathematical structure underlying all results related to the exact synthesis of qubit unitaries known to date, including Clifford+T, Clifford-cyclotomic and V-basis gate sets, as well as gates sets induced by the braiding of Fibonacci anyons in topological quantum computing. The framework presented here also provides a means to answer questions related to the exact synthesis of unitaries for wide classes of other gate sets, such as Clifford+T+V and SU(2) level k anyons.

abstract: Physical implementations of qubits can be extremely sensitive to environmental coupling, which can result in decoherence. While efforts are made for protection, coupling to the environment is necessary to measure and manipulate the state of the qubit. As such, the goal of having long qubit energy relaxation times is in competition with that of achieving high-fidelity qubit control and measurement. Here we propose a method that integrates filtering techniques for preserving superconducting qubit lifetimes together with the dispersive coupling of the qubit to a microwave resonator for control and measurement. The result is a compact circuit that protects qubits from spontaneous loss to the environment, while also retaining the ability to perform fast, high-fidelity readout. Importantly, we show the device operates in a regime that is attainable with current experimental parameters and provide a specific example for superconducting qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: We present a new type of transmon split-junction qubit which can be tuned by Meissner screening currents in the adjacent superconducting film electrodes. The best detected relaxation time was of the order of 50 {\mu}s and the dephasing time about 70 {\mu}s. The achieved period of oscillation with magnetic field was much smaller than in usual SQUID-based transmon qubits, thus a strong effective field amplification has been realized. This Meissner qubit allows an efficient coupling to superconducting vortices. We present a quantitative analysis of the radiation-free energy relaxation in qubits coupled to Abrikosov vortices. The observation of coherent quantum oscillations provides strong evidence that vortices can exist in coherent quantum superpositions of different position states. According to our suggested model, the wave function collapse is defined by Caldeira-Leggett dissipation associated with viscous motion of the vortex cores.

abstract: Exotic topologically protected zero modes with parafermionic statistics (also called fractionalized Majorana modes) have been proposed to emerge in devices fabricated from a fractional quantum Hall system and a superconductor. The fractionalized statistics of these modes takes them an important step beyond the simplest non-Abelian anyons, Majorana fermions. Building on recent advances towards the realization of fractional quantum Hall states of bosonic ultracold atoms, we propose a realization of parafermions in a system consisting of Bose-Einstein-condensate trenches within a bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that parafermionic zero modes emerge at the endpoints of the trenches and give rise to a topologically protected degeneracy. We also discuss methods for preparing and detecting these modes.

The model has an exactly solvable line, on varying the density of fermions, described by a topologically non-trivial ground state wave-function. Away from the exactly solvable line we study the system by means of the numerical density matrix renormalization group. We characterize its topological properties, establish the presence of a gap in its single particle spectrum while the Hamiltonian is gapless, and compute the correlations between the edge modes as well as the superfluid correlations. The topological phase covers a sizeable portion of the phase diagram, the solvable line being one of its boundaries.

A compelling property of this model is the exact solvability for its ground states and low energy excitations. We demonstrate the appearance of topologically protected edge states and derive their braiding properties on a microscopic level. We find the non-abelian statistics of Ising anyons, which can be interpreted as Majorana-like edge states.

abstract: We study a finite basic structure that possibly underlies the observed elementary quantum fields with gauge and gravitational interactions. Realistic wave functions of locally interacting quantum fields emerge naturally as fitting functions for the generic distribution of many quantifiable properties of arbitrary static objects. We prove that in any quantum theory with the superposition principle, evolution of a current state of fields unavoidably continues along alternate routes with every conceivable Hamiltonian for the fields. This applies to the emergent quantum fields too. Yet the Hamiltonian is unambiguous for isolated emergent systems with sufficient local symmetry. The other emergent systems, without specific physical laws, cannot be inhabitable. The acceptable systems are eternally inflating universes with reheated regions. We see how eternal inflation perpetually creates new short-scale physical degrees of freedom and why they are initially in the ground state. In the emergent quantum worlds probabilities follow from the first principles. The Born rule is not universal but there are reasons to expect it in a typical world. The emergent quantum evolution is necessarily Everettian (many-world). However, for a finite underlying structure the Everett branches with norm below a positive threshold cease to exist. Hence some experiments that could be motivated by taking the Everett view too literally will be fatal for the participants.
