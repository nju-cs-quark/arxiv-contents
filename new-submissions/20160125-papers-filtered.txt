abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of two qubits interacting through a polariton bus with an ultrastrong coupled qubit-cavity system. By tuning the energy gap of the qubits maintaining the polariton within the vacuum, we demonstrate an improvement of two-qubit gate operation time and excitations transfer as the ultrastrong coupling strength is increased. Our proposal might pave the way for multipurpose parity protected quantum information tasks, and for the enhancement of excitations transfer in disordered systems.
