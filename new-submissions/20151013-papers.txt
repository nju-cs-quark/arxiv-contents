abstract: Physical modeling closes the gap between perception in terms of measurements and abstraction in terms of theoretical models. Physical modeling is a major objective in physics and is generally regarded as a creative process. How good are computers at solving this task? This question is both of philosophical and practical interest because a positive answer would allow an artificial intelligence to understand the physical world. Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental physical theory and there is a deep belief that nature follows the rules of quantum mechanics. Hence, we raise the question whether computers are able to learn optimal quantum models from measured data. Here we show that in the absence of physical heuristics, the inference of optimal quantum models cannot be computed efficiently (unless P = NP). This result illuminates rigorous limits to the extent to which computers can be used to further our understanding of nature.

abstract: We propose a method to measure the hyperfine vectors between a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and an environment of interacting nuclear spins. Our protocol enables the generation of tunable electron-nuclear coupling Hamiltonians while suppressing unwanted inter-nuclear interactions. In this manner, each nucleus can be addressed and controlled individually thereby permitting the reconstruction of the individual hyperfine vectors. With this ability the 3D-structure of spin ensembles and spins in bio-molecules can be identified without the necessity of varying the direction of applied magnetic fields. We demonstrate examples including the complete identification of an interacting spin cluster in diamond and 3D imaging of all the nuclear spins in a bio-molecule of L-malic acid.

abstract: We propose a general and computable measure of quantum macroscopicity for arbitrary spin states by quantifying interference fringes in phase space. It effectively discriminates genuine macroscopic quantum effects from mere accumulations of microscopic quantum effects in large systems. The measure is applied to several examples and it is found to be consistent with some previous proposals. In particular, we investigate many-body spin systems undergoing the quantum phase transition (QPT) and the QPT turns out to be a genuine macroscopic quantum phenomenon. Our result suggests that a macroscopic quantum superposition of an extremely large size may appear during the QPT.

abstract: A two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized by alternating a two-state DTQW in one spatial dimension followed by an evolution in the other dimension. This was shown to reproduce a probability distribution for a certain configuration of a four-state DTQW on a two-dimensional lattice. In this work we present a three-state alternate DTQW with a parameterized coin-flip operator and show that it can produce localization that is also observed for a certain other configuration of the four-state DTQW and non-reproducible using the two-state alternate DTQW. We will present two limit theorems for the three-state alternate DTQW. One of the limit theorems describes a long-time limit of a return probability, and the other presents a convergence in distribution for the position of the walker on a rescaled space by time. We will also outline the relevance of these walks in physical systems.

abstract: Recently we pointed out the so-called Local Time Scheme [J. Jekni\' c-Dugi\'c et al, (2014) Ref. [1]] as a novel approach to quantum foundations that solves the preferred pointer-basis problem. In this paper we introduce and analyze in depth a rather non-standard dynamical map that is imposed by the scheme. On one hand, the map does not allow for introducing a properly defined generator of the evolution nor does it represent a quantum channel. On the other hand, the map is linear, positive, trace preserving and unital as well as completely positive, but is not divisible and therefore non-Markovian. Nevertheless, we provide quantitative criteria for dynamical emergence of time-coarse-grained Markovianity, for exact dynamics of an open system, as well as for operationally-defined approximation of a closed or open many-particle system. A closed system never reaches a steady state, while an open system may reach a unique steady state given by the L\" uders-von Neumann formula; where the smaller the open system, the faster a steady state is attained. These generic findings extend the standard open quantum systems theory and substantially tackle certain cosmological issues.

abstract: Gaussian state decoherence aspects due to interacting magnetic-like and gravitational fields are quantified through the quantum fidelity and Shannon entropy in the scope of the phase-space representation of elementary quantum systems. For Gaussian Wigner functions describing harmonic oscillator states, an interacting external field destroys the quantum fidelity and introduces a quantum beating behavior. Likewise, it introduces harmonic profiles for free particle systems. Some aspects of quantum decoherence for the quantum harmonic oscillator and for the free particle limit are also quantified through the Shannon entropy. For the gravitational quantum well, the effect of a magnetic-like field on the quantum fidelity is suppressed by the linear term of the gravitational potential. To conclude, one identifies a fine formal connection of the quantum decoherence aspects discussed here with the noncommutative quantum mechanics.

abstract: Recently, in the letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 114}, 170502 (2015)], Tavakoli et al. derived interesting results by studying classical and quantum random access codes (RACs) in which the parties communicate higher-dimensional systems. They construct quantum RACs with a bigger advantage over classical RACs compared to previously considered RACs with binary alphabet. However, these results crucially hinge upon an unproven assertion that the classical strategy "majority-encoding-identity-decoding" leads to the maximum average success probability achievable for classical RACs; in this article we provide a proof of this intuition. We characterize all optimal classical RACs and show that indeed "majority-encoding-identity-decoding" is one among the several optimal strategies. Along with strengthening the results in Tavakoli et al., our result provides a firm basis for future research on this topic.

abstract: Quantum walks behave differently from what we expect and their probability distributions have unique structures. They have localization, singularities, a gap, and so on. Those features have been discovered from the view point of mathematics and reported as limit theorems. In this paper we focus on a time-dependent three-state quantum walk on the line and demonstrate a limit distribution. Three coin states at each position are iteratively updated by a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. As the result of the evolution, we end up to observe both localization and a gap in the limit distribution.

abstract: Optomechanical cooling is a prerequisite for many exotic applications promised by modern quantum technology and it is crucial to achieve it in short times, in order to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment. We formulate cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum-time optimal control problem on anti-de Sitter space of appropriate dimension and use the Legendre pseudospectral optimization method to find the minimum time and the corresponding optimal control, for various values of the maximum coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. The present framework can also be applied to create optomechanical entanglement in minimum time and to improve the efficiency of an optomechanical quantum heat engine.

abstract: We study one- and two-photon scattering from a qubit embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of modal dispersion. We use a resolvent based analysis and utilize techniques borrowed from the Lee model studies. Modal dispersion leads to atom-photon bound states which necessitate the use of multichannel scattering theory. We present multichannel scattering matrix elements in terms of the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Through the use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we derive an infinite series of Feynman diagrams that represent the solution to the integral equation. We use the Feynman diagrams as vertex correction terms to come up with closed form formulas that successfully predict the trapping rate of a photon in the atom-photon bound state. We verify our formalism through Krylov-subspace based numerical studies. Our results provide the tools to calculate the complex correlations between scattered photons in a dispersive environment.

abstract: We maintain that the wavefunction is best understood as describing ensembles rather than individual particles. For a single particle, we propose an ontology underwritten by the Heisenberg representation. It consists of deterministic operators which may have nonlocal dynamics. Indeed, nonlocal equations of motion, arising from the transition from Poisson brackets to commutator algebra, are a salient feature of the proposed ontology. Using this feature, we show how interference phenomena can be understood without having to conceive of the quantum state as wave-like. Nonlocal information is provided by a modular momentum operator. By augmenting the individual particle description with a final boundary condition and employing weak measurements, we show how both interference and which-path can be deduced for the same system. The resulting description is based on a time-symmetric Heisenberg representation, which we believe to capture the essence of quantum mechanics, particularly its nonlocal nature, better than any wavefunction based ontology.

We present two novel gedanken experiments, based on the quantum Zeno effect, suggesting a dynamical process thorough which this curious phenomenon occurs. We analyze, for the first time, a quantum current consisting of spin without mass. Thus, the quantum variables of pre- and post-selected particles are understood to be involved in various interactions, even in the absence of their owners. This current is shown to provide a local explanation for seemingly nonlocal interactions.

abstract: In a recent detailed research program we proposed to study the complex physics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a discrete-time quantum walk. The main novel ingredient proposed for this study is the use of non-linear parametric amplifiers in the network which could in turn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body effects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker. In this paper, and as a first step towards the implementation of our scheme, we analize the interplay between quantum walk lattice topology and spatial correlations of bi-photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We also describe different detection methods suitable for our proposed experimental scheme.

abstract: We address the interaction of single- and two-qubit systems with external fluctuating transverse fields and analyze in details the dynamical decoherence induced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, e.g. random telegraph noise (RTN). Upon exploiting the exact RTN solution of the time-dependent Von Neumann equation, we analyze in details the behavior of quantum correlations and prove the non-Markovianity of the dynamical map in the full parameter range, i.e. for either fast or slow noise. The dynamics induced by Gaussian noise is studied numerically and compared to the RTN solution, showing the existence of (state dependent) regions of the parameter space where the two noises lead to very similar dynamics. Our results shows that while the effects of non-Gaussian noise cannot be trivially mapped to that of Gaussian noise and viceversa, i.e. the spectrum alone is not enough to summarize the noise effects, the dynamics under the effect of one kind of noise may be simulated with high fidelity by the other one.

This enables the investigation of previously inaccessible long-time dynamics, such as those ensuing from low temperature regimes with arbitrary, possibly highly structured, spectral densities. We briefly introduce both methods, followed by a benchmark to prove viability and combination synergies. Subsequently we illustrate the capabilities of this approach at the hand of specific examples and conclude our analysis by highlighting possible further applications of our method.

abstract: We demonstrate a monolithically integrable heralded photon source in a femtosecond laser direct written glass waveguide. The generation of photon pairs with a wide wavelength separation requires a concomitant large birefringence in the normal dispersion regime. Here, by incorporation of side-stress tracks, we produce a waveguide with a birefringence of $1.64\times~10^{-4}$ and propagation loss as low as 0.21 dB/cm near 980~nm. We measure photon pairs with 300~nm wavelength separation at an internal generation rate exceeding $5.05\times10^6$/s. The second order correlations indicate that the generated photon pairs are in a strongly non-classical regime.

abstract: The Loschmidt echo is a measure of quantum irreversibility and is determined by the fidelity amplitude of an imperfect time-reversal protocol. Fidelity amplitude plays an important role both in the foundations of quantum mechanics and its applications, such as time-resolved electronic spectroscopy. We derive an exact path integral formula for the fidelity amplitude and use it to obtain a series of increasingly accurate semiclassical approximations by truncating an exact expansion of the path integral exponent. While the zeroth-order expansion results in a remarkably simple, yet nontrivial approximation for the fidelity amplitude, the first-order expansion yields an alternative derivation of the so-called "dephasing representation", circumventing the use of semiclassical propagator as in the original derivation. We also obtain approximate expression for fidelity based on the second-order expansion, which resolves several shortcomings of the dephasing representation. The rigorous derivation from the path integral permits the identification of sufficient conditions under which various approximations obtained become exact.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Bell measurement scheme proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 113603 (2015)] based on a logical qubit using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement of photons. The success probability of the proposed Bell measurement can be made arbitrarily high using only linear optics as the number of photons in a logical qubit increases. We compare our scheme with all the other proposals, using single-photon qubits, coherent-state qubits or hybrid qubits, suggested to enhance the efficiency of the Bell measurement. As a remarkable advantage, our scheme requires only photon on-off measurements, while photon number resolving detectors are necessary for all the other proposals. We find that the scheme based on coherent-state qubits shows the best performance with respect to the attained success probability in terms of the average number of photons used in the process, while our scheme outperforms the schemes using single-photon qubits. We finally show that efficient quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computation can be realized using our approach.

abstract: Quantum communication protocols such as quantum cloud computing, digital signatures, coin-tossing, secret-sharing, and key distribution, using similar optical technologies, claim to provide unconditional security guaranteed by quantum mechanics. Among these protocols, the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is most scrutinized and believed to be guaranteed as long as implemented devices are properly characterized and existing implementation loopholes are identified and patched. Here we show that this assumption is not true. We experimentally demonstrate a class of attacks based on laser damage, capable of creating new security loopholes on-demand. We perform it on two different implementations of QKD and coin-tossing protocols, and create new information leakage side-channels. Our results show that quantum communication protocols cannot guarantee security alone, but will always have to be supported by additional technical countermeasures against laser damage.

The method is based on measurement of integrated probability of detection of atoms - probes in the top working state from atoms flying via the cavity. Connection of random variables and is found, when is a qudrature phase. Connection of the tomogram and the tomogram is found. The protocol prescribes the rule of choice of problem parameters, such as interaction time, and the number of atoms in series . The method contains a single fitting parameter that is selected in the process of numerical simulation of the quadrature distribution in a coherent state. Quality selection is determined by the Kolmogorov test. The result of the calculation protocol is a convolution with the instrumental function of the method. The parameters of the instrumental function are shown. Numerical simulations performed for typical numerical values of parameters of the experimental setup, shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

abstract: We derive a family of stochastic master equations describing homodyne measurement of multi-qubit diagonal observables in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Our approach replaces the polaron-like transformation of previous work, which required a lengthy calculation for the physically interesting case of three qubits and two resonator modes. The technique introduced here makes this calculation straightforward and manifestly correct. Using this technique, we are able to show that registers larger than one qubit evolve under a non-Markovian master equation. We perform numerical simulations of the three-qubit, two-mode case from previous work, obtaining an average post-measurement state fidelity near 94%.

abstract: The construction of physically relevant low dimensional state models, and the design of appropriate measurements are key issues in tackling quantum state tomography for large dimensional systems. We consider the statistical problem of estimating low rank states in the set-up of multiple ions tomography, and investigate how the estimation error behaves with a reduction in the number of measurement settings, compared with the standard ion tomography setup. We present extensive simulation results showing that the error is robust with respect to the choice of states of a given rank, the random selection of settings, and that the number of settings can be significantly reduced with only a negligible increase in error. We present an argument to explain these findings based on a concentration inequality for the Fisher information matrix. In the more general setup of random basis measurements we use this argument to show that for certain rank $r$ states it suffices to measure in $O(r\log d)$ bases to achieve the average Fisher information over all bases. We present numerical evidence supporting a conjecture on a lower bound for the Fisher information which, if true, would imply a similar behaviour in the case of Pauli bases. The relation to similar problems in compressed sensing is also discussed.

abstract: Entanglement is at the heart of most quantum information tasks, and therefore considerable effort has been made to find methods of deciding the entanglement content of a given bipartite quantum state. Here, we prove a fundamental limitation to deciding if an unknown state is entangled or not: we show that any quantum measurement which can answer this question necessarily gives enough information to identify the state completely. Therefore, only prior information regarding the state can make entanglement detection less expensive than full state tomography in terms of the demanded quantum resources. We also extend our treatment to other classes of correlated states by considering the problem of deciding if a state is NPT, discordant, or fully classically correlated. Remarkably, only the question related to quantum discord can be answered without resorting to full state tomography.

abstract: The concept of complementarity in combination with a non-Boolean calculus of propositions refers to a pivotal feature of quantum systems which has long been regarded as a key to their distinction from classical systems. But a non-Boolean logic of complementary features may also apply to classical systems, if their states and observables are defined by partitions of a classical state space. If these partitions do not satisfy certain stability criteria, complementary observables and non-Boolean propositional lattices may be the consequence. This is especially the case for non-generating partitions of nonlinear dynamical systems. We show how this can be understood in more detail and indicate some challenging consequences for systems outside quantum physics, including mental processes.

abstract: We report the spectroscopic observation of a resonant transition that breaks a selection rule in the quantum Rabi model, implemented using an LC resonator and a superconducting qubit. The eigenstates of the system consist of a superposition of bare qubit-oscillator states with a relative sign. In the limit of low qubit-oscillator coupling strength, the matrix element between excited eigenstates of different sign is very small in presence of an oscillator drive, establishing a sign-preserving selection rule. Here, our qubit-resonator system operates in the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the coupling strength is 10% of the resonator frequency, allowing sign-changing transitions to be activated and, therefore, detected. This work shows that sign-changing transitions are an unambiguous, distinctive signature of systems operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime of the quantum Rabi model. These results pave the way to further studies of sign-preserving selection rules in multiqubit and multiphoton models.

abstract: Unpredictability, or randomness, of the outcomes of measurements made on an entangled state can be certified provided that the statistics violate a Bell inequality. In the standard Bell scenario where each party performs a single measurement on its share of the system, only a finite amount of at most $4 log_2 d$ bits of randomness can be certified from a pair of qudits. In our work, it is shown that this fundamental limitation can be overcome using sequences of (non-projective) measurements on the same system. More precisely, we prove that one can certify any amount of random bits from a pair of qubits in a pure state as resource, even if it is arbitrarily weakly entangled. In addition, this certification is achieved by near-maximal violation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement in the sequence.

In this paper, we argue that beginning from only the fixed point wavefunction (FPW) of a nonchiral topological phase and by locally deforming it, all possible edge theories can be extracted from its entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). We illustrate our claim by deforming the FPW of the Wen-plaquette model, the quantum double of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that the possible EHs of the deformed FPWs reflect the known possible types of edge theories, which are generically gapped, but gapless if translationally symmetry is preserved. We stress that our results do not require an underlying Hamiltonian -- thus, this lends support to the notion that a topological phase is indeed characterized by only a set of quantum states and can be studied through its FPWs.

title: The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for fermions: Implementation, exactness and application to few-fermion tunneling to open space

abstract: We report on an implementation of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method (MCTDH) for spin-polarized fermions (MCTDHF). Our approach is based on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and efficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations of motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive implementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB, the present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark the accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a time-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically trapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We demonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion Schr\"odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can hence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with time-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the problem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling through a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model proposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic particles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from sequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic momenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped subsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the different chemical potentials into kinetic energy.

abstract: The striking efficiency of energy transfer in natural photosynthetic systems and the recent evidence of long-lived quantum coherence in biological light harvesting complexes has triggered much excitement, due to the evocative possibility that these systems - essential to practically all life on earth -- use quantum mechanical effects to achieve optimal functionality. A large body of theoretical work has addressed the role of local environments in determining the transport properties of excitons in photosynthetic networks and the survival of quantum coherence in a classical environment. Nonetheless, understanding the connection between quantum coherence, exciton network geometry and energy transfer efficiency remains a challenge. Here we address this connection from the perspective of heat transfer within the exciton network. Using a non-equilibrium open quantum system approach and focusing on the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that finite local dephasing can be beneficial to the overall power output. The mechanism for this enhancement of power output is identified as a gentle balance between quantum and classical contributions to the local heat flow, such that the total heat flow is directed along the shortest paths and dissipation is minimized. Strongly related to the spatial network structure of the exciton transfer complex, this mechanism elucidates how energy flows in photosyntetic excitonic complexes.

abstract: Most quantum computing architectures can be realized as two-dimensional lattices of qubits that interact with each other. We take transmon qubits and transmission line resonators as promising candidates for qubits and couplers; we use them as basic building elements of a quantum code. We then propose a simple framework to determine the optimal experimental layout to realize quantum codes. We show that this engineering optimization problem can be reduced to the solution of standard binary linear programs. While solving such programs is a NP-hard problem, we propose a way to find scalable optimal architectures that require solving the linear program for a restricted number of qubits and couplers. We apply our methods to two celebrated quantum codes, namely the surface code and the Fibonacci code.

abstract: We present an impedance engineered Josephson parametric amplifier capable of providing bandwidth beyond the traditional gain-bandwidth product. We achieve this by introducing a positive linear slope in the imaginary component of the input impedance seen by the Josephson oscillator using a $\lambda/2$ transformer. Our theoretical model predicts an extremely flat gain profile with a bandwidth enhancement proportional to the square root of amplitude gain. We experimentally demonstrate a nearly flat 20 dB gain over a 640 MHz band, along with a mean 1-dB compression point of -110 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. The results are in good agreement with our theoretical model.

abstract: Forbidden transitions between energy levels typically involve violation of selection rules imposed by symmetry and/or conservation laws. A nanomagnet tunneling between up and down states violates angular momentum conservation because of broken rotational symmetry. Here we report observations of highly forbidden transitions between spin states in a Ni$_4$ single-molecule magnet in which a single photon can induce the spin to change by several times $\hbar$, nearly reversing the direction of the spin. These observations are understood as tunneling-assisted transitions that lift the standard $\Delta m = \pm 1$ selection rule for single-photon transitions. These transitions are observed at low applied fields, where tunneling is dominated by the molecule's intrinsic anisotropy and the field acts as a perturbation. Such transitions may be exploited in quantum information processing since under certain circumstances decoherence due to fluctuations in local magnetic fields is suppressed.

abstract: We argue that the phenomenon of vacuum birefringence in strong inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields can be most efficiently analyzed in terms of a vacuum emission process. In this contribution, we exemplarily stick to the case of vacuum birefringence in a stationary perpendicularly directed, purely magnetic background field extending over a finite spatial extent. Similar field configurations are realized in the BMV and PVLAS experiments. We demonstrate that we can reproduce the conventional constant field result. Our focus is on effects which arise when the probe photons originate in the field free region, are directed towards the magnetic field region, and detected well after the interaction with the magnetic field has taken place, again at zero field.

abstract: We study the incandescence of a semiconductor system characterized by a radiatively broadened material excitation. We show that the shape of the emission spectrum and the peak emissivity value are determined by the ratio between radiative and non-radiative relaxation rates of the material mode. Our system is a heavily doped quantum well, exhibiting a collective bright electronic excitation in the mid-infrared. The spontaneous emission rate of this collective mode strongly depends on the emission direction and, uncommonly for a solid-state system, can dominate non-radiative scattering processes. Consequently the incandescence spectrum undergoes strong modifications when the detection angle is varied. Incandescence is modelled solving quantum Langevin equations, including a microscopic description of the collective excitations, decaying into electronic and photonic baths. We demonstrate that the emissivity reaches unity value for a well-defined direction and presents an angular radiative pattern which is very different from that of an oscillating dipole.

abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of molecules in a solution at room temperature has potential to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions are typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation times between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible molecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the liquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times. Importantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to solid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large detuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme with optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to design a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by room temperature electron thermal polarisation. We illustrate numerically the effectiveness of the model in a flow cell containing nanodiamonds immobilized in a hydrogel, polarising flowing water molecules 4700-fold above thermal polarisation in a magnetic field of 0.35 T, in volumes detectable by current NMR scanners.

abstract: The claim some years ago, contrary to all textbooks, that the angular momentum of a photon (and gluon) can be split in a gauge-invariant way into an orbital and spin term, sparked a major controversy in the Particle Physics community. A further cause of upset was the realization that the gluon polarization in a nucleon, a supposedly physically meaningful quantity, corresponds only to the gauge-variant gluon spin derived from Noether's theorem, evaluated in a particular gauge. On the contrary, Laser Physicists have, for decades, been happily measuring physical quantities which correspond to orbital and spin angular momentum evaluated in a particular gauge. This paper reconciles the two points of view.
