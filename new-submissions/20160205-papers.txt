abstract: We present a local non-iterative method for the implementation of Procrustean entanglement distillation on a pair of entangled qubits using a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM). We show that this POVM can be applied equally to massless and massive qubits in hybrid quantum systems. For massless particles we consider single photons, for which the POVM can be implemented using standard linear optics components. For massive particles, we consider spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles. Numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation show how the POVM can be applied to these qubits using gaussian wavepackets. Our non-iterative method can be applied, not only to pure ensembles with particle pairs of known identical entanglement, but also to ensembles of particle pairs with a distribution of different entanglement entropies. The outlined protocol eases the requirement for the creation of $m$-particle cluster states for measurement based quantum computing, such that the resource states can have entanglement entropies approaching zero as $\mathcal{O}(1 / poly(m))$.

abstract: We propose an approach to detect individual Rydberg molecules with each molecule consisting of two atoms in different Rydberg states. The scheme exploits the movement of atoms in the presence of an external force that exerts only on atoms in one Rydberg state. Since the movement of atoms in the other Rydberg state depends on whether they are bound with atoms directly driven by the applied force, bound atoms can be distinguished from unbound atoms. By utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency, it is possible to non-destructively image the positions of molecules. The scheme is sensitive to a weak force, which is suited to optically detect spatial positions and bond structure of Rydberg molecules.

abstract: We represent a two qubit density matrix in the basis of Pauli matrix tensor products, with the coefficients constituting a Bloch matrix, analogous to the single qubit Bloch vector. We find the quantum state positivity requirements on the Bloch matrix components, leading to three important inequalities, allowing us to parameterize and visualize the two qubit state space. Applying the singular value decomposition naturally separates the degrees of freedom to local and nonlocal, and simplifies the positivity inequalities. It also allows us to geometrically represent a state as two entangled Bloch spheres with superimposed correlation axes. It is shown that unitary transformations, local or nonlocal, have simple interpretations as axis rotations or mixing of certain degrees of freedom. The nonlocal unitary invariants of the state are then derived in terms of local unitary invariants. The positive partial transpose criterion for entanglement is generalized, and interpreted as a reflection, or a change of a single sign. The formalism is used to characterize maximally entangled states, and generalize two qubit isotropic and Werner states.

abstract: Cavity electro-(opto-)mechanics allows us to access not only single isolated but also multiple mechanical modes in a massive object. Here we develop a multi-mode electromechanical system in which a several membrane vibrational modes are coupled to a three-dimensional loop-gap superconducting microwave cavity. The tight confinement of the electric field across a mechanically-compliant narrow-gap capacitor brings the system into the quantum strong coupling regime under a red-sideband pump field. We demonstrate strong coupling between two mechanical modes, which is induced by two-tone parametric drives and mediated by a virtual photon in the cavity. The tunable inter-mechanical-mode coupling can be used to generate entanglement between the mechanical modes.

abstract: Ultrastrong coupling in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems not only provides a platform to study the quantum Rabi model, but it can also facilitate the implementation of quantum logic operations via high-lying resonator states. In this regime, quantum manifolds with different excitation numbers are intrinsically connected via the counter-rotating interactions, which can result in multi-photon processes. Recent experiments have demonstrated ultrastrong coupling in superconducting qubits electromagnetically coupled to superconducting resonators. Here we report the experimental observation of multiphoton sideband transitions of a superconducting flux qubit coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator in the ultrastrong coupling regime. With a coupling strength reaching about 10% of the fundamental frequency of the resonator, we obtain clear signatures of higher-order red-sideband transitions and the first-order blue-sideband transition in a transmission spectroscopic measurement. This study advances the understanding of driven ultrastrongly-coupled systems.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.01594
abstract: We show that the modular value is expressed by the average of the dynamic phase factors using the complex conditional probabilities. In relation to this expression, the chain rule of the conditional probabilities is also derived, which relates the initial-final-state modular value with the initial- transitional-state modular values and the transitional-final-state weak values. Then, we express the modular value with the relative change and the total phase shift (the geometric phases and the intrinsic phase), which is another aspect of the modular value. The modulus of modular value is found to play a significant role in the relative change of the quantum system under the dynamic evolution, and also, the argument of modular value is found to have connection with the total phase shift. By analyzing these two relations, we can apply to calibrate the value of coupling constant, which was used in modular value and the geometric phase, which has many implications. In contrast, one can fully determine the modular value (modulus and argument) by examining the relative change and the corresponding total phase shift.

abstract: In standard quantum mechanics, complex numbers are used to describe the wavefunction. Although complex numbers have proven sufficient to predict the results of existing experiments, there is no apparent theoretical reason to choose them over real numbers or generalizations of complex numbers, i.e. hyper-complex numbers. Experiments performed to date have proven that real numbers are insufficient, but whether or not hyper-complex numbers are required remains an open question. Quantum theories based on hyper-complex numbers are one example of a post-quantum theory, which must be put on a firm experimental foundation. Here we experimentally probe hyper-complex quantum theories, by studying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the non-commutativity of phases. We do so by passing single photons through a Sagnac interferometer containing two physically different phases, having refractive indices of opposite sign. By showing that the phases commute with high precision, we place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex quantum theories.

It is shown that this class of maps cover almost all known examples -- from Markovian semigroup, semi-Markov evolution up to collision models and their generalization.

abstract: In quantum parameter estimation, the ultimate precision limit is given by the so-called Cramer-Rao bound. The calculation of this bound, which is expressed in terms of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and determination of the optimal probe state, in the presence of the inevitable impact of decoherence is still a challenging problem. In this article, this challenge is circumvented by introducing a lower bound on the QFI to estimate the ultimate precision limit. The calculation of this bound (which is mostly close to the exact value of the QFI) requires only the matrix representation of the parameter encoding map. This property allows us to use the bound in open quantum systems which are governed by general (semigroup and non-semigroup) dynamical maps. Reliability and efficiency of the method to predict the ultimate precision limit is demonstrated by several main examples.

abstract: Encryption of data is fundamental to secure communication in the modern world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating classical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible [Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have numerous applications. In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box, indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money. We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions exist [Alagic et al '16].

abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement is drawing attention because it enables us to perform quantum information tasks that are robust against noises. To test the nonlocality of entangled qudits, the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality has been proposed and demonstrated using qudits based on orbital angular momentum, time-energy uncertainty, and frequency bins. Here, we report the generation and observation of time-bin entangled ququarts. We implemented a measurement for the CGLMP inequality test using cascaded delay Mach-Zehnder interferometers fabricated by using planar lightwave circuit technology, with which we achieved a precise and stable measurement for time-bin-entangled ququarts. In addition, we generated an optimized entangled state by modulating the pump pulse intensities, with which we can observe the theoretical maximum violation for the CGLMP inequality test. As a result, we successfully observed a Bell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.774 \pm 0.025$ violating the CGLMP inequality for the maximally entangled state and an enhanced Bell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.913 \pm 0.023$ for the optimized entangled state.

As an example, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a fluxonium qubit inductively coupled to a readout resonator. Our method treats both the anharmonicity of the Hamiltonian and the coupling between qubit and readout modes exactly. Calculated spectra are compared to measured spectroscopy data for this fluxonium-resonator system. We observe excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment that is not possible with a purely perturbative approach.

abstract: We investigate the dispersion relations of TE resonances in different graphene-dielectric structures. Previous work has shown that when a graphene layer is brought into contact with a dielectric material, a gap can appear in its electric band structure. This allows for the formation of TE-plasmons with unusual dispersion relations. In addition, if the dielectric has a finite thickness, graphene strongly modifies the behavior of the waveguiding modes by introducing dissipation above a well-defined cutoff frequency thus providing the possibility of mode filtering. This cutoff and the properties of TE-plasmons are closely related to the pair-creation threshold of graphene thus representing quantum mechanical effects that manifest themselves in the electromagnetic response.

abstract: Today's science provides quite a lean picture of time as a mere geometric evolution parameter. I argue that time is much richer. In particular, I argue that besides the geometric time, there is creative time, when objective chance events happen. The existence of the latter follows straight from the existence of free-will. Following the french philosopher Lequyer, I argue that free-will is a prerequisite for the possibility to have rational argumentations, hence can't be denied. Consequently, science can't deny the existence of creative time and thus that time really passes.

abstract: We investigate the evolution of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral lineshapes in an optically-thick helium gas under near-infrared (IR) perturbation. In our experimental and theoretical work, we systematically vary the IR intensity, time-delay, gas density and IR polarization parameters to study lineshape modifications induced by collective interactions, in a regime beyond the single atom response of a thin, dilute gas. In both experiment and theory, we find that specific features in the frequency-domain absorption profile, and their evolution with propagation distance, can be attributed to the interplay between resonant attosecond pulse propagation and IR induced phase shifts. Our calculations show that this interplay also manifests itself in the time domain, with the IR pulse influencing the reshaping of the XUV pulse propagating in the resonant medium.

To obtain reliable error syndromes using imperfect physical circuits, we propose the idea of quantum data-syndrome (DS) codes that are capable of correcting both data qubits and syndrome bits errors. We study fundamental properties of quantum DS codes and provide several CSS-type code constructions of quantum DS codes.

abstract: Recent advance in quantum simulations of interacting photons using superconducting circuits offers opportunities for investigating the Bose-Hubbard model in various geometries with hopping coefficients and self-interactions tuned to both signs. Here we investigate phenomena related to localized states associated with a flat-band supported by the saw-tooth geometry. A localization-delocalization transition emerges in the non-interacting regime as the sign of hopping coefficient is changed. In the presence of interactions, patterns of localized states approach a uniform density distribution for repulsive interactions while interesting localized density patterns can arise in strongly attractive regime. The density patterns indicate the underlying inhomogeneity of the simulator. Two-particle correlations can further distinguish the nature of the localized states in attractive and repulsive interaction regimes. We also survey possible experimental implementations of the simulator.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize a highly efficient solid state source of photon pairs using cavity-assisted stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in a single quantum dot, where a single photon from pump pulse and two stokes photons from cavity mode drives the Raman transition. The Autler-Townes doublet, generated by using a resonant continuous wave laser between biexciton and exciton states, and two-photon-resonant transition through strongly coupled cavity mode are utilized to facilitate (1+2)type Raman transition in the quantum dot. We show in the case of weak pump although the probability of generating two photons in cavity mode is small without cavity damping but two-photon-resonant emission is enhanced by cavity damping within strong coupling regime. We also discuss spectrum of the generated photon pair and photon-photon correlations in the generated photon pair. The efficiency of two photon source could be more than 80\% in current experimental conditions.

abstract: We investigate a novel hybrid system of a superconducting charge qubit interacting directly with a single neutral atom via electric dipole coupling. Interfacing of the macroscopic superconducting circuit with the microscopic atomic system is accomplished by varying the gate capacitance of the charge qubit. To achieve strong interaction, we employ two Rydberg states with an electric-dipole-allowed transition, which alters the polarizability of the dielectric medium of the gate capacitor. Sweeping the gate voltage with different rates leads to a precise control of hybrid quantum states. Furthermore, we show a possible implementation of a universal two-qubit gate.

abstract: Since the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis, living systems have developed protective mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. During charge separation in photosynthetic reaction centres, triplet states can react with molecular oxygen generating destructive singlet oxygen. The triplet product yield in bacteria is observed to be reduced by weak magnetic fields. Reaction centres from plants' photosystem II share many features with bacterial reaction centres, including a high-spin iron whose function has remained obscure. To explain observations that the magnetic field effect is reduced by the iron, we propose that its fast-relaxing spin plays a protective role in photosynthesis by generating an effective magnetic field. We consider a simple model of the system, derive an analytical expression for the effective magnetic field and analyse the resulting triplet yield reduction. The protective mechanism is robust for realistic parameter ranges, constituting a clear example of a quantum effect playing a macroscopic role vital for life.
