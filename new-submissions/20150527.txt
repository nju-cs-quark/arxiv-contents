abstract: Contemporary understanding of correlations in quantum many-body systems and in quantum phase transitions is based to a large extent on the recent intensive studies of entanglement in many-body systems. In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum nonlocality in these systems, mostly because the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve high-order correlations among many particles, which are hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Standard, "theorist- and experimentalist-friendly" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality for this scenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently, however, we have succeeded in constructing multipartite Bell inequalities that involve two- and one-body correlations only, and showed how they revealed the nonlocality in many-body systems relevant for nuclear and atomic physics [Science 344, 1256 (2014)]. With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On the one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell inequalities, pertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved parties. On the other hand, we present a couple of new results concerning such Bell inequalities. First, we characterize their tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum violations of these inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with the number of parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell inequalities which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke states---ground states of physically relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we shortly discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic systems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of designed nanostructures.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a single photon pulse travels through a linear atomic chain coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) single mode photonic waveguide. We derive a time-dependent dynamical theory for this collective many-body system which allows us to study the real time evolution of the photon transport and the atomic excitations. Our analytical result is consistent with previous numerical calculations when there is only one atom. For an atomic chain, the collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide mode can significantly change the dynamics of the system. The reflectivity of a photon can be tuned by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain. The reflectivity of a single photon pulse with finite bandwidth can even approach $100\%$. The spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly different from the single atom case. Many interesting physical phenomena can occur in this system such as the photonic bandgap effects, quantum entanglement generation, Fano-like interference, and superradiant effects. For engineering, this system may serve as a single photon frequency filter, single photon modulation and may find important applications in quantum information.

abstract: We demonstrate an all-fiber cavity QED system with a trapped single atom in the strong coupling regime. We use a nanofiber Fabry-Perot cavity, that is, an optical nanofiber sandwiched by two fiber-Bragg-grating mirrors. Measurements of the cavity transmission spectrum with a single atom in a state-insensitive nanofiber trap clearly reveal the vacuum Rabi splitting. Our system provides a simple and robust implementation of a large-scale all-fiber quantum network.

abstract: In this paper, we consider an entangled Ising-XYZ diamond chain structure. Quantum correlations for this model is investigated by using of quantum discord and trace distance discord. Quantum correlations is obtained for different values of the anisotropy parameter, magnetic field and temperature. By comparison between quantum correlations, we show trace distance discord is always larger than quantum discord. Finally, some novel effects, such as increasing the quantum correlations with temperature and constructive role of anisotropy parameter which may paly to the quantum correlations were observed.

abstract: Is a violation of Kochen-Specker (KS) non-contextuality inequality a tight bound to rule out the non-contextual hidden variable theory? A test designed by Liang, Spekkens and Wiseman (LSW) provides a more stringent bound and a violation of a generalized non-contextuality inequality such as LSW inequality rules out more generalized non-contextual models including the traditional KS non-contextual models. It is proven that a qubit and three unsharp binary qubit measurements are enough to violate LSW inequality. We show such measurements can be implemented through joint positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy spin-1/2 observables associated with an ancilla and report an experimental realization of the joint POVMs on photonic qubits. We demonstrate an experimental violation of LSW inequality in a state-dependent manner with single photons and provide the first experimental evidence that even for a simplest two-level system, i.e., a qubit, no such classical model can exist that correctly describes the results of a small set of three unsharp binary qubit measurements.

abstract: Current quantum orthodoxy claims that the statistical collapse of the wave-function arises from the interaction of the measuring instrument with its environment through the phenomenon known as environment induced decoherence. Here it is shown that there exists a measurement scheme that is exactly decohering without the aid of an environment. The scheme relies on the assumption that the meter is decomposable into probe and pointer, with the probe taken to be inaccessible for observation. Under the assumption that the probe and the pointer initial states are momentum limited, it is shown that coherences die out within a finite interval of time and the pointer states are exactly orthogonal. These lead to the fundamental realization that dispersion of correlation does not require an external infinite number of degrees of freedom. An internal one degree of freedom is already sufficient to delocalize the correlations and leave its subparts in a classical mixed state, so that decoherence may occur even for isolated measuring instruments.

abstract: We study robustness of genuine multipartite entanglement for a system of three qubits under collective dephasing. Using a computable entanglement monotone for multipartite systems, we found that almost every state is quite robust under this type of decoherence. We analyze random states and weighted graph states at infinity and found all of them to be genuinely entangled.

abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of making n perfect clones from m copies of one of two known pure states with minimum failure probability in the general case where the known states have arbitrary a priori probabilities. The solution emerges from a geometric formulation of the problem. This formulation also reveals a deeper connection between cloning and state discrimination. The convergence of cloning to state discrimination as the number of clones goes to infinity exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking phase transition.

abstract: It is shown that the structure of thermodynamics is "form invariant," when it is derived using maximum entropy principle for various choices of entropy and even beyond equilibrium. By the form invariance of thermodynamics, it is meant that the form of the free energy (internal energy minus the temperature times entropy) remains unaltered when all the entities entering this relation are suitably defined. The useful ingredients for this are the equilibrium entropy associated with thermal density matrix and the relative entropy between an arbitrary density matrix and the thermal density matrix. To delineate the form invariance, we consider the quantum R\'enyi entropic versions (indexed by a parameter $\alpha$), i.e., R\'enyi entropy with appropriate internal energy and equilibrium state defined for all $\alpha$. These results reduce to the well-known Gibbs-von Neumann results when $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. Moreover, we show that the \textit{universality} of the Carnot statement of the second law is the consequence of the form invariance of the free energy. Further, the Clausius inequality, which is the precursor to the Carnot cycle, is also shown to hold. Thus, we find the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium state and its deviation from equilibrium together determine the thermodynamic laws.

abstract: A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac equation), and thus provide us with discrete toy models of familiar particles (e.g. the electron). In this paper, we study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to all those PDEs corresponding to the Hamiltonian form of the massive curved Dirac equation in (1 + 1) dimensions. Therefore a certain QW, which we make explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of the electron as a test particle in curved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice. Mathematically we have introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW, but which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.

abstract: A joint input-output behavior is non-local if it cannot be explained by shared classical information. This is equivalent to the impossibility of the outputs for all alternative inputs to exist in a consistent way. In particular, this view relates outcomes of measurements that cannot actually be carried out together: They are still all assumed to have definite outcomes. It has been argued that such counterfactual definiteness is necessary for understanding non-locality. We propose a viewpoint avoiding it. We refrain from invoking probabilities but use algorithmic complexity instead.

abstract: Lieb-Liniger model describes bosons with contact interactions in one-dimensional space. In the limit of weak repulsive particle interactions, there are two types of low lying excitation spectrum. The first is reproduced by the Bogoliubov dispersion relation, the other is believed to correspond to dark soliton excitations. While there are various evidences that the type II spectrum is related to dark solitons, it has not been shown that measurements of positions of particles reveal dark soliton density profiles. Here, we employ the Bethe ansatz approach and show that dark solitons emerge in the measurement process if the system is prepared in an eigenstate corresponding to the type II spectrum. We analyze single and double dark solitons as well as weak and strong interaction regime.

abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems provide an important window onto the influence of particle statistics on collective behaviour, with the prototypical system being the two-leg ladder. Particle statistics in two dimensions are particularly rich, admitting not only bosonic and fermionic but also anyonic excitations, and while the behaviours of fermions and hard-core bosons on the ladder are well understood, the same cannot be said about anyons. Numerical analysis of the hard-core $\mathbb{Z}_3$ anyon model on the two-rung ladder reveals a rich phase diagram clearly distinct from both the fermionic and bosonic cases, including a novel Cooper triplet superfluid phase. Qualitative predictions are extrapolated for the phase diagrams of all integer Abelian anyon models $\{\mathbb{Z}_q~|~q\in\mathbb{Z}^+\}$.

abstract: We report the generation of high-purity twin photon pairs through cavity-enhanced non-degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in a high-Q silicon microdisk resonator. The device is able to produce twin photons with a pair generation rate of approximately 400 kHz, within a narrow bandwidth of 0.72 GHz, and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio as large as 660 $\pm$ 62, the highest value reported to date for twin photon pairs. Through careful engineering of the dispersion matching window, we have reduced the ratio of photons resulting from degenerate FWM to non-degenerate FWM to less than 0.15.

abstract: The Compton wavelength gives the minimum radius within which the mass of a particle may be localized due to quantum effects, while the Schwarzschild radius gives the maximum radius within which the mass of a black hole may be localized due to classial gravity. In a mass-radius diagram, the two lines intersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects become significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is based on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie relations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$. It is unclear what physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $E \gg m_Pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\lambda \ll l_P$ or time periods $T \ll t_P$ in the standard theory. We therefore propose a correction to the standard de Broglie relations, which gives rise to a modified Schr{\" o}dinger equation and a modified expression for the Compton wavelength, which may be extended into the region $E \gg m_Pc^2$. For the proposed modification, we recover the expression for the Schwarzschild radius for $E \gg m_Pc^2$ and the usual Compton formula for $E \ll m_Pc^2$. The sign of the inequality obtained from the uncertainty principle reverses at $m \approx m_P$, so that the Compton wavelength and event horizon size may be interpreted as minimum and maximum radii, respectively. We interpret the additional terms in the modified de Broglie relations as representing the self-gravitation of the wave packet.

abstract: There is growing experimental interest in coupling cavity photons to the cyclotron resonance excitations of electron liquids in high-mobility semiconductor quantum wells or graphene sheets. These media offer unique platforms to carry out fundamental studies of exciton-polariton condensation and cavity quantum electrodynamics in a regime in which electron-electron (e-e) interactions are expected to play a pivotal role. Focusing on graphene, we present a theoretical study of the impact of e-e interactions on a quantum Hall polariton fluid (QHPF), i.e. a fluid of magneto-excitons resonantly coupled to cavity photons. We show that e-e interactions are responsible for an instability of graphene integer QHPFs towards a crystalline phase. We demonstrate that this phase can be detected by measuring the collective excitation spectra, which soften at a characteristic wave vector of the order of the inverse magnetic length.

abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of a translationally invariant quantum spin chain, based on the East kinetically constrained glass model, in search for evidence of many-body localisation in the absence of disorder. Numerical simulations indicate a change, controlled by a coupling parameter, from a regime of fast relaxation---corresponding to thermalisation---to a regime of very slow relaxation. This slowly relaxing regime is characterised by dynamical features usually associated with non-ergodicity and many-body localisation (MBL): memory of initial conditions, logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, and non-exponential decay of time-correlators. We show that slow relaxation is a consequence of sensitivity to spatial fluctuations in the initial state. While numerics indicate that certain relaxation timescales grow markedly with size, our finite size results are consistent both with an MBL transition, expected to only occur in disordered systems, or with a pronounced quasi-MBL crossover.
