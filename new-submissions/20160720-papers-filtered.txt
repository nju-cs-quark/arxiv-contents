abstract: We consider the quantum search problem with a continuous time quantum walk for networks of finite spectral dimension d_{s} of the network Laplacian. For general networks of fractal (integer or non-integer) dimension d_{f}, for which in general d_{f}\not=d_{s}, it suggests that d_{s} is the scaling exponent that determines the computational complexity of the search. Our results are consistent with those of Childs and Goldstone [Phys. Rev. A 70 (2004), 022314] for lattices of integer dimension, where d=d_{f}=d_{s}. For general fractals, we find that the Grover limit of quantum search can be obtained whenever d_{s}>4. This complements the recent discussion of mean-field (i.e., d_{s}\to\infty) networks by Chakraborty et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016), 100501] showing that for all those networks spatial search by quantum walk is optimal.

abstract: One of the fundamental results in quantum foundations is the Kochen-Specker no-go theorem. For the quantum theory, the no-go theorem excludes the possibility of a class of hidden variable models where value attribution is context independent. Recently, the notion of contextuality has been generalized for different operational procedures and it has been shown that preparation contextuality of mixed quantum states can be a useful resource in an information-processing task called parity-oblivious multiplexing. Here, we introduce a new class of information processing tasks, namely d-level parity oblivious random access codes and obtain bounds on the success probabilities of performing such tasks in any preparation noncontextual theory. These bounds constitute noncontextuality inequalities for any value of d. For d=3, using a set of mutually asymmetric biased bases we show that the corresponding noncontextual bound is violated by quantum theory. We also show quantum violation of the inequalities for some other higher values of d. This reveals operational usefulness of preparation contextuality of higher level quantum systems.

abstract: We show that both discrete and continuous time-translation symmetry can be broken in the pre-thermal regime of quantum systems that eventually thermalize. We prove a theorem that states that such "time crystals" persist until times that are nearly exponentially-long in the couplings and, in driven systems, the drive frequency. After this thermalization time, the time-translational symmetry breaking oscillations fade away. However, during the time interval prior to that, a time crystal can exist even without disorder, and its properties are encapsulated by a field theory analogous to that of equilibrium spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases. When coupled to a cold bath, the pre-thermal regime could potentially persist to infinite time. Similar conclusions hold for topological phases of driven systems.
