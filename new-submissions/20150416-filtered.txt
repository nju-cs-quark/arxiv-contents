abstract: We characterize the set of generalized quantum measurements that can be decomposed into a continuous measurement process using a stream of probe qubits and a tunable interaction Hamilto- nian. Each probe in the stream interacts weakly with the target quantum system, then is measured projectively in a standard basis. This measurement result is used in a closed feedback loop to tune the interaction Hamiltonian for the next probe. The resulting evolution is a stochastic process with the structure of a one-dimensional random walk. To maintain this structure, and require that at long times the measurement outcomes be independent of the path, the allowed interaction Hamil- tonians must lie in a restricted set, such that the Hamiltonian terms on the target system form a finite dimensional Jordan algebra. This algebraic structure of the interaction Hamiltonians yields a large class of generalized measurements that can be continuously performed by our scheme, and we fully describe this set.

abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, until now, have been characterized by a real, parity-symmetric, kinetic Hamiltonian and a non-Hermitian, balanced gain-loss potential. We present a new class of discrete models in which the tunneling Hamiltonian is not parity-symmetric, and yet the models have a nonzero $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking threshold in presence of a pair of gain-loss impurities $\pm i\gamma$ located at reflection-symmetric sites. We uncover a hidden symmetry that is instrumental to the finite threshold strength. We show that such models have topological edge-states that remain robust in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase. Our predictions substantially broaden possible realizations of a $\mathcal{PT}$ system, particularly in optical waveguide arrays or coupled microstructures, by eliminating the parity-symmetry constraint.
