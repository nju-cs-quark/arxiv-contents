abstract: If a photon interacts with a member of an entangled photon pair via a so-called Bell-state measurement (BSM), its state is teleported over principally arbitrary distances onto the second member of the pair. Starting in 1997, this puzzling prediction of quantum mechanics has been demonstrated many times; however, with one very recent exception, only the photon that received the teleported state, if any, travelled far while the photons partaking in the BSM were always measured closely to where they were created. Here, using the Calgary fibre network, we report quantum teleportation from a telecommunication-wavelength photon, interacting with another telecommunication photon after both have travelled over several kilometres in bee-line, onto a photon at 795~nm wavelength. This improves the distance over which teleportation takes place from 818~m to 6.2~km. Our demonstration establishes an important requirement for quantum repeater-based communications and constitutes a milestone on the path to a global quantum Internet.

abstract: Maxwell's demon explores the role of information in physical processes. Employing information about microscopic degrees of freedom, this "intelligent observer" is capable of compensating entropy production (or extracting work), apparently challenging the second law of thermodynamics. In a modern standpoint, it is regarded as a feedback control mechanism and the limits of thermodynamics are recast incorporating information-to-energy conversion. We derive a trade-off relation between information-theoretic quantities empowering the design of an efficient Maxwell's demon in a quantum system. The demon is experimentally implemented as a spin-1/2 quantum memory that acquires information, and employs it to control the dynamics of another spin-1/2 system, through a natural interaction. Noise and imperfections in this protocol are investigated by the assessment of its effectiveness. This realization provides experimental evidence that the irreversibility on a non-equilibrium dynamics can be mitigated by assessing microscopic information and applying a feed-forward strategy at the quantum scale.

abstract: We consider the dynamics of a two-level system (qubit) driven by strong and short resonant pulses in the framework of Floquet theory. First we derive analytical expressions for the quasienergies and Floquet states of the driven system. If the pulse amplitude varies very slowly, the system adiabatically follows the instantaneous Floquet states, which acquire dynamical phases that depend on the evolution of the quasienergies over time. The difference between the phases acquired by the two Floquet states corresponds to a qubit state rotation, generalizing the notion of Rabi oscillations to the case of large driving amplitudes. If the pulse amplitude changes very fast, the evolution is non-adiabatic, with transitions taking place between the Floquet states. We quantify and analyze the nonadiabatic transitions during the pulse by employing adiabatic perturbation theory and exact numerical simulations. We find that, for certain combinations of pulse rise and fall times and maximum driving amplitude, a destructive interference effect leads to a remarkably strong suppression of transitions between the Floquet states. This effect provides the basis of a quantum control protocol, which we name Floquet Interference Efficient Suppression of Transitions in the Adiabatic basis (FIESTA), that can be used to design ultra-fast high-fidelity single-qubit quantum gates.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been realized in atomic systems, but fulfilling the EIT conditions for artificial atoms made from superconducting circuits is a more difficult task. Here we report an experimental observation of the EIT in a tunable three-dimensional transmon by probing the cavity transmission. To fulfill the EIT conditions, we tune the transmon to adjust its damping rates by utilizing the effect of the cavity on the transmon states. From the experimental observations, we clearly identify the EIT and Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) regimes as well as the transition regime in between. Also, the experimental data demonstrate that the threshold $\Omega_{\rm AIC}$ determined by the Akaike information criterion can describe the EIT-ATS transition better than the threshold $\Omega_{\rm EIT}$ given by the EIT theory.

abstract: We show that the use of shaped pulses improves the fidelity of a Rydberg blockade two-qubit entangling gate by several orders of magnitude compared to previous protocols based on square pulses or optimal control pulses. Using analytical Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulses that reduce excitation of primary leakage states and an analytical method of finding the optimal Rydberg blockade we generate Bell states with a fidelity of $F>0.9999$ in a 300 K environment for a gate time of only $50\;{\rm ns}$, which is an order of magnitude faster than previous protocols. These results establish the potential of neutral atom qubits with Rydberg blockade gates for scalable quantum computation.

abstract: The ability to feed energy into a system, or - equivalently - to drive that system with an external input is a fundamental aspect of light-matter interaction. The key concept in many photonic applications is the "critical coupling" condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an input channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was crucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in the context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this so-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are in fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called polaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we term strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into polaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or mechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special curve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more general case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology displayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally understood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most importantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. This result opens new avenues in the exploration of polariton physics, making it possible to control the pumping efficiency of a system almost independently of its Rabi energy, i.e., of the energy exchange rate between the electromagnetic field and the material transition.

abstract: Bell-type local realist inequalities are developed for probing quantum nonlocality of bipartite entangled qutrit states by generalizing Wigner's argument that was originally formulated for the bipartite qubit singlet state. This treatment is based upon assuming the existence of the overall joint probability distributions for the measurement outcomes pertaining to the relevant trichotomic observables, satisfying the locality condition, and yielding the measurable marginal probabilities. We first show that such generalized Wigner inequalities (GWI) are violated by quantum mechanics (QM) for both the bipartite qutrit isotropic and singlet states, thereby demonstrating their nonlocality. The efficacy of GWIs are also probed by comparing their QM violation with that obtained for other types of local realist inequalities that have been used for probing nonlocality of entangled bipartite qutrits. This is done in two different ways, (i) by employing unsharp measurements, and (ii) by incorporating white noise in the isotropic and singlet qutrit states. We find that in both these cases, GWIs outperform the two other types of local realist inequalities considered here in terms of their QM violation, by being (i) more robust against the usharpness of measurement, and (ii) more tolerant to the white noise incorporated in the states considered.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, the state of the system, or set of systems, is encoded as a vector in a state space. While this sounds simple, it has several implications that are not limited to the more well known and "spooky" consequences of quantum physics, such as entanglement. One of these is that we can never directly observe the state of the system itself; we are only able to measure its observable properties, such as position and momentum, that are affected by the system's state. By making many measurements of this set of observables of the state, we can generate marginal distributions of each. From these distributions, we can reconstruct the original state vector from its associated phase-space Wigner function. It has been shown that such a measurement of the Wigner function is possible for light. Here we give a procedure for the direct measurement and reconstruction of the Wigner function for a series of quantum spin states that should be applicable to any quantum system. We have applied our procedure to IBM's Quantum Experience five qubit quantum processor to demonstrate that we can directly measure and distinguish two different Bell states - states central to understanding entanglement - via this method. We have also performed direct measurements of the five qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state Wigner function.

abstract: We study a parity-time (PT) symmetric ring lattice, with one pair of balanced gain and loss located at opposite positions. The system remains PT-symmetric when threaded by a magnetic flux; however, the PT symmetry is sensitive to the magnetic flux, in the presence of a large balanced gain and loss, or in a large system. We find a threshold gain/loss, above which, any nontrivial magnetic flux breaks the PT symmetry. We obtain the maximally tolerable magnetic flux for the exact PT-symmetric phase, which is approximately linearly dependent on a weak gain/loss.

abstract: De Finetti theorems show how sufficiently exchangeable states are well-approximated by convex combinations of i.i.d. states. Recently, it was shown that in many quantum information applications a more relaxed de Finetti reduction (i.e. only a matrix inequality between the symmetric state and one of de Finetti form) is enough, and that it leads to more concise and elegant arguments. Here we show several uses and general flexible applicability of a constrained de Finetti reduction in quantum information theory, which was recently discovered by Duan, Severini and Winter. In particular we show that the technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation action, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that, in some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular separability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly interesting in the context of the complexity class $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of interactive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our results relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ protocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of certain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to infinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de Finetti techniques in the quantum case.

abstract: We consider a narrow magneto-dipole transition in the $^{169}$Tm atom at the wavelength of $1.14\,\mu$m as a candidate for a 2D optical lattice clock. Calculating dynamic polarizabilities of the two clock levels $[\text{Xe}]4f^{13}6s^2 (J=7/2)$ and $[\text{Xe}]4f^{13}6s^2 (J=5/2)$ in the spectral range from $250\,$nm to $1200\,$nm, we suggest the "magic" wavelength for the optical lattice at $807\,$nm. Frequency shifts due to black-body radiation (BBR), the van der Waals interaction, the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and other effects which can perturb the transition frequency are calculated. The transition at $1.14\,\mu$m demonstrates low sensitivity to the BBR shift corresponding to $8\times10^{-17}$ in fractional units at room temperature which makes it an interesting candidate for high-performance optical clocks. The total estimated frequency uncertainty is less than $5 \times 10^{-18}$ in fractional units. By direct excitation of the $1.14\,\mu$m transition in Tm atoms loaded into an optical dipole trap, we set the lower limit for the lifetime of the upper clock level $[\text{Xe}]4f^{13}6s^2 (J=5/2)$ of $112\,$ms which corresponds to a natural spectral linewidth narrower than $1.4\,$Hz. The polarizability of the Tm ground state was measured by the excitation of parametric resonances in the optical dipole trap at $532\,$nm.

abstract: In this work, we consider the systematic error of quantum metrology by weak measurements under decoherence. We derive the systematic error of maximum likelihood estimation in general to the first order approximation of a small deviation in the probability distribution, and study the robustness of standard weak measurement and postselected weak measurements against systematic errors. We show that with a large weak value, the systematic error of a postselected weak measurement when the probe undergoes decoherence can be significantly lower than that of a standard weak measurement. This indicates the advantage of weak value amplification in improving the performance of parameter estimation. We illustrate the results by an exact numerical simulation of decoherence arising from a bosonic mode and compare it to the first order analytical result we obtain.

abstract: Entanglement is a vital resource for realizing many tasks such as teleportation, secure key distribution, metrology and quantum computations. To effectively build entanglement between different quantum systems and share information between them, a frequency transducer to convert between quantum states of different wavelengths while retaining its quantum features is indispensable. Information encoded in the photons orbital angular momentum OAM degrees of freedom is preferred in harnessing the information carrying capacity of a single photon because of its unlimited dimensions. A quantum transducer, which operates at wavelengths from 1558.3 nm to 525 nm for OAM qubits, OAMpolarization hybrid entangled states, and OAM entangled states, is reported for the first time. Nonclassical properties and entanglements are demonstrated following the conversion process by performing quantum tomography, interference, and Bell inequality measurements. Our results demonstrate the capability to create an entanglement link between different quantum systems operating in photons OAM degrees of freedoms, which will be of great importance in building a high capacity OAM quantum network.

This allows us to investigate how the Born-Oppenheimer approximation fails and how effective magnetic and electric fields appear as the consequence of the non-adiabatic dynamics. The results are based on exact numerical diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian describing the coupling between the internal and external degrees of freedom. The position in energy and the decay rate of the trapping states correspond to the imaginary part of the resonances of this Hamiltonian and are computed using the complex rotation method.

abstract: The effect of the frequency chirping on momentum spectrum and pair production rate in one- and two-color laser pulse fields is investigated by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. A small frequency chirp shifts the momentum spectrum along the momentum axis. The positive and negative frequency chirp parameters play the same role in increasing the pair number density. The sign change of frequency chirp parameter at the moment $t=0$ leads pulse shape and momentum spectrum to be symmetric, and the number density to be increased. The number density of produced pairs in the two-color pulse field is much higher than that in the one-color pulse field and the larger frequency chirp pulse field dominates more strongly. In the two-color pulse fields, the relation between the frequency ratio of two colors and the number density is not sensitive to the parameters of small frequency chirp added in either low frequency strong field or high frequency weak field but sensitive to the parameters of large frequency chirp added in high frequency weak field.

abstract: We demonstrate an experimental method for measuring energy-time entanglement over almost 80 nm spectral bandwidth in a single shot with a quantum bit error rate below 0.5%. Our scheme is extremely cost-effective and efficient in terms of resources as it employs only one source of entangled photons and one fixed unbalanced interferometer per phase-coded analysis basis. We show that the maximum analysis spectral bandwidth is obtained when the analysis interferometers are properly unbalanced, a strategy which can be straightforwardly applied to most of today's experiments based on energy-time and time-bin entanglement. Our scheme has therefore a great potential for boosting bit rates and reducing the resource overhead of future entanglement-based quantum key distribution systems.

abstract: In the Leggett-Garg approach to testing macrorealism, the two-time correlation functions, which are normally obtained by sequential measurements of a bivalent variable Q, need to be measured in a non-invasive way in order to exclude certain types of alternative classical explanation. Here, it is shown that the correlation functions are readily expressed in terms of a time integral of the velocity corresponding to Q and that expressions of this type can be determined from a single final-time measurement of an auxiliary system in continual weak interaction with the primary system. It is argued in macrorealistic terms that the measurement can be done non-invasively and that this protocol is a natural analogue, for measurements continuous in time, of an ideal negative measurement. It is also argued that, for a suitably chosen initial state, the quantum account of this measurement process is also non-invasive.

abstract: There is current interest in investigating which variables play an important role in the physical processes with an open composite quan- tum system that ranges from the foundational issues to the tasks of diverse applications in quantum physics and technology. In this paper we contrast the local versus the collective classical-like behavior of a pair of interacting qubits immersed in the mutually independent thermal baths. The qubits can be locally subjected to any of the standard, microscopically modelled, generalized amplitude damping and phase damping channel, as well as to the recently introduced generalized depolarizing channel. As a criterion for the classical-like behavior we use the least entropy production, i.e. the total correlation in the system. The classical-like collective behavior is found for short time intervals for strongly interacting qubits. Only in a certain trivial case we observe the simultaneous collective and individual-qubits classical- ity. Observation (non-observation) of the collective (individual) classicality can reveal the kind and strength of the qubits interaction or the ratio of the qubits' energy-gaps, while manipulating the qubits interaction (by tuning the strength and/or refocussing) can give rise to the desired kind of classicality.

We show that in such a system, the cavity mode can effectively "inherit" parametric driving from the mechanics, yielding phase-sensitive amplification and squeezing of optical signals reflected from the cavity. We also demonstrate how such a system can be used to perform single-quadrature detection of a near-resonant narrow-band force applied to the mechanics with extremely low added noise from the optics. The system also exhibits strong differences from a conventional degenerate parametric amplifier: in particular, the cavity spectral function can become negative.

abstract: Implementing a qubit quantum computer in continuous-variable systems conventionally requires the engineering of specific interactions according to the encoding basis states. In this work, we present a unified formalism to conduct universal quantum computation with a fixed set of operations but arbitrary encoding. By storing a qubit in the parity of two or four qumodes, all computing processes can be implemented by basis state preparations, continuous-variable exponential-swap operations, and swap-tests. Our formalism inherits the advantages that the quantum information is decoupled from collective noise, and logical qubits with different encodings can be brought to interact without decoding. We also propose a possible implementation of the required operations by using interactions that are available in a variety of continuous-variable systems. Our work separates the `hardware' problem of engineering quantum-computing-universal interactions, from the `software' problem of designing encodings for specific purposes. The development of quantum computer architecture could hence be simplified.

abstract: When conducting a Bell test, it is normal to assume that the preparation of the quantum state is independent of the measurements performed on it. Remarkably, the violation of local realism by entangled quantum systems can be certified even if this assumption is partially relaxed. Here, we allow such measurement dependence to correlate multiple runs of the experiment, going beyond previous studies that considered independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) runs. To do so, we study the polytope that defines block-i.i.d. measurement-dependent local models. We prove that non-i.i.d. models are strictly more powerful than i.i.d. ones, and comment on the relevance of this work for the study of randomness amplification in simple Bell scenarios with suitably optimised inequalities.

abstract: We address a molecular dissociation mechanism that is known to occur when a H 2 molecule approaches a catalyst with its molecular axis parallel to the surface. It is found that molecular dissociation is a form of quantum dynamical phase transition associated to an ana- lytic discontinuity of quite unusual nature: the molecule is destabilized by the transition from non-physical virtual states into actual local- ized states. Current description complements our recent results for a molecule approaching the catalyst with its molecular axis perpendicu- lar to the surface. Also, such a description can be seen as a further successful implementation of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in a well defined model.

abstract: The motion of a neutral atom endowed with a magnetic moment interacting with the magnetic field is determined from the Ehrenfest-like equations of motion. These equations for the average values of the translational and spin degrees of freedom are derived from the Schr\"odinger-Pauli wave equation and they form a set of nine coupled nonlinear evolution equations. The numerical and analytic solutions of these equations are obtained for the combination of the rotating magnetic field of a wave carrying orbital angular momentum and a static magnetic field. The running wave traps the atom only in the transverse direction while the standing wave traps the atom also in the direction of the beam.

abstract: We perform an analytical study of the energy and entanglement spectrum of non-interacting fermionic bilayer honeycomb lattices in the presence of trigonal warping in the energy spectrum, on-site energy difference and uniform magnetic field. Employing single particle correlation functions, we present an explicit form for layer-layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is entanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping, at zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between entanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of monolayer which means that the entanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the bilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect correspondence, however, in $\Gamma$-K direction in hexagonal Brillouin zone, their behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping parameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of entanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We also study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the entanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and on-site energy difference. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum versus magnetic flux has a self similar fractal structure, known Hofstadter butterfly. Our results also show that the on-site energy difference causes a transition from the Hofstadter butterfly to a tree-like picture.

abstract: Contextuality in quantum physics provides a key resource for quantum information and computation. The topological approach in [Abramsky and Brandenburger, New J. Phys., 2011, Abramsky et al., CSL 2015, 2015] characterizes contextuality as "global inconsistency" coupled with "local consistency", revealing it to be a phenomenon also found in many other fields. This has yielded a logical method of detecting and proving the "global inconsistency" part of contextuality. Our goal is to capture the other, "local consistency" part, which requires a novel approach to logic that is sensitive to the topology of contexts. To achieve this, we formulate a logic of local inference by using context-sensitive theories and models in regular categories. This provides a uniform framework for local consistency, and lays a foundation for high-level methods of detecting, proving, and moreover using contextuality as computational resource.

abstract: We show that any non-radiating source can be represented by a combination of identical, spatially localized distributions of electric and toroidal point dipoles. One of the implications is that at every point of an arbitrary non-radiating source there exists a simple universal relation between the electric and toroidal dipole moments. We also present simple means of describing non-radiating sources and discuss a possible scenario for observing the time-dependent version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in such systems.

abstract: We study the composition question for bounded-error randomized query complexity: Is R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) R(g)) for all Boolean functions f and g? We show that inserting a simple Boolean function h, whose query complexity is only Theta(log R(g)), in between f and g allows us to prove R(f o h o g) = Omega(R(f) R(h) R(g)). We prove this using a new lower bound measure for randomized query complexity we call randomized sabotage complexity, RS(f). Randomized sabotage complexity has several desirable properties, such as a perfect composition theorem, RS(f o g) >= RS(f) RS(g), and a composition theorem with randomized query complexity, R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for total functions and can be quadratically superior to the partition bound, the best known general lower bound for randomized query complexity. Using this technique we also show implications for lifting theorems in communication complexity. We show that a general lifting theorem for zero-error randomized protocols implies a general lifting theorem for bounded-error protocols.

It is shown that it leads to breakdown of relativistic invariant properly defined objective realism. The argument does not rely on Bell theorem but direct analysis of invariance and positivity of objective correlations in quantum field theory.

abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis implies that for a thermodynamically large system in one of its eigenstates, the reduced density matrix describing any finite subsystem is determined solely by a set of {\it relevant} conserved quantities. In a generic system, only the energy plays that role and hence eigenstates appear locally thermal. Integrable systems, on the other hand, possess an extensive number of such conserved quantities and hence the reduced density matrix requires specification of an infinite number of parameters (Generalized Gibbs Ensemble). However, here we show by unbiased statistical sampling of the individual eigenstates with a given finite energy density, that the local description of an overwhelming majority of these states of even such an integrable system is actually Gibbs-like, i.e. requires only the energy density of the eigenstate. Rare eigenstates that cannot be represented by the Gibbs ensemble can also be sampled efficiently by our method and their local properties are then shown to be described by appropriately {\it truncated} Generalized Gibbs Ensembles. We further show that the presence of these rare eigenstates differentiates the model from the generic (non-integrable) case and leads to the system being described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble at long time under a unitary dynamics following a sudden quench, even when the initial state is a Gibbs-like eigenstate of the pre-quench Hamiltonian.

abstract: A method is presented for achieving entanglement-free teleportation of a quantum state subject to any quantum noise. We apply this as a light-speed noise-resistant communicator, but also treat the possibility of a quantum ansible, a device for effectively superluminal communication and quantum broadcasting. The results suggest a "no-projector theorem" analogous to the no-cloning theorem. We then show how to build a pseudo-ansible for connection-free light-speed communication.

abstract: We discuss the statistics of emission of photons by a single atom or ion illuminated by a laser beam at the frequency of quasi-resonance between two energy levels, a situation that corresponds to real experiments. We extend this to the case of two laser beams resonant with the energy differences between two excited levels and the ground state (three level atom in V-configuration). We use a novel approach of this type of problem by considering Kolmogorov equation for the probability distribution of the atomic state which takes into account first the deterministic evolution of this state under the effect of the incoming laser beam and the random emission of photons during the spontaneous decay of the excited state(s) to the ground state. This approach yields solvable equations in the two level atom case. For the three level atom case we set the problem and define clearly its frame. The results obtained are valid both in the opposite limits of rare and of frequent spontaneous decay, compared to the period of the optical Rabi oscillations due to the interaction between the resonant excitation and the atomic levels. Our theory gives access to various statistical properties of the fluorescence light, including one showing that its fluctuations in time are not invariants under time reversal. This result puts in evidence the fundamentally irreversible character of quantum measurements, represented here by the emission of photons of fluorescence.

abstract: Vacuum birefringence is one of the most striking predictions of strong field quantum electrodynamics: Probe photons traversing a strong field region can indirectly sense the applied "pump" electromagnetic field via quantum fluctuations of virtual charged particles which couple to both pump and probe fields. This coupling is sensitive to the field alignment and can effectively result in two different indices of refraction for the probe photon polarization modes giving rise to a birefringence phenomenon. In this article we perform a dedicated theoretical analysis of the proposed discovery experiment of vacuum birefringence at a x-ray free electron laser/optical high-intensity laser facility. Describing both pump and probe laser pulses realistically in terms of their macroscopic electromagnetic fields, we go beyond previous analyses by accounting for various effects not considered before in this context. Our study facilitates stringent quantitative predictions and optimizations of the signal in an actual experiment.
