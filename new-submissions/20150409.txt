abstract: We experimentally observed nonlinear variations in the three-vertex geometric phase in a two- photon polarization qutrit. The three-vertex geometric phase is defined by three quantum states, which generally forms a three-state (qutrit) system. By changing one of the three constituent states, we observed two rapid increases in the three-vertex geometric phase. The observed variations are inherent in a three-state system and cannot be observed in a two-state system. We used a time-reversed two-photon interferometer to measure the geometric phase with much more intense signals than those of a typical two-photon interferometer.

abstract: Using the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound from quantum estimation theory, we derive a fundamental quantum limit on the sensitivity of a temperature measurement of a thermal astronomical source. This limit is expressed in terms of the source temperature $T_s$, input spectral bandwidth $\Delta \nu$, and measurement duration $T$, subject to a long measurement time assumption $T\Delta \nu \gg 1$. It is valid for any measurement procedure that yields an unbiased estimate of the source temperature. The limit agrees with the sensitivity of direct detection or photon counting, and also with that of the ideal radiometer in the regime $kT_s/h \nu_0\gg 1$ for which the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation is valid, where $\nu_0$ is the center frequency at which the radiometer operates. While valid across the electromagnetic spectrum, the limit is especially relevant for radio astronomy in this regime, since it implies that no ingenious design or technological improvement can beat an ideal radiometer for temperature measurement. In this connection, our result refutes the recent claim of a radio astronomy technique with much-improved sensitivity over the radiometer (Lieu et al. 2015).

abstract: The practical prospect of quantum communication and information processing relies on sophisticated single photon pairs which feature controllable waveform, narrow spectrum, excellent purity, fiber compatibility and miniaturized design. For practical realizations, stable, miniaturized, low-cost devices are required. Sources with one or some of above performances have been demonstrated already, but it is quite challenging to have a source with all of the described characteristics simultaneously. Here we report on an integrated single-longitudinal-mode non-degenerate narrowband photon pair source, which exhibits all requirements needed for quantum applications. The device is composed of a periodically poled Ti-indiffused lithium niobate waveguide with high reflective dielectric mirror coatings deposited on the waveguide end-faces. Photon pairs with wavelengths around 890 nm and 1320 nm are generated via type II phase-matched parametric down-conversion. Clustering in this dispersive cavity restricts the whole conversion spectrum to one single-longitudinal-mode in a single cluster yielding a narrow bandwidth of only 60 MHz. The high conversion efficiency in the waveguide, together with the spectral clustering in the doubly resonant waveguide, leads to a high brightness of $3\times10^4~$pairs/(s$\cdot$mW$\cdot$MHz). This source exhibits prominent single-longitudinal-mode purity and remarkable temporal shaping capability. Especially, due to temporal broadening, we can observe that the coherence time of the two-photon component of PDC state is actually longer than the one of the single photon states. The miniaturized monolithic design makes this source have various fiber communication applications.

abstract: This paper presents a generalization of probability theory and inferring structures in a field of quantum information theory. First, the formalism of quantum information theory is introduced. Next, quantum theory is used to define a quantum conditional operators which are fundamental in describing quantum inferring structures. The result of reasoning performance over the structures was presented in a Monty Hall game. The experiment shows that entanglement of quantum states has influence on optimal behaviour of player in the game.

abstract: We realize on an Atom-Chip a practical, experimentally undemanding, tomographic reconstruction algorithm relying on the time-resolved measurements of the atomic population distribution among atomic internal states. More specifically, we estimate both the state density matrix as well as the dephasing noise present in our system by assuming complete knowledge of the Hamiltonian evolution. The proposed scheme is based on routinely performed measurements and established experimental procedures, hence providing a simplified methodology for quantum technological applications.

abstract: In the absence of decay, the conditional dynamics for an opensystem is often describable by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This study investigates spin squeezing (SS) in non-Hermitian one-axis twisting (OAT) model. Somewhat surprisingly, SS close to the limit of Hermitian two-axis counter twisting (TACT) Hamiltonian is achievable for some parameters, which significantly improves upon the optimal value realizable by Hermitian OAT model. The drawback is like with all conditional schemes, it takes on average longer time to evolve into steady state, and the probability of no decay or success decreases as number of atoms (spins) increases. The result above for steady state SS in non-Hermitian OAT Hamiltonian is thus limited to small systems. For other parameter regimes, however, desirable SS arrives dynamically before steady state is achieved, with greatly shortened evolution time and enhanced probability of success, while still remain significantly improved over the limit of Hermitian OAT.

abstract: Quasiprobability distributions (QDs) in open quantum systems are investigated for $SU(2)$, spin like systems, having relevance to quantum optics and information. In this work, effect of both quantum non-demolition (QND) and dissipative open quantum systems, on the evolution of a number of spin QDs are investigated. Specifically, compact analytic expressions for the $W$, $P$, $Q$, and $F$ functions are obtained for some interesting single, two and three qubit states, undergoing general open system evolutions. Further, corresponding QDs are reported for an N qubit Dicke model and a spin-1 system. The existence of nonclassical characteristics are observed in all the systems investigated here. The study leads to a clear understanding of quantum to classical transition in a host of realistic physical scenarios. Variation of the amount of nonclassicality observed in the quantum systems, studied here,are also investigated using nonclassical volume.

D 68, 1 (2014)], Hou et al. present, using Tsallis' entropy, possible generalizations of the quantum discord measure, finding original results. As for the mutual informations and discord, we show here that these two types of quantifiers can take negative values. In the two qubits instance we further determine in which regions they are non-negative. Additionally, we study alternative generalizations on the basis of R\'enyi entropies.

abstract: Fisher's information measure plays a very important role in diverse areas of theoretical physics. The associated measures as functionals of quantum probability distributions defined in, respectively, coordinate and momentum spaces, are the protagonists of our present considerations. The product of them has been conjectured to exhibit a non trivial lower bound in [Phys. Rev. A (2000) 62 012107]. We show here that such is not the case. This is illustrated, in particular, for pure states that are solutions to the free-particle Schr\"odinger equation. In fact, we construct a family of counterexamples to the conjecture, corresponding to time-dependent solutions of the free-particle Schr\"odinger equation. We also give a new conjecture regarding any normalizable time-dependent solution of this equation.

abstract: Li and Luo [Phys. Rev. A 78 (2008), 024303] discovered a remarkable relation between discord and entanglement. It establishes that all separable states can be obtained via reduction of a classicaly-correlated state "living" in a space of larger dimension. Starting from this result, we discuss here an optimal classical extension of separable states and explore this notion for low-dimensional systems. We find that the larger the dimension of the classical extension, the larger the discord in the original separable state. Further, we analyze separable states of maximum discord of two qubits, and their associated classical extensions.

abstract: We propose a totally corrective boosting algorithm with explicit cardinality regularization. The resulting combinatorial optimization problems are not known to be efficiently solvable with existing classical methods, but emerging quantum optimization technology gives hope for achieving sparser models in practice. In order to demonstrate the utility of our algorithm, we use a distributed classical heuristic optimizer as a stand-in for quantum hardware. Even though this evaluation methodology incurs large time and resource costs on classical computing machinery, it allows us to gauge the potential gains in generalization performance and sparsity of the resulting boosted ensembles. Our experimental results on public data sets commonly used for benchmarking of boosting algorithms decidedly demonstrate the existence of such advantages. If actual quantum optimization were to be used with this algorithm in the future, we would expect equivalent or superior results at much smaller time and energy costs during training. Moreover, studying cardinality-penalized boosting also sheds light on why unregularized boosting algorithms with early stopping often yield better results than their counterparts with explicit convex regularization: Early stopping performs suboptimal cardinality regularization. The results that we present here indicate it is beneficial to explicitly solve the combinatorial problem still left open at early termination.

abstract: We propose a trapped ion scheme en route to realize spin Hamiltonians on a Kagome lattice which, at low energies, are described by emergent Z2 gauge fields, and support a topological quantum spin liquid ground state. The enabling element in our scheme is the hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions in a 2D ion crystal. For this, the phonon-mode spectrum of the crystal is engineered by standing-wave optical potentials or by using Rydberg excited ions, thus generating localized phonon-modes around a hexagon of ions selected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can mediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when subject to state-dependent optical dipole forces. We discuss how these interactions can be employed to emulate a generalized Balents-Fisher-Girvin model in minimal instances of one and two plaquettes. This model is an archetypical Hamiltonian in which gauge fields are the emergent degrees of freedom on top of the classical ground state manifold. Under realistic situations, we show the emergence of a discrete Gauss's law as well as the dynamics of a deconfined charge excitation on a gauge-invariant background using the two-plaquettes trapped ions spin-system. The proposed scheme in principle allows further scaling in a future trapped ion quantum simulator, and we conclude that our work will pave the way towards the simulation of emergent gauge theories and quantum spin liquids in trapped ion systems.

abstract: In a multi-terminal setup, when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic field, the heat flows can be managed by designing a device with programmable Boolean behavior. We show that such device can be used to implement operations like on/off switching, reversal, selected splitting and swap of the heat currents. For each feature, the switching from one working condition to the other is obtained by inverting the magnetic field. This offers interesting opportunities of conceiving a programmable setup, whose operation is controlled by an external parameter (the magnetic field) without need to alter voltage and thermal biases applied to the system. Our results, generic within the framework of linear response, are illustrated by means of a three-terminal electronic interferometer model.

The wave functions have been expressed by hypergeometric functions via the functional analysis approach. An extension to rotational-vibrational energy eigenvalues of some diatomic molecules are also presented. It is shown that the calculated energy levels are in good agreement with the ones obtained previously $E_{n\ell}-D$ (shifted Deng-Fan).

abstract: The three-dimensional potential equation, motivated by representations of quantum mechanics, is investigated in four different scenarios: (i) In the usual Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}_{3}$ where the potential is singular but invariant under the continuous inhomogeneous orthogonal group $\mathcal{I}O(3)$. The invariance under the translation subgroup is compared to the corresponding unitary transformation in the Schr\"{o}dinger representation of quantum mechanics. This scenario is well known but serves as a reference point for the other scenarios. (ii) Next, the discrete potential equation as a partial difference equation in a three-dimensional lattice space is studied. In this arena the potential is non-singular but invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$ is broken. This is the usual picture of lattice theories and numerical approximations. (iii) Next we study the six-dimensional continuous phase space. Here a phase space representation of quantum mechanics is utilized. The resulting potential is singular but possesses invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$. (iv) Finally, the potential is derived from the discrete phase space representation of quantum mechanics, which is shown to be an \emph{exact} representation of quantum mechanics. The potential function here is both non-singular and possesses invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$, and this is proved via the unitary transformations of quantum mechanics in this representation.

abstract: We investigate the transport of excitations through a chain of atoms with non-local dissipation introduced through coupling to additional short-lived states. The system is described by an effective spin-1/2 model where the ratio of the exchange interaction strength to the reservoir coupling strength determines the type of transport, including coherent exciton motion, incoherent hopping and a regime in which an emergent length scale leads to a preferred hopping distance far beyond nearest neighbors. For multiple impurities, the dissipation gives rise to strong nearest-neighbor correlations and entanglement. These results highlight the importance of non-trivial dissipation, correlations and many-body effects in recent experiments on the dipole-mediated transport of Rydberg excitations.

abstract: A seminal result of Cleve (STOC 1986) showed that fairness, in general, is impossible to achieve in case of two-party computation if one of them is malicious. Gordon et al. (STOC 2008) observed that there exist some functions for which fairness can be achieved even though one of the two parties is malicious. One of the functions considered by Gordon et al. is exactly the millionaires' problem (Yao, FOCS 1982) or, equivalently, the `greater than' function. The problem deals with two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who are interested in finding who amongst them is richer, without revealing their actual wealth to each other. We, for the first time, study this problem in presence of rational players. In particular, we show that Gordon's protocol no longer remains fair when the players are rational. Next, we design a protocol with rational players, that not only achieves fairness, but also achieves correctness and strict Nash equilibrium for natural utilities. We, also for the first time, provide a solution to the quantum version of millionaires' problem with rational players, and it too achieves fairness, correctness and strict Nash equilibrium. Both our classical and quantum protocols follow an unified approach; both uses an untrusted third party (UTP) and exploits the idea of interlocking system between the players, to prevent the deviating party to abort early. In both the protocols, we remove the requirement of the online dealer of Groce et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012).

abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum dot coupled to fermionic and bosonic environments, naturally occurring in electrical circuits. The fermionic environments consist of two electronic reservoir leads and the bosonic baths are either external impedances modeled as tunable transmission lines or LC resonators (single-mode cavities). The differing sizes of the zero-point fluctuations of the quantum vacuum break the spatial symmetry of the system if the quantum dot is coupled to two reservoirs or two junctions with different bosonic environments. We show how this permits the rectification of the electrical current in both non-resonant and resonant tunneling cases.
