abstract: We investigate the topology of Bogoliubov excitations in bosonic systems subjected to periodic driving. We show how to manipulate the topological phase and create edge states that are dynamically unstable while the bulk states are stable. As a consequence, the edge states get highly populated which can be used to detect them experimentally. We relate the topology to the existence of non-contractible curves in a stability diagram that can be constructed analytically from an effective Hamiltonian.

abstract: We study a tripartite system of coupled spins, where a first set of one or two spins is our central system which is coupled to another set considered, the near environment, in turn coupled to the third set, the far environment. The dynamics considered are those of a generalized kicked spin chain in the regime of quantum chaotic dynamics. This allows to test recent results that suggest that the presence of a far environment, coupled to the near environment, slows decoherence of the central system. After an extensive numerical study, we confirm previous results for extreme values and special cases. In particular, under a wide variety of circumstances an increasingly large coupling between near and far environment, slows decoherence, as measured by purity, and protects internal entanglement.

abstract: The estimation of the decoherence process of an open quantum system is of both theoretical significance and experimental appealing. Based on the coherence quantification method, we prove a simple factorization relation for the $l_1$ norm of coherence, and analyze under which condition this relation holds. We also obtain a more general relation which applies to arbitrary $N$-qubit state, and determine a condition for the transformation matrix of the quantum channel supporting permanently freezing of the $l_1$ norm of coherence. These results simplify determination of a general decoherence dynamics to that the investigation of the representative probe state.

abstract: The reservoir memory effects can lead to information backflow and recurrence of the previously lost quantum correlations. We establish connections between the direction of information flow and variation of the geometric quantum discords (GQDs) measured respectively by the trace distance, the Hellinger distance, and the Bures distance for two qubits subjecting to the bosonic structured reservoirs, and unveil their dependence on a factor whose derivative signifies the (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics. By considering the reservoirs with Lorentzian and Ohmic-like spectra, we further demonstrated that the non-Markovianity induced by the backflow of information from the reservoirs to the system enhances the GQDs in most of the parameter regions. This highlights the potential of non-Markovianity as a resource for protecting the GQDs.

abstract: We demonstrate a polarization-entangled photon-pair source obtained via a type-II non-collinear quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion process with a 10-mm periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystal, which is as bright, stable, and wavelength-tunable as the well-known Sagnac configuration scheme. A spectral brightness of 74 kHz/mW/nm is measured and a concurrence of 0.975 is estimated using quantum state tomography. Without loss of entanglement and brightness, the photon-pair wavelengths are tunable through control of the crystal temperature. This improvement is achieved using the non-collinear configuration and a stable interferometric distinguishability compensator.

abstract: In cavity optomechanics, radiation pressure and photothermal forces are widely utilized to cool and control micromechanical motion, with applications ranging from precision sensing and quantum information to fundamental science. Here, we realize an alternative approach to optical forcing based on superfluid flow and evaporation in response to optical heating. We demonstrate optical forcing of the motion of a cryogenic microtoroidal resonator at a level of 1.46 nN, roughly one order of magnitude larger than the radiation pressure force. We use this force to feedback cool the motion of a microtoroid mechanical mode to 137 mK. The photoconvective forces demonstrated here provide a new tool for high bandwidth control of mechanical motion in cryogenic conditions, and have the potential to allow efficient transfer of electromagnetic energy to motional kinetic energy.

abstract: We propose a fast phase-gating of a single nuclear spin, which interacts with the single electronic spin of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Our gate operation is to be called the geometric quantum gate; a geometric phase shift of the electron spin induced by the rotating electric field, is utilized to control the nuclear-spin phase. The gate time is inversely proportional to the frequency of the electric-field rotation; we estimate that the phase-gate time is orders shorter than hitherto reported. We also show the robustness against decoherence and systematic errors.

abstract: Quasi Whispering Gallery photon modes of a 5mm diameter YIG sphere loaded in a cylindrical cavity in the 10-30GHz frequency range are characterised as a function of applied DC magnetic field at millikelvin temperatures. The photon modes are confined mainly to the sphere, and exhibited large mode filling factors in comparison to previous experiments, allowing ultrastrong coupling with magnon spin wave resonances of the YIG sphere. The largest observed coupling between photons and magnons is $2g/2\pi=7.11$ GHz for a 15.5 GHz mode, corresponding to a cooperativity of $C=1.51\pm0.47\times10^7$. Deviation of magnon-photon interaction from predicted two oscillator model is observed at low magnetic fields. Between 0.4 to 1 Tesla degenerate resonant photon modes were observed to interact with magnon spin wave resonaces with different couplings strengths, indicating time reversal symmetry breaking due to the gyrotropic permeability of YIG. Bare photon mode frequencies were determined by detuning magnon modes to significantly higher frequencies with strong magnetic fields. By comparing measured mode frequencies at 7 Tesla with Finite Element modelling, a bare dielectric permittivity of $15.96\pm0.02$ of the YIG crystal has been determined at about $20$ mK.

abstract: Microscopic Hamiltonian models of the composite system "open system + environment" typically do not provide the operator-sum Kraus form but a differential (master equation) form of the open system's dynamical map. Due to the recently developed method [Andersson et al, J. Mod. Opt. \textbf{54}, 1695 (2007)], we derive the novel, generalized Kraus operators starting from the microscopic master equation for the one-qubit depolarizing quantum channel, for high temperature of the thermal bath. The proper choice of the composite system's parameters gives rise to reducing the Kraus operators to the standard counterparts that are widely used in the literature. Comparison of the standard and the here obtained channels is performed via investigating dynamical change of the Bloch sphere volume, entropy production and the open system's state trace distance. We find that the standard channel is more deteriorating than the generalized one. We do not obtain new Kraus operators for the amplitude damping and the phase damping channels.

abstract: We discuss dynamical response theory of driven-dissipative quantum systems described by Markovian Master Equations generating semi-groups of maps. In this setting thermal equilibrium states are replaced by non-equilibrium steady states and dissipative perturbations are considered besides the Hamiltonian ones. We derive explicit expressions for the linear dynamical response functions for generalized dephasing channels and for Davies thermalizing generators. We introduce the notion of maximal harmonic response and compute it exactly for a single qubit channel. Finally, we analyze linear response near dynamical phase transitions in quasi-free open quantum systems. It is found that the effect of the dynamical phase transition shows up in a peak at the edge of the spectrum in the imaginary part of the dynamical response function.

abstract: We introduce an intuitive and analytical polaron master equation approach to model pulse-driven population inversion and emitted single photons from a quantum dot exciton. The master equation theory allows one to identify important phonon-induced scattering rates analytically, and fully includes the role of the time-dependent pump field. As an application of the theory, we first study a quantum dot driven by a time-varying laser pulse on and off resonance, showing the population inversion caused by acoustic phonon emission in direct agreement with recent experiments. We also model quantum dots in weakly coupled cavities and show the difference in population response between exciton-driven and cavity-driven systems. Finally, we assess the nonresonant phonon-assisted loading scheme with a quantum dot resonantly coupled to a cavity as a deterministic single photon source, and compare and contrast the important figures of merit with direct Rabi oscillation of the population using a resonant $\pi$ pulse.

abstract: We characterize the entropy production and the maximal extractable work from a squeezed thermal reservoir. The nonequilibrium quantum nature of the reservoir induces an entropy transfer with a coherent contribution while modifying its thermal part, allowing work extraction from a single reservoir, as well as great improvements in power and efficiency for quantum heat engines, which are characterized. Introducing a modified quantum Otto cycle, we predict the appearance of operational regimes forbidden in the standard case, such as refrigeration and work extraction at the same time, accompanied by efficiencies equal to unity.

abstract: Extended Clifford circuits straddle the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Whether such circuits are efficiently classically simulable seems to depend delicately on the ingredients of the circuits. While some combinations of ingredients lead to efficiently classically simulable circuits, other combinations that might just be slightly different, lead to circuits which are likely not. We extend the results of Jozsa and Van den Nest (arXiv:1305.6190) by studying two further extensions of Clifford circuits. Firstly, we consider how the classical simulation complexity changes when we allow for more general measurements. Secondly, we investigate different notions of what it means to "classically simulate" a quantum circuit. These further extensions give us 24 new combinations of ingredients compared to Jozsa and Van den Nest, and we give a complete classification of their classical simulation complexities. Our results provide more examples where seemingly modest changes to the ingredients of Clifford circuits lead to large changes in the classical simulation complexity under plausible complexity assumptions.

abstract: Since general relativity is a consistent low energy effective field theory, it is possible to compute quantum corrections to classical forces. Here we compute a quantum correction to the gravitational potential between a pair of polarizable objects. We study two distant bodies and compute a quantum force from their induced quadrupole moments due to two graviton exchange. The effect is in close analogy to the Casimir-Polder and London-van der Waals forces between a pair of atoms from their induced dipole moments due to two photon exchange. The new effect is computed from the shift in vacuum energy of metric fluctuations due to the polarizability of the objects. We compute the potential energy at arbitrary distances compared to the wavelengths in the system, including the far and near regimes. In the far distance, or retarded, regime, the potential energy takes on a particularly simple form: $V(r)=-3987\,\hbar\,c\,G^2\alpha_{1S}\,\alpha_{2S}/(4\,\pi\,r^{11})$, where $\alpha_{1S},\,\alpha_{2S}$ are the static gravitational quadrupole polarizabilities of each object. We provide estimates of this effect.

abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases exhibit nontrivial order if symmetry is respected but are adiabatically connected to the trivial product phase if symmetry is not respected. However, unlike the symmetry-breaking phase, there is no local order parameter for SPT phases. Here we employ a tensor-network method to compute the topological invariants characterized by the simulated modular $S$ and $T$ matrices to study transitions in a few families of two-dimensional (2D) wavefunctions which are $\mathbb{Z}_N$ ($N=2\, \&3$) symmetric. We find that in addition to the topologically ordered phases, the modular matrices can be used to identify nontrivial SPT phases and detect transitions between different SPT phases as well as between symmetric and symmetry-breaking phases. Therefore, modular matrices can be used to characterize various types of gapped phases in a unifying way.
