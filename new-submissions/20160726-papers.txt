abstract: When one seeks knowledge of the full dynamics of the displacement of a harmonic oscillator, non-commutation of the two mechanical quadratures requires a minimum added noise equal to the mechanical resonator's zero point motion. This fundamental quantum limit (QL) is a distinct bound from the standard quantum limit (SQL) that is often considered in interferometric displacement measurement. The SQL is a consequence of the non-commutation of the probe's quadratures in a specific measurement configuration and is characterized by a tradeoff between shot noise (SN) imprecision and quantum backaction that are uncorrelated. The QL and SQL reach the same limit when probing at the peak mechanical response, but the QL can be a significantly lower bound off resonance. In studies of micro-mechanical motion, there has been great interest in observing quantum backaction and approaching the SQL on mechanical resonance. However, much of what historically motivates SQL research is displacement monitoring over a wide frequency band, such as gravitational wave searches. One long-standing concept for surpassing the SQL is to introduce correlations by changing the readout quadrature as a function of frequency in a technique known as variational readout. Here we harness quantum correlations in the measurement of a macroscopic resonator by modifying the readout quadrature of an optical interferometer. By using an optomechanical device thermalized to a dilution refrigerator, we measure quantum noise far off resonance where we improve upon the off-resonance SQL for our quantum efficiency.

abstract: If a one-phrase summary of the subject of this thesis were required, it would be something like: miscellaneous large (but finite) dimensional phenomena in quantum information theory. That said, it could nonetheless be helpful to briefly elaborate. Starting from the observation that quantum physics unavoidably has to deal with high dimensional objects, basically two routes can be taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones, or try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge in this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to follow here, and rather oscillate between one and the other. In the first part of this manuscript, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the complexity of certain quantum processes, while of course still preserving their essential characteristics. The two types of processes we are interested in are quantum channels and quantum measurements. Oppositely, the second part of this manuscript is specifically dedicated to the analysis of high dimensional quantum systems and some of their typical features. Stress is put on multipartite systems and on entanglement-related properties of theirs. In the third part of this manuscript we eventually come back to a more dimensionality reduction state of mind. This time though, the strategy is to make use of the symmetries inherent to each particular situation we are looking at in order to derive a problem-dependent simplification.

abstract: Condensed matter physics has been driven forward by significant experimental and theoretical progress in the study and understanding of equilibrium phase transitions based on symmetry and topology. However, nonequilibrium phase transitions have remained a challenge, in part due to their complexity in theoretical descriptions and the additional experimental difficulties in systematically controlling systems out of equilibrium. Here, we study a one-dimensional chain of 72 microwave cavities, each coupled to a superconducting qubit, and coherently drive the system into a nonequilibrium steady state. We find experimental evidence for a dissipative phase transition in the system in which the steady state changes dramatically as the mean photon number is increased. Near the boundary between the two observed phases, the system demonstrates bistability, with characteristic switching times as long as 60 ms -- far longer than any of the intrinsic rates known for the system. This experiment demonstrates the power of circuit QED systems for studying nonequilibrium condensed matter physics and paves the way for future experiments exploring nonequilbrium physics with many-body quantum optics.

abstract: We use differential Ramsey interferometry of ultracold atoms to characterize the vector light shift (VLS) from a far-off resonance optical dipole trap at $\lambda = 1064\,\mathrm{nm}$. The VLS manifests as a `fictitious' magnetic field, which we perceive as a change in the Larmor frequency of two spinor condensates exposed to different intensities of elliptically polarized light. We use our measurement scheme to diagnose the light-induced magnetic field and suppress it to $2.1(8)\times10^{-4}$ of its maximum value, by making the trapping light linearly polarized with a quarter-wave plate in each beam. Our sensitive measurement of the VLS-induced field demonstrates high-precision, in-vacuo interferometric polarimetry of dipole trapping light and can be adapted to measure vector shifts from other lasers, advancing the application of optically trapped atoms to precision metrology.

These results use the i.i.d. model of the quantum noise. In this paper we consider quantum Gaussian signal+noise model with time-continuous stationary coloured noise. A proof of the coding theorem for the classical capacity of quantum broadband gauge-covariant Gaussian channels is given. We also discuss and compare the "broadband" and the "bandpass" models of time-continuous time-continuous stationary coloured noise.

Besides, signal amplification and signal-to-noise ratio enhancement can be achieved.

abstract: The exchange contribution to the energy of the hydrogen atom interacting with a proton is calculated from the polarization expansion of the wave function using the conventional surface-integral formula and two formulas involving volume integrals: the formula of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) and the variational formula recommended by us. At large internuclear distances $R$, all three formulas yield the correct expression $-(2/e)Re^{-R}$, but approximate it with very different convergence rates. In the case of the SAPT formula, the convergence is geometric with the error falling as $3^{-K}$, where $K$ is the order of the applied polarization expansion. The error of the surface-integral formula decreases exponentially as $a^K/(K+1)!$, where $a=\ln2 -\tfrac{1}{2}$. The variational formula performs best, its error decays as $K^{1/2} [a^{ K}/(K+1)!]^2$. These convergence rates are much faster than those resulting from approximating the wave function through the multipole expansion. This shows the efficiency of the partial resummation of the multipole series effected by the polarization expansion. Our results demonstrate also the benefits of incorporating the variational principle into the perturbation theory of molecular interactions.

abstract: The model of Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to the scalar field for finite time is studied. A systematic way of computing finite time corrections in various cases is suggested and nonperturbative in coupling constant effects like thermalization are discussed. It is shown in particular that adiabatic switching off the coupling between the detector and the thermal bath leaves non-vanishing corrections to the detector's levels distribution. Considering the two level detector as an information bearing degree of freedom encoding one bit of information, limits on external work for the detector's (de)couling in finite time following from the Landauer's bound are formulated.

abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the nonstationary circuit QED setup in which $N$ independent qubits interact with a single mode of the Electromagnetic field confined in a resonator. We consider the harmonic time modulation of some parameter (atomic transition frequency or the atom-field coupling strength) and derive the unitary dynamics up to the second order in the modulation depth for $N=1$ and $N\gg 1$. It is shown that all the resonant phenomena that occur for modulation frequencies $\sim 2\omega _{0}$ (where $\omega _{0}$ is the cavity frequency) also occur for the halved frequencies. However, in the latter case the associated transition rates are significantly smaller and the modulation of the coupling strength is less effective. The transition rates are evaluated explicitly and the prospects of employing the second-order resonances in the phenomena related to the dynamical Casimir effect are examined.

abstract: This study explores a new security problem existing in various state-of-the-art quantum private comparison (QPC) protocols, where a malicious third-party (TP) announces fake comparison (or intermediate) results. In this case, the participants could eventually be led to a wrong direction and the QPC will become fraudulent. In order to resolve this problem, a new level of trustworthiness for TP is defined and a new QPC protocol is proposed, where a second TP is introduced to monitor the first one. Once a TP announces a fake comparison (or intermediate) result, participants can detect the fraud immediately. Besides, due to the introduction of the second TP, the proposed protocol allows strangers to compare their secrets privately, whereas the state-of-the-art QPCs require the involved clients to know each other before running the protocol.

In this paper, we present efficient quantum circuits to implement circulant operators using fewer resources and with lower complexity than existing methods. Moreover, our quantum circuits can be readily extended to the implementation of Toeplitz, Hankel, and block circulant matrices. Efficient quantum algorithms to implement the inverses and products of circulant operators are also provided.

abstract: We present a novel scheme for controlled quantum secure communication (CQSC) using GHZ-like state. In this scheme, a trusted controller assists the users for achieving secure transmission of data between them. The dense coding technique is exploited to increase the qubit efficiency and we show that the proposed scheme is immune against common eavesdropping attacks. We show how the method can be generalized to include N controllers using sets of GHZ-like states shared among the controllers and users. In this process entanglement swapping and single particle measurements are performed by the controllers to relax their controls and the users get entangled in Bell states.

abstract: Several nonclassical effects displayed by wave packets subject to generic nonlinear Hamiltonians can be identified and assessed directly from tomograms without attempting to reconstruct the Wigner function or the density matrix explicitly. We have demonstrated this for both single-mode and bipartite systems. We have shown that a wide spectrum of effects such as the revival phenomena, quadrature squeezing and Hong-Mandel and Hillery type higher-order squeezing in both the single-mode system and the double-well Bose-Einstein condensate can be obtained from appropriate tomograms in a straightforward manner. We have investigated entropic squeezing of the subsystem state of a bipartite system as it evolves in time, solely from tomograms. Further we have identified a quantifier of the extent of entanglement between subsystems which can be readily obtained from the tomogram and which mirrors the qualitative behavior of other measures of entanglement such as the subsystem von Neumann entropy and the subsystem linear entropy. The procedures that we have demonstrated can be readily adapted to multimode systems.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of a subset of interacting bosons in a subspace of fixed particle number is described in terms of symmetrized many-particle states. A suitable partial trace operation over the von Neumann equation of an $N$-particle system produces a hierarchical expansion for the subdynamics of $M\leq N$ particles. Truncating this hierarchy with a pure product state ansatz yields the general, nonlinear coherent mean-field equation of motion. In the special case of a contact interaction potential, this reproduces the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. To account for incoherent effects on top of the mean-field evolution, we discuss possible extensions towards a second-order perturbation theory that accounts for interaction-induced decoherence in form of a nonlinear Lindblad-type master equation.

abstract: We show the emergence of spontaneous synchronization between a pair of detuned quantum oscillators within a harmonic network. Our model does not involve any nonlinearity, driving or external dissipation, thus providing the simplest scenario for the occurrence of local coherent dynamics in an extended harmonic system. A sufficient condition for synchronization is established building upon the Rayleigh's normal modes approach to vibrational systems. Our results show that mechanisms favoring synchronization, even between uncoupled oscillators, are transient energy depletion and cross-talk. We also address the possible build-up of quantum correlations during synchronization and show that indeed entanglement may be generated in our detuned systems starting from uncorrelated states and without any direct coupling between the two oscillators.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a proposal [Phys. Rev. A 87, 052325 (2013)] of a scheme for robust distribution of polarization entangled photon pairs over collective noisy channels having the reciprocity. Although the scheme employs the robustness of two qubit decoherence-free subspace, by utilizing the forward propagation of one half of the entangled photons and the backward propagation of a classical reference light, it achieves an entanglement-sharing rate proportional to the transmittance of the quantum channel for the signal photon. We experimentally observed the efficient sharing rate while keeping a highly entangled state after the transmission. We also show that the protection method is applicable to transmission of arbitrary polarization state of a single photon.

abstract: We argue that one of the cases that is intended to trivialize the standard uncertainty product inequality also trivializes the recently-introduced host of alternatives involving sums of variances. A critical discussion on the experimental justifications of some of the relations using qutrit and qubit states is presented. Additionally, we study how the traditional uncertainty product inequality may be modified to handle the most frustrating situation. The sum-form inequalities are also simplified along similar lines. In favorable circumstances, a simple bypass in function space is obtained by virtue of symmetry that does not seem to have any obvious analog in the vector-space language.

abstract: The sensitivity properties of an SU(1,1) interferometer made of two cascaded parametric amplifiers, as well as of an ordinary SU(2) interferometer preceded by a squeezer and followed by an anti-squeezer, are theoretically investigated. Several possible experimental configurations are considered, such as the absence or presence of a seed beam, direct or homodyne detection scheme. In all cases we formulate the optimal conditions to achieve phase super-sensitivity, meaning a sensitivity overcoming the shot-noise limit. We show that for a given gain of the first parametric amplifier, unbalancing the interferometer by increasing the gain of the second amplifier improves the interferometer properties. In particular, a broader super-sensitivity phase range and a better overall sensitivity can be achieved by gain unbalancing.

abstract: Intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) cameras are widely used in various applications such as microscopy, astronomy, spectroscopy. Often they are used as single-photon detectors, with thresholding being an essential part of the readout. In this paper, we measure the quantum efficiency of an ICCD camera in the single-photon detection mode using the Klyshko absolute calibration technique. The quantum efficiency is obtained as a function of the threshold value and of the wavelength of the detected light. In addition, we study the homogeneity of the photon sensitivity over the camera chip area. The experiment is performed in the autonomous regime, without using any additional detectors. We therefore demonstrate the self-calibration of an ICCD camera.

abstract: In this paper we describe a method for finding polynomial invariants under Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication (SLOCC), for a system of delocalized fermions shared between different parties, with global particle number conservation as the only constraint. These invariants can be used to construct entanglement measures for different types of entanglement in such a system. It is shown that the invariants, and the measures constructed from them, take a nonzero value only if the state of the system allows for the observation of Bell-nonlocal correlations. Invariants of this kind are constructed for systems of two and three spin-1/2 fermions and examples of maximally entangled states are given that illustrate the different types of entanglement distinguished by the invariants. A general condition for the existence of SLOCC invariants and their associated measures is given as a relation between the number of fermions, their spin, and the number of spatial modes of the system. In addition, the effect of further constraints on the system, including the localization of a subset of the fermions, is discussed. Finally, a hybrid Ising-Hubbard Hamiltonian is constructed for which the groundstate of a three site chain exhibits a high degree of entanglement at the transition between a regime dominated by on-site interaction and a regime dominated by Ising-interaction. This entanglement is well described by a measure constructed by the introduced method.

abstract: In molecular photodissociation, some specific combinations of laser parameters (wavelength and intensity) lead to unexpected Zero-Width Resonances (ZWR), with in principle infinite lifetimes. Their interest in inducing basic quenching mechanisms have recently been devised in the laser control of vibrational cooling through filtration strategies [O. Atabek et al., Phys. Rev. A87, 031403(R) (2013)]. A full quantum adiabatic control theory based on the adiabatic Floquet Hamiltonian is developed to show how a laser pulse could be envelop-shaped and frequency-chirped so as to protect a given initial vibrational state against dissociation, taking advantage from its continuous transport on the corresponding ZWR, all along the pulse duration. As compared with previous control scenarios actually suffering from non-adiabatic contamination, drastically different and much more efficient filtration goals are achieved. A semiclassical analysis helps in finding and interpreting a complete map of ZWRs in the laser parameter plane. In addition, the choice of a given ZWR path, among the complete series identified by the semiclassical approach, amounts to be crucial for the cooling scheme, targeting a single vibrational state population left at the end of the pulse, while all others have almost completely decayed. The illustrative example, offering the potentiality to be transposed to other diatomics, is Na2 prepared by photoassociation in vibrationally hot but translationally and rotationally cold states.

abstract: The ability to perform computations on encrypted data is a powerful tool for protecting a client's privacy, especially in today's era of cloud and distributed computing. In terms of privacy, the best solutions that classical techniques can achieve are unfortunately not unconditionally secure in the sense that they are dependent on a hacker's computational power. Here we theoretically investigate, and experimentally demonstrate with Gaussian displacement and squeezing operations, a quantum solution that achieves the unconditional security of a user's privacy using the practical technology of continuous variables. We demonstrate losses of up to 10 km both ways between the client and the server and show that security can still be achieved. Our approach offers a number of practical benefits, which can ultimately allow for the potential widespread adoption of this quantum technology in future cloud-based computing networks.

abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a wave packet passing through two different nonlinear media. The effect of dissipation on the known phenomenon of collapses and revivals of a wave packet as it evolves in a Kerr type nonlinear medium represented by the Hamiltonian $({a}^{\dag} a)^2$ is investigated. We find that partial revivals do take place when dissipation values are moderate. We consider the next order nonlinearity represented by the Hamiltonian $({a}^{\dag} a)^3$ where we observe the phenomena of super revivals. The effect of dissipation in this case has an additional feature of number dependence for the case of displaced number states. Overall our simulations show the robustness of the phenomena of collapses and revivals in a dissipative environment.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.05401
abstract: An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories is proposed. It is proved that the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy $\bar S_\alpha$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\alpha$ and $(\alpha-1)\bar S_\alpha$ is a concave function of $\alpha$. Under the assumption that the thermal entropy associated with the "replica trick" time circle is bounded from below by the charge in the supersymmetric system, it is further proved that both ${\alpha-1\over \alpha}\bar S_\alpha$ and $(\alpha-1)\bar S_\alpha$ monotonically increase as functions of $\alpha$. Because $\bar S_\alpha$ enjoys universal relations with the Weyl anomaly coefficients in even-dimensional superconformal field theories, one therefore obtains a set of bounds on these coefficients by imposing the inequalities of $\bar S_\alpha$. Some of the bounds coincide with Hofman-Maldacena bounds and the others are new. We also check the inequalities for examples in odd-dimensions.

abstract: We present a generic system of three harmonic modes coupled parametrically with a time-varying coupling modulated by a combination of two pump harmonics, and show how this system provides the minimal platform to realize nonreciprocal couplings that can lead to gainless photon circulation, and phase-preserving or phase-sensitive directional amplification. Explicit frequency-dependent calculations within this minimal paradigm highlight the separation of amplification and directionality bandwidths, universal in such schemes. We also study the influence of counter-rotating interactions that can adversely affect directionality and associated bandwidth; we find that these effects can be mitigated by suitably designing the properties of the auxiliary mode that plays the role of an engineered reservoir to the amplification mode space.

abstract: We investigate the real-time evolution of lattice bosons in two spatial dimensions whose dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation. We derive the generalization of the truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum many-body systems to study the initial value problem from first principles. Employing non-Hermitean quantum jump operators that constitute a mechanism for dissipative cooling, we study the buildup of long-range correlations in real-time. We observe the formation of vortex-antivortex pairs if the initially disordered system is dissipatively driven into a state with quasi long-range order. This effect resembles the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for driven-dissipative systems, however, without the necessity of quenching a control parameter to a critical value.

The single quantum dot charge sensors have a charge sensitivity of 8.2 x 10^{-4} e/root(Hz) and allow the investigation of real-time charge dynamics. As a demonstration of the versatility of this device, we use single-shot readout to measure a spin relaxation time T1 = 170 ms at a magnetic field B = 1 T. By reconfiguring the device, we form two capacitively coupled double quantum dots and extract a mutual charging energy of 200 microeV, which indicates that 50 GHz two-qubit gate operation speeds are feasible.

abstract: We study the problem of site recurrence of discrete time nearest neighbor open quantum random walks (OQWs) on the integer line, proving basic properties and some of its relations with the corresponding problem for unitary (coined) quantum walks (UQWs). For both kinds of walks our discussion concerns two notions of recurrence, one given by a monitoring procedure, another in terms of P\'olya numbers, and we study their similarities and differences. In particular, by considering UQWs and OQWs induced by the same pair of matrices, we discuss the fact that recurrence of these walks are related by an additive interference term in a simple way. Based on a previous result of positive recurrence we describe an open quantum version of Kac's lemma for the expected return time to a site.

abstract: In this paper, we review the concept and properties of finite field-dependent BRST and BRST-antiBRST transformations introduced in our recent study (A. Reshetnyak, IJMPA 29 (2014) 1450128, P. Moshin, A. Reshetnyak, Nucl. Phys. B 888 (2014) 92, Phys. Lett B 739 (2014) 110, IJMPA 29 (2014) 1450159, IJMPA 30 (2015) 1550021, IJMPA 31 (2016) 1650111, [arxiv:1604.03027 [hep-th]]) for gauge theories are reviewed. Exact rules of calculating the Jacobian for a corresponding change of variables in the partition function are presented. Infrared peculiarities under $R_\xi$-gauges in the Yang---Mills theory and Standard Model are examined in a gauge-invariant way with an appropriate horizon functional and unaffected local $N=1,2$ BRST symmetries.

abstract: We investigate the photo-doubleionization of $H_2$ molecules with 400 eV photons. We find that the emitted electrons do not show any sign of two-center interference fringes in their angular emission distributions if considered separately. In contrast, the quasi-particle consisting of both electrons (i.e. the "dielectron") does. The work highlights the fact that non-local effects are embedded everywhere in nature where many-particle processes are involved.

abstract: Metastable states of noble gas atoms are typically produced by electrical discharge techniques or "all-optical" excitation methods. Here we combine electrical discharges with optical pumping to demonstrate "optically enhanced" production of metastable xenon (Xe*). We experimentally measure large increases in Xe* density with relatively small optical control field powers. This technique may have applications in systems where large metastable state densities are desirable.

abstract: We investigate magnetic phase in the bilayer system of ultra-cold bosons in an optical lattice, which is involved with Raman-induced spin-orbit (SO) coupling and laser-assisted interlayer tunneling. It is shown that there exit a rich of spin textures such as hetero ferromagnet, heterochiral magnet, chiral magnet with interlayer antiferromagnet. In particular, heterochiral magnet induced by SO coupling occurs extremely rarely in real solid-state materials. We present detailed experimental setup of realizing such a model in cold atom system.

abstract: We discuss generation of subwavelength optical barriers on the scale of tens of nanometers, as conservative optical potentials for cold atoms. These arise from non-adiabatic corrections to Born-Oppenheimer potentials from dressed `dark states' in atomic $\Lambda$-configurations. We illustrate the concepts with a double layer potential for atoms obtained from inserting an optical subwavelength barrier into a well generated by an off-resonant optical lattice, and discuss bound states of pairs of atoms interacting via magnetic dipolar interactions. The subwavelength optical barriers represent an optical `Kronig-Penney' potential. We present a detailed study of the bandstructure in optical `Kronig-Penney' potentials, including decoherence from spontaneous emission and atom loss to open `bright' channels.
