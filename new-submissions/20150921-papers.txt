abstract: We present an analysis of electron transport through two weakly coupled precision placed phosphorus donors in silicon. In particular, we examine the (1,1) to (0,2) charge transition where we predict a new type of current blockade driven entirely by the nuclear spin dynamics. Using this nuclear spin blockade mechanism we devise a protocol to readout the state of single nuclear spins using electron transport measurements only. We extend our model to include realistic effects such as Stark shifted hyperfine interactions and multi-donor clusters. In the case of multi-donor clusters we show how nuclear spin blockade can be alleviated allowing for low magnetic field electron spin measurements.

abstract: The ability to characterize static and time-dependent electric fields in situ is an important prerequisite for quantum-optics experiments with atoms close to surfaces. Especially in experiments which aim at coupling Rydberg atoms to the near field of superconducting circuits, the identification and subsequent elimination of sources of stray fields is crucial. We present a technique that allows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions $(F^\text{str}_\text{x}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{y}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{z}(\vec{r}))$ at distances of less than $2~\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using coherent Rydberg-Stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable $1\text{s}^12\text{s}^1~{}^{1}S_{0}$ helium atoms. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field emanating from a structured superconducting surface. Exploiting coherent population transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the same technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution above the surface.

abstract: Leakage errors occur when a quantum system leaves the two-level qubit subspace. Reducing these errors is critically important for quantum error correction to be viable. To quantify leakage errors, we use randomized benchmarking in conjunction with measurement of the leakage population. We characterize single qubit gates in a superconducting qubit, and by refining our use of Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse shaping along with detuning of the pulses, we obtain gate errors consistently below $10^{-3}$ and leakage rates at the $10^{-5}$ level. With the control optimized, we find that a significant portion of the remaining leakage is due to incoherent heating of the qubit.

abstract: This paper presents a model reduction method for the class of linear quantum stochastic systems often encountered in quantum optics and their related fields. The approach is proposed on the basis of an interpolatory projection ensuring that specific input-output responses of the original and the reduced-order systems are matched at multiple selected points (or frequencies). Importantly, the physical realizability property of the original quantum system imposed by the law of quantum mechanics is preserved under our tangential interpolatory projection. An error bound is established for the proposed model reduction method and an avenue to select interpolation points is proposed. A passivity preserving model reduction method is also presented. Examples of both active and passive systems are provided to illustrate the merits of our proposed approach.

abstract: This paper establishes that generic linear quantum stochastic systems have a pure cascade realization of their transfer function, generalizing an earlier result established only for the special class of completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems. In particular, a cascade realization therefore exists for generic active linear quantum stochastic systems that require an external source of quanta to operate. The results facilitate a simplified realization of generic linear quantum stochastic systems for applications such as coherent feedback control and optical filtering. The key tools that are developed are algorithms for symplectic QR and Schur decompositions. It is shown that generic real square matrices of even dimension can be transformed into a lower $2 \times 2$ block triangular form by a symplectic similarity transformation. The linear algebraic results herein may be of independent interest for applications beyond the problem of transfer function realization for quantum systems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the main results. In particular, one example describes an equivalent realization of the transfer function of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier as the cascade interconnection of two degenerate parametric amplifiers with an additional outcoupling mirror.

abstract: One main goal of quantum control is to steer a quantum system toward an expected state or dynamics. For measurement-induced quantum control, measurements serve as the only control, which is like the cases in quantum Zeno and anti-zeno effects. In this paper, this scenario will be investigated in a general $N$-level quantum system. It is proved that, when the intial and expected states are both pure, the control space could be reduced to an effective subspace spanned by these two states only. This result will greatly simplify the measurement-induced control strategy of an $N$-level quantum system.

abstract: The aim of the book is to give a consequent and mathematical formulation to the interpretation of quantum mechanics that is often met, mostly in some rough and naive form, among practical physicists. In this way, not quite obvious consequences of standard quantum mechanics are derived that may look quite different from what is usually written in textbooks. In addition, some truly new ideas are introduced concerning quantum models of classical properties as well as quantum theory of measurement. Such ideas are necessary to make the interpretation self-consistent. The book ought to be accessible to students of theoretical physics that finished the standard course of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We present a scheme of positioning a single electron spin with sub-nanometer resolution through multiple nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. With unwanted noise suppressed by dynamical decoupling, the spin coherence of each center develops characteristic oscillations due to a single electron spin located $4{\sim20}$ nm away from the centers. We can extract the position information from the characteristic oscillations of each center. This scheme is useful for high-resolution nanoscale magnetometry and spin-based quantum computing.

abstract: We propose a new protocol for thr manipulation of a three-level artificial atom in Lambda ($\Lambda$) configuration in the absence of a direct pump coupling. It allows faithful, selective and robust population transfer analogous to stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ($\Lambda$-STIRAP), in highly noise protected superconducting artificial atoms. It combines the use of a two-photon pump pulse with suitable advanced control, operated by a slow modulation of the phase of the external fields, leveraging on the stability of semiclassical microwave drives. This protocol is a building block for novel tasks in complex quantum architectures. Its demonstration would be a benchmark for the implementation of a class of multilevel advanced control procedures for quantum computation and microwave quantum photonics in systems based on artificial atoms.

abstract: Spatial adiabatic passage processes for ultracold atoms trapped in tunnel-coupled cylindrically symmetric concentric potentials are investigated. Specifically, we discuss the matter-wave analogue of the rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) technique for a high fidelity and robust loading of a single atom into a harmonic ring potential from a harmonic trap, and for its transport between two concentric rings. We also consider a system of three concentric rings and investigate the transport of a single atom between the innermost and the outermost rings making use of the matter-wave analogue of the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique. We describe the RAP-like and STIRAP-like dynamics by means of a two- and a three-state models, respectively, obtaining good agreement with the numerical simulations of the corresponding two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: We report quantum enhancement of Faraday rotation spin noise spectroscopy by polarization squeezing of the probe beam. Using natural abundance Rb in \SI{100}{Torr}of N$_2$ buffer gas, and squeezed light from a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator stabilized \SI{20}{GHz}to the blue of the D$_1$ resonance, we observe that an input squeezing of \SI{3.0}{dB} improves the signal-to-noise ratio by \SI{1.5}{dB} to \SI{2.6}{dB} over the combined (power)$\otimes$(number density) ranges (\SI{0.5}{mW} to \SI{4.0}{mW})$\otimes$(\SI{1.5d12}{cm\tothe{-3}} to \SI{1.3d13}{cm\tothe{-3}}), covering the full practical range and into the strongly-perturbed regime. We show that in these conditions squeezing improves the trade-off between statistical noise and systematic shifts, a new kind of quantum advantage.

abstract: In this work we present a new generic feature of PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein condensates by studying the many-particle description of a two-mode condensate with balanced gain and loss. This is achieved using a master equation in Lindblad form whose mean-field limit is a PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii equation. It is shown that the purity of the condensate periodically drops to small values but then is nearly completely restored. This has a direct impact on the average contrast in interference experiments which cannot be covered by the mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed.

abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for implementation of a maximally entangling quantum controlled-Z gate between two weakly interacting systems. We conditionally enhance the interqubit coupling by quantum interference. Both before and after the interqubit interaction, one of the qubits is coherently coupled to an auxiliary quantum system, and finally it is projected back onto qubit subspace. We experimentally verify the practical feasibility of this technique by using a linear optical setup with weak interferometric coupling between single-photon qubits. Our procedure is universally applicable to a wide range of physical platforms including hybrid systems such as atomic clouds or optomechanical oscillators coupled to light.

abstract: Extending the single photon transmission distance is a basic requirement for the implementation of quantum communication on a global scale. In this work we report the single photon exchange from a medium Earth orbit satellite (MEO) at more than 7000 km of slanted distance to the ground station at the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory. The single photon transmitter was realized by exploiting the corner cube retro-reflectors mounted on the LAGEOS-2 satellite. Long duration of data collection is possible with such altitude, up to 43 minutes in a single passage. The mean number of photons per pulse ({\mu}sat) has been limited to 1 for 200 seconds, resulting in an average detection rate of 3.0 cps and a signal to noise ratio of 1.5. The feasibility of single photon exchange from MEO satellites paves the way to tests of Quantum Mechanics in moving frames and to global Quantum Information.

abstract: We address the problem of understanding from first principles the conditions under which a closed quantum system equilibrates rapidly with respect to a concrete observable. Previously known general upper bounds on the time scales of equilibration were extremely long, with times scaling linearly with the dimension of the Hilbert space. Moreover, these bounds proved to be tight, since particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. In this paper we provide a new upper bound on the equilibration time scales which shows, in fact, equilibration is much faster under some physically reasonable conditions. In particular, we apply this result to give bounds on the time scales of equilibration for a system interacting with a thermal bath which do not scale with the size of the bath.

abstract: The recent progress in the analytical solution of models invented to describe theoretically the interaction of matter with light on an atomic scale is reviewed. The methods employ the classical theory of linear differential equations in the complex domain (Fuchsian equations). The linking concept is provided by the Bargmann Hilbert space of analytic functions, which is isomorphic to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, the standard Hilbert space for a single continuous degree of freedom in quantum mechanics. I give the solution of the quantum Rabi model in some detail and sketch the solution of its generalization, the asymmetric Dicke model. Characteristic properties of the respective spectra are derived directly from the singularity structure of the corresponding system of differential equations.

abstract: The problem of construction of a quantum master equation for a system of sites weakly coupled to each other and to one or more reservoirs (open quantum network) is considered. Microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation requires a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the network, which can be a difficult task. When the inter-site couplings are weak, the local approach, which neglects the influence of the inter-site couplings on the system-reservoir couplings, is often used. Recently, some doubts were cast to the consistency of the local approach. We develop a systematic perturbation expansion to derive corrections to the local approach and establish its range of validity. Using this extension of the local approach, we derive an expression for the heat flux for a particular model and show that it does not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

abstract: We find a Friedmann model with appropriate matter/energy density such that the solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly corresponds to the classical evolution. The well-known problems in quantum cosmology disappear in the resulting coasting evolution. The exact quantum-classical correspondence is demonstrated with the help of the de Broglie-Bohm and modified de Broglie-Bohm approaches to quantum mechanics. It is reassuring that such a solution leads to a robust model for the universe, which agrees well with cosmological expansion indicated by SNe Ia data.

abstract: Alkali-filled hollow-core fibres are a promising medium for investigating light-matter interactions, especially at the single-photon level, due to the tight confinement of light and high optical depths achievable by light-induced atomic desorption. However, until now these large alkali vapour densities could only be generated for seconds at most once per day, severely limiting the practicality of the technology. Here we report the generation of highest observed transient ($>10^5$ for minutes) and highest observed persistent (>2000 for hours) optical depths of alkali vapours in hollow-core fibres to date, using a caesium-filled Kagom\'e-type hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. Our results pave the way to light-matter interaction experiments in confined geometries requiring long operation times and large atomic number densities, such as single-photon-level light-matter interaction experiments and fundamental investigations of hot dense atomic gases.

abstract: The possibility that anyons - quantum particles other than fermions or bosons - can emerge in condensed matter systems has motivated generations of physicists. In addition to being of fundamental scientific importance, so-called non-Abelian anyons are particularly sought-after for potential applications to quantum computing. However, experimental evidence of anyons in electronic systems remains inconclusive. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate non-Abelian braiding statistics by injecting coherent states of light into "topological guided modes" in specially-fabricated photonic waveguide arrays. These modes are photonic analogues of topological zero modes in electronic systems. Light traveling inside spatially well-separated topological guided modes can be braided, leading to the accumulation of non-Abelian phases. We propose an optical interference experiment to probe this non-Abelian braiding statistics directly.

abstract: The recently proposed ER=EPR correspondence postulates the existence of wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) between entangled states (such as EPR pairs). Entanglement is famously known to be unobservable in quantum mechanics, in that there exists no observable (or, equivalently, projector) that can accurately pick out whether a generic state is entangled. Many features of the geometry of spacetime, however, are observables, so one might worry that the presence or absence of a wormhole could identify an entangled state in ER=EPR, violating quantum mechanics, specifically, the property of state-independence of observables. In this note, we establish that this cannot occur: there is no measurement in general relativity that unambiguously detects the presence of a generic wormhole geometry. This statement is the ER=EPR dual of the undetectability of entanglement.

We find that the disorder-averaged (single-particle) Green's function, calculated via the coherent potential approximation, is in very good agreement with exact numerics. Using the transfer-matrix method, we compute the phase diagram in the energy-disorder plane and show that its peculiar shape can be understood from the self-consistent theory of localization. In particular, we recover the large asymmetry in the position of the mobility edge for blue and red speckles, which was recently observed numerically for correlated speckle potentials.

abstract: We develop a variational approximation to the entanglement entropy for scalar $\phi^4$ theory in 1+1, 2+1, and 3+1 dimensions, and then examine the entanglement entropy as a function of the coupling. We find that in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, the entanglement entropy of $\phi^4$ theory as a function of coupling is monotonically decreasing and convex. While $\phi^4$ theory with positive bare coupling in 3+1 dimensions is thought to lead to a trivial free theory, we analyze a version of $\phi^4$ with infinitesimal negative bare coupling, an asymptotically free theory known as precarious $\phi^4$ theory, and explore the monotonicity and convexity of its entanglement entropy as a function of coupling. Within the variational approximation, the stability of precarious $\phi^4$ theory is related to the sign of the first and second derivatives of the entanglement entropy with respect to the coupling.

abstract: Based on the perturbation theory up to the second order, analytical asymptotic expressions for the variation of the population of hyperfine component $\mu=0 $ particles in the ground state of spin-1 condensates against a magnetic field $B$ has been derived. The ranges of $B$ in which the asymptotic expressions are applicable have been clarified via a comparison of the numerical results from the analytical expressions and from a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a complete spin-space. It was found that, For $^{87}$Rb, the two analytical expressions, one for a weak and the other one for a strong field, together cover the whole range of $B$ from 0 to infinite. For Na, the analytical expressions are valid only if $B$ is very weak or sufficiently strong.
