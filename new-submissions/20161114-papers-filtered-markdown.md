**1.    Spectra and Bifurcations**

<blockquote>
<p>
The concept of spectrum for a class of non-linear wave equations is studied. Instead of looking for stability, the key to the spectral structure is found in the instability phenomena (bifurcations). This aspect is best seen in the `classical model' of the non-linear wave mechanics. The solitons (macro-localizations) are a part of the non-linear spectral problem; their bifurcations reflect the dynamical symmetry breaking. The computer simulations suggest that the bifurcations of the asymptotic behaviour occur also for the general, non-stationary states. A~phenomenon of the soliton splitting is observed.
