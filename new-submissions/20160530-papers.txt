abstract: By assuming a deterministic evolution of quantum systems and taking realism into account, we carefully build a hidden variable theory for Quantum Mechanics based on the notion of ontological states proposed by 't Hooft. We view these ontological states as the ones embedded with realism and compare them to the (usual) quantum states that represent superpositions, viewing the latter as mere information of the system they describe. With this basis we reach a local understanding of Quantum Mechanics, whose predictions come to be in accordance with Bell's inequality and with the experiments in the laboratory. In this way we show that Quantum Mechanics can indeed have a local interpretation, and thus meet with the Theory of Relativity in a satisfying mode.

abstract: We transform the way of finding entanglement criterion into two steps: to obtain necessary criterion of separability by maximizing an algebra function for a set of characteristic variables of the witness operator and the given number of partitions, then to obtain the sufficient criterion by minimizing an algebra function with respect to the characteristic variables for a given quantum state. Our method avoids the semi-definite program calculation in the witness operator entanglement detection. The necessary and sufficient criterion of separability for the three qubit X shaped state is given to illustrate the procedure of finding the criterion. We give the necessary and sufficient criteria of the three partite and full separabilities for the four qubit noisy GHZ state and the four qubit noisy cluster state.

abstract: We demonstrate the necessary and sufficient criterion for an $N$ qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state in white noise when it is divided into $N-j$ parties with $N\geq 2j+1$ for arbitrary $N$ and $j$. The criterion covers more than a half of all the separabilities of $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in white noise. For the rest of multipartite separable problems, we present a method to obtain the sufficient conditions of separability using linear programming.

abstract: Computing permanents of matrices are known to be a classically hard problem that the computational cost grows exponentially with the size of the matrix increases. So far, there exist a few classical algorithms to compute the matrix permanents in deterministic and in randomized ways. By exploiting the series expansion of products of boson operators regarding collective boson operators, a generalized algorithm for computing permanents is developed that the algorithm can handle the arbitrary matrices with repeated columns and rows. In a particular case, the formula is reduced to Glynn's form. Not only the algorithm can be used for a deterministic direct calculation of the matrix permanent but also can be expressed as a sampling problem like Gurvits's randomized algorithm.

abstract: Quantum memory is an important component in the long-distance quantum communication system based on the quantum repeater protocol. To outperform the direct transmission of photons with quantum repeaters, it is crucial to develop quantum memories with high fidelity, high efficiency and a long storage time. Here, we achieve a storage efficiency of 96\% for a photonic memory based on the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) scheme in cold atomic media with an optical depth of near 1000. At a storage efficiency of 50\%, we also obtain a fractional delay of 1200. Both are the best record to date in all kinds of the schemes for the realization of quantum memory. Our work significantly advances the pursuit of a high-performance photonic memory and should have important applications in quantum information science.

abstract: In this letter, we show that the exact master equation incorporating initial correlations for open quantum systems, within the Nakajima-Zwangzig operator-projection method, is a homogenous master equation in terms of the reduced density matrix of the system. We derive also explicitly the master equation for a large class of bosonic and fermionic open quantum systems incorporating initial correlations, the resulting master equation is exact and homogenous. We find that the effects of the initial correlations can be fully embedded into the fluctuation dynamics through the homogenous master equation. Also a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem incorporating the initial correlations is obtained.

Here we further develop this approach, derive maximal amount of such correlations and show that they are not monotonous under local operations and classical communication. Nevertheless, we demonstrate their usefulness in entanglement detection with a single random observable per party. Finally we study convex-roof extension of the correlations and provide a closed-form necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement in rank-$2$ mixed states and a witness in general.

abstract: Quantum entanglement among multiple spatially separated particles is of fundamental interest, and can serve as central resources for studies in quantum nonlocality, quantum-to-classical transition, quantum error correction, and quantum simulation. The ability of generating an increasing number of entangled particles is an important benchmark for quantum information processing. The largest entangled states were previously created with fourteen trapped ions, eight photons, and five superconducting qubits. Here, based on spontaneous parametric down-converted two-photon entanglement source with simultaneously a high brightness of ~12 MHz/W, a collection efficiency of ~70% and an indistinguishability of ~91% between independent photons, we demonstrate, for the first time, genuine and distillable entanglement of ten single photons under different pump power. Our work creates a state-of-the-art platform for multi-photon experiments, and provide enabling technologies for challenging optical quantum information tasks such as high-efficiency scattershot boson sampling with many photons.

abstract: Nonclassical quantum effects gradually reach domains of physics of large systems previously considered as purely classical. We derive a hierarchy of operational criteria suitable for a reliable detection of nonclassicality of light from an arbitrarily large ensemble of independent single-photon emitters. We show, that such large ensemble can always emit nonclassical light without any phase reference and under realistic experimental conditions including incoherent background noise. The nonclassical light from the large ensemble of the emitters can be witnessed much better than light coming from a single or a few emitters.

abstract: We present a quantum theory for a fully coupled hybrid optomechanical system where all mutual couplings between a two-level atom, a confined photon mode and a mechanical oscillator mode are considered. In such a configuration, new quantum interference effects and correlations arise due to the interplay and competition between the different physical interactions. We present an analytical diagonalization of the related fully coupled Hamiltonian, showing the nature and energy spectra of the tripartite dressed excitations. We determine the driven-dissipative dynamics of such hybrid systems and study phonon blockade effects under resonant excitation. We also study the statistical properties of the photon emission obtained under incoherent pumping of the two-level atom, which is particularly relevant for experiments with solid-state two-level emitters.

abstract: Sampling the distribution of bosons that have undergone a random unitary evolution is strongly believed to be a computationally hard problem. Key to outperforming classical simulations of this task is to increase both the number of input photons and the size of the network. We propose driven boson sampling, in which photons are input within the network itself, as a means to approach this goal. When using heralded single-photon sources based on parametric down-conversion, this approach offers an $\sim e$-fold enhancement in the input state generation rate over scattershot boson sampling, reaching the scaling limit for such sources. More significantly, this approach offers a dramatic increase in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to higher-order photon generation from such probabilistic sources, which removes the need for photon number resolution during the heralding process as the size of the system increases.

abstract: This is the second part of a three-part overview, in which we derive the category-theoretic backbone of quantum theory from a process ontology, treating quantum theory as a theory of systems, processes and their interactions. In this part we focus on classical-quantum interaction. Classical and quantum systems are treated as distinct types, of which the respective behavioural properties are specified in terms of processes and their compositions. In particular, classicality is witnessed by 'spiders' which fuse together whenever they connect. We define mixedness and show that pure processes are extremal in the space of all processes, and we define entanglement and show that quantum theory indeed exhibits entanglement. We discuss the classification of tripartite qubit entanglement and show that both the GHZ-state and the W-state come from spider-like families of processes, which differ only in how they behave when they are connected by two or more wires. We define measurements and provide fully-comprehensive descriptions of several quantum protocols involving classical data flow. Finally, we give a notion of 'genuine quantumness', from which special processes called 'phase spiders' arise, and get a first glimpse of quantum non-locality.

abstract: Transfer of quantum information between physical systems of a different nature is a central matter in quantum technologies. Particularly challenging is the transfer between discrete- and continuous degrees of freedom of various harmonic oscillator systems. Here we implement a protocol for teleporting a continuous-variable optical qubit, encoded by means of coherent states, onto a discrete-variable, single-rail qubit - a superposition of the vacuum- and single-photon optical states - via a hybrid entangled resource. We test our protocol on coherent states of different phases and obtain the teleported qubit with a fidelity of $0.83\pm0.04$. We also find that the phase of the resulting qubit varies consistently with that of the input, having a standard deviation of $3.8^\circ$ from the target value. Our work opens up the way to wide application of quantum information processing techniques where discrete- and continuous-variable encodings are combined within the same optical circuit.

abstract: A usual assumption in quantum estimation is that the unknown parameter labels the possible states of the system, while it does not influence the sample space and measurements aimed at extracting information on the parameter itself. This assumption is crucial to obtaining the quantum generalization of the Cram\'er-Rao theorem of classical statistics, i.e. the introduction of the quantum Fisher information as an upper bound of the Fisher information of any possible measurement. However, there are relevant estimation problems where this assumption does not hold and an alternative approach should be developed to find a proper bound to the ultimate precision allowed by quantum mechanics. Here we derive generalized Cram\'er-Rao bounds where those additional sources of information on the parameter are taken into account. The long-standing problem of estimating the direction of a magnetic field is revisited in order to illustrate our point.

abstract: We present the quantum theory of coherent Ising machines based on networks of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). In a simple model consisting of two coupled DOPOs, both positive-$P$ representation and truncated Wigner representation predict quantum correlation and inseparability between the two DOPOs in spite of the open-dissipative nature of the system. Here, we apply the truncated Wigner representation method to coherent Ising machines with thermal, vacuum, and squeezed reservoir fields. We find that the probability of finding the ground state of a one-dimensional Ising model increases substantially as a result of reducing excess thermal noise and squeezing the incident vacuum fluctuation on the out-coupling port.

abstract: Understanding the behavior of light in non-equilibrium scenarios underpins much of quantum optics and optical physics. While lasers provide a severe example of a non-equilibrium problem, recent interests in the near-equilibrium physics of photon `gases', such as in Bose condensation of light or in attempts to make photonic quantum simulators, suggest one reexamine some near-equilibrium cases. Here we consider how a sinusoidal parametric coupling between two semi-infinite photonic transmission lines leads to the creation and flow of photons between the two lines. Our approach provides a photonic analogue to the Landauer transport formula, and using non-equilbrium Green's functions, we can extend it to the case of an interacting region between two photonic `leads' where the sinusoid frequency plays the role of a voltage bias. Crucially, we identify both the mathematical framework and the physical regime in which photonic transport is directly analogous to electronic transport, and regimes in which other new behavior such as two-mode squeezing can emerge.

The estimates may also be experimentally accessible after the recent results by Islam et al. [Nature, {\bf 528}, 77 (2015)]. The moments of the partially transposed density matrix $\rho^{T_2}$ can be measured using the quantum circuits\cite{PT} previously given by the author, which can also be implemented as a generalization of the replica trick.

abstract: We report on a direct measurement of the pair-wise anti-symmetric exchange interaction, known as the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI), in a Nd3+-doped YVO4 crystal. To this end we introduce a broadband electron spin resonance technique coupled with an optical detection scheme which selectively detects only one Nd3+-Nd3+ pair. Using this technique we can fully determine the spin-spin coupling tensor, allowing us to experimentally determine both the strength and direction of the DMI vector. We believe that this ability to fully determine the interaction Hamiltonian is of interest for studying the numerous magnetic phenomena where the DMI interaction is of fundamental importance, including multiferroics. We also detect a singlet-triplet transition within the pair, with a highly suppressed magnetic-field dependence, which suggests that such systems could form singlet-triplet qubits with long coherence times for quantum information applications.

abstract: The Fano lineshape arises from the interference of two excitation pathways to reach a continuum. Its generality has resulted in a tremendous success in explaining the lineshapes of many one-dimensional spectroscopies - absorption, emission, scattering, conductance, photofragmentation - applied to very varied systems - atoms, molecules, semiconductors and metals. Unravelling a spectroscopy into a second dimension reveals the relationship between states in addition to decongesting the spectra. Femtosecond-resolved two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a four-wave mixing technique that measures the time-evolution of the populations, and coherences of excited states. It has been applied extensively to the dynamics of photosynthetic units, and more recently to materials with extended band-structures. In this letter, we solve the full time-dependent third-order response, measured in 2DES, of a Fano model and give the new system parameters that become accessible.

abstract: It is quite relevant the extension of decoration transformation for quantum spin models since most of the real materials could be well described by Heisenberg type models. Here we propose an exact quantum decoration transformation and also showing interesting properties such as the persistence of symmetry and the symmetry breaking during this transformation. Although the proposed transformation, in principle, cannot be used to map exactly a quantum spin lattice model into another quantum spin lattice model, since the operators are non-commutative. However, it is possible the mapping in the "classical" limit, establishing an equivalence between both quantum spin lattice models. To study the validity of this approach for quantum spin lattice model, we use the Zassenhaus formula, and we verify how the correction could influence the decoration transformation. But this correction could be useless to improve the quantum decoration transformation because it involves the second-nearest-neighbor and further nearest neighbor couplings, which leads into a cumbersome task to establish the equivalence between both lattice models. This correction also gives us valuable information about its contribution, for most of the Heisenberg type models, this correction could be irrelevant at least up to the third order term of Zassenhaus formula. This transformation is applied to a finite size Heisenberg chain, comparing with the exact numerical results, our result is consistent for weak xy-anisotropy coupling. We also apply to bond-alternating Ising-Heisenberg chain model, obtaining an accurate result in the limit of the quasi-Ising chain.

abstract: Entanglement plays a major role in characterizing many-body quantum systems. In particular, the entanglement spectrum holds a great promise to characterize essential physics of quantum many-body systems. While there has been a surge of theoretical works on the subject, no experimental measurement has been performed to this date, due to the lack of an implementable measurement scheme. Here, we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of many-body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. Our scheme effectively performs a Ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement Hamiltonian, and is based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under investigation together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate between two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit. We show how the required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms, either by using Rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode. We illustrate these ideas on a simple (extended) Bose-Hubbard model where such a measurement protocol reveals topological features of the Haldane phase.

We also gave a proof for the number of roots of the constraint polynomials defining these exceptional solutions as a function of the system parameters and discussed the number of crossing points in the eigenspectrum. This approach however, only covered a subset of all exceptional points in the eigenspectrum. In this addendum, we clarify the distinction between the exceptional parts of the eigenspectrum for this model and discuss the subset of exceptional points not determined in our paper.

abstract: Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for fermions are becoming the standard to provide high quality reference data in systems that are too large to be investigated via quantum chemical approaches. DMC with the fixed-node approximation relies on modifications of the Green function to avoid singularities near the nodal surface of the trial wavefunction. We show that these modifications affect the DMC energies in a way that is not size-consistent, resulting in large time-step errors. Building on the modifications of Umrigar {\em et al.} and of DePasquale {\em et al.} we propose a simple Green function modification that restores size-consistency to large values of time-step; substantially reducing the time-step errors. The new algorithm also yields remarkable speedups of up to two orders of magnitude in the calculation of molecule-molecule binding energies and crystal cohesive energies, thus extending the horizons of what is possible with DMC.
