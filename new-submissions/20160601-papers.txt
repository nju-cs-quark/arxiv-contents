abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and illustrate, once again, the potency of the variational technique as an approximation procedure for the quantization of quantum mechanical systems. By choosing particle-in-a-box wavefunctions as trial wavefunctions, with the size of the box as the variation parameter, approximate eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained for the one dimensional free harmonic oscillator.

abstract: Cat states of the microwave field stored in high-Q resonators show great promise for robust encoding and manipulation of quantum information. Here we propose an approach to efficiently prepare such cat states in a Kerr-nonlinear resonator by the use of a two-photon drive. We show that this preparation is robust against single-photon loss. We moreover find that it is possible to remove undesirable phase evolution induced by a Kerr nonlinearity using a two-photon drive of appropriate amplitude and phase. Finally, we present a universal set of quantum logical gates that can be performed on the engineered eigenspace of the two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonator.

abstract: The algebraic method enables one to study the properties of the spectrum of a quadratic Hamiltonian through the mathematical properties of a matrix representation called regular or adjoint. This matrix exhibits exceptional points where it becomes defective and can be written in canonical Jordan form. It is shown that any quadratic function of $K$ coordinates and $K$ momenta leads to a $2K$ differential equation for those dynamical variables. We illustrate all these features of the algebraic method by means of the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and its PT-variant.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.09435
abstract: To date all self-tests for high dimensional systems are confined to many-qubit states. This is due to two restrictions in the literature: the standard techniques for proving self-testing results apply only to qubits, and there are few suitable non-local games that are known to require high dimensional non-qubit states to achieve their optimal quantum value. In this paper we address these two problems. Specifically, we generalize the usual self-testing framework to q$d$its and then apply it to a generalization of the magic square game, giving a self-test for two maximally entangled pairs of q$d$its. This self-test has two parties, perfect completeness for honest quantum players, and requires only a constant number of measurement settings, regardless of the dimension $d$.

abstract: Recently it was shown that the quantum behavior of an intense cavity field can be revealed by measuring the steady atomic correlations between two ideal atoms, which interact with the same leaking cavity mode. Considering weak atom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity mode ($\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the whole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of correlations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the cavity field even in the limit of $\bar{n} \gg 1$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{107}, 153601 (2011)]. Here, we extend this result by investigating the relaxation time for such a system. We have shown that the relaxation time of the system varies proportionally to $\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but inversely proportional to $\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time required to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field on the atomic correlations diverges as $\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values due to a coherent driving, while goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a coherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability, i.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for a long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have also discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady correlations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity field is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times. Then, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness of a cavity field in a certain time interval.

abstract: We put forward an effective amplification protocol for protecting the single-photon entangled state of the time-bin qubit. The protocol only requires one pair of the single-photon entangled state and some auxiliary single photons. With the help of the 50:50 beam splitters, variable beam splitters with the transmission of $t$ and the polarizing beam splitters, we can increase the fidelity of the single-photon entangled state under $t<\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, the encoded time-bin information can be perfectly contained. Our protocol is quite simple and economical. More importantly, it can be realized under current experimental condition. Based on the above features, our protocol may be useful in current and future quantum information processing.

abstract: We design an effect protocol for protecting the single-photon entanglement from photon loss and decoherence. The protocol only requires some auxiliary single photons and the linear optical elements. By operating the protocol, the photon loss can be effectively decreased and the less entangled single photon state can be recovered to the maximally entangled state with some probability. Moreover, the polarization information encoded in the single photon state can be perfectly contained. The protocol can be realized under current experimental condition. As the single photon entanglement is quite important in quantum communication, this protocol may be useful in current and future quantum information processing.

abstract: Standard weak measurement (SWM) has been proved to be a useful ingredient for measuring small longitudinal phase shifts. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 033604 (2013)]. In this letter, we show that with specfic pre-coupling and postselection, destructive interference can be observed for the two conjugated variables, i.e. time and frequency, of the meter state. Using a broad band source, this conjugated destructive interference (CDI) can be observed in a regime approximately 1 attosecond, while the related spectral shift reaches hundreds of THz. This extreme sensitivity can be used to detect tiny longitudinal phase perturbation. Combined with a frequency-domain analysis, conjugated destructive interference weak measurement (CDIWM) is proved to outperform SWM by two orders of magnitude.

abstract: We report a quantum measurement beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) for the amplitude of a small displacement acting on a cavity field. This measurement uses as resource an entangled mesoscopic state, prepared by the resonant interaction of a circular Rydberg atom with a field stored in a superconducting cavity. We analyse the measurement process in terms of Fisher information and prove that it is, in principle, optimal. The achieved experimental precision, 2.4 dB below the SQL, is well understood in terms of experimental imperfections.This method could be transposed to other systems, particularly to circuit QED, for the precise measurements of weak forces acting on oscillators.

abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for the construction of quantum tensor product codes (QTPC). In a classical tensor product code (TPC), its parity check matrix is constructed via the tensor product of parity check matrices of the two component codes. We show that by adding some constraints on the component codes, we can get several classes of dual-containing TPCs. By selecting di?erent component codes, the proposed method enables the construction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide the similar quantum error control abilities as the corresponding classical TPCs. In particular, if one of the component codes is selected as a burst error-correction code, then QTPCs have multiple quantum burst error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in distinct subblocks. Compared with concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the component code selections of QTPCs are much more exible than those of CQCs since only one of the component codes of QTPCs needs to satisfy the dual-containing restriction. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to construct QTPCs with parameters better than other classes of quantum error-correction codes (QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH codes. It is known that classical TPCs cannot have parameters better than classical BCH codes. However, we show that QTPCs can have better parameters than quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with parameters better than previously known QECCs available in the literature.

abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms can be used to sense fluctuations of the magnetic field by means of the transitions into untrapped hyperfine states. It has been shown recently that counting the outcoupled atoms can yield the power spectrum of the magnetic noise. We calculate the spectral resolution function which characterizes the condensate as a noise measurement device in this scheme. We use the description of the radio frequency outcoupling scheme of an atom laser which takes into account the gravitational acceleration. The three-dimensional and fully quantum mechanical approach leads to a position-dependent spectral resolution function which can be used to describe any spatial resolution of the atom detection scheme.

abstract: The question of open-loop control in the Gaussian regime may be cast by asking which Gaussian unitary transformations are reachable by turning on and off a given set of quadratic Hamiltonians. For compact groups, including finite dimensional unitary groups, the well known Lie algebra rank criterion provides a sufficient and necessary condition for the reachable set to cover the whole group. Because of the non-compact nature of the symplectic group, which corresponds to Gaussian unitary transformations, this criterion turns out to be still necessary but not sufficient for Gaussian systems. If the control Hamiltonians are unstable, in a sense made rigorous in the main text, the peculiar situation may arise where the rank criterion is satisfied and yet not all symplectic transformations are reachable. Here, we address this situation for one degree of freedom and study the properties of the reachable set under unstable control Hamiltonians. First, we provide a partial analytical characterisation of the reachable set and prove that no orthogonal (`energy-preserving' or `passive' in the literature) symplectic operations may be reached with such controls. Then, we apply numerical optimal control algorithms to demonstrate a complete characterisation of the set in specific cases.

abstract: Quantum image processing (QIP) means the quantum based methods to speed up image processing algorithms. Many quantum image processing schemes claim that their efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical schemes. However, most of them do not consider the problem of measurement. As we all know, measurement will lead to collapse. That is to say, executing the algorithm once, users can only measure the final state one time. Therefore, if users want to regain the results (the processed images), they must execute the algorithms many times and then measure the final state many times to get all the pixels' values. If the measurement process is taken into account, whether or not the algorithms are really efficient needs to be reconsidered. In this paper, we try to solve the problem of measurement and give a quantum image matching algorithm. Unlike most of the QIP algorithms, our scheme interests only one pixel (the target pixel) instead of the whole image. It modifies the probability of pixels based on Grover's algorithm to make the target pixel to be measured with higher probability, and the measurement step is executed only once. An example is given to explain the algorithm more vividly. Complexity analysis indicates that the quantum scheme's complexity is $O(2^{n})$ in contradistinction to the classical scheme's complexity $O(2^{2n+2m})$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers related to the size of images.

abstract: The Schmidt coefficients capture all entanglement properties of a pure bipartite state and therefore determine its usefulness for quantum information processing. While the quantification of the corresponding properties in mixed states is important both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, it is considerably more difficult, and methods beyond estimates for the concurrence are elusive. In particular this holds for a quantitative assessment of the most valuable resource, the maximum possible Schmidt number of an arbitrary mixed state. We derive a framework for lower bounding the appropriate measure of entanglement, the so-called G-concurrence, through few local measurements. Moreover, we show that these bounds have relevant applications also for multipartite states.

abstract: Digital quantum simulation of fermionic systems is important in the context of chemistry and physics. Simulating fermionic models on general purpose quantum computers requires imposing a fermionic algebra on spins. The previously studied Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations are two techniques for accomplishing this task. Here we re-examine an auxiliary fermion construction which maps fermionic operators to local operators on spins. The local simulation is performed by relaxing the requirement that the number of spins should match the number of fermionic modes. Instead, auxiliary modes are introduced to enable non-consecutive fermionic couplings to be simulated with constant low-rank tensor products on spins. We connect the auxiliary fermion construction to other topological models and give examples of the construction.

We report on an experiment using a warm atomic vapor and low-finesse cavity, and briefly discuss the potential for reaching the strong coupling regime of cavity QED by using trapped atoms and a high-finesse cavity of this kind.

abstract: Microscopically controlled neutral atoms in optical tweezers and lattices have led to exciting advances in the study of quantum information and quantum many-body systems. The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.
