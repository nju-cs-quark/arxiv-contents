abstract: We study a generalization of nonlocal games---which we call extended nonlocal games---in which the players, Alice and Bob, initially share a tripartite quantum state with the referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to randomly selected questions. Our study of this class of games was inspired by the monogamy-of-entanglement games introduced by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner, which they also generalize. We prove that a natural extension of the Navascues--Pironio--Acin hierarchy of semidefinite programs converges to the optimal commuting operator value of extended nonlocal games, and we prove two extensions of results of Tomamichel et al.~concerning monogamy-of-entanglement games.

abstract: We present a new method to study the semiclassical dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings dimer model, describing two coupled cavities each containing a two-level system (qubit). We develop a Fock space WKB approach in the polariton basis where each site is treated exactly while the intersite polariton hopping is treated semiclassically. We show that the self-trapped states can be viewed as Fock space localized states. We find that this picture yields the correct critical value of interaction strength at which the delocalization-localization transition occurs. Moreover, the validity of our WKB approach is supported by showing that the quantum spectrum can be derived from a set of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions and by confirming that the quantum eigenstates are consistent with the classical orbital motion in the polariton band picture. The underlying idea of our method is quite general and can be applied to other interacting spin-boson models.

abstract: It is commonly claimed in the recent literature that certain solutions to wave equations of positive energy of Dirac-type with internal variables are characterized by a non-thermal spectrum. As part of that statement, it was said that the transformations and symmetries involved in equations of such type correspond to a particular representation of the Lorentz group. In this paper we give the general solution to this problem emphasizing the interplay between the group structure, the corresponding algebra and the physical spectrum. This analysis is completed with a strong discussion and proving that: i) the physical states are represented by coherent states; ii) the solutions in previous references [1] are not general, ii) the symmetries of the considered physical system in [1] (equations and geometry) do not correspond to the Lorentz group but to the fourth covering: the Metaplectic group Mp(n).

abstract: We consider an Ehrenfest approximation for a particle in a double-well potential in the presence of an external environment schematized as a finite resource heat bath. This allows us to explore how the limitations in the applicability of Ehrenfest dynamics to nonlinear systems are modified in an open system setting. Within this framework, we have identified an environment-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, and we argue that the Ehrenfest approximation becomes increasingly valid in the limit of strong coupling to the external reservoir, either in the form of increasing number of oscillators or increasing temperature. The analysis also suggests a rather intuitive picture for the general phenomenon of quantum tunneling and its interplay with classical thermal activation processes, which may be of relevance in physical chemistry, ultracold atom physics, and fast-switching dynamics such as in superconducting digital electronics.

abstract: We report an experimental realisation of Maxwell's demon in a photonic setup. We show that a measurement at the single-photon level followed by a feed-forward operation allows the extraction of work from intense thermal light into an electric circuit. The interpretation of the experiment stimulates the derivation of a new equality relating work extraction to information acquired by measurement. We derive a bound using this relation and show that it is in agreement with the experimental results. Our work puts forward photonic systems as a platform for experiments related to information in thermodynamics.

abstract: This thesis contains contributions to the theory of quantum computation. We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary operators. Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision {\epsilon} > 0, we show how to efficiently find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T operators whose product approximates U up to {\epsilon} in the operator norm. In the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to {\epsilon}. Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties.

abstract: In a hybrid quantum network, linking two kinds of quantum nodes through photonic channels requires excellent matching of central frequency and bandwidth between both nodes and their interfacing photons. However, pre-existing photon sources can not fulfill this requirement. Using a novel conjoined double-cavity strategy, we report the generation of nondegenerate narrow-band photon pairs by cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The central frequencies and bandwidths of the signal and idler photons are independently set to match with trapped ions and solid-state quantum memories. With this source we achieve the bandwidths and central frequencies of 4 MHz at 935 nm and 5 MHz at 880 nm for the signal and idler photons respectively, with a normalized spectrum brightness of 4.9/s/MHz/mW. Due to the ability of being independently locked to two different wavelenghts, the conjoined double-cavity is universally suitable for hybrid quantum network consisting of various quantum nodes.

abstract: We compare and contrast the entangling properties of a three-well Bose-Hubbard model and an optical beamsplitter. The coupling between the different modes is linear in both cases, and we may identify two output modes. Obvious differences are that our Bose-Hubbard model, with only the middle well initially occupied, does not have a vacuum input port, there is no equivalent of a collisional, $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity with the beamsplitter, and the results of the Bose-Hubbard model show a time-dependence. In the non-interacting case, we obtain analytic solutions and show that, like a beamsplitter, the Bose-Hubbard system will not produce entanglement for classical initial states. We also show that whether inseparability or entanglement are detected depends sensitively on the criteria measured, with different criteria giving contradictory predictions.

abstract: We present a new approach based on real time domain Feynman path integrals (RTPI) for electronic structure calculations and quantum dynamics, which includes correlations between particles exactly but within the numerical accuracy. We demonstrate that incoherent propagation by keeping the wave function real is a novel method for finding and simulation of the ground state, similar to Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, but introducing new useful tools lacking in DMC. We use 1D Hooke's atom, a two-electron system with very strong correlation, as our test case, which we solve with incoherent RTPI (iRTPI) and compare against DMC. This system provides an excellent test case due to exact solutions for some confinements and because in 1D the Coulomb singularity is stronger than in two or three dimensional space. The use of Monte Carlo grid is shown to be efficient for which we determine useful numerical parameters. Furthermore, we discuss another novel approach achieved by combining the strengths of iRTPI and DMC. We also show usefulness of the perturbation theory for analytical approximates in case of strong confinements.

abstract: We explore the behavior in time of the energy exchange between a system of interest and its environment, together with its relationship to the non-Markovianity of the system dynamics. In order to evaluate the energy exchange we rely on the full counting statistics formalism, which we use to evaluate the first moment of its probability distribution. We focus in particular on the energy backflow from environment to system, to which we associate a suitable condition and quantifier, which enables us to draw a connection with a recently introduced notion of non-Markovianity based on information backflow. This quantifier is then studied in detail in the case of the spin-boson model, described within a second order time-convolutionless approximation, observing that non-Markovianity allows for the observation of energy backflow. This analysis allows us to identify the parameters region in which energy backflow is higher.

abstract: It is essential for a secure quantum key agreement protocol (QKA) to possess the fairness property in which all protocol participants contribute their information evenly for the construction of a shared secret key and none of them has the advantage to control (manipulate) even a bit of the key. This study shows that most of the existing QKAs cannot prevent a malicious participant from manipulating the shared secret key. To solve this problem, a model which describes the way to design a QKA with the fairness property is proposed. Based on the model, an example QKA is presented. Security analyses show that the proposed QKA is effective to resist not only outsider's eavesdropping attack but also insider's key manipulation.

abstract: We study the behavior of Quantum Darwinism (Zurek, [8]) within the iterative, random unitary operations qubit-model of pure decoherence (Novotny et al, [6]). We conclude that Quantum Darwinism, which describes the quantum mechanical evolution of an open system S from the point of view of its environment E, is not a generic phenomenon, but depends on the specific form of input states and on the type of S-E-interactions. Furthermore, we show that within the random unitary model the concept of Quantum Darwinism enables one to explicitly construct and specify artificial input states of environment E that allow to store information about an open system S of interest with maximal efficiency.

abstract: It is demonstrated that the computationally affordable nature of the Hessian of the fidelity functional in the GRAPE algorithm for quantum optimal control [N. Khaneja, T. Reiss, C. Kehlet, T. Schulte-Herbruggen, S.J. Glaser, J. Magn. Reson. 172 (2005) 296-305] leads to the possibility of using very efficient optimization techniques with quadratic convergence throughout the active space. In particular, the Newton-Raphson version of GRAPE with RFO regularized Hessian is shown in this communication to be significantly faster than all other algorithms in the GRAPE family. This communication describes the technical matters (matrix exponential recycling, Hessian regularization, etc.) involved in the implementation of the Newton-Raphson version of GRAPE and reports the benchmarks for the resulting method. The algorithm described in this communication is implemented in versions 1.7 and later of the Spinach library.

abstract: We explore the question of entanglement as a universal resource for implementing quantum measurements by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that for most multipartite systems (consisting of three or more subsystems), there is no entangled state from the same space that can enable all measurements by LOCC. This is in direct contrast to the bipartite case, where a maximally entangled state is an universal resource. Our results are obtained by considering the problem of local state discrimination using entanglement as a resource; and a key ingredient in our proofs is showing an equivalence between the problem of local state discrimination and that of unambiguous local state transformation. We also present partial characterization of universal resource states in multipartite systems.

abstract: Motivated by recent trapped-ion quantum simulation experiments, we carry out a comprehensive study of the phase diagram of a spin-1 chain with XXZ-type interactions that decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, using a combination of finite and infinite-size DMRG calculations, spin-wave analysis, and field theory. In the absence of long-range interactions, varying the spin-coupling anisotropy leads to four distinct phases: a ferromagnetic Ising phase, a disordered XY phase, a topological Haldane phase, and an antiferromagnetic Ising phase. If long-range interactions are antiferromagnetic and thus frustrated, we find primarily a quantitative change of the phase boundaries. On the other hand, ferromagnetic (non-frustrated) long-range interactions qualitatively impact the entire phase diagram. Importantly, for $\alpha\lesssim3$, long-range interactions destroy the Haldane phase, break the conformal symmetry of the XY phase, give rise to a new phase that spontaneously breaks a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry, and introduce an exotic tricritical point with no direct parallel in short-range interacting spin chains. We show that the main signatures of all five phases found could be observed experimentally in the near future.

abstract: Thermalization of a system in the presence of a heat bath has been the subject of many theoretical investigations especially in the framework of solid-state physics. In this setting, the presence of a large bandwidth for the frequency distribution of the harmonic oscillators schematizing the heat bath is crucial, as emphasized in the Caldeira-Leggett model. By contrast, ultracold gases in atomic traps oscillate at well-defined frequencies and therefore seem to lie outside the Caldeira-Leggett paradigm. We introduce interaction Hamiltonians which allow us to adapt the model to an atomic physics framework. The intrinsic nonlinearity of these models differentiates them from the original Caldeira-Leggett model and calls for a nontrivial stability analysis to determine effective ranges for the model parameters. These models allow for molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of ultracold gases, which is of current relevance for optimizing sympathetic cooling in degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures.

abstract: The identification of new solid-state defect qubit candidates in widely used semiconductors has the potential to enable the use of nanofabricated devices for enhanced qubit measurement and control operations. In particular, the recent discovery of optically active spin states in silicon carbide thin films offers a scalable route for incorporating defect qubits into on-chip photonic devices. Here we demonstrate the use of 3C silicon carbide photonic crystal cavities for enhanced excitation of color center defect spin ensembles in order to increase measured photoluminescence signal count rates, optically detected magnetic resonance signal intensities, and optical spin initialization rates. We observe up to a factor of 30 increase in the photoluminescence and ODMR signals from Ky5 color centers excited by cavity resonant excitation and increase the rate of ground-state spin initialization by approximately a factor of two. Furthermore, we show that the small excitation mode volume and enhanced excitation and collection efficiencies provided by the structures can be used to study inhomogeneous broadening in defect qubit ensembles. These results highlight some of the benefits that nanofabricated devices offer for engineering the local photonic environment of color center defect qubits to enable applications in quantum information and sensing.

abstract: It is possible to condense a macroscopic number of bosons into a single mode. Adding interactions the question arises whether the condensate is stable. For repulsive interaction the answer is positive with regard to the ground-state, but what about a condensation in an excited mode? We discuss some results that have been obtained for a 2-mode bosonic Josephson junction, and for a 3-mode minimal-model of a superfluid circuit. Additionally we mention the possibility to stabilize an unstable condensate by introducing periodic or noisy driving into the system: this is due to the Kapitza and the Zeno effects.

abstract: We consider the psychological effect of preference reversal and show that it finds a natural explanation in the frame of quantum decision theory. When people choose between lotteries with non-negative payoffs, they prefer a more certain lottery because of uncertainty aversion. But when people evaluate lottery prices, e.g. for selling to others the right to play them, they do this more rationally, being less subject to behavioral biases. This difference can be explained by the presence of the attraction factors entering the expression of quantum probabilities. Only the existence of attraction factors can explain why, considering two lotteries with close utility factors, a decision maker prefers one of them when choosing, but evaluates higher the other one when pricing. We derive a general quantitative criterion for the preference reversal to occur that relates the utilities of the two lotteries to the attraction factors under choosing versus pricing and test successfully its application on experiments by Tversky et al. We also show that the planning paradox can be treated as a kind of preference reversal.

abstract: We extend the range of quantum dot (QD) emission energies where electron and hole $g$ factors have been measured to the practically important telecom range. The spin dynamics in InAs/In$_{0.53}$Al$_{0.24}$Ga$_{0.23}$As self-assembled QDs with emission wavelengths at about 1.6 $\mu$m grown on InP substrate is investigated by pump-probe Faraday rotation spectroscopy in a magnetic field. Pronounced oscillations on two different frequencies, corresponding to the QD electron and hole spin precessions about the field are observed from which the corresponding $g$ factors are determined. The electron $g$ factor of about $-1.9$ has the largest negative value so far measured for III-V QDs by optical methods. This value, as well as the $g$ factors reported for other III-V QDs, differ from those expected for bulk semiconductors at the same emission energies, and this difference increases significantly for decreasing energies.

abstract: The Keldysh-ordered full counting statistics is a quasi-probability distribution describing the fluctuations of a time-integrated quantum observable. While it is well known that this distribution can fail to be positive, the interpretation and origin of this negativity has been somewhat unclear. Here, we show how the full counting statistics can be tied to trajectories through Hilbert space, and how this directly connects negative quasi-probabilities to an unusual interference effect. Our findings are illustrated with the example of energy fluctuations in a driven bosonic resonator; we discuss how negative quasi-probability here could be detected experimentally using superconducting microwave circuits.
