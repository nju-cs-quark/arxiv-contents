abstract: We present a review on the progress in the understanding and characterization of holonomy and topology of a discrete-time quantum walk architecture, consisting of a unitary step given by a sequence of two non-commuting rotations in parameter space \cite{Puentesarxiv}. Unlike other similar systems recently studied in detail in the literature, this system does not present continous 1D topological boundaries, it only presents a discrete number of Dirac points where the quasi- energy gap closes. At these discrete points the topological winding number is not defined. Therefore, such discrete points represent topological boundaries of dimension zero, and they endow the system with a non-trivial topology. We illustrate the non-trivial character of the system by calculating the Zak phase. We also propose a suitable experimental scheme to implement these ideas, and we present preliminary experimental data.

abstract: We present new quantum algorithms for Triangle Finding improving its best previously known quantum query complexities for both dense and spare instances. For dense graphs on $n$ vertices, we get a query complexity of $O(n^{5/4})$ without any of the extra logarithmic factors present in the previous algorithm of Le Gall [FOCS'14]. For sparse graphs with $m\geq n^{5/4}$ edges, we get a query complexity of $O(n^{11/12}m^{1/6}\sqrt{\log n})$, which is better than the one obtained by Le Gall and Shogo [ISAAC'15] when $m \geq n^{3/2}$. We also obtain an algorithm with query complexity ${O}(n^{5/6}(m\log n)^{1/6}+d_2\sqrt{n})$ where $d_2$ is the variance of the degree repartition. Our algorithms are designed and analyzed in a new model of learning graphs that we call extended learning graphs. In addition, we present a framework in order to easily combine and analyze them. As a consequence we get much simpler algorithms and analyses than previous algorithms of Le Gall {\it et al} based on the MNRS quantum walk framework [SICOMP'11].
