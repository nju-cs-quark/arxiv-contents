abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the optically detected magnetic resonance signals for ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in 13C isotopically enriched single-crystal diamond. We observe four broad transition peaks with superimposed sharp features at zero magnetic field and study their dependence on applied magnetic field. A theoretical model that reproduces all qualitative features of these spectra is developed. Understanding the magnetic-resonance spectra of NV centers in isotopically enriched diamond is important for emerging applications in nuclear magnetic resonance.

abstract: By analyzing the dissipative dynamics of a tunable gap flux qubit, we extract both sides of its two-sided environmental flux noise spectral density over a range of frequencies around $2k_BT/h \approx 1\,\rm{GHz}$, allowing for the observation of a classical-quantum crossover. Below the crossover point, the symmetric noise component follows a $1/f$ power law that matches the magnitude of the $1/f$ noise near $1\,{\rm{Hz}}$. The antisymmetric component displays a 1/T dependence below $100\,\rm{mK}$, providing dynamical evidence for a paramagnetic environment. Extrapolating the two-sided spectrum predicts the linewidth and reorganization energy of incoherent resonant tunneling between flux qubit wells.

abstract: A theoretical justification of the empirical surface hopping method for the laser-driven molecular dynamics is given utilizing the formalism of the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction [Abedi et al., PRL $\textbf{105}$, 123002 (2010)] in its quantum-classical limit. Employing an exactly solvable $\textrm H_2^{\;+}$-like model system, it is shown that the deterministic classical nuclear motion on a single time-dependent surface in this approach describes the same physics as stochastic (hopping-induced) motion on several surfaces, provided Floquet surfaces are applied. Both quantum-classical methods do describe reasonably well the exact nuclear wavepacket dynamics for extremely different dissociation scenarios. Hopping schemes using Born-Oppenheimer surfaces or instantaneous Born-Oppenheimer surfaces fail completely.

abstract: We demonstrate how an acoustic phonon bath when coupled to a quantum dot with the help of a bichromatic laser field may effectively form a quantum squeezed reservoir. This approach allows to achieve an arbitrary degree of squeezing of the effective reservoir and it incorporates the properties of the reservoir into two parameters, which can be controlled by varying the ratio of the Rabi frequencies of the bichromatic field. It is found that for unequal Rabi frequencies, the effective reservoir may appear as a quantum squeezed field of ordinary or inverted harmonic oscillators. When the Rabi frequencies are equal the effective reservoir appears as a perfectly squeezed field in which the decay of one of the polarization quadratures of the quantum dot dipole moment is inhibited. The decay of the quantum dot to a stationary state which depends on the initial coherence is predicted. This unusual result is shown to be a consequence of a quantum-nondemolition type coupling of the quantum dot to the engineered squeezed reservoir. The effect of the initial coherence on the steady-state dressed-state population distribution and the fluorescence spectrum is discussed in details. The complete polarization of the dressed state population and asymmetric spectra composed of only a single Rabi sideband peak are obtained under strictly resonant excitation.

abstract: Most of the work done in the field of Bose-Einstein condensates with balanced gain and loss has been performed in the mean-field approximation using the PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In this work we study the many-particle dynamics of a two-mode condensate with balanced gain and loss described by a master equation in Lindblad form whose purity periodically drops to small values but then is nearly completely restored. This effect cannot be covered by the mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed. We present analytic solutions for the dynamics in the non-interacting limit and use the Bogoliubov backreaction method to discuss the influence of the on-site interaction. Our main result is that the strength of the purity revivals is almost exclusively determined by the strength of the gain and loss and is independent of the amount of particles in the system and the interaction strength. For larger particle numbers, however, strong revivals are shifted towards longer times, but by increasing the interaction strength these strong revivals again occur earlier.

abstract: In a linear amplifier, the output signal is linearly related to the input signal with an additive noise that is independent of the input. Here we show that entanglement between the input signal and the amplifying medium can produce exponentially-large decoherence in an ideal optical amplifier even when the gain is arbitrarily close to unity and the added noise is arbitrarily small. These nonlinear effects show that the usual input/output relationship of a 'linear' amplifier does not provide a complete description of its performance.

abstract: We are able to detect clear signatures of dephasing -- a distinct trait of Many-Body Localisation (MBL) -- via the dynamics of two-sites entanglement, quantified through the concurrence. Using the protocol implemented in [Science {\bf 349}, 842 (2015)] we show that -- in the MBL phase -- the average two-site entanglement decays in time as a power law, while in the Anderson localised phase it tends to a plateau. The exponent of the power law is not universal and shows a clear dependence on the strength of the interaction. This behaviour is also qualitatively different in the ergodic phase where the two-site entanglement decays exponentially. All the results are obtained by means of time-dependent density matrix renormalisation group simulations; they are corroborated by analytical calculations on an effective model. Two-site entanglement has been already measured in cold atoms: Our analysis paves the way for the first direct experimental test of many-body dephasing in the MBL phase.

Here it is shown that transverse light dynamics in an optical resonator with off-axis longitudinal pumping can emulate a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum harmonic oscillator, providing an experimentally accessible system to investigate non-Hermitian coherent state propagation.

abstract: Highly controllable arrays of ions and ultra-cold atoms are providing exciting opportunities for realizing quantum simulators of complex many-body phenomena that can provide insights into unsolved problems in modern science. A fundamental step towards this goal is the development of protocols that can quantify how a quantum simulator builds up quantum correlations and stores quantum information starting from easily prepared uncorrelated states. Out-of-time-order correlation functions have been recently suggested as ideal probes to accomplish this task, because they can quantify the spreading, or "scrambling", of quantum information and set speed limits for thermalization. They might also enable experimental tests of the holographic duality between quantum and gravitational systems. Here we report experimental measurements of dynamics of out-of-time-order correlations in a quantum simulator of more than 100 ions in a Penning trap by using the many-body echo sequence developed in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance to probe the multiple quantum coherence spectrum. Our experiment involves the time reversal of the evolution under an all-to-all Ising Hamiltonian and allows us to measure the spin state purity, the spreading of many-body quantum coherences and the build-up of up to 8-body correlations. Comparisons to numerical simulations also allow us to use this protocol as a sensitive tool for quantifying and understanding various sources of decoherence. Our measurements pave the way for using time-reversal schemes for entanglement detection, quantum enhanced metrology, studies of quantum chaos, quantum phase transitions, and criticality.

abstract: We report on a source of heralded narrowband (3MHz) single photons compatible with solid-state spin-wave quantum memories based on praseodymium doped crystals. Widely non-degenerate narrow-band photon pairs are generated using cavity enhanced down conversion. One photon from the pair is at telecom wavelengths and serves as heralding signal, while the heralded single photon is at 606nm, resonant with an optical transition in Pr:YSO. The source offers a heralding efficiency of 28% and a generation rate exceeding 2000 pairs/mW in a single-mode. The single photon nature of the heralded field is confirmed by a direct antibunching measurement, with a measured antibunching parameter down to 0.010(4). Moreover, we investigate in detail photon cross- and autocorrelation functions proving non-classical correlations between the two photons. The results presented in this paper represent significant improvement over the state of the art and offer prospects for the demonstration of single photon spin-wave storage in an on-demand solid state quantum memory, heralded by a telecom photon.

abstract: In this work, with focus on the energy transport properties in quantum, low dimensional, graded materials, we address the investigation of the energy (and spin) current in XXZ open chains with graded inner structures and driven out of equilibrium by magnetization pumping applied at the ends. We study several types of graded structures in different situations in order to show a ubiquitous occurrence of energy rectification, even for the system under a homogeneous magnetic field. Due to technical difficulties, we carry out the computation for small chains, but we present arguments which indicate the extension of some results to larger systems. Recalling the generic existence of energy rectification in classical, graded materials, which are described by anharmonic chains of oscillators, and recalling also the anharmonicity of these XXZ models, which involve quartic terms in more transparent representation in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators, we may say that our results extend the ubiquity of energy rectification occurrence in classical graded materials to the case of quantum systems.

abstract: Adiabatic quantum state evolution can be accelerated through a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. In one approach, a counterdiabatic quantum Hamiltonian $\hat H_{CD}$ is constructed to suppress nonadiabatic excitations. In the analogous classical problem, a counterdiabatic classical Hamiltonian $H_{CD}$ ensures that the classical action remains constant even under rapid driving. Both the quantum and classical versions of this problem have been solved for the special case of scale-invariant driving, characterized by linear expansions, contractions or translations of the system. Here we investigate an example of a non-scale-invariant system -- a tilted piston. We solve exactly for the classical counterdiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{CD}(q,p,t)$, which we then quantize to obtain a Hermitian operator $\hat H_{CD}(t)$. Using numerical simulations, we find that $\hat H_{CD}$ effectively suppresses non-adiabatic excitations under rapid driving. These results offer a proof of principle -- beyond the special case of scale-invariant driving -- that quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity can successfully be constructed from their classical counterparts.

abstract: Quantum mechanics is known to provide significant improvements in information processing tasks when compared to classical computational models. These advantages range from computational speeds-ups to security improvements. Here we study protocols based on the quantum stabilizer formalism within Spekkens' toy model by extending the toy stabilizer notation. As the toy model is a local hidden variable theory no computational improvements are observed. On the other hand, we show that other types of advantages can be shown to arise in the toy model. We first provide explicit constructions for the impossibility of toy bit-commitment and the existence of a toy error correction protocol and consequent $k-$threshold secret sharing. Then, defining a toy computational model based on the quantum one-way computer we prove the existence of a blind and verified protocol. Importantly, these two quantum protocols are known to achieve a better-than-classical security. Our results suggest that such quantum improvements need not arise from any Bell-type non locality or contextuality, but rather as a consequence of steering correlations.

abstract: We use a Raman four-wave mixing process to read out light from an atomic coherence which is continuously written. This realizes a continuous source of polaritons having been delayed or effectively stored for a finite duration. Contrary to slow-light delay, which depends on the atom number and population distribution, here the effective storage duration is determined solely by intensive properties of the system, approaching the ground-state natural lifetime at the weak driving limit. The generated polaritons are background free. We experimentally probe these properties utilizing spatial atomic diffusion as an 'internal clock' for the write-read delay. A continuous source of delayed polaritons can replace discrete write-read procedures when the atomic evolution is the subject of interest, for example, when dipolar interactions lead to retrieval of non-classical light.

abstract: We investigate the dispersion relations for light coupled to one-dimensional ensembles of atoms with different level schemes. The unifying feature of all the considered setups is that the forward and backward propagating quantum fields are coupled by the applied classical drives such that the group velocity can vanish in an effect known as ``stationary light''. We derive the dispersion relations for all the considered schemes, highlighting the important differences between them. Furthermore, we show that additional control of stationary light can be obtained by treating atoms as discrete scatterers and placing them at well defined positions. For the latter purpose, a multi-mode transfer matrix theory for light is developed.

abstract: Consequences of an exceedingly strong electric field (E field) on the ground state energetics and transport properties of a 2D spinless electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field (a Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) configuration) are investigated to all orders in the fields. For a conventional semiconductor, we find fractional values of the Hall conductivity and some magnetoelectric coefficients for certain values of E and B fields that do not result from interactions or impurities, but are a pure consequence of a strong enough in-plane E field. We also determine analytically the ground state energy, and response properties such as magnetization and polarization as functions of the electromagnetic field in the strong E field limit. In the case of Graphene, we obtain more complex behaviors leading to the possibility of irrational Hall values. The results are also qualitatively discussed in connection to various mechanisms for the QHE-breakdown.

abstract: The appearance of linear spaces, describing physical quantities by vectors and tensors, is ubiquitous in all of physics, from classical mechanics to the modern notion of local Lorentz invariance. However, as natural as this seems to the physicist, most computer scientists would argue that something like a "local linear tangent space" is not very typical and in fact a quite surprising property of any conceivable world or algorithm. In this paper, we take the perspective of the computer scientist seriously, and ask whether there could be any inherently information-theoretic reason to expect this notion of linearity to appear in physics. We give a series of simple arguments, spanning quantum information theory, group representation theory, and renormalization in quantum gravity, that supports a surprising thesis: namely, that the local linearity of space-time might ultimately be a consequence of the linearity of probabilities. While our arguments involve a fair amount of speculation, they have the virtue of being independent of any detailed assumptions on quantum gravity, and they are in harmony with several independent recent ideas on emergent space-time in high-energy physics.

abstract: Exotic topological states of matter such as Floquet topological insulator or Floquet Weyl semimetal can be induced by periodic driving. This work proposes a Floquet semimetal with Floquet-band holonomy. That is, the system is gapless, but as a periodic parameter viewed as quasimomentum of a synthetic dimension completes an adiabatic cycle, each Floquet band as a whole exchanges with other Floquet bands. The dynamical manifestations of such Floquet-band holonomy are studied. Under open boundary conditions, we discover anomalous chiral edge modes localized only at one edge, winding around the entire quasienergy Brillouin zone, well separated from bulk states, and possessing holonomy different from bulk states. These remarkable properties are further exploited to realize quantized or half-quantized edge state pumping.

abstract: Ultracold quantum gases offer a fascinating playground for exploring and understanding the fundamentals of out-of-equilibrium behaviour of quantum matter. Experimental systems whose many-body dynamics can be described by exactly solvable models play a particularly important role. A paradigmatic example in this realm is the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas of impenetrable bosons. Here we investigate and predict a striking dynamical manifestation of the impenetrability--a collective many-body bounce effect. This effect, while being invisible in the evolution of the in-situ density profile of the gas, can be revealed through a nontrivial narrowing of its momentum distribution during breathing-mode oscillations. To demonstrate this, we develop an exact finite-temperature dynamical theory of a harmonically trapped TG gas, thus extending on previous zero-temperature results and opening the way to solving arbitrary dynamical protocols of the TG gas. We identify physical regimes for observing the many-body bounce effect and foresee it as a valuable probe for characterising the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum fluids.

abstract: We consider recently introduced solutions of Einstein gravity with minimally coupled massless scalars. The geometry is homogeneous, isotropic and asymptotically anti de-Sitter while the scalar fields have linear spatial-dependent profiles. The spatially-dependent marginal operators dual to scalar fields cause momentum dissipation in the deformed dual CFT. We study the effect of these marginal deformations on holographic entanglement measures and Wilson loop. We show that the structure of the universal terms of entanglement entropy for d(>2)-dim deformed CFTs is corrected depending on the geometry of the entangling regions. In d = 2 case, the universal term is not corrected while momentum relaxation leads to a non-critical correction. We also show that decrease of the correlation length causes: the phase transition of holographic mutual information to happen at smaller separations and the confinement/deconfinement phase transition to take place at smaller critical lengths. The effective potential between point like external objects also gets corrected. We show that the strength of the corresponding force between these objects is an increasing function of the momentum relaxation parameter.

abstract: Theoretical achievements, as well as much controversy surround multiverse theory. Various types of multiverses, with an increasing amount of complexity, were suggested and thoroughly discussed by now. While these types are very different, they all share the same basic idea - our physical reality consists of more than just one universe. Each universe within a possibly huge multiverse might be slightly or even very different from the others. The quilted multiverse is one of these types, whose uniqueness arises from the postulate that every possible event will occur infinitely many times in infinitely many universes. In this paper we show that the quilted multiverse is not self-consistent due to the instability of entropy decrease under small perturbations. We therefore propose a modified version of the quilted multiverse which might overcome this shortcoming. It includes only those universes where the minimal entropy occurs at the same instant of (cosmological) time.

abstract: Within a plane-wave approach, a number of scattering events in a generic collision process is insensitive to an overall complex phase of a transition amplitude, although this phase is extremely important for a number of problems, especially in hadronic physics at the LHC energies. In reality, however, the particles are better described as localized wave packets with the mean momenta $p$, their uncertainties $\sigma$, and here we show that the observables grow dependent upon this phase if one lays aside the simplified plane-wave model. A relative contribution of the phase to the cross section is generally attenuated by a small factor $\sigma^2/p^2 \ll 1$, making its experimental measurement a rather challenging task. We discuss two methods for probing how this phase changes with the transferred momentum $t$, either by colliding two beams at a non-zero impact-parameter (say, $pp \rightarrow X$) or by employing the states with the non-trivial wave functions, for instance, vortex particles carrying orbital angular momentum or the Airy beams. In both these scenarios, the phase contribution is of the order of $\sigma/p$, which is $\sim 0.1\% - 1\%$ for protons and, hence, is no longer prohibitively small.

abstract: We examine the dynamics of nearest-neighbor bipartite concurrence and total correlations in the spin-1/2 XXZ model with random fields. We show, starting from factorized random initial states, that the concurrence can suffer entanglement sudden death in the long time limit and therefore may not be a useful indicator of the properties of the system. In contrast, we show that the total correlations capture the dynamics more succinctly, and further reveal a fundamental difference in the dynamics governed by the ergodic versus many-body localized phases, with the latter exhibiting dynamical oscillations. Finally, we consider an initial state composed of several singlet pairs and show that by fixing the correlation properties, while the dynamics do not reveal noticeable differences between the phases, the long-time values of the correlation measures appear to indicate the critical region.

abstract: We study quantum enhancement of transport in open systems in the presence of disorder and dephasing. Quantum coherence effects may significantly enhance transport in open systems even in the deep classical regime (where the decoherence rate is greater than the inter-site hopping amplitude), as long as the disorder is sufficiently strong. When the strengths of disorder and dephasing are fixed, there is an optimal opening strength at which the coherent transport enhancement is optimized. Analytic results are obtained in two simple paradigmatic tight-binding models of large systems: the linear chain and the fully connected network. The physical behavior is also reflected in the FMO photosynthetic complex, which may be viewed as intermediate between these paradigmatic models.

As a cavity couples simultaneously to $N$ molecules, understanding this requires understanding collective behavior. We show how the exact eigenstates of the $N$-molecule problem can be found in polynomial time. Using such exact solutions, we construct a simple ansatz which, in the one excitation sector, accurately reproduces both the minimum energy and the full quantum state of the $N$-molecule problem.

This enabled an improved test of molecular theory (including QED), new constraints on the size of possible effects due to 'new physics', and the first determination of the proton-electron mass ratio from a molecule. Here, we provide the details of the experimental procedure, spectral analysis, and the assessment of systematic frequency shifts. Our analysis focuses in particular on deviations of the HD+ velocity distribution from thermal (Gaussian) distributions under the influence of collisions with fast ions produced during (laser-induced) chemical reactions, as such deviations turn out to significantly shift the hyperfine-less vibrational frequency as inferred from the saturated and Doppler-broadened spectrum, which contains partly unresolved hyperfine structure.

title: Optimal Efficiency of Heat Engines with Finite-Size Heat Baths
authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Masahito Hayashi
comments: Main: 16pages, 3figures Appendix: 21pages The second and third versions treat essentially the same topics as the first version, and give a substantial expansion of the first version. Because the first version has problems in the formulation, we gives a new formulation for quantum and classical heat engines in arXiv:1504.06150v2. The second and third versions are based on the new formulation
