abstract: We study state transfer in quantum walk on graphs relative to the adjacency matrix. Our motivation is to understand how the addition of pendant subgraphs affect state transfer. For two graphs $G$ and $H$, the Frucht-Harary corona product $G \circ H$ is obtained by taking $|G|$ copies of the cone $K_{1} + H$ and by connecting the conical vertices according to $G$. Our work explores conditions under which the corona $G \circ H$ exhibits state transfer. We also describe new families of graphs with state transfer based on the corona product. Some of these constructions provide a generalization of related known results.
