**1.    Quantum-limited estimation of continuous spontaneous localization**

<blockquote>
<p>
We apply the formalism of quantum estimation theory to extract information about potential collapse mechanisms of the continuous spontaneous localisation (CSL) form. In order to estimate the strength with which the field responsible for the CSL mechanism couples to massive systems, we consider the optomechanical interaction between a mechanical resonator and a cavity field. We demonstrate the experimental viability of strategies for the estimation of the coupling strength by either probing the oscillator or the electromagnetic field that drives its motion.In particular, we concentrate on all-optical measurements, such as homodyne and heterodyne measurements. We also compare the performances of such strategies with those of a spin-assisted optomechanical system, where the estimation of the CSL parameter is performed through time-gated spin-like measurements.

<blockquote>
<p>
The discovery of topological insulators sparked significant interest in the investigation of topological material properties. Quantum walks constitute a versatile platform for simulating transport phenomena including topological features in highly controllable setups. We experimentally implement the scheme proposed by Tarasinski et al. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 042327 (2014)] using our photonic time multiplexed discrete-time quantum walk system, directly accessing and measuring the relevant topological invariants. Our tunable coin operation allows to reach distinct topological phases, and accordingly observe topological phase transitions. Being able to read-out the position and the coin state, we measure scattered reflection amplitudes which are directly related to the topological invariants. By interfacing two samples with known, experimentally determined, topological invariants we observe localised edge states of verified topological origin. The predicted robustness of the found edge states against disorder and perturbation has been tested and verified in large ensemble measurements.
