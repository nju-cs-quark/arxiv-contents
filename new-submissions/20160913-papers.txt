abstract: In a recent work [\href{this http URL}{Phys. Rev. A 86, 042113 (2012)}] the question of persistency of entanglement and nonlocality of multi-party systems under particle loss has been addressed. This question is of immense importance considering the practical realization of the information theoretic tasks which make use of the power of quantum correlations. But in multipartite scenario more interesting cases arise since subsystems can also possess genuineness in correlation which is prevalently inequivalent to the bipartite scenario. In this work, we investigate the persistency of such genuine correlations under particle loss. Keeping in mind the practical importance, considerable attention has been devoted to find the multipartite states which exhibit maximal persistency of genuine correlations.

abstract: We analyze the fundamental resolution of incoherent optical point sources from the perspective of a quantum detection problem: deciding whether the optical field on the image plane is generated by one source or two weaker sources with arbitrary separation. We investigate the detection performances of two measurement methods recently proposed by us to enhance the estimation of the separation. For the detection problem, we show that the method of binary spatial-mode demultiplexing is quantum-optimal for all values of separations, while the method of image-inversion interferometry is near-optimal for sub-Rayleigh separations. Unlike the proposal by Helstrom, our schemes do not require the separation to be given and can offer that information as a bonus in the event of a successful detection. For comparison, we also demonstrate the supremacy of our schemes over direct imaging for sub-Rayleigh separations. These results demonstrate that simple linear optical measurements can offer supremal performances for both detection and estimation.

abstract: Quasiclassical dynamics of trapped ions is described by applying the time dependent variational principle (TDVP) on coherent state orbits, introduced as sub-manifolds of the quantum state space. The classical Hamilton functions associated to the system are obtained as the expected values of the quantum Hamiltonian on symplectic coherent states. Such formalism can be applied to Hamilton functions which are nonlinear in the infinitesimal generators of a dynamical symmetry group. We give the explicit expression of the quantum Hamilton function in case of nonlinear electromagnetic traps. Discrete quasienergy spectra result, and the corresponding quasienergy states are explicitly realized as coherent states parameterized by the stable solutions of the corresponding classical equations of motion. A dequantization algorithm is also suggested. The method is then applied to combined (Paul and Penning) and ideal Paul traps. We obtain the explicit expressions of the classical Hamilton functions for such particular traps, as well as the classical Hamilton equations of motion in complex coordinates for an octupole trap. In the pseudopotential approximation, the points of minimum of the Hamiton function define equilibrium configurations for trapped ions, of interest for quantum logic.

abstract: We take a tour of a set of equiangular lines in eight-dimensional Hilbert space. This structure defines an informationally complete measurement, that is, a way to represent all quantum states of three-qubit systems as probability distributions. Investigating the shape of this representation of state space yields a pattern of connections among a remarkable spread of mathematical constructions. In particular, studying the Shannon entropy of probabilistic representations of quantum states leads to an intriguing link between the questions of real and of complex equiangular lines. Furthermore, we will find relations between quantum information theory and mathematical topics like octonionic integers and the 28 bitangents to a quartic curve.

abstract: We develop a general dynamical theory for studying a single photon transport in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to multiple emitters which can be either identical or non-identical. In this theory, both the effects of the waveguide and non-waveguide vacuum modes are included. This theory enables us to investigate the propagation of an emitter excitation or an arbitrary single photon pulse along an array of emitters coupled to a 1D waveguide. The dipole-dipole interaction induced by the non-waveguide modes, which is usually neglected in the literatures, can significantly modify the dynamics of the emitter system as well as the characteristics of output field if the emitter separation is much smaller than the resonance wavelength. Non-identical emitters can also strongly couple to each other if their energy difference is smaller than or of the order of the dipole-dipole energy shift. Interestingly, if their energy difference is close but non-zero, a very narrow transparency window around the resonance frequency can appear which does not occur for identical emitters. This phenomenon may find important applications in quantum waveguide devices such as optical switch and ultra narrow single photon frequency comb generator.

abstract: We observe spin squeezing in three-component Bose gases where all three hyperfine states are coupled by synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of spin-orbit coupling, as can be seen clearly from an effective spin Hamiltonian. By solving this effective model analytically with the aid of a Holstein-Primakoff transformation for spin-1 system in the low excitation limit, we conclude that the spin-nematic squeezing, a novel category of spin squeezing existing exclusively in large spin systems, is enhanced with increasing spin-orbit intensity and effective Zeeman field, which correspond to Rabi frequency and two-photon detuning within the Raman scheme for synthetic spin-orbit coupling, respectively. These trends of dependence are in clear contrast to spin-orbit coupling induced spin squeezing in spin-1/2 systems. We also analyze the effects of harmonic trap and interaction with realistic experimental parameters numerically, and find that a strong harmonic trap favors spin-nematic squeezing. We further show spin-nematic squeezing can be interpreted as two-mode entanglement or two-spin squeezing at low excitation. Our findings can be observed in ^{87}Rb gases with existing techniques of synthetic spin-orbit coupling and spin-selectively imaging.

abstract: We study an implementation of the open GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm well suited for large open quantum systems. While typical implementations of optimal control algorithms for open quantum systems rely on a transformation to Liouville space, our implementation avoid this transformation which leads to a polynomial speed-up of the open GRAPE algorithm in cases of interest. As an example, we apply our implementation to active reset of a readout resonator in circuit QED. In this problem, the shape of a microwave pulse is optimized to steer the cavity state towards its ground state as fast as possible. Using our open GRAPE implementation, we obtain pulse shapes leading to a reset time over four times faster than typical passive reset.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.03174
abstract: An interferometric technique is proposed for determining the spatial forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many body system can absorb energy from its environment. The method separates out the coherent excitations present at any given frequency; it is not necessary to infer modal content from spectra. The system under test is excited with two external sources, which create generalized forces, and the fringe in the total power dissipated is measured as the relative phase between the sources is varied. If the complex fringe visibility is measured for different pairs of source locations, the anti-Hermitian part of the complex-valued non-local correlation tensor can be determined, which can then be decomposed to give the natural dynamical modes of the system and their relative responsivities. If each source in the interferometer creates a different kind of force, the spatial forms of the individual excitations that are responsible for cross-correlated response can be found. The technique is a generalization of holography because it measures the state of coherence to which the system is maximally sensitive. It can be applied across a wide range of wavelengths, in a variety of ways, to homogeneous media, thin films, patterned structures, and to components such as sensors, detectors and energy harvesting absorbers.

abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum parameter estimation in the presence of the most general Gaussian dissipative reservoir. We derive lower bounds on the precision of phase estimation and a closely related problem of frequency estimation. For both problems we show that it is impossible to achieve Heisenberg limit asymptotically in the presence of such a reservoir. However, we also find that for any fixed number of probes used in the setup there exists a Gaussian dissipative reservoir, which, in principle, allows for the Heisenberg-limited performance for that number of probes. We discuss a realistic implementation of a frequency estimation scheme in the presence of a Gaussian dissipative reservoir in a cavity system.

abstract: A quantum algorithm to solve the parity problem is better than its most efficient classical counter- part with a separation that is polynomial in the number of queries. This was shown by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani and was one of the earliest indications that the quantum information processing can outperform the classical one by a significant margin. The problem and its solution both is usually stated for a 2-level system since we generally work with bits/qubits. However, many works have been done generalizing known quantum computing techniques to higher level systems. Following this, we look at a generalization of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm implemented on a general qudit system.

abstract: We experimentally study a homodyne detection technique for the characterization of a quadrature squeezed field where the correlated bands, here created by four-wave mixing in a hot atomic vapor, are separated by a large frequency gap of more than 6 GHz. The technique uses a two-frequency local oscillator to detect the fluctuations of the correlated bands at a frequency accessible to the detection electronics. Working at low detection frequency, the method allows for the determination of both the amplitude and the phase of the squeezing spectrum. In particular, we show that the quadrature squeezing created by our four-wave mixing process displays a noise ellipse rotation of $\pi/2$ across the squeezing spectrum

abstract: A possible explanation for the seemingly random nature of the measurement result in quantum mechanics was recently proposed by Sparenberg et al. In this approach, a measurement result is simply determined by the microscopic state of the measuring device. This interpretation led to a new discussion of Mott's problem, i.e. the paradoxical appearance of linear tracks in a cloud-chamber measurement of a radioactive source emitting spherical waves. It was proposed that the appearance of particular linear tracks was actually determined by the (random) positions of atoms or molecules inside the chamber. In the present work, we further explore this hypothesis, both analytically and numerically, in the framework of a recently established one-dimensional model by Carlone et al. In this model, meshes of localized spins 1/2 play the role of the cloud-chamber atoms and the spherical wave is replaced by a linear superposition of two wave packets moving from the origin to the left and to the right, evolving deterministically according to the Schroedinger equation. We first revisit these results using a time-dependent approach, where the wave packets impinge on a symmetric two-sided detector. We discuss the evolution of the wave function in the configuration space and stress the interest of a non-symmetric detector in a quantum-measurement perspective. Next we use a time-independent approach to study the scattering of a plane wave on a single-sided detector. Preliminary results are obtained, analytically for the single-spin case and numerically for up to 8 spins. They show that the spin-excitation probabilities are sometimes very sensitive to the parameters of the model, which corroborates the idea that the measurement result could be determined by the atom positions. The possible origin of decoherence and entropy increase in future models is finally discussed.

abstract: Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have already found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated electron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum computing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the gauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe the recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered dynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the corresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time, associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently, despite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the solution of prime factorization.

abstract: Schmidt decomposition is a widely employed tool of quantum theory which plays a key role for distinguishable particles in scenarios such as entanglement characterization, theory of measurement and state purification. Yet, it is held not to exist for identical particles, an open problem forbidding its application to analyze such many-body quantum systems. Here we prove, using a newly developed approach, that the Schmidt decomposition exists for identical particles and is thus universal. We find that it is affected by single-particle measurement localization and state overlap. We study paradigmatic two-particle systems where identical qubits and qutrits are located in the same place or in separated places. For the case of two qutrits in the same place, we show that their entanglement behavior, whose physical interpretation is given, differs from that obtained before by different methods. Our results are generalizable to multiparticle systems and open the way for further developments in quantum information theory when particle identity counts as a resource.

abstract: Random number generators are essential to ensure performance in information technologies, including cryptography, stochastic simulations and massive data processing. The quality of random numbers ultimately determines the security and privacy that can be achieved, while the speed at which they can be generated poses limits to the utilisation of the available resources. In this work we propose and demonstrate a quantum entropy source for random number generation on an indium phosphide photonic integrated circuit made possible by a new design using two-laser interference and heterodyne detection. The resulting device offers high-speed operation with unprecedented security guarantees and reduced form factor. It is also compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology, opening the path to its integration in computation and communication electronic cards, which is particularly relevant for the intensive migration of information processing and storage tasks from local premises to cloud data centres.

abstract: Here, the particle-wave duality principle is generalized to accommodate the non-relativistic quantum mechanics of interacting (correlated) particles. Through the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of walkers in physical and in Hilbert spaces one can correctly predict the ground state and the time evolution of a subsystem of a larger quantum system in a quantum Monte Carlo manner. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be constructed straightforwardly through a random sampling (windowing) applied to the mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that although the resulting individual quantum trajectories may differ significantly from those predicted by the many-body Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the particle distribution and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction can be accounted for correctly using an explicitly parameterized quantum non-locality.

abstract: In many non-linear systems, such as plasma oscillation, boson condensation, chemical reaction, and even predatory-prey oscillation, the coarse-grained dynamics are governed by an equation containing anti-symmetric transitions, known as the anti-symmetric Lotka-Volterra (ALV) equations. In this work, we prove the existence of a novel bifurcation mechanism for the ALV equations, where the equilibrium state can be drastically changed by flipping the stability of a pair of fixed points. As an application, we focus on the implications of the bifurcation mechanism for evolutionary networks; we found that the bifurcation point can be determined quantitatively by the quantum entanglement in the microscopic interactions. The equilibrium state can be critically changed from one type of global demographic condensation to another state that supports global cooperation for homogeneous networks. In other words, our results indicate that there exist a class of many-body systems where the macroscopic properties are, to some extent, insensitive to a small amount of microscopic entanglement, but they can be changed abruptly when the entanglement exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence showing that the emergence of bifurcation is robust against the change of the network topologies, and the critical values are in good agreement with our theoretical prediction. These results show that the bifurcation mechanism could be ubiquitous in many physical systems, apart from evolutionary networks.

abstract: We theoretically derive the lower and upper bounds of quantum Fisher information (QFI) of an SU(1,1) interferometer whatever the input state chosen. According to the QFI, the crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be large intramode correlations indicated by the Mandel $Q$-parameter. For a photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state with high super-Poissonian statistics in one input port and a coherent state in the other input port, the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound of the SU(1,1) interferometer can beat $1/\langle\hat{N}\rangle$ scaling in presence of large fluctuations in the number of photons, with a given fixed input mean number of photons. The definition of the Heisenberg limit (HL) should take into account the amount of fluctuations. The HL considering the number fluctuation effect may be the ultimate phase limit.

abstract: We theoretically explore manipulation of interactions between excited and ground state atoms at nanoscale separations by cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). We develop an adiabatic molecular dressed state formalism and show that it is possible to generate Fano-Feshbach resonances between ground and long-lived excited-state atoms inside a cavity. The resonances are shown to arise due to non-adiabatic coupling near a pseudo-crossing between the dressed state potentials. We illustrate our results with a model study using fermionic $^{171}$Yb atoms in a two-modal cavity. Our study is important for manipulation of interatomic interactions at low energy by cavity field.

The proposed technique leads to a deeper understanding of biphoton interference and coherence, and opens the way to the development of novel schemes for retrieving information on the relative position and the spatial structure of distant objects, which is of interest in remote sensing, biomedical imaging, as well as monitoring of laser ablation, when first-order imaging and interference are not feasible.

abstract: It is shown that observable physical properties can impose conditions on the selection of electromagnetic gauge (i.e. sets of potentials) that are explicit and restrictive. To preserve the propagation property of a transverse field such as that of a laser, the sole acceptable gauges are those that differ from the radiation gauge by a transformation function that depends only on light-cone coordinates. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. In the quantum case, it is further true for the important example of an electron bound in an atom and irradiated by a laser field, that only the radiation gauge can satisfy all physical conditions exactly. A counter-example is given of a set of potentials that describes fields correctly, but that violates physical constraints. The basic conclusions are that physical requirements place stringent limits on acceptable gauges; and that potentials are more fundamental than fields in both classical and quantum physics. These important properties are lost if the dipole approximation is employed. Practical consequences for strong-field physics are fundamental.

This indicates that the path of test particle is made up of integral multiples of a fundamental Compton-type unit of length $h/mc$.

abstract: We introduce a minimalistic quantum model of coupled heat and particle transport. The system is composed of two spins, each coupled to a different bath and to a particle which moves on a ring consisting of three sites. We show that a spin current can be generated and the particle can be set into motion at a speed and direction which sensitively depends not only on the baths' temperatures, but also on the various system parameters. This current can withstand dissipative processes, such as dephasing. Furthermore, the particle can perform work against an external driving, thus operating as an efficient quantum motor, whose implementation could be envisaged in trapped ions or solid state systems. A two-particle extension of the model shows that particle interactions can qualitatively change the induced current, even causing current inversion.

It is known that the spectrum of $H$ depends on the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator $L=-\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+\omega^2-\lambda V(x)$ and it changes substantially as $\inf\sigma(L)$ switches sign. We prove that in the critical case, $\inf\sigma(L)=0$, the spectrum of $H$ is purely essential and covers the interval $[0,\infty)$. In the subcritical case, $\inf\sigma(L)>0$, the essential spectrum starts from $\omega$ and there is a non-void discrete spectrum in the interval $[0,\omega)$. We also derive a bound on the corresponding eigenvalue moments.

abstract: The current-carrying steady-state that arises in the middle of a metallic wire connected to macroscopic leads is characterized regarding its response functions, correlations and entanglement entropy. The spectral function and the dynamical structure factor show clear non-equilibrium signatures accessible by state-of-the-art techniques. In contrast with the equilibrium case, the entanglement entropy is extensive with logarithmic corrections at zero-temperature that depend on the wire-leads coupling and, in a non-analytic way, on voltage. This shows that some robust universal quantities found in gapless equilibrium phases do not persist away from equilibrium.

In the literature one can find some suggestions that some of false (unstable) vacuum states may survive up to times when their survival probability has a non-exponential form. At asymptotically late times the survival probability as a function of time $t$ has an inverse power--like form. We show that at this time region the energy of the false vacuum states tends to the energy of the true vacuum state as $1/t^{2}$ for $t \to \infty$. This means that the energy density in the unstable vacuum state should have analogous properties and hence the cosmological constant $\Lambda = \Lambda (t)$ too. The conclusion is that $\Lambda$ in the Universe with the unstable vacuum should have a form of the sum of the "bare" cosmological constant and of the term of a type $1/t^{2}$: $\Lambda(t) \equiv \Lambda_{bare} + d/ t^{2}$ (where $\Lambda_{bare}$ is the cosmological constant for the Universe with the true vacuum).

abstract: We demonstrate coincidence measurements of spatially entangled photons by means of a novel type of multi-pixel based detection array. The adopted sensor is a fully digital 8$\times$16 silicon photomultiplier array allowing not only photon counting but also per-pixel time stamping of the arrived photons with a resolution of 65 ps. Together with a frame rate of 500 kfps, this property exceeds the capabilities of conventional charge-coupled device cameras which have become of growing interest for the detection of transversely correlated photon pairs. The sensor is used to measure a second-order correlation function for various non-collinear configurations of entangled photons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The experimental results are compared to theory.

abstract: We consider eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ perturbed by a generic perturbation $V$ modelled by a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Using the supersymmetry approach we derive analytical results for the statistics of the eigenvectors, which are non-perturbative in $V$ and valid for an arbitrary deterministic $H_0$. Further we generalise them to the case of a random $H_0$, focusing, in particular, on the Rosenzweig-Porter model. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.
