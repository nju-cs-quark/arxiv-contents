abstract: The solution of the Feinberg-Horodecki (FH) equation for a time-dependent mass (TDM) harmonic oscillator quantum system is studied. A certain interaction is applied to a mass to provide a particular spectrum of stationary energies. The related spectrum of the harmonic oscillator potential acting on the TDM oscillators is found. We apply the time version of the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) to calculate analytical expressions of the TDM stationary state energies and their wave functions. It is shown that the obtained solutions reduce to those of simple harmonic oscillator as the time-dependent of the mass reduces to

abstract: The classical and quantum representations of thermal equilibrium are strikingly different, even for free, non-interacting particles. While the first involves particles with well-defined positions and momenta, the second usually involves energy eigenstates that are delocalized over a confining volume. In this paper, we derive convex decompositions of the density operator for non-interacting, non-relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium that allow for a connection between these two descriptions. Associated with each element of the decomposition is a many-particle wave function that involves a set of wave packets; the distribution of the average positions and momenta of the wave packets can be linked to the classical description of thermal equilibrium, while the different amplitudes in the wave function capture the statistics relevant for fermions or bosons.

abstract: The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) diagnoses quantum chaos and the scrambling of quantum information via the spread of entanglement. The OTOC encodes forward and reverse evolutions and has deep connections with the flow of time. So do fluctuation theorems such as Jarzynski's Equality, derived in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. I unite these two powerful, seemingly disparate tools by deriving a fluctuation theorem for the OTOC. The fluctuation theorem is analogous to Jarzynski's Equality. The theorem's left-hand side equals the OTOC. The right-hand side implies a platform-nonspecific protocol for experimentally measuring the OTOC in an indirect manner fundamentally different from existing proposals. Time evolution need not be reversed in any trial. The theorem opens holography, condensed matter, and quantum information to new insights from fluctuation theorems and vice versa.

abstract: Effective transition between the population-inverted optical eigenmodes of two coupled microcavities carrying mechanical oscillation realizes a phonon analogue of optical two-level laser. By providing an approach that linearizes the dynamical equations of weak nonlinear systems without relying on their steady states, we study such phonon laser action as a realistic dynamical process, which exhibits time-dependent stimulated phonon field amplification especially when one of the cavities is added with optical gain medium. The approach we present explicitly gives the conditions for the optimum phonon lasing, and thermal noise is found to be capable of facilitating the phonon laser action significantly.

abstract: We calculate that an appropriate modification of the field associated with only one of the photons of a photon-pair can suppress generation of the pair entirely. From this general result, we develop a method for suppressing the generation of undesired photon-pairs utilizing photonic stop-bands. For a third-order nonlinear optical source of frequency-degenerate photons we calculate the modified frequency spectrum (joint spectral intensity or JSI) and show a significant increase in a standard metric, the coincidence to accidental ratio (CAR). These results open a new avenue for photon-pair frequency correlation engineering.

abstract: A major advantage in using Szegedy's formalism over discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks lies in its ability to define a unitary quantum walk on directed and weighted graphs. In this paper, we present a general scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits for Szegedy quantum walks that correspond to classical Markov chains possessing transformational symmetry in the columns of the transition matrix. In particular, the transformational symmetry criteria do not necessarily depend on the sparsity of the transition matrix, so this scheme can be applied to non-sparse Markov chains. Two classes of Markov chains that are amenable to this construction are cyclic permutations and complete bipartite graphs, for which we provide explicit efficient quantum circuit implementations. We also prove that our scheme can be applied to Markov chains formed by a tensor product. We also briefly discuss the implementation of Markov chains based on weighted interdependent networks. In addition, we apply this scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits simulating the Szegedy walks used in the quantum Pagerank algorithm for some classes of non-trivial graphs, providing a necessary tool for experimental demonstration of the quantum Pagerank algorithm.

abstract: Recently [Cavalcanti et al. Nat Commun 6, 7941 (2015)] proposed a method to certify the presence of entanglement in asymmetric networks, where some users do not have control over the measurements they are performing. Such asymmetry naturally emerges in realistic situtations, such as in cryptographic protocols over quantum networks. Here we implement such semi-device independent techniques to experimentally witness all types of entanglement on a three-qubit photonic W state. Furthermore we analise the amount of genuine randomness that can be certified in this scenario from any bipartition of the three-qubit W state.

We witness genuine ten-photon entanglement with an observed fidelity of $\bar F_{\text{exp}}=0.606\pm0.029$. Our results are further verified faithfully by calculating the $p$-value, which is upper bounded by $3.7\times10^{-3}$ under a hypothesis test. Our experiment open a new way to efficiently engineer multi-photon entanglement based on thin BiB$_{3}$O$_{6}$ crystals, and provide a promising platform for investigations of advanced optical quantum information processing tasks such as boson sampling, quantum error correction and quantum-enhanced measurement.

abstract: The harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency has a family of linear quantum invariants for the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which are determined by any two independent solutions to the classical equation of motion. Ermakov and Pinney have shown that a general solution to the time-dependent oscillator with an inverse cubic term is expressed in terms of two independent solutions to the time-dependent oscillator. We explore the connection between linear quantum invariants and Ermakov-Pinney solution for the time-dependent harmonic oscillator. We advance a novel method to construct Ermakov-Pinney solutions to a class of time-dependent oscillators and the wave functions for time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We further show that the first and second P\"{o}schl-Teller potentials belong to a special class of exact time-dependent oscillators.

abstract: We vary the time-frequency mode structure of ultrafast pulse-pumped modulational instability (MI) in an argon-filled hollow-core kagom\'e-style PCF by adjusting the pressure, pump pulse chirp, fiber length and parametric gain. Compared to solid-core systems, the pressure dependent dispersion landscape brings increased flexibility to the tailoring of frequency correlations. The resulting mode content is characterized by measuring the multimode second-order correlation function g(2) and by directly observing frequency correlations in single-shot MI spectra. We show that, from such measurements, the shapes and weights of time-frequency Schmidt (TFS) modes can be extracted and that the number of modes directly influences the shot-to-shot pulse-energy and spectral-shape fluctuations in MI. Using this approach we are able to change the number of TFS modes from 1.3 (g(2) = 1.75) to 4 (g(2) = 1.25) using only a single fiber.

abstract: A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice, through local unitaries. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac equation). Recently it was discovered that prior grouping and encoding allows for more general continuum limit equations (e.g. the Dirac equation in $(1+1)$ curved spacetime). In this paper, we extend these results to arbitrary space dimension and internal degree of freedom. We recover an entire class of PDEs encompassing the massive Dirac equation in $(3+1)$ curved spacetime. This means that the metric field can be represented by a field of local unitaries over a lattice.

The spin and pseudo-spin symmetries are considered. The correct bound state spectra and their corresponding wave functions are obtained. We seek such a solution using the biconfluent Heun differential equation method. Further, we give some of our results at the end of this study. Our final results can be reduced to their non-relativistic forms by simply using some appropriate transformations. The spectra, in the spin and pseudo-spin symmetries, are very similar with a slight difference in energy spacing between different states.

abstract: The partial transpose (PT) is an important function for entanglement testing and quantification and also for the study of geometrical aspects of the quantum state space. In this article, considering general bipartite and multipartite discrete systems, explicit formulas ready for the numerical implementation of the PT and of related entanglement functions are presented and the Fortran code produced for that purpose is described. What is more, we obtain an analytical expression for the Hilbert-Schmidt entanglement of two-qudit systems and for the associated closest separable state. In contrast to previous works on this matter, we only use the properties of the PT, not applying Lagrange multipliers.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a transmon qubit that is capacitively coupled to an open multimode superconducting resonator. Our effective equations are derived by eliminating resonator degrees of freedom while encoding their effect in the Green's function of the electromagnetic background. We account for the dissipation of the resonator exactly by employing a spectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of non-Hermitian modes and show that it is possible to derive effective Heisenberg-Langevin equations without resorting to the rotating wave, two level or Markov approximations. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived to systematically account for the nonlinearity of the transmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission, capturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid for any qubit-resonator coupling strength.

abstract: In this paper we analyze the quantum phase estimation problem using continuous-variable, entangled squeezed coherent states (quasi-Bell states). We calculate the quantum Fisher information having the quasi-Bell states as probe states and find that both squeezing and entanglement might bring advantages, increasing the precision of the phase estimation compared to protocols which employ other continuous variable states, e.g., coherent or non-entangled states. We also study the influence of a linear (unitary) perturbation during the phase estimation process, and conclude that entanglement is a useful resource in this case as well.

abstract: We construct and classify chiral topological phases in driven (Floquet) systems of strongly interacting bosons, with finite-dimensional site Hilbert spaces, in two spatial dimensions. The construction proceeds by introducing exactly soluble models with chiral edges, which in the presence of many body localization in the bulk are argued to lead to stable chiral phases. These chiral phases do not require any symmetry, and in fact owe their existence to the absence of energy conservation in driven systems. Surprisingly, we show that they are classified by a quantized index, taking the form of the logarithm of a rational number, which can be related to the flow of quantum information. We explicitly compute this index for specific models, and show that the nontrivial topology leads to edge thermalization, which provides an interesting link between bulk topology and chaos at the edge. Some parallels with the free fermion Floquet topological phases are discussed, and possible experimental implementations are mentioned.

By considering a realistic exciton-polariton field in a appropriately designed microcavity, we show that the antibunching should emerge in such semiconductor system where nonclassical signatures have remained elusive to date.

abstract: By perceiving gauge invariance as an analytical tool in order to get insight into the states of the "generalized Landau problem" (a charged quantum particle moving inside a magnetic, and possibly electric field), and motivated by an early article that correctly warns against a naive use of gauge transformation procedures in the usual Landau problem (i.e. with the magnetic field being static and uniform), we first show how to bypass the complications pointed out in that article by solving the problem in full generality through gauge transformation techniques in a more appropriate manner. Our solution provides in simple and closed analytical forms all Landau Level-wavefunctions without the need to specify a particular vector potential. This we do by proper handling of the so-called pseudomomentum K (or of a quantity that we term pseudoangular momentum Lz), a method that is crucially different from the old warning argument, but also from standard treatments in textbooks and in research literature (where the usual Landau wavefunctions are employed - labeled with canonical momenta quantum numbers). Most importantly, we go further by showing that a similar procedure can be followed in the more difficult case of spatially-nonuniform magnetic fields: in such case we define K and Lz as plausible generalizations of the previous ordinary case, namely as appropriate line integrals of the inhomogeneous magnetic field - our method providing closed analytical expressions for all stationary state wavefunctions.. (see paper) ... also provide explicit Berry's phase calculations and their connection to probability currents and ...issues in elementary Quantum Mechanics and Condensed Matter Physics. As an added feature, we also show how the possible presence of an additional electric field can be treated through a further generalization of pseudomomenta and their proper handling.

abstract: We study the excitation energy transfer (EET) for a simple model in which a virtual massless scalar particle is exchanged between two molecules. If the time interval is finite, then the finite size effect generally appears in a transition amplitude through the regions where the wave nature of quanta remains. We calculated the transition amplitude for EET and obtained finite size corrections to the standard formula derived by using Fermi's golden rule. These corrections for the transition amplitude appear outside the resonance energy region. The estimation in a photosynthesis system indicates that the finite size correction could reduce the EET time considerably.

abstract: Work fluctuation and total entropy production play crucial roles in small thermodynamic systems subject to large thermal fluctuations. We investigate a trade-off relation between them in a nonequilibrium situation in which a system starts from an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. We apply the variational method to study this problem and find a stationary solution against variations over protocols that describe the time dependence of the Hamiltonian of the system. Using the stationary solution, we find the minimum of the total entropy production for a given amount of work fluctuation. An explicit protocol that realizes this minimum is constructed from an adiabatic process followed by a quasi-static process. The obtained results suggest how one can control the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system while suppressing its work fluctuation and total entropy production.

The q-deformed hyperbolic Rosen-Morse potential is perturbed by q-deformed non-central trigonometric Scarf potentials, where whole of them can be solved by using Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM). This work is limited to spin symmetry case. The relativistic energy equation and orbital quantum number equation lD-1 have been obtained using Asymptotic Iteration Method. The upper radial wave function equations and angular wave function equations are also obtained by using this method. The relativistic energy levels are numerically calculated using Mat Lab, the increase of radial quantum number n causes the increase of bound state relativistic energy level both in dimension D = 5 and D = 3. The bound state relativistic energy level decreases with increasing of both deformation parameter q and orbital quantum number nl.

abstract: Clathrate hydrates hold considerable promise as safe and economical materials for hydrogen storage. Here we present a quantum mechanical study of H$_2$ and D$_2$ diffusion through a hexagonal face shared by two large cages of clathrate hydrates over a wide range of temperatures. Path integral molecular dynamics simulations are used to compute the free-energy profiles for the diffusion of H$_2$ and D$_2$ as a function of temperature. Ring polymer molecular dynamics rate theory, incorporating both exact quantum statistics and approximate quantum dynamical effects, is utilized in the calculations of the H$_2$ and D$_2$ diffusion rates in a broad temperature interval. We find that the shape of the quantum free-energy profiles and their height relative to the classical free energy barriers at a given temperature, as well as the rate of diffusion, are profoundly affected by competing quantum effects: above 25 K, zero-point energy (ZPE) perpendicular to the reaction path for diffusion between cavities decreases the quantum rate compared to the classical rate, whereas at lower temperatures tunneling outcompetes the ZPE and as result the quantum rate is greater than the classical rate.

abstract: In standard localization microscopy methods a small number of emitters are sparsely photoswitched, typically not more than one flourophore per diffraction limited spot, limiting the temporal resolution of super-resolved images. Localization of a non-sparse scene requires a precise estimate for the number of active emitters. Quantum correlations in the emitted fluorescence can probe the number of activated emitters, exploiting the fact that a single fluorophore emits a single photon at a time. To obtain this additional information, which is not provided by conventional cameras, we employ a new imaging configuration based on single-photon avalanche detectors (SPAD). Here we demonstrate a 20nm resolution localization and single-particle tracking (SPT) of non-sparsely activated emitters, which may facilitate super-resolved imaging at enhanced temporal resolution.

Most importantly, we observe a clear experimental signature of the counterintuitive weak collapse, namely that making the system more unstable can result in a smaller particle loss. We experimentally determine the scaling laws that govern the weak-collapse atom loss, providing a benchmark for the general theories of nonlinear wave phenomena.
