abstract: Secure positioning, a prover located at a specified position convinces a set of verifiers at distant reference stations that he/she is indeed at the specific position, is considered to be impossible if the prover and verifiers have no pre-shared data while dishonest provers have an arbitrary amount of pre-shared entanglement [Nature 479, 307-308 (2011)]. We argue here that current impossibility results for secure positioning are the upshot of not utilizing full powers of relativistic quantum information theory and show that secure positioning and hence position-based quantum cryptography is possible if causal structure of Minkowski space time and quantum non-locality is used properly.

abstract: We present and investigate an analogue model for a controllable photon geberation via the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in a cavity containing a degenerate optical amplifier (OPA) which is pumed by an amplitude-modulated field. The time modulation of the pump field in the model OPA system is equivalent to a periodic modulation of the cavity length, which is responsible for the generation of the Casimir radiation. By taking into account the rapidly oscillating terms of the modulation frequency, the effects of the corresponding counter-rotating terms (CRTs) on the analogue Casimir radiation emerge clearly. We find that the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical properties exhibit oscillatory behaviors, which are controllable through the modulation frequency as an external control parameter.We also recognize a new phenomenon, the so-called "Anti-DCE," in which pair photons can be coherently annihilated due to the time-modulated pumping. We show that the Casimir radiation exhibits quadrature squeezing, photon bunching and super-Poissonian statistics which are controllable by modulation frequency. We also calculate the power spectrum of the intracavity light field. We find that the appearance of the side bands in the spectrum is due to the presence of the CRTs.

abstract: The influence of outside quantum noises on the amplification of weak measurements is investigated. Three typical quantum noises are discussed. The maximum values of the pointer's shifts decrease sharply with the strength of the depolarizing channel and phase damping. In order to obtain significant amplified signals, the preselection quantum systems must be kept away from the two quantum noises. Interestingly, the amplification effect is immune to the amplitude damping noise.

abstract: Topological entanglement entropy, which is defined as the conditional mutual information of a state for an annular region in a topologically ordered system, is widely used to detect characteristic topological correlations in topologically ordered phases. We investigate an information-theoretical meaning of the topological entanglement entropy by analyzing a multi-partite correlation measure called irreducible correlation. We prove that the topological entanglement entropy is equivalent to the irreducible correlation if the state has zero-correlation length. We further show that for zero-correlation length states the irreducible correlation is equal to the maximum communication rate of a particular class of secret sharing protocols. Therefore, we provide an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy.

abstract: We introduce a family of operations in quantum mechanics that one can regard as "universal quantum measurements" (UQMs). These measurements are applicable to all finite-dimensional quantum systems and entail the specification of only a minimal amount of structure. The first class of UQM that we consider involves the specification of the initial state of the system---no further structure is brought into play. We call operations of this type "tomographic measurements", since given the statistics of the outcomes one can deduce the original state of the system. Next, we construct a disentangling operation, the outcome of which, when the procedure is applied to a general mixed state of an entangled composite system, is a disentangled product of pure constituent states. This operation exists whenever the dimension of the Hilbert space is not a prime, and can be used to model the decay of a composite system. As another example, we show how one can make a measurement of the direction along which the spin of a particle of spin s is oriented (s = 1/2, 1, ...). The required additional structure in this case involves the embedding of CP(1) as a rational curve of degree 2s in CP(2s).

abstract: Quantum nonlocality and contextuality are two phenomena stemming from nonclassical correlations. Whereas the former requires entanglement that is consumed in the measurement process the latter can occur for any state if one chooses a proper set of measurements. Despite this stark differences experimental tests of both phenomena were similar so far. For each run of the experiment one had to use a different copy of a physical system prepared according to the same procedure, or the system had to be brought to its initial state. Here we show that this is not necessary and that the state-independent contextuality can be manifested in a scenario in which each measurement round is done on an output state from the previous round.

abstract: A state is called Maximally Multipartite Entangled State (MMES) if it is maximally entangled according to any balanced bipartition. Such states are also important in setting up quantum networks. In this work, we introduce a method for creating such states or very good approximations of them, by gluing Bell states in a step by step manner. Three different strategies based on linear, star and branch geometries are investigated. Beside creating GHZ, W and asymmetric W states, we obtain other entangled states up to seven-qubit states. In each case we calculate the measure of multiparty entanglement first introduced in [1, 2] in the form of an average of purity over all bi-partitions.

abstract: In this work we propose a practical entanglement classification scheme for pure states of $2\times L\times M\times N\times H$, under the stochastic local operation and classical communication (SLOCC), which generalizes the method explored in the entanglement classification of $2\times L\times M\times N$ to the five-partite system. The entangled states of $2\times L\times M\times N\times H$ system are first classified into different coarse-grained standard forms using matrix decompositions, and then fine-grained identification of two inequivalent entangled states with the same standard form are completed by using the matrix realignment technique. As an practical example, entanglement classes of the five-qubit system of $2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ are presented.

abstract: A randomly walking quantum particle searches in Grover's $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ iterations for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices by repeatedly querying an oracle that flips the amplitude at the marked vertex, scattering by a "coin" flip, and hopping. Physically, however, potential energy barriers can hinder the hop and cause the search to fail, even when the amplitude of not hopping decreases with $N$. We correct for these errors by interpreting the quantum walk search as an amplitude amplification algorithm and modifying the phases applied by the coin flip and oracle such that the amplification recovers the $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ runtime.

abstract: Nuclear spin registers in the vicinity of electron spins in solid state systems offer a powerful resource to address the challenge of scalability in quantum architectures. We investigate here the properties of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins surrounding donor atoms in silicon, and consider the use of such spins, combined with the donor nuclear spin, as a quantum register coupled to the donor electron spin. We find the coherence of the nearby $^{29}$Si nuclear spins is effectively protected by the presence of the donor electron spin, leading to coherence times in the second timescale - over two orders of magnitude greater than the coherence times in bulk silicon. We theoretically investigate the use of such a register for quantum error correction, including methods to protect nuclear spins from the ionisation/neutralisation of the donor, which is necessary for the re-initialisation of the ancillae qubits. This provides a route for multi-round quantum error correction using donors in silicon.

abstract: We investigate the role of dissipation in excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPT) within the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Signatures of the ESQPT are directly visible in the complex spectrum of an effective Hamiltonian, whereas they get smeared out in the time-dependence of system observables. In the latter case, we show how delayed feedback control can be used to restore the visibility of the ESQPT signals.

abstract: The static and dynamic properties of many-body quantum systems are often well described by collective excitations, known as quasiparticles. Engineered quantum systems offer the opportunity to study such emergent phenomena in a precisely controlled and otherwise inaccessible way. We present a spectroscopic technique to study artificial quantum matter and use it for characterizing quasiparticles in a many-body system of trapped atomic ions. Our approach is to excite combinations of the system's fundamental quasiparticle eigenmodes, given by delocalised spin waves. By observing the dynamical response to superpositions of such eigenmodes, we extract the system dispersion relation, magnetic order, and even detect signatures of quasiparticle interactions. Our technique is not limited to trapped ions, and it is suitable for verifying quantum simulators by tuning them into regimes where the collective excitations have a simple form.

abstract: We study the problem of remote one-qubit mixed state creation using a pure initial state of two-qubit sender and spin-1/2 chain as a connecting line. We express the parameters of creatable states in terms of transition amplitudes. We show that the creation of complete receiver's state-space can be achieved only in the chain engineered for the one-qubit perfect state transfer (PST) (for instance, in the fully engineered Ekert chain), the chain can be arbitrarily long in this case. As for the homogeneous chain, the creatable receiver's state region decreases quickly with the chain length. Both homogeneous chains and chains engineered for PST can be used for the purpose of selective state creation, when only the restricted part of the whole receiver's state space is of interest. Among the parameters of the receiver's state, the eigenvalue is the most hard creatable one and therefore deserves the special study. Regarding the homogeneous spin chain, an arbitrary eigenvalue can be created only if the chain is of no more then 34 nodes. Alternating chain allows us to increase this length up to 68 nodes.

The Hamiltonian of the system considered contains some explicit time-dependence in addition to one resulting from being minimally coupled to a time-dependent magnetic field. The eigenvalue equations for the two spinor components of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant are found to decouple into a pair of supersymmetric invariants in a similar fashion as the known decoupling for the time-independent Dirac Hamiltonians.

Calculation of the correlated counting rate distributions in the ghost image plane and diffraction plane show that agreement between collapse and non-collapse models is obtained if the signal is assumed to collapse into a specific mixed state. However, if the signal is assumed to collapse into a pure state, significant differences arise between the predictions of the two collapse models.

abstract: In ultracold atoms settings, inelastic light scattering is a preeminent technique to reveal static and dynamic properties at nonzero momentum. In this work, we investigate an array of one-dimensional trapped Bose gases, by measuring both the energy and the momentum imparted to the system via light scattering experiments. The measurements are performed in the weak perturbation regime, where these two quantities - the energy and momentum transferred - are expected to be related to the dynamical structure factor of the system. We discuss this relation, with special attention to the role of in-trap dynamics on the transferred momentum.

abstract: We consider a two-dimensional weakly interacting ultracold Bose gas whose constituents are two-level atoms. We study the effects of a synthetic density-dependent gauge field that arises from laser-matter coupling in the adiabatic limit with a laser configuration such that the single-particle zero-order vector potential corresponds to a constant synthetic magnetic field. We find a new exotic type of current non-linearity in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which affects the dynamics of the order parameter of the condensate. We investigate the rotational properties of this system, focusing in particular on the physical conditions that make the nucleation of a quantized vortex in the system energetically favourable with respect to the non rotating solution. We point out that two different physical interpretations can be given to this new non linearity: firstly it can be seen as a local modification of the mean field coupling constant, whose value depends on the angular momentum of the condensate. Secondly, it can be interpreted as a density modulated angular velocity given to the cloud. Looking at the problem from both of these viewpoints, we analyze the physical conditions that make a single vortex state energetically favourable. In the Thomas-Fermi limit, we show that the effect of the new nonlinearity is to induce a rotation to the condensate, where the transition from non-rotating to rotating states depends on the density of the cloud.

abstract: We denote by $M^n$ the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Given a fixed density matrix $\beta:\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ and a fixed unitary operator $U : \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, the transformation $\Phi: M^n \to M^n$ $$ Q \to \Phi (Q) =\, \text{Tr}_2 (\,U \, ( Q \otimes \beta )\, U^*\,)$$ describes the interaction of $Q$ with the external source $\beta$. The result of this is $\Phi(Q)$. If $Q$ is a density operator then $\Phi(Q)$ is also a density operator. The main interest is to know what happen when we repeat several times the action of $\Phi$ in an initial fixed density operator $Q_0$. This procedure is known as random repeated quantum iterations and is of course related to the existence of one or more fixed points for $\Phi$. In \cite{NP}, among other things, the authors show that for a fixed $\beta$ there exists a set of full probability for the Haar measure such that the unitary operator $U$ satisfies the property that for the associated $\Phi$ there is a unique fixed point $ Q_\Phi$. Moreover, there exists convergence of the iterates $\Phi^n (Q_0) \to Q_\Phi$, when $n \to \infty$, for any given $Q_0$ We show here that there is an open and dense set of unitary operators $U: \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n $ such that the associated $\Phi$ has a unique fixed point. We will also consider a detailed analysis of the case when $n=2$. We will be able to show explicit results. We consider the $C^0$ topology on the coefficients of $U$. In this case we will exhibit the explicit expression on the coefficients of $U$ which assures the existence of a unique fixed point for $\Phi$. Moreover, we present the explicit expression of the fixed point $Q_\Phi$

abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of efficient and robust energy transfer in organic systems provides us with new insights for the optimal design of artificial systems. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of excitation energy transfer (EET) through a complex quantum network by a toy model consisting of three sites coupled to environments. We study how the coherent evolution and the noise-induced decoherence work together to reach efficient EET and illustrate the role of the phase factor attached to the coupling constant in the EET. By comparing the differences between the Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, we discuss the effect of environment and the spatial structure of system on the dynamics and the efficiency of EET. A intuitive picture is given to show how the exciton is transferred through the system. Employing the simple model, we show the robustness of EET efficiency under the influence of the environment and elucidate the important role of quantum coherence in EET. We go further to study the quantum feature of the EET dynamics by {\it quantumness} and show the importance of quantum coherence from a new respect. We calculate the energy current in the EET and its quantumness, results for different system parameters are presented and discussed.

abstract: Achieving controllable coupling of dopants in silicon is crucial for operating donor-based qubit devices, but it is difficult because of the small size of donor-bound electron wavefunctions. Here we report the characterization of a quantum dot coupled to a localized electronic state, and we present evidence of controllable coupling between the quantum dot and the localized state. A set of measurements of transport through this device enable the determination of the most likely location of the localized state, consistent with an electronically active impurity in the quantum well near the edge of the quantum dot. The experiments we report are consistent with a gate-voltage controllable tunnel coupling, which is an important building block for hybrid donor and gate-defined quantum dot devices.
