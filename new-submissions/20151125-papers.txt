abstract: We propose a generalization of the superconducting circuit simulation of the dynamical Casimir effect where we consider relativistically moving boundary conditions following different trajectories. We study the feasibility of the setup used in the past to simulate the dynamical Casimir effect to reproduce richer relativistic trajectories differing from purely sinusoidal ones. We show how different relativistic oscillatory trajectories of the boundaries of the same period and similar shape produce a rather different spectrum of particles characteristic of their respective motions.

abstract: In the context of a physical theory, two devices, A and B, described by the theory are called incompatible if the theory does not allow the existence of a third device C that would have both A and B as its components. Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ``no-cloning'' and ``no information without disturbance''; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.

abstract: We propose to implement tunable interaction of superconducting flux qubits with cavity-assisted interaction and strong driving. The qubits have a three-level Lambda configuration, and the decay of the excited state will be greatly suppressed due to the effective large detuning. The implemented interaction is insensitive to the cavity field state and can be controlled by modulating the phase difference of the driving fields of the qubits. In particular, our scheme is based on the typical circuit QED setup and thus will provide a simple method towards the tunable interaction of superconducting qubits. Finally, we consider the generation of two and four qubits entangled states with the constructed interaction under the influence of typical decoherence effects.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize controllable quantum state transfer and entanglement generation among transmon qubits in the typical circuit QED setup based on adiabatic passage. Through designing the time-dependent driven pulses applied on the transmon qubits, we find that fast quantum sate transfer can be achieved between arbitrary two qubits and quantum entanglement among the qubits also can also be engineered. Furthermore, we numerically analyzed the influence of the decoherence on our scheme with the current experimental accessible systematical parameters. The result shows that our scheme is very robust against both the cavity decay and qubit relaxation, the fidelities of the state transfer and entanglement preparation process could be very high. In addition, our scheme is also shown to be insensitive to the inhomogeneous of qubit-resonator coupling strengths.

abstract: We study Gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. We present a Gaussian channel description of quantum state evolution under the influence of Hawking radiation. We find that thermal noise introduced by Hawking effect will destroy the steerability between an inertial observer Alice and an accelerated observer Bob who hovers outside an event horizon, while it generates steerability between Bob and a hypothetical observer Anti-Bob inside the event horizon. Besides, unlike entanglement behaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from Alice to Bob suffers from a ``sudden death" and the steering from Anti-Bob to Bob appears a ``sudden birth" with the increasing of Hawking temperature. We also find that the Gaussian steering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry can \emph{ exceed} $\ln 2$ in curved spacetime, which is quite different from the flat spacetime case [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 060403 (2015)] where the steering asymmetry can \emph{never} exceed $\ln 2$. We conclude that $\ln2$ would not be a general bound of Gaussian steering asymmetry.

abstract: We consider a chain of trapped ions to interact with each other via long-range interactions. This system can be used to simulate the long-range Ising model. We study the dynamics of quantum coherence of a single spin in the chain, where the spins are initially prepared in their upper states. The relaxation dynamics exhibits due to the genuine long-range interaction. The degree of quantum coherence of a single spin rapidly decreases and vanishes in the steady state. However, our numerical result suggests that the conventional spin chain model, which truncates the interactions between the distant spins, cannot show the relaxation dynamics. This implies that the usual truncation in approximating the long-range interaction is not applicable to describing the non-equilibrium dynamics. The effect of the interaction range on the relaxation dynamics is studied. The higher relaxation rate will show if a system has a longer range of interaction. However, it takes a longer relaxation time in the vicinity of infinite interaction range. We also examine the dynamics of quantum coherence of a block of spins. Our result may shed light on the relationship between long-range interaction and the coherence dynamics of a quantum many-body system.

abstract: A background-independent quantization of the Universe near its Big Bang singularity is considered using a drastically simplified toy model. Several conceptual issues are addressed. (1) The observable spatial-geometry characteristics of our empty-space expanding Universe is sampled by the time-dependent operator $Q=Q(t)$ of the distance between two space-attached observers (``Alice and Bob''). (2) For any pre-selected guess of the simple, non-covariant time-dependent observable $Q(t)$ one of the Kato's exceptional points (viz., $t=\tau_{(EP)}$) is postulated {\em real-valued}. This enables us to treat it as the time of Big Bang. (3) During our ``Eon'' (i.e., at all $t>\tau_{(EP)}$) the observability status of operator $Q(t)$ is mathematically guaranteed by its self-adjoint nature with respect to an {\em ad hoc} Hilbert-space metric $\Theta(t) \neq I$. (4) In adiabatic approximation (i.e., in Heisenberg picture) the passage of the Universe through its $t=\tau_{(EP)}$ singularity is interpreted as a quantum phase transition between the preceding and the present Eon. It is worth adding that in our model the widely accepted ``Big Bounce'' regularization of the classical Big Bang singularity after quantization gets replaced by the full-fledged quantum degeneracy. At the quantum-phase-transition singularity, operator $Q(\tau_{(EP)})$ becomes unobservable and acquires a non-diagonalizable Jordan-block structure.

abstract: We prepare single phonon Fock state of mechanical mode in optomechanical system based on photon subtraction process in the linear regime of optomechanical interaction. The correlation set between cavity and field modes is utilized to recast the state of a pre-cooled mechanical mode into a single phonon Fock state as the field mode is subjected to a photon subtraction type measurement at a dynamical instant of interaction time. The resultant conditional state of mechanical mode quantified by its Wigner function, exhibits an excellent compatibility with the standard single quantum Fock state. We confirm the nature of obtained state by calculating the phonon statistics, and conditional fidelity which approaches to unity for an instantaneous measurement time within an appropriate choice of parametric regime. Moreover, we also study the effects of temperature parameter for the preparation of target state. The present scheme can be realized to engineer the single quantum Fock state of macroscopic mechanical mode with currently available technology.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that our physical reality is influenced by events that can potentially happen but factually do not occur. Interaction-free measurements (IFMs) exploit this counterintuitive influence to detect the presence of an object without requiring any interaction with it. Here we propose and realize an IFM concept based on an unstable many-particle system. In our experiments, we employ an ultracold gas in an unstable spin configuration which can undergo a rapid decay. The object - realized by a laser beam - prevents this decay due to the indirect quantum Zeno effect and thus, its presence can be detected without interacting with a single atom. Contrary to existing proposals, our IFM does not require single-particle sources and is only weakly affected by losses and decoherence. We demonstrate confidence levels of 90%, well beyond previous optical experiments.

Lett. 111, 023004) to a single ion laser-cooled in a micro fabricated surface trap. The branching fraction for the decay into the 5s 2 S 1/2 ground level was found to be p = 0.9453 +0.0007 --0.0005. This result is in good agreement with recent theoretical calculations but disagrees with previous experimental measurements, however affected by a one order of magnitude larger uncertainty. This experiment also demonstrates the reliability and the performances of ion micro trap technology in the domain of precision measurements and spectroscopy.

abstract: We investigate Landau-Zener processes modeled by a two-level quantum system, with its finite bias energy varied in time and in the presence of a single broadened cavity mode at zero temperature. By applying the hierarchy equation method to the Landau-Zener problem, we computationally study the survival fidelity of adiabatic states without Born, Markov, rotating-wave or other perturbative approximations. With this treatment it also becomes possible to investigate cases with very strong system-bath coupling. Different from a previous study of infinite-time Landau-Zener processes, the fidelity of the time-evolving state as compared with instantaneous adiabatic states shows non-monotonic dependence on the system-bath coupling and on the sweep rate of the bias. We then consider the effect of applying a counter-diabatic driving field, which is found to be useful in improving the fidelity only for sufficiently short Landau-Zener processes. Numerically exact results show that different counter-diabatic driving fields can have much different robustness against environment effects. Lastly, using a case study we discuss the possibility of introducing a dynamical decoupling field in order to eliminate the decoherence effect of the environment and at the same time to retain the positive role of a counter-diabatic field. Our work indicates that finite-time Landau-Zener processes with counter-diabatic driving offer a fruitful test bed to understand controlled adiabatic processes in open systems.

abstract: Ultra strong electromagnetic fields can lead to a breakdown of the vacuum and the spontaneous creation of single or multiple electron-positron pairs. A quantum field theoretical treatment of the pair creation process combined with numerical methods provides a complete description of the quantum field state, from which all observables of the multiple electron-positron pairs can be inferred. This allows to study the complex multi-particle dynamics of electron-positron pair creation in-depth, including multi-pair statistics as well as momentum distributions and spin. To illustrate the potential benefit of this approach, it is applied to the intermediate regime of pair creation between nonperturbative Schwinger pair creation and perturbative multiphoton pair creation where the creation of multi-pair states becomes nonnegligible but cascades do not yet set in. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how spin and helicity of the created electrons and positrons are affected by the polarization of the counterpropagating laser fields, which induce the creation of electron-positron pairs.

abstract: The addressability of parallel spatially multimode quantum memory for light allows one to control independent collective spin waves within the same cold atomic ensemble. Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the pump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the mutual evolution and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of collective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that these modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on--demand transverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the directions, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this allows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a given set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can retrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable superpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output signal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a controllable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the delays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence. We elaborate the theory of such light--matter interface for the spatially multivariate cavity-based off--resonant Raman--type quantum memory. Since in order to speed up the manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories it might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time shape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond the bad cavity limit.

abstract: We consider the bound states of a system consisting of a light particle and two heavy bosonic ones, which are restricted in their quantum mechanical motion to two space dimensions. The interaction between the two heavy particles is established by a $p$-wave resonance in the heavy-light short-range potential. Due to large ratio of atomic masses this system is perfectly suited for applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this way we show that this planar three-body system has a Coulomb energy spectrum with a Gaussian cut-off.

abstract: We analyze a family of singular Schr\"odinger operators with local singular interactions supported by a hypersurface $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 2$, being the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, bounded or unbounded, not necessarily connected. At each point of $\Sigma$ the interaction is characterized by four real parameters, the earlier studied case of $\delta$- and $\delta'$-interactions being particular cases. We discuss spectral properties of these operators and derive operator inequalities between those referring to the same hypersurface but different couplings and describe their implications for spectral properties.

abstract: We show that the generating functional for scalar theories admits a representation which is dual with respect to the one by Schwinger, interchanging the role of the free and interacting terms. It maps $\int V(\delta_J)$ and $J\Delta J$ to $\delta_{\phi_c}\Delta\delta_{\phi_c}$ and $\int V(\phi_c)$, respectively, with $\phi_c=\int J\Delta$ and $\Delta$ the Feynman propagator. Comparing the Schwinger representation with its dual version leads to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff relation $$ \exp(Z_0[J]) \exp(-\smallint V(\delta_J))\exp(-Z_0[J]) = \exp(-Z_0[\delta_{\phi_c}])\exp(-\smallint V(\phi_c)) $$

abstract: In this paper, we attempt the theoretical modeling of the magnetic tunnel junctions with embedded magnetic and nonmagnetic nanoparticles (NPs). A few abnormal tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effects, observed in related experiments, can be easily simulated within our model: we found, that the suppressed TMR magnitudes and the TMR sign-reversing effect at small voltages are related to the electron momentum states of the NP located inside the insulating layer. All these TMR behaviors can be explained within the tunneling model, where NP is simulated as a quantum well (QW). The coherent (direct) double barrier tunneling is dominating over the single barrier one. The origin of the TMR suppression is the quantized angle transparency for spin polarized electrons being in one of the lowest QW states. The phenomenon was classified as the quantized conductance regime due to restricted geometry.

abstract: Recently I proposed the linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This turn from physics to language does not only extend quantum theory to classical theory but also yield the quantum mechanical world view. Although the wave function collapse is prohibited in the linguistic interpretation, in this paper I show that the phenomenon like wave function collapse can be realized in the linguistic interpretation. And furthermore, I propose the justification of the von Neumann-L\"uders projection postulate. After all, I conclude that the wave function collapse should not be adopted in the Copenhagen interpretation.

abstract: We challenge the hypothesis that the ground states of a physical system whose degeneracy depends on topology must necessarily realize topological quantum order and display non-local entanglement. To this end, we introduce and study a classical rendition of the Toric Code model embedded on Riemann surfaces of different genus numbers. We find that the minimal ground state degeneracy (and those of all levels) depends on the topology of the embedding surface alone. As the ground states of this classical system may be distinguished by local measurements, a characteristic of Landau orders, this example illustrates that topological degeneracy is not a sufficient condition for topological quantum order. This conclusion is generic and, as shown, it applies to many other models. We also demonstrate that in certain lattice realizations of these models, and other theories, one can find a ground state entropy that is ``holographic", i.e., extensive in the system's boundary. We find that clock and $U(1)$ gauge theories display topological or holographic (in addition to gauge) degeneracies.
