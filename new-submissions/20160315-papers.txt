abstract: We demonstrate optomechanical quantum control of the internal electronic states of a diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in the resolved-sideband regime by coupling the NV to both optical fields and surface acoustic waves via a phonon-assisted optical transition and by taking advantage of the strong excited-state electron-phonon coupling of a NV center. Optomechanically-driven Rabi oscillations as well as quantum interferences between the optomechanical sideband and the direct dipole-optical transitions have been realized. These studies open the door to using resolved-sideband optomechanical coupling for quantum control of both the atom-like internal states and the motional states of a coupled NV-nanomechanical system, leading to the development of a solid-state analog of trapped ions.

abstract: Entangled states are a crucial resource for quantum-based technologies such as quantum computers and quantum communication systems (1,2). Exploring new methods for entanglement generation is important for diversifying and eventually improving current approaches. Here, we create entanglement in atomic ions by applying laser fields to constrain the evolution to a restricted number of states, in an approach that has become known as "quantum Zeno dynamics" (3-5). With two trapped $^9\rm{Be}^+$ ions, we obtain Bell state fidelities up to $0.990^{+2}_{-5}$, with three ions, a W-state (6) fidelity of $0.910^{+4}_{-7}$ is obtained. Compared to other methods of producing entanglement in trapped ions, this procedure is relatively insensitive to certain imperfections such as fluctuations in laser intensity, laser frequency, and ion-motion frequencies.

abstract: Floquet theory provides rigorous foundations for the theory of periodically driven quantum systems. In the case of non-periodic driving, however, the situation is not so well understood. Here, we provide a critical review of the theoretical framework developed for quasi-periodically driven quantum systems. Although the theoretical footing is still under development, we argue that quasi-periodically driven quantum systems can be treated with generalizations of Floquet theory in suitable parameter regimes. Moreover, we provide a generalization of the Floquet-Magnus expansion and argue that quasi-periodic driving offers a promising route for quantum simulations.

abstract: During many years since the birth of quantum mechanics, instrumentalist interpretations prevailed: the meaning of the theory was expressed in terms of measurements results. But in the last decades, several attempts to interpret it from a realist viewpoint have been proposed. Among them, modal interpretations supply a realist non-collapse account, according to which the system always has definite properties and the quantum state represents possibilities, not actualities. However, the traditional modal interpretations faced some conceptual problems when addressing imperfect measurements. The modal-Hamiltonian interpretation, on the contrary, proved to be able to supply an adequate account of the measurement problem, both in its ideal and its non-ideal versions. Moreover, in the non-ideal case, it gives a precise criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements. Nevertheless, that criterion depends on the particular state of the measured system, and this might be considered as a shortcoming of the proposal. In fact, one could ask for a criterion of reliability that does not depend on the features of what is measured but only on the properties of the measurement device. The aim of this article is precisely to supply such a criterion: we will adopt an informational perspective for this purpose.

abstract: Phase transitions are commonly held to occur only in the thermodynamical limit of large number of system components. Here we exemplify at the hand of the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model and its generalization to finite JC-lattices that finite component systems of coupled spins and bosons may exhibit quantum phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we find a continuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic condensate with a macroscopic occupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation. For the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a Mott-insulator to superfluid QPT. We identify as the underlying principle of the emergence of finite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy and increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which allows for the exploration of an increasingly large portion of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that finite system phase transitions will be present in a broad range of physical systems.

abstract: It is an oft cited fact that no quantum code can support a set of fault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however, is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable method of code switching.

abstract: The von Neumann lattice refers to a discrete basis of Gaussians located on a lattice in phase space. It provides an attractive approach for solving quantum mechanical problems, allowing the pruning of tensor-product basis sets using phase space considerations. In a series of recent articles Shimshovitz et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 7 (2012)], Takemoto et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics 137 1 (2012)] Machnes et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics, accepted (2016)]), we have introduced two key new elements into the method: a formalism for converging the basis and for efficient pruning by use of the biorthogonal basis. In this paper we review the key components of the theory and then present new, efficient and parallelizable iterative algorithms for solving the time-independent and time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. The algorithms dynamically determine the active reduced basis iteratively without resorting to classical analogs. These algorithmic developments, combined with the previous formal developments, allow quantum dynamics to be performed directly and economically in phase space. We provide two illustrative examples: double-well tunneling and double ionization of helium.

Our result is that if SLOCC transformations are allowed, then the best asymptotic rate is the minimum of bipartite log-ranks of the initial state. This generalizes a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of the matrix multiplication tensor.

abstract: Entanglement-assisted quantum communication employs pre-shared entanglement between sender and receiver as a resource. We apply the same framework to quantum metrology, introducing shared entanglement between the preparation and the measurement stage, namely using some entangled ancillary system that does not interact with the system to be sampled. This is known to be useless in the noiseless case, but was recently shown to be useful in the presence of noise. Here we detail how and when it can be of use. For example, surprisingly it is useful when randomly time sharing two channels where ancillas do not help (depolarizing). We show that it is useful for all levels of noise for many noise models and propose a simple experiment to test these results.

abstract: The creation of composite quantum gates that implement quantum response functions $\hat{U}(\theta)$ dependent on some parameter of interest $\theta$ has historically been more of an art than a science. Through inspired design, a sequence of $L$ primitive gates also depending on $\theta$ can engineer a highly nontrivial $\hat{U}(\theta)$ that enables myriad precision metrology, spectroscopy, and control techniques. However, discovering new useful examples of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ requires great intuition to perceive the possibilities, and often brute-force to find optimal implementations. These demands hobble our imagination of new applications. We present a systematic and efficient methodology for composite gate design of arbitrary length, where phase-controlled primitive gates all rotating by $\theta$ act on a single spin. We fully characterize the realizable family of $\hat{U}(\theta)$, provide an efficient algorithm that decomposes a choice of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ into its shortest sequence of gates, and show how to efficiently choose achievable $\hat{U}(\theta)$ that for fixed $L$, are optimal approximations to objective functions on its quadratures. A strong connection is forged with \emph{classical} discrete-time signal processing, allowing us to swiftly construct, as examples, compensated gates with optimal bandwidth that implement arbitrary single spin rotations with optimal sub-wavelength spatial selectivity.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.03999
abstract: We present a complete classification of quantum stabilizer gates in terms of the functions they generate assuming the ability to swap qubits and use ancillary workspace. Because we view these stabilizer circuits as subroutines of some general quantum computation, we insist that any ancilla qubits used during the computation must not change in an input-dependent manner. This is the first attempt at a quantum extension of the classification of reversible classical gates introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious program to classify all quantum gate sets. The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau representation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which elementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57 different stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the single-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining classes are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the CNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to X-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining classes are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the T_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates.

abstract: As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, (transient) superballistic transport is not well understood but it has been experimentally observed recently. We here calculate the white noise effect (in Markov approximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model with disordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to perfect lattices at both ends. Here we show the effect of white noise on spreading of the wave packet initially located at the center of the sublattice. We find threshold values of the white noise strength, beyond which the quantum hyperdiffusion does not occur. We predict from our numerical studies that the quantum hyperdiffusion exponent can be tuned by the strength of applied white noise. Therefore we can manually apply noise to a system to drive it to desired diffusion rate.

abstract: Pulsed ESR experiments are reported for ensembles of negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) in diamonds at X-band magnetic fields (280-400 mT) and low temperatures (2-70 K). The NV$^-$ centers in synthetic type IIb diamonds (nitrogen impurity concentration $<1$~ppm) are prepared with bulk concentrations of $2\cdot 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $4\cdot 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ by high-energy electron irradiation and subsequent annealing. We find that a proper post-radiation anneal (1000$^\circ$C for 60 mins) is critically important to repair the radiation damage and to recover long electron spin coherence times for NV$^-$s. After the annealing, spin coherence times of T$_2 = 0.74$~ms at 5~K are achieved, being only limited by $^{13}$C nuclear spectral diffusion in natural abundance diamonds. At X-band magnetic fields, strong electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) is observed originating from the central $^{14}$N nucleus. The ESEEM spectral analysis allows for accurate determination of the $^{14}$N nuclear hypefine and quadrupole tensors. In addition, the ESEEM effects from two proximal $^{13}$C sites (second-nearest neighbor and fourth-nearest neighbor) are resolved and the respective $^{13}$C hyperfine coupling constants are extracted.

abstract: Boson sampling is a problem intractable for classical computers, but can be naturally solved on a specialized photonic quantum simulator which requires less resources than building a universal quantum computer. The biggest challenge to implement boson sampling with a large number of photons has been the lack of reliable single-photon sources. Here we demonstrate a scalable architecture of boson sampling using a solid-state single-photon source with simultaneously high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability. The single photons are time-bin encoded and interfered in an electrically programmable loop-based network. We implement and validate boson sampling with input three and four single photons, and track the dynamical multi-photon evolution inside the circuit. With further refinement of the system efficiency, our approach may be feasible to be scaled up to >20-boson sampling to outperform classical computers, and thus provide experimental evidence against the Extended Church-Turing Thesis.

abstract: Theoretically, the coordinate measurement of two identical particles at a point by two narrowly separated narrow detectors, is interpreted in the limit of shrinking width and separation, as the detection of two particles by a single narrow detector. { Ordinarily, the ratio between probabilities of point measurements is independent of the width of the narrow detectors.} We show here that not only this is not the case, but that in some scenarios the results depend on the way the dimensions shrink to zero. The ratio between the width and the separation determines the detection result. { In particular, it is shown that the bunching parameter of bosons is not a well-defined physical property. Moreover, it may suggests that } there is a difficulty in quantum measurement theory in the interpretation of coordinate measurement of two particles.

abstract: Spectrum Broadcast Structures are a new and fresh concept in the quantum-to-classical transition, introduced recently in the context of decoherence and the appearance of objective features in quantum mechanics. These are specific quantum state structures, responsible for an apparent objectivity of a decohered state of a system. Recently they have been shown to appear in the well known Quantum Brownian Motion model, however the final analysis relied on numerics. Here, after a presentation of the main concepts, we perform analytical studies of the model, showing the timescales and the efficiency of the spectrum broadcast structure formation. We consider a massive central system and a somewhat simplified environment being random with a uniform distribution of the frequencies.

abstract: Standard error correction techniques only provide a quantum memory and need extra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are small angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A. 91, 042315 (2015)], though it uses nearly half the resources to achieve the same output error rate. Direct access to small angle rotations reduces the need for costly gate synthesis techniques. We find a magic state approach can reduce resource costs by approximately a factor of 40 compared to using gate synthesis, with some variation depending on the parameter regime of interest.

We also prove, however, that repeating the L\"uders measurement of an unsharp non-trivial two-outcome observable yields novel information at each step, and we characterize the information obtained in the limit of infinitely many repetitions. Our result implies that a repeated measurement can be used to correct the inherent noise of an unsharp observable.

abstract: We prove the equivalence between two approaches to the characterisation of quantum Markovianity, divisibility and lack of information backflow. We show that a dynamical map is completely-positive-divisible if and only if a monotonic non-increase of distinguishability is observed for two equiprobable states of the evolving system and an ancilla. Moreover our proof is constructive for invertible dynamical maps: given any such a map that is not completely-positive-divisible, we give an explicit construction of two states that exhibit information backflow. Finally, while an ancilla is necessary for the equivalence to hold in general, we show that it is always possible to witness the non-Markovianity of maps without using any entanglement between system and ancilla.

abstract: Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum information applications due to their bright single photon emission and optically accessible spin states. Furthermore, SiV centers in low-strain diamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e. they show very weak spectral diffusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV centers interesting for sensing applications. We here report on photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy on an SiV ensemble in a low strain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure the fine structure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the SiV centers. We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and position of the fine structure peaks. Our measurements reveal linewidths of about 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on the order of 0.1 GHz. This difference arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions caused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral hole burning spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited homogeneous linewidth of 279 MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of coherent interaction in the system by driving a $\Lambda$-scheme. Additional measurements on single emitters created by ion implantation confirm the homogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate the ground state splitting to the decoherence rate.

abstract: A universal and optimal method for the polarimetry of light with arbitrary photon statistics is presented. The method is based on the continuous maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued measure (ML-POVM) for pure polarization states over the surface of the Bloch sphere. The success probability and the mean fidelity are used as the figures of merit to show its performance. The POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization estimation with respect to the mean fidelity. As demonstrations, explicit results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized coherent state (Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that the estimation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are almost identical, while that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests that thermal light leaks less information to an eavesdropper and hence could potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quantum communication protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally, comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical communications are made to show the better and more stable performance of the continuous ML-POVM.

abstract: The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds with basic principles in quantum mechanics. While statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium, an isolated many-body system undergoing Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics has zero entropy because, at any given time, it is described by a single quantum state. The underlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly antithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of systems. Here we observe experimentally how this conflict is resolved: we perform microscopy on an evolving quantum state, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. Although the full state has zero entropy, entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a near-volume law in the entanglement entropy.

abstract: The advent of quantum devices, which exploit the two essential elements of quantum physics, coherence and entanglement, has sparked renewed interest in the control of open quantum systems. Successful implementations face the challenge to preserve the relevant nonclassical features at the level of device operation. A major obstacle is decoherence which is caused by interaction with the environment. Optimal control theory is a tool that can be used to identify control strategies in the presence of decoherence. We review here recent advances in optimal control methodology that allow for tackling typical tasks in device operation for open quantum systems and discuss examples of relaxation-optimized dynamics. Optimal control theory is also a useful tool to exploit the environment for control. We discuss examples and point out possible future extensions.

We show how to realize a controlled-phase gate by simultaneously modulating the coupling of two qubits to a common oscillator mode. In contrast to the situation with the more familiar transversal qubit-oscillator coupling, the magnitude of the effective qubit-qubit interaction here does not rely on a small perturbative parameter. As a result, this effective interaction strength can be made large, leading to short gate times and high gate fidelities. We moreover show how the gate fidelity can be exponentially improved with single-mode squeezing and how the entangling gate can be generalized to qubits coupled to separate oscillators.

abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of entanglement entropy, induced by an oscillating time periodic driving of the transverse field, h(t), of a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We consider several realizations of h(t), and we find a number of results in analogy with entanglement entropy dynamics induced by a sudden quantum quench. After short-time relaxation, the dynamics of entanglement entropy synchronises with h(t), displaying an oscillatory behaviour at the frequency of the driving. Synchronisation in the dynamics of entanglement entropy, is spoiled by the appearance of quasi-revivals which fade out in the thermodynamic limit, and which we interpret using a quasi-particle picture adapted to periodic drivings. Taking the time-average of the entanglement entropy in the synchronised regime, we find that it obeys a volume law scaling with the subsystem's size. Such result is reminiscent of a thermal state or of a Generalised Gibbs ensemble of a quenched Ising chain, although the system does not heat up towards infinite temperature as a consequence of the integrability of the model.

abstract: The complete characterisation of the charge transport in a mesoscopic device is provided by the Full Counting Statistics (FCS) $P_t(m)$, describing the amount of charge $Q = me$ transmitted during the time $t$. Although numerous systems have been theoretically characterized by their FCS, the experimental measurement of the distribution function $P_t(m)$ or its moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$ are rare and often plagued by strong back-action. Here, we present a strategy for the measurement of the FCS, more specifically its characteristic function $\chi(\lambda)$ and moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$, by a qubit with a set of different couplings $\lambda_j$, $j = 1,\dots,k,\dots k+p$, $k = \lceil n/2 \rceil$, $p \geq 0$, to the mesoscopic conductor. The scheme involves multiple readings of Ramsey sequences at the different coupling strengths $\lambda_j$ and we find the optimal distribution for these couplings $\lambda_j$ as well as the optimal distribution $N_j$ of $N = \sum N_j$ measurements among the different couplings $\lambda_j$. We determine the precision scaling for the moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$ with the number $N$ of invested resources and show that the standard quantum limit can be approached when many additional couplings $p\gg 1$ are included in the measurement scheme.

abstract: Based on the nonperturbative analysis, we show that the classical motion of harmonic oscillator derived from the deformed QM is manifestly in contradiction with observations. For this reason, we take an alternate way for estimating the effect and discuss its possible observational manifestations in macrophysics.

abstract: Recent results in deeply subwavelength thickness films demonstrated coherent control and logical gate operations with both classical and single photon light sources. However, quantum processing and devices typically involve more than one photon and non-trivial input quantum states. Here we experimentally investigate two-photon N00N state coherent absorption in a multilayer graphene film. Depending on the N00N state input phase, it is possible to selectively choose between single or two photon absorption of the input state in the graphene film. These results demonstrate that coherent absorption in the quantum regime exhibits unique features opening up applications in multiphoton spectroscopy and imaging.
