abstract: Macro-realism is the position that certain "macroscopic" observables must always possess definite values: e.g. the table is in some definite position, even if we don't know what that is precisely. The traditional understanding is that by assuming macro-realism one can derive the Leggett-Garg inequalities, which constrain the possible statistics from certain experiments. Since quantum experiments can violate the Leggett-Garg inequalities this is taken to rule out the possibility of macro-realism in a quantum universe. However, recent analyses have exposed loopholes in the Leggett-Garg argument, which allow many types of macro-realism to be compatible with violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. This paper takes a different approach to ruling out macro-realism and the result is a no-go theorem for macro-realism in quantum theory that is stronger than the Leggett-Garg argument. This approach uses the framework of ontological models: an elegant way to reason about foundational issues in quantum theory which has successfully produced many other recent results, such as the PBR theorem.

abstract: We advocate the step change in properties of discrete $d$-level quantum systems, between $d=2$ and $d\geq 3$. Qubit systems, or multipartite systems containing qubit subsystem, are exceptional in their relative simplicity. One faces a step in complexity in valuating measures of quantum correlations for qutrits and then other higher dimensional qudits. There is a growing number of arguments leading to such conclusion: recently found no-go theorem for generalization of the Peres-Horodecki's PPT criterion \cite{sko}, change in geometry of state spaces of qubit and higher degree qudits (the so called 'generalized Bloch ball' is not a ball anymore), restricted possibilities for diagonalization of correlation matrices for bipartite systems, more difficult way for handling the set of relevant families of orthogonal projectors.

abstract: We examine the pair entanglement in the ground state of finite dimerized spin-$s$ chains interacting through anisotropic $XY$ couplings immersed in a transverse magnetic field, by means of a self-consistent pair mean field approximation. The approach, which makes no a priori assumptions on the pair states, predicts, for sufficiently low coupling between pairs, $2s$ distinct dimerized phases for increasing fields below the pair factorizing field, separated by spin parity breaking phases. The dimerized phases lead to approximate magnetization and pair entanglement plateaus, while the parity breaking phases are characterized by weak pair entanglement but non-negligible entanglement of the pair with the rest of the system. These predictions are confirmed by the exact results obtained in finite $s=1$ and $s=3/2$ chains. It is also shown that for increasing values of the spin $s$, the entanglement of an isolated pair, as measured by the negativity, rapidly saturates in the anisotropic $XY$ case but increases as $s^{1/2}$ in the $XX$ case, reflecting a distinct single spin entanglement spectrum.

abstract: Superposition principle of wave function in multi-slit interference experiment has been widely accepted by many quantum mechanics textbooks, however the expression ${\psi _{AB}} = {\psi _A} + {\psi _B}$ does not strictly hold. The non-classical paths in Feynman path integral provide an explanation to the multi-path interference effect, and can be used to quantitatively analyse the multi-slit interference effect. In this work, we apply quantities in Bohmian mechanics to the measurement of multi-order interference by analysing the contribution of non-classical paths to Bohmian velocity in electron's multi-slit interferometer. The result shows that the non-classical paths effect will cause a relative deviation of $10^{-3}$ in electron's Bohmian velocity, which is observable by doing weak measurement similar to previous work.

abstract: Using the information content of correlations between multipartite systems, together with the notion of partitioning, we show that some general results about the evolution of correlations in quantum systems can be derived with only elementary methods. In particular, we show that for 2 quantum systems A and B, each comprised of a number of sub-systems, in which a partition of A interacts unitarily with a partition of B, then the total correlation can only increase (or remain unchanged) and is given simply by the sum of the initial correlation and the correlation that develops as a result of the interaction. We then show that in a 4 qubit entanglement swapping process the transferred degree of entanglement is bounded by the lower of the initial degrees of entanglements of the qubits.

abstract: The mutual information has been successfully used as a measure of correlation strength between quantum systems, especially for bipartite systems. Here we examine the use of this measure for multipartite quantum systems. For system of qubits we find that the difference between `classical' and `quantum' regimes of correlation strength amounts to just 1 bit of information, at most. We show that the information content of a correlation can be expanded into correlations between pairwise components and demonstrate that in terms of this information-based measure of correlation the GHZ states are the only states that simultaneously optimize these pairwise correlations for systems of qubits.

abstract: Quantum correlations reflect the quantumness of a system and are useful resources for quantum information and computational processes. The measures of quantum correlations do not have a classical analog and yet are influenced by the classical dynamics. In this work a multi-qubit system collectively modelled as a quantum kicked top is studied. Effect of classical bifurcations on the measures of quantum correlations such as quantum discord, geometric discord and Meyer and Wallach $Q$ measure is studied. It is found that the slope of these measures as a function of chaoticity parameter changes at the bifurcation point. Random matrix theory is used to model the globally chaotic case and it is found that time averages of the correlation measures in both the cases are in good agreement with each other. Scaling of these measures is studied as a function of total spin of the multi-qubit system for the cases when the classical phase space structure is regular and globally chaotic. An approximate power-law for time averaged correlations as a function of total spin is found in the case regular regions. While for the global chaotic case the rate of increase of time averaged correlations is initially large which is reduced drastically later on as a function of total spin. Finally, it saturates to a constant value for total spin tending to infinity. An exact formula for average $Q$ measure is derived for the eigenvectors of corresponding circular unitary ensemble and it agrees with that for the eigenvectors of the kicked top in the global chaotic case. We also suggest that it can have experimental consequences.

abstract: We consider light scattering off a two-dimensional (2D) dipolar array and show how it can be tailored by properly choosing the lattice constant of the order of the incident wavelength. In particular, we demonstrate that such arrays can operate as nearly perfect mirrors for a wide range of incident angles and frequencies close to the individual atomic resonance. These results can be understood in terms of the cooperative resonances of the surface modes supported by the 2D array. Experimental realizations are discussed, using ultracold arrays of trapped atoms and excitons in 2D semiconductor materials, as well as potential applications ranging from atomically thin metasurfaces to single photon nonlinear optics and nanomechanics.

abstract: We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with an equal mixing of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC) produced by an external Raman laser field. These probabilities are computed over multiple relevant energy ranges within the pseudo-potential approximation. Strong scattering resonances are found whenever the incident energy approaches either a scattering threshold or a quasi-bound state attached to one of the energetically closed higher dispersion branches. A striking difference is demonstrated between two very different regimes set by the Raman laser intensity, namely between scattering for the single- minimum dispersion versus the double-minimum dispersion at the lowest threshold. The presence of RD-SOC together with the Raman field fundamentally changes the scattering behavior and enables the realization of very different one-dimensional theoretical models in a single experimental setup when combined with a confinement-induced resonance.

abstract: We report on a surface-electrode trap with SmCo magnets arranged in a quadrupole configuration underneath the trap electrode. Because the distance between the magnets and the trapped ions can be as little as several hundred micrometers, a large magnetic field is produced without any heat management. The magnetic-field gradient was measured using the Zeeman splitting of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion at several positions, and a field gradient of 36 T/m was obtained. Such a field gradient is useful for the generation of a state-dependent force, which is important for quantum simulation and/or quantum gate operation using radio-frequency or microwave radiation.

abstract: Given a preferred orthonormal basis $B$ in the Hilbert space of a quantum system we define a measure of the coherence generating power of a unitary map with respect to $B$. We give its explicit analytical form and provide an operational protocol to directly detect it. This measure vanishes if and only if the unitary map transforms all the incoherent states into themselves and is non-increasing under pre- or post-processing by incoherent operations. We characterize the set of unitaries with maximal coherence generating power and study the properties of our measure when the unitary is drawn at random from the Haar distribution. For large state-space dimension a random unitary has, with overwhelming probability, nearly maximal coherence generating power with respect to any basis. Finally, extensions to general unital completely positive maps and the relation to the concept of asymmetry are discussed.

abstract: Cluster state plays a crucial role in the one-way quantum computation. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new scheme to prepare an ultrahigh-fidelity four-photon linear cluster state via spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. The state fidelity is measured to be $0.9517\pm0.0027$. Our scheme can be directly extended to more photons to generate N-qubit linear cluster state. Furthermore, our scheme is optimal for generating photonic linear cluster states in the sense of achieving the maximal success probability and having the simplest strategy. The key idea is that the photon pairs are prepared in some special non-maximally entangled states instead of the normal Bell states. To generate a 2N-qubit linear cluster state from N pairs of entangled photons, only (N-1) Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences are needed and a success probability of $(\frac{1}{4})^{N-1}$ is achieved.

abstract: Characterizing quantum systems through experimental data is critical to applications as diverse as metrology and quantum computing. Analyzing this experimental data in a robust and reproducible manner is made challenging, however, by the lack of readily-available software for performing principled statistical analysis. We improve the robustness and reproducibility of characterization by introducing an open-source library, QInfer, to address this need. Our library makes it easy to analyze data from tomography, randomized benchmarking, and Hamiltonian learning experiments either in post-processing, or online as data is acquired. QInfer also provides functionality for predicting the performance of proposed experimental protocols from simulated runs. By delivering easy- to-use characterization tools based on principled statistical analysis, QInfer helps address many outstanding challenges facing quantum technology.

abstract: Majorization provides a rather powerful partial-order classification of probability distributions depending only on the spread of the statistics, and not on the actual numerical values of the variable being described. We propose to apply majorization as a meta-measure of quantum polarization fluctuations, this is to say of the degree of polarization. We compare the polarization fluctuations of the most relevant classes of quantum and classical-like states. In particular we test the Lieb's conjecture regarding classical-like states as the most polarized and a complementary conjecture that the most unpolarized pure states are the most nonclassical.

abstract: We introduce spatial deformations to an array of light sources and study how the estimation precision of the interspacing distance, d, changes with the sources of light used. The generator of translations, G, in d is derived such that any general deformation may be considered. Contrary to what may have been expected, the higher average mode occupancies of the classical states performs better in estimating d when compared with SPEs---favouring their use over more difficult to prepare quantum sources. This would find applications in evaluating stresses and strains, fracture prevention in materials expressing great sensitivities to deformations and selecting frequency distinguished quantum sources from an array of reference sources. We incorporate imperfect sources to find the estimation protocol remains robust even with poor efficiencies.

abstract: We investigate an asymptotically spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime from two different perspectives. First, using von Neumann entropy, we evaluate the entanglement generation due to the encoded information in spacetime. Then, we work out the entropy of particle creation based on the quantum thermodynamics of the scalar field on the underlying spacetime. We show that the general behavior of both entropies are the same. Therefore, the entanglement can be applied to the customary quantum thermodynamics of the universe. Also, using these entropies, we can recover some information about the parameters of spacetime.

abstract: In [N. Friis, New J. Phys. 18, 033014 (2016)] the non-relativistic description of fermions is considered and in particular the role of the parity superselection rule in relation to the characterization of entanglement. An argument based on the spin-statistics connection is presented as a physical motivation for the parity superselection rule. Since the spin statistics connection was derived in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics it is argued that the inclusion of the parity superselection rule is motivated by Lorentz invariance. Based on this it is further argued that fermionic Quantum Information theory and the theory of special relativity are conceptually inseparable. In this comment a different, and well known, motivation for the parity superselection rule is given that does not rely on arguments from relativistic quantum mechanics, but instead uses the assumptions that the laws of physics are the same for different observers and the no-signalling principle.

Moreover, for non-universal $\mathcal{S}$ our criteria indicate what type of gates can be added to $\mathcal{S}$ to turn it into a universal set.

We then present quantum algorithms for deciding the two properties in the adjacency array model, which run in time $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d_m})$ and also require $O(\log n)$ space, where $d_m$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in the input graph.

abstract: We find analytic asymptotic expressions at low temperature for the Casimir free energy, entropy and pressure of two parallel graphene sheets in the framework of the Lifshitz theory. The reflection coefficients of electromagnetic waves on graphene are described on the basis of first principles of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature using the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The leading contributions to the Casimir entropy and to the thermal corrections to the Casimir energy and pressure are given by the thermal correction to the polarization tensor at nonzero Matsubara frequencies. It is shown that the Casimir entropy for two graphene sheets goes to zero when the temperature vanishes, i.e., the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem) is satisfied. At low temperature, the magnitude of the thermal correction to the Casimir pressure between two graphene sheets is shown to vary inversely proportional to the separation. The Nernst heat theorem for graphene is discussed in the context of problems occurring in Casimir physics for both metallic and dielectric plates.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantum mechanics and forms the basis of quantum information technologies. Here we present a novel method for the creation of quantum entanglement in multipartite and high-dimensional photonic systems, exploiting an idea introduced by the group of Leonard Mandel 25 years ago. The two ingredients are 1) superposition of photon pairs with different origins and 2) aligning photon paths such that they emerge from the same output mode. We explain examples for the creation of various classes of multiphoton entanglement encoded in polarization as well as in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces -- starting only from separable (non-entangled) photon pairs. For two photons, we show how arbitrary high-dimensional entanglement can be created. Interestingly, a common source for two-photon polarization entanglement is found as a special case. We discovered the technique by analyzing the output of a computer algorithm designing quantum experiments, and generalized it from there. This shows that computer designed quantum experiments can be inspirations for new techniques.

abstract: I suggest a simple alteration of my CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization) theory, replacing the mass density collapse-generating operators by relativistic energy density operators. Some consequences of the density matrix evolution equation are explored. First, the expression for the mean energy increase of free particles is calculated (which, in the non-relativistic limit, agrees with the usual result). Then, the density matrix evolution is applied to photons. The mean rate of loss of photon number from a laser beam pulse, the momentum distribution of the photons "excited" out of the laser beam pulse, and the alteration of the cosmic blackbody spectrum are all treated to first order in the collapse rate parameter $\lambda$. Associated possible experimental limits on $\lambda$ are discussed.

abstract: One of the most striking features of quantum theory is the existence of entangled states, responsible for Einstein's so called "spooky action at a distance". These states emerge from the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, but to date we do not have a clear idea of which physical principles give rise to entanglement. Why does quantum theory have entangled states? Would any theory superseding classical theory have entangled states, or is quantum theory special? We demonstrate that without entanglement, non-classical degrees of freedom cannot reversibly interact. We present two postulates, no-cloning / no-broadcasting and local transitivity, either of which are sufficient to imply the existence of entangled states in any non-classical theory with reversible interactions. Therefore we argue that entanglement is an inevitable feature of a non-classical universe.

abstract: We present the exact analytical solution of the explicitly time-periodic quantum Langevin equation describing the dual-beam backaction-evasion measurement of a single mechanical oscillator quadrature due to Braginsky, Vorontsov and Thorne beyond the commonly used rotating-wave approximation. We show that counterrotating terms lead to extra sidebands in the optical and mechanical spectra and to a modification of the main peak. Physically, the backaction of the measurement is due to periodic coupling of the mechanical resonator to a light field quadrature that only contains cavity-filtered shot noise. Since this fact is independent of other degrees of freedom the resonator might be coupled to, our solution can be generalized, including to dissipatively or parametrically squeezed oscillators, as well as recent two-mode backaction evasion measurements.

abstract: We consider the existence of plasmons in a non-equilibrium situation where electrons from the valence band of graphene are pumped to states in the Brillouin zone around the $\mathbf{M}$-point by a high intensity UV electromagnetic field. The resulting out-of-equilibrium electron gas is later probed by a weak electromagnetic field of different frequency. We show that the optical properties of the system and the dispersion of the plasmons are strongly anisotropic, depending on the pumping radiation properties: its intensity, polarization, and frequency. This anisotropy has its roots in the saddle-like nature of the electronic dispersion relation around that particular point in the Brillouin zone. It is found that despite the strong anisotropy, the dispersion of the plasmons scales with the square root of the wave number but is characterized an effective Fermi energy, which depends on the properties of the pumping radiation. Our calculations go beyond the usual Dirac cone approximation taking the full band structure of graphene into account. This is a necessary condition for discussing plasmons at the $\mathbf{M}$-point in the Brillouin zone.

abstract: We develop an approach to characterize excited states of disordered many-body systems using spatially resolved structures of entanglement. We show that the behavior of the mutual information (MI) between two parties of a many-body system can signal a qualitative difference between thermal and localized phases -- MI is finite in insulators while it approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit in the ergodic phase. Related quantities, such as the recently introduced Codification Volume (CV), are shown to be suitable to quantify the correlation length of the system. These ideas are illustrated using prototypical non-interacting wavefunctions of localized and extended particles and then applied to characterize states of strongly excited interacting spin chains. We especially focus on evolution of spatial structure of quantum information between high temperature diffusive and many-body localized phases believed to exist in these models. We study MI as a function of disorder strength both averaged over the eigenstates and in time-evolved product states drawn from continuously deformed family of initial states realizable experimentally. As expected, spectral and time-evolved averages coincide inside the ergodic phase and differ significantly outside. We also highlight dispersion among the initial states \emph{within} the localized phase -- some of these show considerable generation and delocalization of quantum information.

In two dimensions, we discover that if ETH holds locally, the finite size reduced density matrix of states created by heavy primary operators is well-approximated by a projection to the Virasoro identity block.

abstract: We examine the suppression of quantum beating in a one dimensional non- linear double well potential, made up of two focusing nonlinear point interactions. The investigation of the Schr\"odinger dynamics is reduced to the study of a system of coupled nonlinear Volterra integral equations. For various values of the geometric and dynamical parameters of the model we give analytical and numerical results on the way states, which are initially confined in one well, evolve. We show that already for a nonlinearity exponent well below the critical value there is complete suppression of the typical beating behavior characterizing the linear quantum case.

abstract: We consider the problem of computing energy distribution of inner harmonic oscillations of a nanoparticle in its phase space, when the particle moves in a medium in heat equilibrium under certain temperature. It is assumed that the particle obeys the Brownian motion under the action of the medium and the force field given by a potential function. In the present paper we provide and study an equation describing the problem, generalizing the Klein--Kramers equation. It is shown that for large value of medium resistance, the process of energy distribution of inner harmonic oscillations of the nanoparticle is represented as the composition of a rapid transition process and a slow process. After the rapid transition process, the system goes to a quasi-stationary state. The slow process is approximately described by the standard Schrodinger equation used for description ofquantum processes. Thus, the process being studied can serve as a model of quantum processes.

abstract: Tunneling between two classically disconnected regular regions can be strongly affected by the presence of a chaotic sea in between. This phenomenon, known as chaos-assisted tunneling, gives rise to large fluctuations of the tunneling rate. Here we study chaos-assisted tunneling in the presence of Anderson localization effects in the chaotic sea. Our results show that the standard tunneling rate distribution is strongly modified by localization, going from the known Cauchy distribution in the ergodic regime to a log-normal distribution in the strongly localized case. We develop an analytical single-parameter scaling theory which accurately describes the numerical data, for both a deterministic and a disordered model. Several possible experimental implementations using cold atoms, photonic lattices or microwave billiards are discussed.
