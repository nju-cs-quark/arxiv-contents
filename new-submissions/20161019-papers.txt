abstract: To the working physicist, anyon theory is meant to describe certain quasi-particle excitations occurring in two dimensional topologically ordered systems. A typical calculation using this theory will involve operations such as $\otimes$ to combine anyons, $F^{abc}_{d}$ to re-associate such combinations, and $R^{ab}_c$ to commute or braid these anyons. Although there is a powerful string-diagram notation that greatly assists these manipulations, we still appear to be operating on particles arranged on a one-dimensional line, algebraically ordered from left to right. The obvious question is, where is the other dimension? The topological framework for considering these anyons as truly living in a two dimensional space is known as a modular functor, or topological quantum field theory. In this work we show how the apparently one-dimensional algebraic anyon theory is secretly the theory of anyons living in a fully two-dimensional system. The mathematical literature covering this secret is vast, and we try to distill this down into something more manageable.

abstract: Squeezing ensemble of spins provides a way to surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) in quantum metrology and test the fundamental physics as well, and therefore attracts broad interest. Here we propose an experimentally accessible protocol to squeeze a giant ensemble of spins via the geometric phase control. Using the cavity-assisted Raman transitions in a double $\Lambda$-type system, we realize an effective Dicke model. Under the condition of vanishing effective spin transition frequency, we find a particular evolution time where the cavity decouples from the spins and the spin ensemble is squeezed considerably. Our scheme has the potential to improve the sensitivity in quantum metrology with spins by about two orders.

abstract: Neutrino oscillations are at the forefront of advances in Physics beyond the Standard Model. They are explained by the mismatch between neutrinos flavor and mass eigenstates through what is called neutrino mixing, similar to the quark mixing, which amounts to say that flavor eigenstates are superpositions of mass eigenstates. The neutrino mixing matrix depends on some parameters that do not directly correspond to observables of the neutrino system. Therefore, their values must be inferred from the measurement of other observables. This type of estimation problem is handled by Quantum Estimation Theory (QET), which is concerned with the best precision in the estimation of parameters that is allowed by the laws of Quantum Mechanics. This is expressed by the Fisher Information (FI), which establishes the best precision in the estimation of parameters for a given measurement scheme, and the so-called Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), which determines the optimal precision that can be achieved with any measurement scheme. In this work, we analyse the two-flavor neutrino oscillations in the plane-wave approach from a quantum estimation perspective. We compute the QFI for the estimation of the mixing angle $\theta$ and show that the mass measurement is the one that should be implemented to achieve such optimal precision. We also study the FI associated with the flavor measurement, which is what one actually detects in neutrino oscillation experiments. Then, we investigate the effect of decoherence on these quantities by studying an open system model via the introduction of a physically plausible Markovian term in the system's dynamics . Finally, we study the dynamics of entanglement and show that, at least in single-particle settings, entanglement is not directly connected with the optimal precision in metrological tasks.

abstract: A scheme of single-photon multi-port router is put forward by coupling two optomechanical cavities with waveguides. It is shown that the coupled two optomechanical cavities can exhibit photon blockade effect, which is generated from interference of three mode interaction. A single-photon travel along the system is calculated. The results show that the single photon can be controlled in the multi-port system because of the radiation pressure, which should be useful for constructing quantum network.

abstract: Quantum coherence, incompatibility, and quantum correlations are fundamental features of nonclassical systems. We define the relative quantum coherence (RQC) of two quantum states as the coherence of one state in the reference basis spanned by the eigenvectors of another one, and established its quantitative connections with the extent of mutual incompatibility of two states. For the bipartite states, we also connected quantitatively the RQC to quantum correlations which include quantum discord, symmetric discord, entanglement of formation, and quantum deficits. Our results reveal conceptual implications and basic connections of quantum coherence, mutual incompatibility, and quantum correlations of nonclassical systems.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering allows Alice to remotely prepare a state in some specific bases for Bob through her choice of measurements. The temporal analogue of EPR steering, temporal steering, also reveals the steerability of a single system between different times. Focusing on a four-dimensional system, here we investigate the dynamics of the temporal steering measures, the temporal steering robustness, using 5 mutually unbiased bases. As an example of an application, we use these measures to examine the temporal correlations in a radical pair model of magnetoreception. We find that, due to interactions with a static nuclear spin, the radical pair model exhibits strong non-Markovianity.

abstract: We report a measurement of the transverse momentum correlation between two photons by detecting only one of them. Our method uses two identical sources in an arrangement, in which the phenomenon of induced coherence without induced emission is observed. In this way, we produce an interference pattern in the superposition of one beam from each source. We quantify the transverse momentum correlation by analyzing the visibility of this pattern. Our approach might be useful for the characterization of correlated photon pair sources and may lead to an experimental measure of continuous variable entanglement, which relies on the detection of only one of two entangled particles.

abstract: We observe spatial fringes in the interference of two beams, which are controlled by a third beam through the phenomenon of induced coherence without induced emission. We show that the interference pattern depends on the alignment of this beam in an analogous way as fringes created in a traditional division-of-amplitude interferometer depend on the relative alignment of the two interfering beams. We demonstrate that the pattern is characterized by an equivalent wavelength, which corresponds to a combination of the wavelengths of the involved physical light beams.

abstract: We theoretically study the propagation and storage of a classical field in a $\Lambda$-type atomic medium using coherent population oscillations (CPO). We show that the propagation eigenmodes strongly relate to the different CPO modes of the system. Light storage in such modes is discussed by introducing a "populariton" quantity, mixture of populations and field, by analogy to the dark state polariton used in the context of electromagnetically-induced transparency light storage protocol. As experimentally shown, this memory relies on populations and is then - by contrast with usual Raman coherence optical storage protocols - robust to dephasing effects.

abstract: We study quantum information properties of a seven-level system realized by a particle in an one-dimensional square-well trap. Features of encodings of seven-level systems in a form of three-qubit or qubit-qutrit systems are discussed. We use the three-qubit encoding of the system in order to investigate subadditivity and strong subadditivity conditions for the thermal state of the particle. The qubit-qutrit encoding is employed to suggest a single qudit algorithm for calculation of parity of a bit string. Obtained results indicate on the potential resource of multilevel systems for realization of quantum information processing.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.05614
abstract: We propose an information-theoretically secure encryption scheme for classical messages with quantum ciphertexts that offers detection of eavesdropping attacks, and re-usability of the key in case no eavesdropping took place: the entire key can be securely re-used for encrypting new messages as long as no attack is detected. This is known to be impossible for fully classical schemes, where there is no way to detect plain eavesdropping attacks. This particular application of quantum techniques to cryptography was originally proposed by Bennett, Brassard and Breidbart in 1982, even before proposing quantum-key-distribution, and a simple candidate scheme was suggested but no rigorous security analysis was given. The idea was picked up again in 2005, when Damgard, Pedersen and Salvail suggested a new scheme for the same task, but now with a rigorous security analysis. However, their scheme is much more demanding in terms of quantum capabilities: it requires the users to have a quantum computer. In contrast, and like the original scheme by Bennett et al., our new scheme merely requires to prepare and measure single BB84 qubits. As such, we not only show a provably-secure scheme that is within reach of current technology, but we also confirm Bennett et al.'s original intuition that a scheme in the spirit of their original construction - though slightly more involved - is indeed secure.

abstract: We obtain an explicit characterization of linear maps, in particular, quantum channels, which are covariant with respect to an irreducible representation ($U$) of a finite group ($G$), whenever $U \otimes U^c$ is simply reducible (with $U^c$ being the contragradient representation). Using the theory of group representations, we obtain the spectral decomposition of any such linear map. The eigenvalues and orthogonal projections arising in this decomposition are expressed entirely in terms of representation characteristics of the group $G$. This in turn yields necessary and sufficient conditions on the eigenvalues of any such linear map for it to be a quantum channel. We also obtain a wide class of quantum channels which are irreducibly covariant by construction. For two-dimensional irrreducible representations of the symmetric group $S(3)$, and the quaternion group $Q$, we also characterize quantum channels which are both irreducibly covariant and entanglement breaking.

authors: Avatar Tulsi
comments: 3 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.05661
abstract: Grover's quantum search algorithm evolves a quantum system from a known source state $|s\rangle$ to an unknown target state $|t\rangle$ using the selective phase inversions, $I_{s}$ and $I_{t}$, of these two states. In one of the generalizations of Grover's algorithm, $I_{s}$ is replaced by a general diffusion operator $D_{s}$ having $|s\rangle$ as an eigenstate and $I_{t}$ is replaced by a general selective phase rotation $I_{t}^{\phi}$. A fast quantum search is possible as long as the operator $D_{s}$ and the angle $\phi$ satisfies certain conditions. These conditions are very restrictive in nature. Specifically, suppose $|\ell\rangle$ denote the eigenstates of $D_{s}$ corresponding to the eigenphases $\theta_{\ell}$. Then the sum of the terms $|\langle \ell|t\rangle|^{2}\cot(\theta_{\ell}/2)$ over all $\ell \neq s$ has to be almost equal to $\cot(\phi/2)$ for a fast quantum search. In this paper, we show that this condition can be significantly relaxed by introducing appropriate modifications of the algorithm. This allows access to a more general class of diffusion operators for fast quantum search.

abstract: In nanoscale metrology applications, measurements are commonly limited by the performance of the sensor. Here we show that in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements using single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, the NV sensor electron spin limits spectral resolution down to a few hundred Hz, which constraints the characterization and coherent control of finite spin systems, and furthermore, is insufficient for high resolution NMR spectroscopy aiming at single molecule recognition and structure analysis of the latter. To overcome the limitation, we support an NV electron spin sensor with a nuclear spin qubit acting as quantum and classical memory allowing for intermediate nonvolatile storage of metrology information, while suppressing the deleterious back-action of the sensor onto the system under investigation. We demonstrate quantum and classical memory lifetimes of 8 ms and 4 minutes respectively under ambient conditions. Furthermore, we design and test measurement and decoupling protocols, which exploit such memory qubits efficiently. Using our hybrid quantum-classical sensor device, we achieve high resolution NMR spectra with linewidths of single spins down to 13 Hz. Our work is therefore a prerequisite for high resolution NMR spectroscopy on nanoscopic quantum systems down to the single level.

abstract: A scheme for transferring classical information over a lossy bosonic channel is proposed by generalizing the proposal presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 240502 (2011) by Guha. It employs codewords formed by products of coherent states of fixed mean photon number with multiple phases which, through a passive unitary transformation, reduce to a Pulse-Position Modulation code with multiple pulse phases. The maximum information rate achievable with optimal, yet difficult to implement, detection schemes is computed and shown to saturate the classical capacity of the channel in the low energy regime. An easy to implement receiver based on a conditional Dolinar detection scheme is also proposed finding that, while suboptimal, it allows for improvements in an intermediate photon-number regime with respect to previous proposals.

abstract: Ultracold interacting Bose atoms placed in disordered two dimensional optical lattices with square and triangular symmetries are found to be localized above a certain disorder strength amplitude. From a Gross-Pitaevskii mean analysis we determine the localization length as a function of the disorder strength and investigate the energy spectrum in terms of the disorder magnitude. We found that the localization length is observed to decrease faster in triangular geometries than in square ones. In the presence of a harmonic confinement localization is observed at the center of the trap. The analysis of the energy spectrum reveals that discrete energy levels acquire a finite width that is always smaller than the distance among energy levels.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.05552
abstract: This work studies in detail the possibility of defining a one-to-one mapping from charge densities as obtained by the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to external potentials. Such a mapping is provided by the Runge-Gross theorem and lies at the very core of time-dependent density functional theory. After introducing the necessary mathematical concepts, the usual mapping "there" - from potentials to wave functions as solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation - is revisited paying special attention to Sobolev regularity. This is scrutinised further when the question of functional differentiability of the solution with respect to the potential arises, a concept related to linear response theory. Finally, after a brief introduction to general density functional theory, the mapping "back again" - from densities to potentials thereby inverting the Schr\"odinger equation for a fixed initial state - is defined. Apart from utilising the original Runge-Gross proof this is achieved through a fixed-point procedure. Both approaches give rise to mathematical issues, previously unresolved, which however could be dealt with to some extent within the framework at hand.

abstract: We demonstrate a hybrid device architecture where the charge states in a double quantum dot (DQD) formed in a Si/SiGe heterostructure are read out using an on-chip superconducting microwave cavity. A quality factor Q = 5,400 is achieved by selectively etching away regions of the quantum well and by reducing photon losses through low-pass filtering of the gate bias lines. Homodyne measurements of the cavity transmission reveal DQD charge stability diagrams. These measurements indicate that electrons trapped in a Si DQD can be effectively coupled to microwave photons, potentially enabling coherent electron-photon interactions in silicon.
