abstract: Entanglement is an important concept in quantum information and computing. Here we provide a simple and elegant geometrical analysis of all rank-2 quantum mixed states. The analysis is complete for all the bipartite states, and is partial for all the multipartite states. We characterize each rank-2 mixed state by defining the Bloch sphere spanned by the eigenstates of the density matrix describing the mixed state, and by the state's location within its Bloch sphere. We provide various interesting examples of entanglement and separability of mixed states belonging to exactly five classes of Bloch spheres, and we prove that there are no other classes. The tools developed in our work can be used for analysing the entanglement of all the quantum states that are "neighbours" of a rank-2 quantum state (namely, of all the states in its Bloch sphere).

abstract: In optomechanics, electromagnetic fields are harnessed to control a single mode of a mechanically compliant system, while other mechanical degrees of freedom remain unaffected due to the modes' mutual orthogonality and high quality factor. Extension of the optical control beyond the directly addressed mode would require a controlled coupling between mechanical modes. Here, we introduce an optically controlled coupling between two oscillation modes of an optically levitated nanoparticle. We sympathetically cool one oscillation mode by coupling it coherently to the second mode, which is feedback cooled. Furthermore, we demonstrate coherent energy transfer between mechanical modes and discuss its application for ground-state cooling.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is an inherently non-classical feature of quantum mechanics and manifests itself through violation of Bell inequalities for nonlocal games. We show that in a fairly general setting, a simple extension of a nonlocal game can certify instead the absence of quantum nonlocality. Through contraposition, our result implies that a super-classical performance for such a game ensures that a player's output is unpredictable to the other player. Previously such output unpredictability was known with respect to a third party.

abstract: An asymmetric double-well potential is considered, assuming that the wells are parabolic around the minima. The WKB wave function of a given energy is constructed inside the barrier between the wells. By matching the WKB function to the exact wave functions of the parabolic wells on both sides of the barrier, for two almost degenerate states, we find a quantization condition for the energy levels which reproduces the known energy splitting formula between the two states. For the other low-lying non-degenerate states, we show that the eigenfunction should be primarily localized in one of the wells with negligible magnitude in the other. Using Dekker's method [Physica 146A (1987) 375], the present analysis generalizes earlier results for weakly biased double-well potentials to systems with arbitrary asymmetry.

abstract: We analyze the low-lying states for a one-dimensional potential consisting of $N$ identical wells, assuming that the wells are parabolic around the minima. Matching the exact wave functions around the minima and the WKB wave functions in the barriers, we find a quantization condition which is then solved to give a formula for the energy eigenvalues explicitly written in terms of the potential. In addition, constructing $N$ localized approximate eigenstates each of which matches on to that of the harmonic oscillator in one of the parabolic wells, and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the subspace spanned by the localized states on the assumption that the localized states form an orthogonal basis, we also find the same formula for the energy eigenvalues which the method of matching the wave functions gives. In the large-$N$ limit, the formula reproduces, at the leading order, the expression for the widths of the narrow energy bands of the Mathieu equation present in the mathematical literature. As there are differences between the $N$-well system in the large-$N$ limit and the fully periodic system, we include a two-dimensional model in which the quadratic minima are located on the vertices of a regular $N$-sided polygon with rotational symmetry of order $N$. We argue that the lowest band of the two-dimensional model closely resembles the tight-binding energy bands of the fully periodic one-dimensional system in that most of the eigenvalues are degenerate in the large-$N$ limit with the eigenfunctions satisfying the Bloch condition under the discrete rotations.

abstract: Quantum digital signature (QDS) is an approach to guarantee the nonrepudiation, unforgeability and transferability of a signature with the information-theoretical security. All previous experimental realizations of QDS relied on an unrealistic assumption of secure channels and the longest distance is only several kilometers. Here, we have experimentally demonstrated a recently proposed QDS protocol without any secure channel. Exploiting the decoy state modulation, we have successfully signed one bit message through up to 102 km optical fiber. Furthermore, we continuously run the system to sign the longer message "USTC" with 32 bit at the distance of 51 km. Our results pave the way towards the practical application of QDS.

abstract: Integrated optical components on lithium niobate play a major role in standard high-speed communication systems. Over the last two decades, after the birth and positioning of quantum information science, lithium niobate waveguide architectures have emerged as one of the key platforms for enabling photonics quantum technologies. Due to mature technological processes for waveguide structure integration, as well as inherent and efficient properties for nonlinear optical effects, lithium niobate devices are nowadays at the heart of many photon-pair or triplet sources, single-photon detectors, coherent wavelength-conversion interfaces, and quantum memories. Consequently, they find applications in advanced and complex quantum communication systems, where compactness, stability, efficiency, and interconnectability with other guided-wave technologies are required. In this review paper, we first introduce the material aspects of lithium niobate, and subsequently discuss all of the above mentioned quantum components, ranging from standard photon-pair sources to more complex and advanced circuits.

abstract: We propose a measure of macroscopic coherence based on the degree of disturbance caused by a coarse-grained measurement. Based on our measure, we point out that recently proposed criteria of macroscopic coherence may lead to inconsistent results when considering certain states such as a product of microscopic superpositions. An inequality relation is proved that relates the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information and the measurement disturbance, providing arguments as to why our approach is able to rule out such inconsistencies. Our work provides a general framework of quantifying macroscopic coherence from an operational point of view, based on the relationship between the precision of the measurement and disturbance of the quantum state.

abstract: The Majorization Principle is a fundamental statement governing the dynamics of information processing in optimal and efficient quantum algorithms. While quantum computation can be modeled to be reversible, due to the unitary evolution undergone by the system, these quantum algorithms are conjectured to obey a quantum arrow of time dictated by the Majorization Principle: the probability distribution associated to the outcomes gets ordered step-by-step until achieving the result of the computation. Here we report on the experimental observation of the effects of the Majorization Principle for two quantum algorithms, namely the quantum fast Fourier transform and a recently introduced validation protocol for the certification of genuine many-boson interference. The demonstration has been performed by employing integrated 3-D photonic circuits fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique, which allows to monitor unambiguously the effects of majorization along the execution of the algorithms. The measured observables provide a strong indication that the Majorization Principle holds true for this wide class of quantum algorithms, thus paving the way for a general tool to design new optimal algorithms with a quantum speedup.

The continuum scattering states are written in terms of the Wilson polynomials whose asymptotics gives the scattering amplitude and phase shift. On the other hand, the finite number of discrete bound states are associated with the Racah polynomials. We are honored to dedicate this work to Prof. Hashim A.

abstract: We investigate the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion in the context of conserved quantities and derive a condition of in- separability for a composite bipartite system depending only on the dimen- sions of its subsystems, which leads to a bi-linear entanglement witness for the two qubit system. A separability inequality using generalized Schrodinger- Robertson uncertainty relation taking suitable operators, has been derived, which proves to be stronger than the bi-linear entanglement witness operator. In the case of mixed density matrices, it identically distinguishes the separable and non separable Werner states.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate system identification for single input single output general (active or passive) quantum linear systems. For a given input we address the following questions: (1) Which parameters can be identified by measuring the output ? (2) How can we construct a system realisation from sufficient input-output data? We show that for time-dependent inputs, the systems which cannot be distinguished are related by symplectic transformations acting on the space of system modes. This complements a previous result for passive linear systems. In the regime of stationary quantum noise input, the output is completely determined by the power spectrum. We define the notion of global minimality for a given power spectrum, and characterise globally minimal systems as those with fully mixed stationary state. We show that in the case of systems with a cascade realisation, the power spectrum completely fixes the transfer function, so the system can be identified up to a symplectic transformation. We give a method for constructing a globally minimal subsystem direct from the power spectrum. Restricting to passive systems the analysis simplifies so that identifiability may be completely understood from the eigenvalues of a particular system matrix.

abstract: A reversible logic has application in quantum computing. A reversible logic design needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure circuit functions or gate functions. The removal of garbage qubits and ancilla qubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit. In the literature, there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible multiplication operation. A multiplication hardware is essential for the circuit design of quantum algorithms, quantum cryptanalysis, and digital signal processing (DSP) applications. The existing designs of reversible quantum integer multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits. In this work, we propose a reversible logic based, garbage-free and ancilla qubit optimized design of a quantum integer multiplier. The proposed quantum integer multiplier utilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a reversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified version of a conventional shift and add method. The proposed design of the quantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier qubits and followed by a rotate right operation. The proposed design of the quantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an improvement ranging from 60% to 90% in ancilla qubits count over the existing work on reversible quantum integer multipliers.

abstract: In this work we examine loss in ring resonator networks from an "operator valued phasor addition" approach (or OVPA approach) which considers the multiple transmission and cross coupling paths of a quantum field traversing a ring resonator coupled to one or two external waveguide buses. We demonstrate the consistency of our approach by the preservation of the operator commutation relation of the out-coupled bus mode. We compare our results to those obtained from the conventional quantum Langevin approach which introduces noise operators in addition to the quantum Heisenberg equations in order to preserve commutation relations in the presence of loss. It is shown that the two expressions agree in the neighborhood of a cavity resonance where the Langevin approach is applicable, whereas the operator valued phasor addition expression we derive is more general, remaining valid far from resonances.

abstract: In a partially filled flat Bloch band electrons do not have a well defined Fermi surface and hence the low-energy theory is not a Fermi liquid. Neverethless, under the influence of an attractive interaction, a superconductor well described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wave function can arise. Here we study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a generic Hubbard model with a flat band. We obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the flat band physics by eliminating higher lying bands via perturbative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. At first order in the interaction energy we recover the usual procedure of projecting the interaction term onto the flat band Wannier functions. We show that the BCS wave function is the exact ground state of the projected interaction Hamiltonian and that the compressibility is diverging as a consequence of an emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is broken by second order interband transitions resulting in a finite compressibility, which we illustrate for a one-dimensional ladder with two perfectly flat bands. These results motivate a further approximation leading to an effective ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The gauge-invariant result for the superfluid weight of a flat band can be obtained from the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model only if the maximally localized Wannier functions in the Marzari-Vanderbilt sense are used. Finally, we prove an important inequality $D \geq \mathcal{W}^2$ between the Drude weight $D$ and the winding number $\mathcal{W}$, which guarantees ballistic transport for topologically nontrivial flat bands in one dimension.

abstract: This volume contains the Proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics and Cognitive Science (SLPCS 2016), which was held on the 11th of June at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, and was co-located with Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2016). Exploiting the common ground provided by the concept of a vector space, the workshop brought together researchers working at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), cognitive science, and physics, offering them an appropriate forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay between these three disciplines inspired theoretically motivated approaches to the understanding of how word meanings interact with each other in sentences and discourse, how diagrammatic reasoning depicts and simplifies this interaction, how language models are determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence meanings interact logically. This first edition of the workshop consisted of three invited talks from distinguished speakers (Hans Briegel, Peter G\"ardenfors, Dominic Widdows) and eight presentations of selected contributed papers. Each submission was refereed by at least three members of the Programme Committee, who delivered detailed and insightful comments and suggestions.

abstract: We study the richer structures of quasi-one-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Genes collective excitations of F = 1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in a harmonic trap potential loaded in an optical lattice. Employing a perturbative method we report general analytical expressions for the con?ned collective polar and ferromagnetic Goldstone modes. In both cases the excited eigenfrequencies are given as function of the 1D e?ective coupling constants, trap frequency and optical lattice parameters. It is shown that the main contribution of the optical lattice laser intensity is to shift the con?ned phonon frequencies. Moreover, for high intensities, the excitation spectrum becomes independent of the self-interaction parameters. We reveal some features of the evolution for the Goldstone modes as well as the condensate densities from the ferromagnetic to the polar phases.

abstract: Although creating a unified theory in Elementary Particles Physics is still an open problem, there are a lot of attempts for unifying other fields of physics. Following such unifications, we regard a two dimensional (2D) classical $\Phi^{4}$ field theory model to study several field theories with different symmetries in various dimensions. While the completeness of this model has been already proved by a mapping between statistical mechanics and quantum information theory, here, we take into account a fundamental systematic approach with purely mathematical basis to re-derive such completeness in a general manner. Due to simplicity and generality, we believe that our method leads to a general approach which can be understood by other physical communities as well as quantum information theorists. Furthermore, our proof of the completeness is not only a proof-of-principle, but also an interesting algorithmic proof. We consider a discrete version of a general field theory as an arbitrary polynomial function of fields which is defined on a lattice with arbitrary dimension. Then we give a few specific transformations on such field theories to convert them to a classical $\phi^4$ field theory on a 2D square lattice with the same Partition function. We also extend the results to the $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions.

abstract: In a recent work [D. Malpetti and T. Roscilde, arXiv:1605.04223] we have shown that in quantum many-body systems at finite temperature, two-point correlations can be formally separated into a thermal part, and a quantum part -- and that generically quantum correlations decay exponentially at finite temperature, with a characteristic, temperature-dependent quantum coherence length. The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum many-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation which affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct description of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice boson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub \emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized to a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to cluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces a family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the quantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to standard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is captured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional quantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study systematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact result, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sub-linear in the { boundary-to-bulk ratio} of the clusters as $T\to 0$, while it becomes faster than linear as $T$ grows. These results pave the way towards the development of semi-classical numerical approaches based on an approximate, { yet} systematically improved account of quantum correlations.

abstract: A novel soliton-like solution in quantum electrodynamics is obtained via a self-consistent field method. By writing the Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics in the Coulomb gauge, we separate out a classical component in the density operator of the electron-positron field. Then, by modeling the state vector in analogy with the theory of superconductivity, we minimize the functional for the energy of the system. This results in the equations of the self-consistent field, where the solutions are associated with the collective excitation of the electron-positron field---the soliton-like solution. In addition, the canonical transformation of the variables allowed us to separate out the total momentum of the system and, consequently, to find the relativistic energy dispersion relation for the moving soliton.
