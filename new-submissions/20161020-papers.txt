abstract: We derive families of optimal and near-optimal probe states for quantum estimation of the coupling constants of a general two-mode number-conserving bosonic Hamiltonian describing one-body and two-body dynamics. We find that the optimal states for estimating the dephasing of the modes, the self-interaction strength, and the contact interaction strength are related to the NOON states, whereas the optimal states for estimation of the intermode single particle tunneling amplitude are superpositions of antipodal SU(2) coherent states. For estimation of the amplitude of pair tunneling and the amplitude of density-dependent single particle tunneling processes, respectively, we introduce classes of variational superposition probe states that provide near perfect saturation of the corresponding quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. We show that the ground state of the pair tunneling term in the Hamiltonian has a high fidelity with the optimal states for estimation of a single particle tunneling amplitude, suggesting that high-performance probes for tunneling amplitude estimation may be produced by tuning the two-mode system through a quantum phase transition.

abstract: The influence of wave function symmetry on statistical correlation is studied for the case of three non-interacting spin-free quantum particles in a unidimensional box, in position and in momentum space. Higher-order statistical correlations occurring among the particles in this three-particle quantum system is quantified via higher-order mutual information and compared to the correlation between pairs of variables in this model, and to the correlation in the two-particle system. The results for the higher-order mutual information show that in general symmetric wave functions are more correlated than the antisymmetric ones with same quantum numbers. This holds in position as well as in momentum space. This behavior is opposite to that observed for the correlation between pairs of variables in this model, and the two-particle system, where the antisymmetric wave functions are in general more correlated. The use of higher-order mutual information as a correlation measure, is monitored and examined by considering a superposition of states or systems with two Slater determinants.

abstract: Bethe ansatz solutions of the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian for any (integer and half-integer) $J$ are derived based on the Jordan-Schwinger (differential) boson realization of the $SU(2)$ algebra after desired Euler rotations, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number of the system. It is shown that solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations can be obtained as zeros of the extended Heine-Stieltjes polynomials. Two sets of solutions, with solution number being $J+1$ and $J$ respectively when $J$ is an integer and $J+1/2$ each when $J$ is a half-integer, are obtained. Properties of the zeros of the related extended Heine-Stieltjes polynomials for half-integer $J$ cases are discussed. It is clearly shown that double degenerate level energies for half-integer $J$ are symmetric with respect to the $E=0$ axis. It is also shown that the excitation energies of the `yrast' and other `yrare' bands can all be asymptotically given by quadratic functions of $J$, especially when $J$ is large.

As a consequence of which we are able to obtain a Hamiltonian which commute with itself at different times. We solve the problem using the Sylvester Formula where we make use of the eigenvalues.

abstract: We study very generally to what extent the uncertainty with which a phase shift can be estimated in quantum metrology can be reduced by extending the Hamiltonian that generates the phase shift to an ancilla system with a Hilbert space of arbitrary dimension, and allowing arbitrary interactions between the original system and the ancilla. Such Hamiltonian extensions provide a general framework for open quantum systems, as well as for "non-linear metrology schemes" that have been investigated over the last few years. We prove that such Hamiltonian extensions cannot improve the sensitivity of the phase shift measurement when considering the quantum Fisher information optimized over input states.

abstract: In this paper we investigate how the dynamics of a two-level atom is affected by its interaction with the quantized near field of a plasmonic slab in relative motion. We demonstrate that for small separation distances and a relative velocity greater than a certain threshold, this interaction can lead to a population inversion, such that the probability of the excited state exceeds the probability of the ground state, corresponding to a negative spontaneous emission rate. It is shown that the developed theory is intimately related to a classical problem. The problem of quantum friction is analyzed and the differences with respect to the corresponding classical effect are highlighted.

abstract: A qudit ($d$-level quantum systems) has a large Hilbert space and thus can be used to achieve many quantum information and communication tasks. Here, we propose a method to transfer arbitrary $d$-dimensional quantum states (known or unknown) between two superconducting qudits coupled to a single cavity. The state transfer can be performed fast because of employing resonant interactions only. In addition, quantum states can be deterministically transferred without measurement. Numerical simulations show that high-fidelity transfer of quantum states between two superconducting transmon qudits ($d\leq5$) is feasible with current circuit QED technology. This proposal is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the same task with various superconducting qudits, quantum dots, or natural atoms coupled to a cavity or resonator.

abstract: In two- and three-dimensional structures, topologically-protected chiral edge modes offer a powerful mean to realize robust light transport. However, little attention has been paid so far to robust one-way transport in one-dimensional systems. Here it is shown that unidirectional transport, which is immune to disorder and backscattering, can occur in certain one-dimensional metacrystals with long-range hopping without resorting to topological protection. Such metacrystals are described by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian with broken time reversal symmetry, and transport does not require adiabatic (Thouless) pumping. A simple implementation in optics of such one-dimensional metacrystals, based on transverse light dynamics in a self-imaging optical cavity with phase gratings, is suggested

abstract: We consider wave transport phenomena in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of the periodically-kicked quantum rotator model and reveal that dynamical localization assists the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ phase. In the delocalized (quantum resonance) regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is always in the broken phase and ratchet acceleration arises as a signature of unidirectional non-Hermitian transport. An optical implementation of the periodically-kicked $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian, based on transverse beam propagation in a passive optical resonator with combined phase and loss gratings, is suggested to visualize acceleration modes in fractional Talbot cavities.

abstract: Observer dependence is central to Quantum Mechanics; in particular if we associate consistent sets with observer worldviews we can think of the Consistent Histories (CH) interpretation as a formalisation of observer dependence. However we lack a theory of the observers themselves. In this paper we begin by building such a theory within General Relativity (GR), and find that this framework bears close mathematical resemblance to the treatment of consistent sets in CH. We therefore adapt the CHSH framework to identify the `gap' between the classical and quantum theories. We find that the CHSH argument does not hold on a curved background, so that the inequality may be violated by classical theories.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to derive the pointer states of a macro-object using a simple perturbation method. We study the model Hamiltonian involving the weak interaction between the center of mass and its environment. The main conclusion is that the pointer states emerge as the small part of the total state vector when the interaction Hamiltonian is not dominant: the degrees of freedom being at the center of interaction can be localized. In the weak interaction case, if the disappearance of the energy contribution from the off-diagonal terms is caused by the decoherence, it threatens the conservation law. In this study, however, the energy conservation reasonably holds, since the non-classical (i.e., normal quantum) states give main contribution to it. The emergence of the pointer states also implies the special initial state in which the localized state makes the deep well of the potential. In the result, the unitary time evolution of a pointer state is very different from that of the majority of the original state vector of the total system.

abstract: In seminal work, Szegedy gave a method for quantizing a classical Markov chain that has been especially useful for searching for marked vertices in graphs. We prove, however, that this algorithm fails when searching on the two-dimensional periodic square lattice with a marked diagonal, in the sense that the state of the system only evolves by acquiring minus signs. Then the state is a uniform probability distribution over the vertices for all time, which is equivalent to classically guessing and checking. Furthermore, we prove that this failure also occurs for any configuration of marked vertices on the one-dimensional cycle and for any configuration that reduces to it. Thus, Szegedy's quantum walk has a family of exceptional configurations for which it does not spread. Despite this, we exploit this stationary behavior to construct a quantum walk with an arbitrary polynomial speedup over the classical random walk, and it is the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup.

abstract: The Landsman-Reuvers proposal to solve the measurement problem from within quantum theory is extensively analysed. In favor of proposals of this kind, it is shown that the standard reasoning behind objections to solving the measurement problem from within quantum theory rely on counterfactual reasoning or mathematical idealisations. Subsequently, a list of objections/challenges to the proposal are made. Part of these objections are equally important for all attempts at solving the measurement problem, such as the problem of interpreting small numbers in the density matrix, the problem of reproducing the Born rule, the use of pure states as a tool to alleviate the interpretational issues of quantum states, and the necessity of introducing classical certainties which are not strictly present in quantum theory. The additional objections that are particular to the proposal, such as the physical interpretation/origin of the flea perturbation, the use of potentials to solve a dynamical problem, slow collapse times, the inability to handle unequal probabilities, and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead us to believe that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking in both physical grounding and theoretical promise. Finally, an overview is given of the challenges that were encountered in this attempt to solve the measurement problem from within quantum theory.

abstract: Quantum state transfer within a quantum computer can be modelled mathematically by a graph. Here, we focus on the corresponding Laplacian matrix, and those graphs for which the Laplacian can be diagonalized by a Hadamard matrix. We give a simple eigenvalue characterization for when such a graph has perfect state transfer at time $\pi/2$; this characterization allows one to reverse-engineer graphs having perfect state transfer. We then introduce a new operation on graphs, which we call the \emph{merge}, that takes two Hadamard-diagonalizable graphs on $n$ vertices and produces a new graph on $2n$ vertices. We use this operation to produce a wide variety of new graphs that exhibit perfect state transfer, and we consider several corollaries in the settings of both weighted and unweighted graphs, as well as how our results relate to the notion of pretty good state transfer.

abstract: We propose a criterion to classify and compare sources of single photons: the $p$-norm of their $k$th-order photon correlations. While ideally one should use the uniform norm with $p\rightarrow\infty$, in practice, the 3-norm already allows a meaningful comparison and shows the serious limitations of the usual criterion based on the second order correlation $g^{(2)}$ only. We apply this new criterion to a large family of popular single photon sources and show that some of them do not, in fact, qualify for this function. The best sources from our selections consist of a cascade of two-level systems, improving on the otherwise standard low-power resonant excitation of a single two-level system.

abstract: We present a heuristic derivation of Born's rule and unitary transforms in Quantum Mechanics, from a simple set of axioms built upon a physical phenomenology of quantization. This approach naturally leads to the usual quantum formalism, within a new realistic conceptual framework that is discussed in details. Physically, the structure of Quantum Mechanics appears as a result of the interplay between the quantized number of "modalities" accessible to a quantum system, and the continuum of "contexts" that are required to define these modalities. Mathematically, the Hilbert space structure appears as a consequence of a specific "extra-contextuality" of modalities, closely related to the hypothesis of Gleason's theorem, and consistent with its conclusions.

abstract: We study the fundamental limits on the reliable storage of quantum information in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of local approximate correctability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations thereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff bounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits $k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\delta$ that quantifies how well the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\ell$ that specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In a regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\epsilon$ that is exponentially small in $\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local commuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\frac{2}{D-1}} \le O\bigl(n (\log n)^{\frac{2D}{D-1}} \bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of Euclidean metric. We also find that the code distance of any local approximate code cannot exceed $O\bigl(\ell n^{(D-1)/D}\bigr)$ if $\delta \le O(\ell n^{-1/D})$. As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of logical operator avoidance, we show that the code distance $d$ and the size $\tilde d$ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical operators satisfies $\tilde d d^{\frac{1}{D-1}}\le O\bigl( n \ell^{\frac{D}{D-1}} \bigr)$, where the logical operators are accurate up to $O\bigl( ( n \delta / d )^{1/2}\bigr)$ in operator norm. Finally, we prove that for two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by operators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of the code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of algebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types.

abstract: Several semi-relativistic Hamiltonians have been proposed to describe the interaction of light with magnetic matter. In the calculation of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, these different Hamiltonians lead to different results. Gauge invariance is supposed to help choosing the proper Hamiltonian, but we show that the semi-classical formulation of the absorption cross-section is not gauge invariant in a commonly accepted sense. To avoid the problem of choosing the proper semi-relativistic Hamiltonian, we start from the fully relativistic absorption and scattering cross-sections given by quantum electrodynamics and we derive a semi-relativistic expansion of the cross-sections by formulating a new many-body Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunctions in the transition matrix elements. In the process, a new light-matter interaction term emerges, called the spin-position interaction, that contributes significantly to the magnetic x-ray circular dichroism of transition metals. In the case of absorption, the final formula agrees with the result obtained from one of the semi-relativistic Hamiltonians. However, the correct scattering cross-section is not given by any of the semi-relativistic Hamiltonians.

The system has rich topological features, for examples, the threefold degeneracy points called Maxwell points may have nontrivial $\pm 2\pi$ Berry phases and the anomalous quantum Hall effect with spin-momentum locking may appear in topological Maxwell insulators. We propose realistic schemes for realizing the Maxwell metals/insulators and detecting the intrinsic properties of the topological Maxwell quasiparticles with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: By using a state of art tensor network state method, we study the ground-state phase diagram of an extended Bose-Hubbard model on square lattice with frustrated next-nearest neighboring tunneling. In the hardcore limit, tunneling frustration stabilizes a peculiar half supersolid (HSS) phase with a SS sublattice and an empty-occupied sublattice away from half filling. A new phase separation regime composes of the HSS and superfluid phases is also identified. In the softcore case, the model show very rich phase diagrams above half filling, including three different types of supersolid phases depending on the interaction parameters. The considered model provides a promising route to realize the stable SS state especially in below half filling region, which can be implemented experimentally with dipolar atoms or molecules.

Additionally, we give an analysis of the complexity of our method and provide numerical evidence that it yields good approximations of the entropy of density matrices represented by MPOs while being robust against truncations.

abstract: A proposal for a magnetic quantum processor that consists of individual molecular spins coupled to superconducting coplanar resonators and transmission lines is carefully examined. We derive a simple magnetic quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonian to describe the underlying physics. It is shown that these hybrid devices can perform arbitrary operations on each spin qubit and induce tunable interactions between any pair of them. The combination of these two operations ensures that the processor can perform universal quantum computations. The feasibility of this proposal is critically discussed using the results of realistic calculations, based on parameters of existing devices and molecular qubits. These results show that the proposal is feasible, provided that molecules with sufficiently long coherence times can be developed and accurately integrated into specific areas of the device. This architecture has an enormous potential for scaling up quantum computation thanks to the microscopic nature of the individual constituents, the molecules, and the possibility of using their internal spin degrees of freedom.
