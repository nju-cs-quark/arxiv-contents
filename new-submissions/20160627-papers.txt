abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of an atom in a V-level configuration driven by lasers and coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide. The coupling to the waveguide is chiral, in that each transition interacts only with the modes propagating in a given direction, and this direction is opposite for the two transitions. The waveguide is terminated by a mirror which coherently feeds the photon stream emitted by one transition back to the atom. First, we are interested in the dynamics of the atom in the Markovian limit where the time-delay in the feedback is negligible. Specifically, we study the conditions under which the atom evolves towards a pure "dark" stationary state, where the photons emitted by both transitions interfere destructively thanks to the coherent feedback, and the overall emission vanishes. This is a single-atom analogue of the quantum dimer, where a pair of laser-driven two-level atoms is coupled to a unidirectional waveguide and dissipates towards a pure entangled dark state. Our setup should be feasible with current state-of-the-art experiments. Second, we extend our study to non-Markovian regimes and investigate the effect of the feedback retardation on the steady-state.

abstract: We use semiconductor quantum dots, "artificial atoms," to implement a scheme for deterministic generation of long strings of entangled photons in a cluster state, an important resource for quantum information processing. We demonstrate a prototype device which produces strings of a few hundred photons in which the entanglement persists over 5 sequential photons. The implementation follows a proposal by Lindner and Rudolph (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2009) which suggested periodic timed excitation of a precessing electron spin as a mechanism for entangling the electron spin with the polarization of the sequentially emitted photons. In our realization, the entangling qubit is a quantum dot confined dark exciton. By performing full quantum process tomography, we obtain the process map which fully characterizes the evolution of the system, containing the dark exciton and n photons after n applications of the periodic excitations. Our implementation may greatly reduce the resources needed for quantum information processing.

abstract: Teleportation of an entangled state, known as entanglement swapping, plays an essential role in quantum communication and network.Here we report a field-test entanglement swapping experiment with two independent telecommunication band entangled photon-pair sources over the optical fibre network of Hefei city. The two sources are located at two nodes 12 km apart and the Bell-state measurement is performed in a third location which is connected to the two source nodes with 14.7 km and 10.6 km optical fibres. An average visibility of 79.9+/-4.8% is observed in our experiment, which is high enough to infer a violation of Bell inequality. With the entanglement swapping setup, we demonstrate a source independent quantum key distribution, which is also immune to any attack against detection in the measurement site.

abstract: We propose a systematic procedure to optimize quantum state tomography protocols for continuous variable systems based on excitation counting preceded by a displacement operation. Compared with conventional tomography based on Husimi or Wigner function measurement, the excitation counting approach can significantly reduce the number of measurement settings. We investigate both informational completeness and robustness, and provide a bound of reconstruction error involving the condition number of the sensing map. We also identify the measurement settings that optimize this error bound, and demonstrate that the improved reconstruction robustness can lead to an order of magnitude reduction of estimation error with given resources. This optimization procedure is general and can incorporate prior information of the unknown state to further simplify the protocol.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a one dimensional quantum spin chain evolving from unentangled or entangled initial state. At a given instant of time a quantum dynamical process (ex. measurement) is performed on a single spin at one end of the chain. The aim is to detect if the process occurred or not from a measurement on a far away spin at a later time. From the dynamical evolution of the state from the epoch time it is possible to detect the occurrence of the dynamical process. The propagation of the signal for the dynamical process, and the speed of the signal are investigated for various spin models, viz. the Ising, Heisenberg, and the transverse-XY dynamics.

abstract: We express the positive partial transpose (PPT) separability criterion for symmetric states of multi-qubit systems in terms of matrix inequalities based on the recently introduced tensor representation for spin states. We construct a matrix from the tensor representation of the state and show that it is similar to the partial transpose of the density matrix written in the computational basis. Furthermore, the positivity of this matrix is equivalent to the positivity of a correlation matrix constructed from tensor products of Pauli operators. This allows for a more transparent experimental interpretation of the PPT criteria for an arbitrary spin-j state. The unitary matrices connecting our matrix to the partial transpose of the state generalize the so-called magic basis that plays a central role in Wootters' explicit formula for the concurrence of a 2-qubit system and the Bell bases used for the teleportation of a one or two-qubit state.

abstract: We study the question of whether a macroscopic superposition can naturally exist as a ground state of some gapped many-body Hamiltonian. We derive an upper bound on the energy gap of an arbitrary physical Hamiltonian provided that its ground state is a superposition of two macroscopic "semi-classical" states. For a large class of such macroscopic superposition states we show that the gap vanishes in the macroscopic limit. Our main result shows an interesting quantitative relation between the order of interaction and separation probability between the two constituents of the superposition. This in turn shows that preparation of a "typical" Schr\"odinger cat-like state by simple cooling to the ground state would require the order of interaction to increase with the size of system. We also discuss our results in the context of quantum spin-lattice models and trapped Bose-Einstein condensates and we find that certain classes of states (e.g. W states), although not usually considered to exhibit macroscopic quantum properties, cannot be ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians.

abstract: We show how the Laplace transform can be used to give a solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for an arbitrary initial wave packet if the solution of the stationary equation is known. The solution is achieved without summing up eigenstates, nor do we need the path integral. Providing several examples, we show that our method yields a direct and inituitive picture of the wave packet dynamics. The representations of the exact solutions we have found reproduce explicitely the reflection process due to the given potential. They are the quantum counterpart of the classical dynamics. This makes the method especially appropriate for the study of the transition between classical and quantum mechanics.

abstract: A clock steps a computer through a cycle of phases. For the propagation of logical symbols from one computer to another, each computer must mesh its phases with arrivals of symbols from other computers. Even the best atomic clocks drift unforeseeably in frequency and phase; feedback steers them toward aiming points that depend on a chosen wave function and on hypotheses about signal propagation. A wave function, always under-determined by evidence, requires a guess. Guessed wave functions are coded into computers that steer atomic clocks in frequency and position---clocks that step computers through their phases of computations, as well as clocks, some on space vehicles, that supply evidence of the propagation of signals. Recognizing the dependence of the phasing of symbol arrivals on guesses about signal propagation elevates `logical synchronization.' from its practice in computer engineering to a discipline essential to physics. Within this discipline we begin to explore questions invisible under any concept of time that fails to acknowledge the unforeseeable. In particular, variation of spacetime curvature is shown to limit the bit rate of logical communication.

abstract: We introduce an inhomogeneous protocol to drive a weakly disordered quantum spin chain quasi-adiabatically across a quantum phase transition and minimize the residual energy of the final state. The number of spins that simultaneously reach the critical point is controlled by the length scale of the inhomogeneity in which the magnetic field is modulated, introducing an effective size that favors adiabatic dynamics. The dependence of the residual energy on this length scale and the velocity at which the magnetic field sweeps out the chain is shown to be nonmonotonic. We determine the conditions for an optimal suppression of the residual energy of the final state and show that inhomogeneous driving can outperform conventional adiabatic schemes based on homogeneous control fields by several orders of magnitude.

abstract: We examine the Casimir free energy and pressure of magnetic metal films, which are free-standing in vacuum, sandwiched between two dielectric plates, and deposited on either nonmagnetic or magnetic metallic plates. All calculations are performed using both the Drude and plasma model approaches to the Lifshitz theory. According to our results, the Casimir free energies and pressures calculated using both theoretical approaches are significantly different in the magnitude and sign even for thin films of several tens of nanometers thickness. Thus, for the Ni film of 47\,nm thickness deposited on a Fe plate the obtained magnitudes of the Casimir free energy differ by the factor of 5866. We show that the Casimir free energy and pressure of a magnetic film calculated using the plasma model approach do not possess the classical limit, but exponentially fast drop to zero with increasing film thickness. If the Drude model approach is used, the classical limit is reached for magnetic films of about 150\,nm thickness, but the Casimir free energy remains nonzero in the limit of ideal metal, contrary to expectations. For the plasma model approach the Casimir free energy of a film vanishes in this case. Numerical computations are performed for the magnetic films made of Ni, nonmagnetic plates made of Cu and Al, and magnetic plates made of Fe using the tabulated optical data for the complex indexes of refraction of all metals. The obtained results can be used for a discrimination between the plasma and Drude model approaches in the Casimir physics and in the investigation of stability of thin films.

abstract: Multiplexed quantum memories capable of storing and processing entangled photons are essential for the development of quantum networks. In this context, we demonstrate the simultaneous storage and retrieval of two entangled photons inside a solid-state quantum memory and measure a temporal multimode capacity of ten modes. This is achieved by producing two polarization entangled pairs from parametric down conversion and mapping one photon of each pair onto a rare-earth-ion doped (REID) crystal using the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. We develop a concept of indirect entanglement witnesses, which can be used as Schmidt number witness, and we use it to experimentally certify the presence of more than one entangled pair retrieved from the quantum memory. Our work puts forward REID-AFC as a platform compatible with temporal multiplexing of several entangled photon pairs along with a new entanglement certification method useful for the characterisation of multiplexed quantum memories.

abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of photonic signals preserves quantum information while simultaneously changing the signal wavelength. A common application of QFC is to translate the wavelength of a signal compatible with the current fiber-optic infrastructure to a shorter wavelength more compatible with high quality single-photon detectors and optical memories. Recent work has investigated the use of QFC to manipulate and measure specific temporal modes (TMs) through tailoring of the pump pulses. Such a scheme holds promise for multidimensional quantum state manipulation that is both low loss and re-programmable on a fast time scale. We demonstrate the first QFC temporal mode sorting system in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, achieving a conversion efficiency and mode separability as high as 92% and 0.84, respectively. A 20-GHz pulse train is projected onto 6 different TMs, including superposition states, and mode separability with weak coherent signals is verified via photon counting. Such ultrafast high-dimensional photonic signals could enable long-distance quantum communication with high rates.

The ground state may be interpreted as a deformation away from the uniform superposition of colored Motzkin paths, showed by Movassagh and Shor to have a large (square-root) but sub-extensive scaling of entanglement into a state with an extensive entropy.

abstract: We propose a novel method for reducing the number of variables in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, using a quantum annealer to fix the value of a large portion of the variables to values that have a high probability of being optimal. This method significantly increases the success rate and number of observations of the best known energy value in the sample obtained from the quantum annealer, when compared with calling the quantum annealer without using it, even when using fewer annealing cycles. Use of the method results in a considerable improvement in success metrics even for problems with high-precision couplers and biases. The results are further enhanced by applying the method iteratively and combining it with classical pre-processing. We present results for both Chimera graph-structured problems and embedded problems from a real-world application.

abstract: A causal scenario is a graph that describes the cause and effect relationships between all relevant variables in an experiment. A scenario is deemed interesting if different operational probabilistic theories give rise to different marginal distributions of the observed variables -- a Bell-type experiment is one example. Graphs that are not interesting are boring in a precise sense: the predictions of an arbitrary generalised probabilistic theory (quantum or otherwise) can be reproduced by local hidden variables respecting the causal structure of the graph. Henson, Lal and Pusey (HLP) [New J. Phys. 16, 113043] recently proposed a sufficient condition for a causal scenario to be boring. In this paper we review and propose several sufficient conditions for a graph to be interesting. We first show that existing graphical techniques due to Evans can be used to confirm that many graphs are interesting without having to explicitly search for inequality violations. For three exceptional cases -- the graphs numbered 15,16,20 in HLP -- we show that there exist non-Shannon-type entropic inequalities that imply these graphs are interesting.

abstract: We introduce a new selected configuration interaction plus perturbation theory algorithm that is based on a deterministic analog of our recent efficient heat-bath sampling algorithm. This Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the tradeoff between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection of determinants to add to a variational wavefunction, and one which controls the the selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative correction to the variational energy. We show that HCI provides an accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly-correlated chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core. These systems have full variational spaces of 3x10^14 and 2x10^22 determinants respectively.

abstract: Streaking of photoelectrons has long been used for the temporal characterization of attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses. When the time-resolved photoelectrons originate from a coherent superposition of electronic states, they carry an additional phase information, which can be retrieved by the streaking technique. In this contribution we extend the streaking formalism to include coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in molecules as well as initial coherences and demonstrate how it offers a novel tool to monitor non-adiabatic dynamics as it occurs in the vicinity of conical intersections and avoided crossings. Streaking can enhance the time resolution and provide direct signatures of electronic coherences, which affect many primary photochemical and biological events.

abstract: We study wave scattering from a gently curved surface. We show that the recursive relations, implied by shift invariance, among the coefficients of the perturbative series for the scattering amplitude allow to perform an infinite resummation of the perturbative series to all orders in the amplitude of the corrugation. The resummed series provides a derivative expansion of the scattering amplitude in powers of derivatives of the height profile, which is expected to become exact in the limit of quasi-specular scattering. We discuss the relation of our results with the so-called small-slope approximation introduced some time ago by Voronovich.

abstract: Invisibility cloak capable of hiding an object can be achieved by properly manipulating electromagnetic field. Such a remarkable ability has been shown in transformation and ray optics. Alternatively, it may be realistic to create a spatial cloak by means of confining electromagnetic field in three-dimensional arrayed waveguides and introducing appropriate collective curvature surrounding an object. We realize the artificial structure in borosilicate by femtosecond laser direct writing, where we prototype up to 5000 waveguides to conceal millimeter-scale volume. We characterize the performance of the cloak by normalized cross correlation, tomography analysis and continuous three-dimensional viewing angle scan. Our results show invisibility cloak can be achieved in waveguide optics. Furthermore, directly printed invisibility cloak on a photonic chip may enable controllable study and novel applications in classical and quantum integrated photonics, such as invisualising a coupling or swapping operation with on-chip circuits of their own.
