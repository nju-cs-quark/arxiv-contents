abstract: Recently, two-photon six-qubit hyperentanged states were produced in experiment and they can improve the channel capacity of quantum communication largely. Here we present the first scheme for the hyperentanglement purification of nonlocal two-photon systems in three degrees of freedom (DOFs), including the polarization, the first longitudinal momentum, and the second longitudinal momentum DOFs. Our hyper-EPP is constructed with two steps resorting to parity-check quantum nondemolition measurement on the three DOFs and SWAP gates, respectively. With these two steps, the bit-flip errors in the three DOFs can be corrected efficiently. Using SWAP gates is a universal method for hyper-EPP in the polarization DOF and multiple longitudinal momentum DOFs. The implementation of our hyper-EPP is assisted by nitrogen-vacancy centers in optical microcavities, which could be achieved with current techniques. It is useful for long-distance high-capacity quantum communication with two-photon six-qubit hyperentanglement.

abstract: We consider a family of quantum Hamiltonians $H_\hbar=-\hbar^2\,(d^2\!/dx^2) +V(x)$, $x\in\mathbb{R},$ $\hbar>0,$ where $V(x)=i(x^3-x)$ is an imaginary double well potential. We prove the existence of infinite eigenvalue crossings with the selection rules of the eigenvalue pairs taking part in a crossing. This is a semiclassical localization effect. The eigenvalues at the crossings accumulate at a critical energy for some of the Stokes lines.

abstract: We describe relations between several relativistic spin observables and derive a Lorentz-invariant characteristic of a reduced spin density matrix. A relativistic position operator that satisfies all the properties of its non-relativistic analogue does not exist. Instead we propose two causality-preserving positive operator-valued measures (POVM) that are based on projections onto one-particle and antiparticle spaces, and on the normalized energy density. They predict identical expectation values for position. The variances differ by less than a quarter of the squared de Broglie wavelength and coincide in the non-relativistic limit. Since the resulting statistical moment operators are not canonical conjugates of momentum, the Heisenberg uncertainty relations need not hold. Indeed, the energy density POVM leads to a lower uncertainty. We reformulate the standard equations of the spin dynamics by explicitly considering the charge-independent acceleration, allowing a consistent treatment of backreaction and inclusion of a weak gravitational field.
