abstract: We introduce the third independent exactly solvable hypergeometric potential, after the Eckart and the P\"oschl-Teller potentials, which is proportional to an energy-independent parameter and has a shape that is independent of this parameter. The general solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for this potential is written through fundamental solutions each of which presents an irreducible combination of two Gauss hypergeometric functions. The potential is an asymmetric step-barrier with variable height and steepness. Discussing the transmission above such a barrier, we derive a compact formula for the reflection coefficient.

abstract: Quantum communication without a shared reference frame or the construction of a relational quantum theory requires the notion of a quantum reference frame. We analyze aspects of quantum reference frames associated with non-compact groups, specifically the group of spatial translations and Galilean boosts. We begin by demonstrating how the usually employed group average, used to dispense of the notion of an external reference frame, leads to unphysical states when applied to reference frames associated with non-compact groups. However, we show that this average does lead naturally to a reduced state on the relative degrees of freedom of a system, which was previously considered by Angelo et al. [1]. We then study in detail the informational properties of this reduced state for systems of two and three particles in Gaussian states.

abstract: The Quantum Query Model is a framework that allow us to express most known quantum algorithms. Algorithms represented by this model consist on a set of unitary operators acting over a finite Hilbert space, and a final measurement step consisting on a set of projectors. In this work, we prove that the application of these unitary operators before the measurement step is equivalent to decomposing a unit vector into a sum of vectors and then inverting some of their relative phases. We also prove that the vectors of that sum must fulfill a list of properties and we call such vectors a Block Set. If we take the same measurement step on the Quantum Query Model and on the Block Set Formulation, then we prove that both formulations give the same Gram matrix of output states, although the Block Set Formulation allows a much more explicit form. Therefore, the Block Set reformulation of the Quantum Query Model has advantages for the design of exact quantum algorithms. Finally, we test these advantages of Block Sets by applying our approach to the construction of quantum exact algorithms.

abstract: We present exact results on the exactly solvable spin chain of Bravyi et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 207202 (2012)]. This model is a spin one chain and has a Hamiltonian that is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. It has a unique (frustration free) ground state with an energy gap that is polynomially small in the system's size ($2n$). The half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state is $\frac{1}{2}\log n+const.$. Here we first write the Hamiltonian in the standard spin-basis representation. We prove that at zero temperature, the magnetization is along the $z-$direction i.e., $\langle s^{x}\rangle=\langle s^{y}\rangle=0$ (everywhere on the chain). We then analytically calculate $\langle s^{z}\rangle$ and the two-point correlation functions of $s^{z}$. By analytically diagonalizing the reduced density matrices, we calculate the Schmidt rank, von Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropies for: 1. Any partition of the chain into two pieces (not necessarily in the middle) and 2. $L$ consecutive spins centered in the middle. Further, we identify entanglement Hamiltonians (Eqs. 40 and 50). We prove a small lemma (Lemma1) on the combinatorics of lattice paths using the reflection principle to relate and calculate the Motzkin walk 'height' to spin expected values. We also calculate the, closely related, (scaled) correlation functions of Brownian excursions. The known features of this model are summarized in a table in Sec.I.

abstract: The existence of minimal length scale has motivated the proposal of generalized uncertainty principle, which provides a potential routine to probe quantum gravitational effects in low-energy quantum mechanics experiment. Hitherto, the tabletop experiment of testing deviations from ordinary quantum mechanics are mostly based on microscopic objects. However, the feasibility of these studies are challenged by the recent study of spacetime quantization for composite macroscopic body. In this paper, we propose a scheme to probe quantum gravity effects by revealing the deviations from predictions of Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Our scheme focus on manipulating the interaction sequences between external laser fields and a single trapped ion to seek evidence of spacetime quantization, therefore reduce the complicity induced by large bodies to some extent. The relevant study for microscopic particles is crucial considering the lack of satisfactory theories regarding basic properties for multi-particles in the framework of quantum gravity. Meanwhile, we are managed to set a new upper limit for deformation parameter.

abstract: The ability to modulate an optical field via an electric field is regarded as a key function of electro-optic interconnects, which are used in optical communications and information processing systems. One of the main required devices for such interconnects is the electro-optic modulator (EOM). Current EOM based on the electro-optic effect and the electro-absorption effect often is bulky and power inefficient due to the weak electro-optic properties of its constituent materials. Here we propose a new mechanism to produce an arbitrary-waveform EOM based on the quantum interference, in which both the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are engineered coherently with the superhigh efficiency. Based on this EOM, a waveform interconnect from the voltage to the modulated optical absorption is realised. We expect that such a new type of electro-optic interconnect will have a broad range of applications including the optical communications and network.

abstract: We present a general approach to calculating the entanglement of formation for superpositions of two-mode coherent states, placed equidistantly on a circle in the phase space. We show that in the particular case of rotationally-invariant circular states the Schmidt decomposition of two modes, and therefore the value of their entanglement, are given by analytical expressions. We analyse the dependence of the entanglement on the radius of the circle and number of components in the superposition. We also show that the set of rotationally-invariant circular states creates an orthonormal basis in the state space of the harmonic oscillator, and this basis is advantageous for representation of other circular states of light.

We show that the retarded dipole-dipole interaction creates coherence regardless of the coherence properties of the excitation fields. In contrast to earlier claims in the literature, our rigorous analysis shows that the steady state coherence {\it increases} with the energy gradient between the two-level atoms.

abstract: This paper is concerned with a filtering problem for a class of nonlinear quantum stochastic systems with multichannel nondemolition measurements. The system-observation dynamics are governed by a Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation driven by quantum Wiener processes of bosonic fields in vacuum state. The Hamiltonian and system-field coupling operators, as functions of the system variables, are represented in a Weyl quantization form. Using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we obtain a stochastic integro-differential equation for the posterior quasi-characteristic function (QCF) of the system conditioned on the measurements. This equation is a spatial Fourier domain representation of the Belavkin-Kushner-Stratonovich stochastic master equation driven by the innovation process associated with the measurements. We also discuss a more specific form of the posterior QCF dynamics in the case of linear system-field coupling and outline a Gaussian approximation of the posterior quantum state.

abstract: The transition from quantum to classical physics remains an intensely debated question even though it has been investigated for more than a century. Further clarifications could be obtained by preparing macroscopic objects in spatial quantum superpositions and proposals for generating such states for nano-mechanical devices either in a transient or a probabilistic fashion have been put forward. Here we introduce a method to deterministically obtain spatial superpositions of arbitrary lifetime via dissipative state preparation. In our approach, we engineer a double-well potential for the motion of the mechanical element and drive it towards the ground state, which shows the desired spatial superposition, via optomechanical sideband cooling. We propose a specific implementation based on a superconducting circuit coupled to the mechanical motion of a lithium-decorated monolayer graphene sheet, introduce a method to verify the mechanical state by coupling it to a superconducting qubit, and discuss its prospects for testing collapse models for the quantum to classical transition.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.07942
abstract: One of the current major challenges surrounding the use of quantum annealers for solving practical optimization problems is their inability to encode even moderately sized problems---the main reason for this being the rigid layout of their quantum bits as well as their sparse connectivity. In particular, the implementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of practical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful penalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian --- a technique that often requires an `all-to-all' connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique designed to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on the construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of the problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose general guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an arbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism, not-all-equal 3SAT, and the so-called Lechner, Hauke and Zoller constraints. We also discuss the significance of our approach in the context of current and future experimental quantum annealers.

abstract: Refocusing of a quantum system in NMR and quantum information processing can be achieved by application of short pulses according to the methods of spin echo and dynamical decoupling. However, these methods are strongly limited by the requirement that the evolution of the system between pulses be suitably small. Here we show how refocusing may be achieved for arbitrary (but time-independent) evolution of the system between pulses. We first illustrate the procedure with one-qubit systems, and then generalize to $d$-dimensional quantum systems. We also give an application of this result to quantum computation, proving a new version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that does not require inverse gates.

abstract: The quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open system characterizes the most efficient response of the system to the environmental influences. Previous results showed that the non-Markovianity governs the quantum speedup. Via studying the dynamics of a dissipative two-level system, we reveal that the non-Markovian effect is only the dynamical way of the quantum speedup, while the formation of the system-environment bound states is the essential reason for the quantum speedup. Our attribution of the quantum speedup to the energy-spectrum character can supply another vital path for experiments when the quantum speedup shows up without any dynamical calculations. The potential experimental observation of our quantum speedup mechanism in the circuit QED system is discussed. Our results may be of both theoretical and experimental interests in exploring the ultimate QSL in realistic environments, and may open new perspectives for devising active quantum speedup devices.

abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states of photons can be prepared by effective gauge fields gated by the quantum states of a two-level atom interacting with three cavities. By periodically modulating the cavity frequencies with different phases, opposite effective gauge fields of cavity photons can be created for the two quantum states of the atom. A superposition of atomic states can transport photons from one cavity to a macroscopic superposition of the other two cavities. This mechanism provides new possibilities in exploring quantum entanglement and has applications in quantum metrology and quantum information.

abstract: Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks. Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states, propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification for either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold among the different approaches to quantifying coherence.

abstract: Heterogeneous bipartite quantum pure states, composed of two subsystems with a different number of levels, cannot have both reductions maximally mixed. In this work, we demonstrate existence of a wide range of highly entangled states of heterogeneous multipartite systems consisting of $N>2$ parties such that every reduction to one and two parties is maximally mixed. Two constructions of generating genuinely multipartite maximally entangled states of heterogeneous systems for an arbitrary number of subsystems are presented. Such states are related to quantum error correction codes over mixed alphabets and mixed orthogonal arrays. Additionally, we show that constructed entangled states can be expressed as superpositions of mutually orthogonal GHZ-like states.

abstract: We present combined measurements of the spatially-resolved optical spectrum and the total excited-atom number in an ultracold gas of three-level atoms under electromagnetically induced transparency conditions involving high-lying Rydberg states. The observed optical transmission of a weak probe laser at the center of the coupling region exhibits a double peaked spectrum as a function of detuning, whilst the Rydberg atom number shows a comparatively narrow single resonance. By imaging the transmitted light onto a charge-coupled-device camera, we record hundreds of spectra in parallel, which are used to map out the spatial profile of Rabi frequencies of the coupling laser. Using all the information available we can reconstruct the full one-body density matrix of the three-level system, which provides the optical susceptibility and the Rydberg density as a function of spatial position. These results help elucidate the connection between three-level interference phenomena, including the interplay of matter and light degrees of freedom and will facilitate new studies of many-body effects in optically driven Rydberg gases.

abstract: We experimentally implement high-efficiency coherent excitation to a Rydberg state using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a cold atom electron and ion source, leading to a peak efficiency of 85%, a 1.7 times improvement in excitation probability relative to incoherent pulsed-laser excitation. Using streak measurements and pulsed electric field ionization of the Rydberg atoms we demonstrate electron bunches with duration of 250 ps. High-efficiency excitation will increase source brightness, crucial for ultrafast electron diffraction experiments, while using coherent excitation to high-lying Rydberg states could allow for the reduction of internal bunch heating and the creation of a high-speed single ion source.

abstract: We develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic approach for a harmonically trapped one-dimensional quasicondensate and apply it to describe the phenomenon of frequency doubling in the breathing-mode oscillations of its momentum distribution. The doubling here refers to the oscillation frequency relative to the oscillations of the real-space density distribution, invoked by a sudden confinement quench. We find that the frequency doubling is governed by the quench strength and the initial temperature, rather than by the crossover from the ideal Bose gas to the quasicondensate regime. The hydrodynamic predictions are supported by the results of numerical simulations based on a finite-temperature c-field approach, and extend the utility of the hydrodynamic theory for low-dimensional quantum gases to the description of finite-temperature systems and their dynamics in momentum space.

abstract: For the two-parameter $p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra (DHA) introduced recently and in which, instead of usual commutator of $X$ and $P$ in the l.h.s. of basic relation $[X,P]={\rm i}\hbar$, one uses the $p,q$-commutator, we established interesting properties. Most important is the realizability of the $p,q$-DHA by means of the appropriate deformed oscillator algebra (DOA). Another uncovered property is special extension of the usual mutual Hermitian conjugation of the creation and annihilation operators, namely the so-called $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rule, along with the related $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermiticity property of the position or momentum operators. In this work, we present some new solutions of the realization problem yielding new (nonstandard) deformed oscillators, and show their inequivalence to the earlier known solution and respective DOA, in particular what concerns ground state energy.

abstract: Determining the minimum number of states required by a finite automaton to separate a given pair of different words is an important problem. In this paper, we consider this problem for quantum automata (QFAs). We show that 2-state QFAs can separate any pair of words in nondeterministic acceptance mode and conjecture that they can separate any pair also with zero-error. Then, we focus on (a more general problem) separating a pair of two disjoint finite set of words. We show that QFAs can separate them efficiently in nondeterministic acceptance mode, i.e. the number of states is two to the power of the size of the small set. Additionally, we examine affine finite automata (AfAs) and show that two states are enough to separate any pair with zero-error. Moreover, AfAs can separate any pair of disjoint finite sets of words with one-sided bounded error efficiently like QFAs in nondeterministic mode.

abstract: We demonstrate a silicon-chip biphoton source with an unprecedented quantum cross correlation up to ${\rm g_{si}^{(2)}(0) = (2.58 \pm 0.16) \times 10^4}$. The emitted biphotons are intrinsically single-mode, with self correlations of ${\rm g_{ss}^{(2)}(0) = 1.90 \pm 0.05}$ and ${\rm g_{ii}^{(2)}(0) = 1.87 \pm 0.06}$ for signal and idler photons, respectively. We observe the waveform asymmetry of cross correlation between signal and idler photons and reveal the identical and non-exponential nature of self correlations of individual signal and idler photon modes, which is a nature of cavity-enhanced nonlinear optical processes. The high efficiency and high purity of the biphoton source allow us to herald single photons with a conditional self correlation $\rm g_{c}^{(2)}(0)$ as low as $\rm 0.0059 \pm 0.0014$ at a pair flux of $\rm 1.95 \times 10^5$ pairs/s, which remains below $\rm 0.026 \pm 0.001$ for a biphoton flux up to $\rm 2.93 \times 10^6$ pairs/s, with a photon preparation efficiency in the single-mode fiber up to 51%, among the best values that have ever been reported. Our work unambiguously demonstrates that silicon photonic chips are superior material and device platforms for integrated quantum photonics.
