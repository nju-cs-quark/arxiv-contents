abstract: We consider four-dimensional qudits as qubit pairs and their qudit Pauli operators as qubit Clifford operators. This introduces a nesting, $C_1^2 \subset C_2^4 \subset C_3^2$, where $C_n^m$ is the $n$th level of the $m$-dimensional qudit Clifford hierarchy. If we can convert between logical qubits and qudits, then qudit Clifford operators are qubit non-Clifford operators. Conversion is achieved by qubit fusion and qudit fission using stabilizer circuits that consume a resource state. This resource is a fused qubit stabilizer state with a fault-tolerant state preparation using stabilizer circuits.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of correlations between composite systems -- multipartite entanglement (ME) -- that, while puzzling our physical intuition, enable technologies not accessible in a classical world. Notwithstanding, there is still no efficient general method to theoretically quantify and experimentally detect ME. Here we propose a novel paradigm based on the measurement of the statistical response of a quantum systems to a collective parametric evolution. As a major difference with respect to current approaches based on the implementation of entanglement witness operators, we witness ME without relying on measurement efficiencies or tomographic reconstructions of the quantum state. The protocol requires only two settings for any number of parties. To illustrate its user-friendliness we demonstrate ME in different experiments with ions and photons by analyzing published data on fidelity visibilities and averaged observables.

abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and their mixtures exhibit fascinating properties. A complete basis of GHZ-states can be constructed by properly choosing local basis rotations. We demonstrate this experimentally for the Hilbert space C2x4 by entangling two photons in polarisation and orbital angular momentum. Mixing GHZ-states unmasks different entanglement features based on their particular local geometrical connectedness. In particular, a specific GHZ-state in a complete orthonormal basis has a twin GHZ-state for which equally mixing leads to full separability in opposition to any other basis-state. Exploiting these local geometrical relations provides a toolbox for generating specific types of multipartite entanglement, each providing different benefits in outperforming classical devices. Our experiment, based on hybrid entangled entanglement, investigates these GHZs properties showing a good stability and fidelity and allowing a scaling in degrees of freedom and advanced operational manipulations.

abstract: Using the asymptotic iteration method, we obtain the S-wave solution for a short-range three-parameter central potential with 1/r singularity and with a non-orbital barrier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at calculating the energy spectrum for this potential, which was introduced by H. Bahlouli and A. D. Alhaidari and for which they obtained the "potential parameter spectrum". Our results are also independently verified using a direct method of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the J-matrix basis.

abstract: We estimate the success probability of quantum protocols composed of Clifford operations in the presence of Pauli errors. Our method is derived from the fault-point formalism previously used to determine the success rate of low-distance error correction codes. Here we apply it to a wider range of quantum protocols and identify circuit structures that allow for efficient calculation of the exact success probability and even the final distribution of output states. As examples, we apply our method to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code and compare the results to Monte Carlo simulations.

abstract: We give an analytical description of the dynamics of the three-qubit Dicke model using the adiabatic approximation in the parameter regime where the qubits transition frequencies are far off-resonance with the field frequency and the interaction strengths reach the ultra-strong coupling regimes. Qualitative differences arise when comparing to the single- and two-qubit systems - simple analytic formulas show that three revival sequences produce a three-frequency beat note in the time evolution of the population. We find an explicit way to estimate the dynamics for the qubit-field and qubit-qubit entanglement inside the three-qubit system in the ultra strong coupling regime, and the resistance to the sudden death proves the robustness of the GHZ state.

abstract: We study the geometric curvature and phase of the Rabi model. Under the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we apply the gauge independent Berry curvature over a surface integral to calculate the Berry phase of the eigenstates for both single and two-qubit systems, which is found to be identical with the system of spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. We extend the idea to define a vacuum-induced geometric curvature when the system starts from an initial state with pure vacuum bosonic field. The induced geometric phase is related to the average photon number in a period which is possible to measure in the qubit-cavity system. We also calculate the geometric phase beyond the RWA and find an anomalous sudden change, which implies the breakdown of the adiabatic theorem and the Berry phases in an adiabatic cyclic evolution are ill-defined near the anti-crossing point in the spectrum.

abstract: It has recently been noticed that quantum gates can be performed faster and can utilize interaction between qubits more effectively if performed via continuous time quantum walks through states outside of the computational basis. We formulate general requirements for such walks and illustrate them with examples of single-, two- and three-qubit gates, including Hadamard, Control-NOT, and Toffoli gates. Continuous-time quantum walks on graphs involved in these gates are investigated.

abstract: We propose a device architecture capable of direct quantum electro-optical conversion of microwave to optical photons. The hybrid system consists of a planar superconducting microwave circuit coupled to an integrated whispering-gallery-mode microresonator made from an electro-optical material. We show that electro-optical (vacuum) coupling rates $g_0$ as large as$\sim 2\pi \, \mathcal{O}(10-100)$ kHz are achievable with currently available technology, due to the small mode volume of the planar microwave resonator. Operating at millikelvin temperatures, such a converter would enable high-efficiency conversion of microwave to optical photons. We analyze the added noise, and show that maximum conversion efficiency is achieved for a multi-photon cooperativity of unity which can be reached with optical power as low as $ \mathcal{O}(1)\,\mathrm{mW} $.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a quantum system coupled linearly to Gaussian white noise using functional methods. By performing the integration over the noisy field in the evolution operator, we get an equivalent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which evolves the quantum state with a dissipative dynamics. We also show that if the integration over the noisy field is done for the time evolution of the density matrix, a gain contribution from the fluctuations, can be accessed in addition to the loss one from the non-hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics. We illustrate our study by computing analytically the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which we found to be the complex frequency harmonic oscillator, with a known evolution operator. It leads to space and time localisation, a common feature of noisy quantum systems in general applications.

abstract: Recently, Zhang et al [Phys. Rev. A 92, 012332 (2015)] presented $4d-4$ orthogonal product states that are locally indistinguishable and completable in a $d\otimes d$ quantum system. Later, Zhang et al. [arXiv: 1509.01814v2 (2015)] constructed $2n-1$ orthogonal product states that are locally indistinguishable in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$). In this paper, we construct a locally indistinguishable and completable orthogonal product basis with $4p-4$ members in a general $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$) quantum system, where $p$ is an arbitrary integer from $3$ to $m$, and give a very simple but quite effective proof for its local indistinguishability. Specially, we get a completable orthogonal product basis with $8$ members that cannot be locally distinguished in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$) when $p=3$. It is so far the smallest completable orthogonal product basis that cannot be locally distinguished in a $m\otimes n$ quantum system. On the other hand, we construct a small locally indistinguishable orthogonal product basis with $2p-1$ members, which is maybe uncompletable, in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$ and $p$ is an arbitrary integer from $3$ to $m$). We also prove its local indistinguishability. As a corollary, we give an uncompletable orthogonal product basis with $5$ members that are locally indistinguishable in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$). All the results can lead us to a better understanding of the structure of a locally indistinguishable product basis in $m \otimes n$.

abstract: We develop a new approach for controllable single-photon transport between two remote one-dimensional coupled-cavity arrays, used as quantum registers, mediated by an additional one-dimensional coupled-cavity array, acting as a quantum channel. A single two-level atom located inside one cavity of the intermediate channel is used to control the long-range coherent quantum coupling between two remote registers, thereby functioning as a quantum switch. With a time-independent perturbative treatment, we find that the leakage of quantum information can in principle be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, our method can be extended to realize a quantum router in multi-register quantum networks, where single-photons can be either stored in one of the registers or transported to another on demand. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in the mean-field dynamics of various atom-interferometry schemes designed for precision sensing. In the field of quantum metrology, the standard tools for evaluating metrological sensitivity are the classical- and quantum-Fisher information. In this letter, we show how these tools can be adapted to evaluate the sensitivity when the behaviour is dominated by mean-field dynamics. As an example, we compare the behaviour of four recent theoretical proposals for gyroscopes based on matterwaves interference in toroidally trapped geometries. We show that while the quantum Fisher information increases at different rates for the various schemes considered, in all cases it is consistent with the well-known Sagnac phase shift after the matterwaves have traversed a closed path. However, we argue that the relevant metric for quantifying interferometric sensitivity is the classical Fisher information, which can vary considerably between the schemes.

abstract: The biased Dicke model describes a system of biased two-level atoms coupled to a bosonic field, and is expected to produce new phenomena that are not present in the original Dicke model. In this paper, we study the critical properties of the biased Dicke model in the classical oscillator limits. For the finite-biased case in this limit, We present analytical results demonstrating that the excitation energy does not vanish for arbitrary coupling. This indicates that the second order phase transition is avoided in the biased Dicke model, which contrasts to the original Dicke model. We also analyze the squeezing and the entanglement in the ground state, and find that a finite bias will strongly modify their behaviors in the vicinity of the critical coupling point.

abstract: Quantum squeezing of mechanical resonator is important for studying the macroscopic quantum effects and the precision metrology of weak forces. Here we give a theoretical study of a hybrid atom-optomechanical system in which the steady-state squeezing of the mechanical resonator can be generated via the mechanical nonlinearity and cavity cooling process. The validity of the scheme is assessed by simulating the steady-state variance of the mechanical displacement quadrature numerically. The scheme is robust against dissipation of the optical cavity, and the steady-state squeezing can be effectively generated in a highly dissipative cavity.

abstract: The transport properties of the photons injected into one-dimensional coupled-cavity-arrays (CCAs) are studied. It is found that the number of photons cannot change the evolution cycle of the system and the time points at which W states and NOON state are obtained with a relatively higher probability. Transport dynamics in the CCAs exhibits that entanglement-enhanced state transmission is more effective phenomenon, and we show that for a quantum state with the maximum concurrence, it can be transmitted completely without considering the case of photon loss.

abstract: We propose a simple architecture based on multimode quantum memories for collective readout of classical information keyed using a pair coherent states, exemplified by the well-known binary phase shift keying format. Such a configuration enables demonstration of the superadditivity effect in classical communication over quantum channels, where the transmission rate becomes enhanced through joint detection applied to multiple channel uses. The proposed scheme relies on the recently introduced idea to prepare Hadamard sequences of input symbols that are mapped by a linear optical transformation onto the pulse position modulation format [Guha, S. {\em Phys. Rev. Lett.}\ {\bf 2011}, {\em 106}, 240502]. We analyze two versions of readout based on direct detection and an optional Dolinar receiver which implements the minimum-error measurement for individual detection of a binary coherent state alphabet.

abstract: We propose a quantum simulation of electromagnetism in (2+1) dimensions using an array of superconducting fluxonium devices. The encoding is in the integer (S=1) representation of the quantum link model formulation of compact U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how to engineer the Gauss constraint via an ancilla mediated gadget construction and how to tune between the strongly coupled and intermediately coupled regimes. The witnesses to the existence of the predicted confining phase of the model are provided by non-local order parameters from Wilson loops and disorder parameters from 't Hooft strings and we show how to measure these operators non-destructively via dispersive coupling of the fluxonium islands to a microwave cavity mode. Evidence for existence of the confined phase in the ground state of the simulation Hamiltonian is found by DMRG calculations on a ladder geometry.

abstract: Aiming at efficient numerical treatment of tunneling ionization of atoms and molecules by mid-infrared (IR) lasers, exterior time scaling (ETS) theory is formulated as a generalization of the time-scaled coordinate approach. The key idea of ETS is the division of the spatial volume into a small region around the nucleus and its outside; the radial coordinates are time scaled only in the outer region. The continuum components of photoelectron wave packets are prevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the long-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis functions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the bound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of non-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are less stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in which the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff. For numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms of finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions. Furthermore, the stiffness-free Lanczos time propagator is introduced to remove any persistent stiffness in the treatment of mid-IR lasers due to the involvement of hundreds of angular-momentum states. The test calculations for atomic hydrogen interacting with linearly polarized mid-IR pulses demonstrate the accuracy and numerical efficiency of the new scheme, and exhibit its special capability if there is no recollision with the parent ion. Hence, ETS will show its true potential for the detailed analysis of photoelectron wave packet dynamics in circularly or near-circularly polarized mid-IR fields.

abstract: The concept of coherence is one of cornerstones in physics. The development of quantum information science has lead to renewed interest in properly approaching the coherence at the quantum world. Various measures could be proposed for quantifying the coherence of a quantum state with respect to the prescribed orthonormal basis. To be a proper measure of coherence, each candidate should enjoy certain properties. It seems that the monotonicity property plays a crucial role here. Indeed, there is known an intuitive measure of coherence that does not share this condition. We study coherence measures induced by quantum divergences of the Tsallis type. It is proved that considered measures of coherence satisfy all the required properties. The only point is that monotonicity under incoherent selective measurements has to be reformulated. The proposed formulation can naturally be treated as a parametric extension of its standard form. This extension is reduced to the standard form when the standard relative entropy is dealt. Finally, two coherence measures quadratic in moduli of matrix elements are compared from the monotonicity viewpoint.

Our equation provides a unifying picture of the consequences of recoil and indistinguishability of atoms beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime on both their dissipative and conservative dynamics, and applies equally well to distinguishable and indistinguishable atoms. We give general expressions for the decay rates and the dipole-dipole shifts for any motional states, and we find closed-form formulas for a number of relevant states (Gaussian states, Fock states and thermal states). In particular, we show that dipole-dipole interactions and cooperative photon emission can be modulated through the external state of motion.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Retrocausal models of QM add further weight to the conflict between causality and the possible existence of free will. We analyze a simple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic time arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other. The loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law therefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution is demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF), where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been actually made. To quantify this assertion, "weak information" is described in terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does not exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, particles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and future states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by quantum indeterminism.

Two partial results on using entanglement as a resource for quantum-state discrimination and discrimination with remaining entanglement is given.

As a concrete demonstration, we consider quantum state transfer in a Heisenberg spin chain, and we show how to determine the confining potential in order to obtain perfect state transfer.

abstract: Quantum computation can be achieved by preparing an appropriate initial product state of qudits and then letting it evolve under a fixed Hamiltonian. The readout is made by measurement on individual qudits at some later time. This approach is called the Hamiltonian quantum computation and it includes, for example, the continuous-time quantum cellular automata and the universal quantum walk. We consider one spatial dimension and study the compromise between the locality $k$ and the local Hilbert space dimension $d$. For geometrically 2-local (i.e., $k=2$), it is known that $d=8$ is already sufficient for universal quantum computation but the Hamiltonian is not translationally invariant. As the locality $k$ increases, it is expected that the minimum required $d$ should decrease. We provide a construction of Hamiltonian quantum computer for $k=3$ with $d=5$. One implication is that simulating 1D chains of spin-2 particles is BQP-complete. Imposing translation invariance will increase the required $d$. For this we also construct another 3-local ($k=3$) Hamiltonian that is invariant under translation of a unit cell of two sites but that requires $d$ to be 8.

Lett. \textbf{113}, 110501(2014) have proposed a stronger version of monogamy relation for concurrence. We have extended the strong monogamy inequality for another entanglement measure, viz., negativity. In particular, we have concentrated on four-qubit system and provided a detail study on the status of strong monogamy on pure states. Further, we have analytically provided some classes of states for which negativity and squared negativity satisfy strong monogamy. Numerical evidences have also been shown in proper places. Our analysis also provides cases where strong monogamy is violated.

abstract: We report the optical imaging of a single atom with nanometer resolution using an adaptive optical alignment technique that is applicable to general optical microscopy. By decomposing the image of a single laser-cooled atom, we identify and correct optical aberrations in the system and realize an atomic position sensitivity of $\approx$ 0.5 nm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ with a minimum uncertainty of 1.7 nm, allowing the direct imaging of atomic motion. This is the highest position sensitivity ever measured for an isolated atom, and opens up the possibility of performing out-of-focus 3D particle tracking, imaging of atoms in 3D optical lattices or sensing forces at the yoctonewton (10$^{-24}$ N) scale.

abstract: Entropy is one of the central quantities in thermodynamics, whose flow between two systems determines the statistics of energy transfers. In quantum systems entropy is non-linear in density matrix whose time evolution is cumbersome. Using recent developments in the Keldysh formalism for the evolution of nonlinear quantum information measures (Phys. Rev. B 91, 174307 (2015)), we study the flow of von Neumann and Renyi entropies in a generic four-level quantum system that is weakly coupled to equilibrium heat engines. We show that noise-induced coherence has significant influence on the entropy flow of the quantum heat engine. We determine analytical optimization of couplings for the purpose of designing optimal artificial energy transfer systems.

abstract: We consider the gravity dual of the modular Hamiltonian associated to a general subregion of a boundary theory. We use it to argue that the relative entropy of nearby states is given by the relative entropy in the bulk, to leading order in the bulk gravitational coupling. We also argue that the boundary modular flow is dual to the bulk modular flow in the entanglement wedge, with implications for entanglement wedge reconstruction.

abstract: Inspired by the experimental measurement of the Renyi entanglement entropy in a lattice of ultracold atoms by Islam et al., [Nature 528, 77 (2015)] we propose a method to entangle two spatially-separated qubits using the quantum many-body state as a resource. Through local operations accessible in an experiment, entanglement is transferred to a qubit register from atoms at the ends of a one-dimensional chain. We compute the operational entanglement, which bounds the entanglement physically transferable from the many-body resource to the register, and discuss a protocol for its experimental measurement. Finally, we explore measures for the amount of entanglement available in the register after transfer, suitable for use in quantum information applications.

abstract: Applying a symmetric bulk bipartition to one-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki valence bond solid (VBS) states for the integer spin-S Haldane gapped phase, we can create an array of fractionalized spin-S/2 edge states with the super unit cell $l$ in the reduced bulk system, and the topological properties encoded in the VBS wave functions can be revealed. The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) with $l=even$ corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-S/2 model. For the even integer spins, the EH still describes the Haldane gapped phase. For the odd integer spins, however, the EH just corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg half-odd integer spin model with spinon excitations, characterizing the critical point separating the topological Haldane phase from the trivial gapped phase. Our results thus demonstrate that the topological bulk property not only determines its fractionalized edge states, but also the quantum criticality associated with the topological phase, where the elementary excitations are precisely those fractionalized edge degrees of freedom confined in the bulk of the topological phase.

abstract: We present a mainly analytical study of the entanglement spectrum of Bernal-stacked graphene bilayers in the presence of trigonal warping in the energy spectrum. Upon tracing out one layer, the entanglement spectrum shows qualitative geometric differences to the energy spectrum of a graphene monolayer. However, topological quantities such as Berry phase type contributions to Chern numbers agree. The latter analysis involves not only the eigenvalues of the entanglement Hamiltonian but also its eigenvectors. We also discuss the entanglement spectra resulting from tracing out other sublattices. As a technical basis of our analysis we provide closed analytical expressions for the full eigensystem of bilayer graphene in the entire Brillouin zone with a trigonally warped spectrum.

abstract: We evaluate the Hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in the region between two co-dimension one branes on the background of locally AdS spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. Along compact dimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the phases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. The latter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. There exists a range in the space of the Robin coefficients for separate branes where the vacuum state becomes unstable. Compared to the case of the standard AdS bulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on the parameters is less restrictive. The current density has nonzero components along compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact dimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that dimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that distinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes. In particular, for Dirichlet boundary condition the current density vanishes on the branes. We show that, depending on the constants in the boundary conditions, the presence of the branes may either increase or decrease the current density compared with that for the brane-free geometry. Applications are given to the Randall--Sundrum 2-brane model with extra compact dimensions.

abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two atoms with a short-ranged pair interaction in a one-dimensional harmonic trap with time-dependent frequency. Our analysis is focused on two representative cases: (i) a sudden change of the trapping frequency from one value to another, and (ii) a periodic trapping frequency. In case (i), the dynamics of the interacting and the corresponding non-interacting systems turn out to be similar. In the second case, however, the interacting system can behave quite differently, especially close to parametric resonance. For instance, in the regions where such resonance occurs we find that the interaction can significantly reduce the rate of energy increase. The implications for applications of our findings to cool or heat the system are also dicussed.

abstract: Chemical reactions at temperatures near absolute zero require a full quantum description of the reaction pathways and enable enhanced control of the products via quantum state selection. Ultracold molecule experiments have provided initial insight into the quantum nature of basic chemical processes involving diatomic molecules, for example from studies of bimolecular reactions, but complete control over the reactants and products has remained elusive. The "half-collision" process of photodissociation is an indispensable tool in molecular physics and offers significantly more control than the reverse process of photoassociation. Here we reach a fully quantum regime with photodissociation of ultracold $^{88}$Sr$_2$ molecules where the initial bound state of the molecule and the target continuum state of the fragments are strictly controlled. Detection of the photodissociation products via optical absorption imaging reveals the hallmarks of ultracold chemistry: resonant and nonresonant barrier tunneling, importance of quantum statistics, presence of forbidden reaction pathways, and matter wave interference of reaction products. In particular, this interference yields fragment angular distributions with a strong breaking of cylindrical symmetry, so far unobserved in photodissociation. We definitively show that the quasiclassical description of photodissociation fails in the ultracold regime. Instead, a quantum model accurately reproduces our results and yields new intuition.
