**1.    Efficient quantum transport in disordered interacting many-body networks**

<blockquote>
<p>
The coherent transport of fermions in disordered networks of $l$ single-particle states connected by $k$-body interactions is studied. These networks are modeled by embedded Gaussian random matrix ensembles (EGE). The conductance bandwidth of the ensemble averaged transmission as well as the total current increases with the number of fermions $n$ in the network and is maximal for $k \sim n/2$. The transmission is peaked around the band center for $k=n$ making the transport efficient in a narrow energy band. We show that for all parameters the transport is enhanced significantly if only centrosymmetric ensembles (csEGE) are considered. In this case the transmission shows numerous resonances of perfect transport. Analyzing the transmission by spectral decomposition, we find that centrosymmetry induces strong correlations and enhances the extrema of the distributions. This suppresses destructive interference effects in the system and thus, causes backscattering-free transmission resonances which enhance the overall transport.

**2.    Quantum walks and non-Abelian discrete gauge theory**

<blockquote>
<p>
A new family of DTQWs on the line is introduced, which presents an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical ({\sl i.e.} non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article open up the possibility of performing quantum simulation of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.
