abstract: A dielectric body couples with electromagnetic fields through radiation pressure and electrostrictive forces, which mediate phonon-photon coupling in cavity optomechanics. In a magnetic medium, according to Korteweg-Helmholtz formula, magnetostrictive forces should arise and lead to phonon-magnon interaction. Here we report such a coupled phonon-magnon system based on ferrimagnetic spheres, which we term as cavity magnomechanics, by analogy to cavity optomechanics. Coherent phonon-magnon interactions, including electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption, are demonstrated. Excitingly, due to strong hybridization of magnon and microwave photon modes and their high tunability, our platform exhibits new features including parametric amplification of magnons and phonons, triply resonant photon-magnon-phonon coupling and phonon lasing. Our work demonstrates the fundamental principle of cavity magnomechanics and its application as a new information transduction platform based on coherent coupling between photons, phonons and magnons.

abstract: We study the localization of probability distribution in a discrete quantum random walk on an infinite chain. With a phase defect introduced in any position of the quantum random walk (QRW), we have found that the localization of the probability distribution in the QRW emerges. Different localized behaviors of the probability distribution in the QRW are presented when the defect occupies different positions. Given that the coefficients of the localized stationary eigenstates relies on the coin operator, we reveal that when the defect occupies different positions, the amplitude of localized probability distribution in the QRW exhibits a non-trivial dependence on the coin operator.

abstract: In this paper, we introduce a controllable method for producing two and three-mode entangled coherent states (ECS's) using atom-field interaction in cavity QED and beam splitter. The generated states play central roles in linear optics, quantum computation and teleportation. We especially focus on qubit, qutrit and qufit like ECS's and investigate their entanglement by concurrence measure. Moreover, we illustrate decoherence properties of ECS's due to noisy channels, using negativity measure. At the end the effect of noise on monogamy inequality is discussed.

abstract: We investigate how the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) can entangle quantum systems in different coupling regimes of circuit quantum electrodynamics, and show the robustness of such entanglement generation against dissipative effects with current technology. We consider two qubit-resonator systems, which are coupled by a SQUID driven with an external magnetic field, and explore the entire range of coupling regimes between each qubit and its respective resonator. In this scheme, we derive a semianalytic explanation for the entanglement generation between both superconducting qubits when they are coupled to their resonators in the strong coupling (SC) regime. For the ultrastrong (USC) and deep strong coupling (DSC) regimes, we design feasible protocols to generate maximally-entangled polaritonic states.

abstract: A one-dimensional quantum oscillator is monitored by taking repeated position measurements. As a first con- tribution, it is shown that, under a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme applied to a system initially at the ground state, (i) the observed sequence of measurements (quantum tracks) corresponding to a single experiment converges to a limit point, and that (ii) the limit point is random over the ensemble of the experiments, being distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with a variance at most equal to the ground-state variance. As a second contribution, the richer scenario where the oscillator is coupled with a frozen (i.e., at the ground state) ensemble of independent quantum oscillators is considered. A sharply different behavior emerges: under the same measurement scheme, here we observe that the measurement sequences are essentially divergent. Such a rigorous statistical analysis of the sequential measurement process might be useful for characterizing the main quantities that are currently used for inference, manipulation, and monitoring of many quantum systems. Several interesting properties of the quantum tracks evolution, as well as of the associated (quantum) threshold crossing times, are discussed and the dependence upon the main system parameters (e.g., the choice of the measurement sampling time, the degree of interaction with the environment, the measurement device accuracy) is elucidated. At a more fundamental level, it is seen that, as an application of basic quantum mechanics principles, a sharp difference exists between the intrinsic randomness unavoidably present in any quantum system, and the extrinsic randomness arising from the environmental coupling, i.e., the randomness induced by an external source of disturbance.

abstract: In typical discrete-time quantum walk algorithms, one measures the position of the walker while ignoring its internal spin/coin state. Rather than neglecting the information in this internal state, we show that additionally measuring it doubles the success probability of many quantum spatial search algorithms. For example, this allows Grover's unstructured search problem to be solved with certainty, rather than with probability 1/2 if only the walker's position is measured, so the additional measurement yields a search algorithm that is twice as fast as without it, on average. Thus the internal state of discrete-time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to improve algorithms. Furthermore, we determine conditions for which spatial search problems are amenable to this doubling of the success probability, and this involves diagrammatically analyzing search using degenerate perturbation theory and deriving a useful formula for how the quantum walk acts in its reduced subspace.

abstract: In this work we use the extremization method of various information-theoretic measures (Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy) for $d$-dimensional quantum systems, which complementary describe the spreading of the quantum states of natural systems. Under some given constraints, usually one or two radial expectation values, this variational method allows us to determine an extremum-entropy distribution, which is the \textit{least-biased} one to characterize the state among all those compatible with the known data. Then we use it, together with the spin-dependent uncertainty-like relations of Daubechies-Thakkar type, as a tool to obtain relationships between the position and momentum radial expectation values of the type $\langle r^{\alpha}\rangle^{\frac{k}{\alpha}}\langle p^k\rangle\geq f(k,\alpha,q,N), q=2s+1$, for $d$-dimensional systems of $N$ fermions with spin $s$. The resulting uncertainty-like products, which take into account both spatial and spin degrees of freedom of the fermionic constituents of the system, are shown to often improve the best corresponding relationships existing in the literature.

abstract: Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a powerful tool for a wide variety of measurements, has been realized with Bose-Einstein condensates in recent experiments. In this report, we propose and analyze a realizable scheme for performing a Heisenberg-limited Mach-Zehnder interferometry with dipolar spin-1 condensate. Based upon adiabatic processes of sweeping the transverse magnetic field, we demonstrate a perfect phase transition, which accomplishes the beam splitter, phase shifter and recombiner as for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The attractive dipolar interaction ensures the existence of a path-entangled state which enhances the phase measurement precision to the Heisenberg limit. We also discuss the spin-$1$ squeezing induced in the adiabatic passage and show that the squeezing parameter attains its minimal value near the point of saturation field.

abstract: Relativistic quantum metrology provides an optimal strategy for the estimation of parameters encoded in quantum fields in flat and curved spacetime. These parameters usually correspond to physical quantities of interest such as proper times, accelerations, gravitational field strengths, among other spacetime parameters. The precise estimation of these parameters can lead to novel applications in gravimeters, spacetime probes and gravitational wave detectors. Previous work in this direction only considered pure probe states. In realistic situations, however, probe states are mixed. In this paper, we provide a framework for the computation of optimal precision bounds for mixed single- and two-mode Gaussian states within quantum field theory. This enables the estimation of spacetime parameters in case the field states are initially at finite temperature.

abstract: Tunneling is often claimed to be the key mechanism underlying possible speedups in quantum optimization via quantum annealing (QA), especially for problems featuring a cost function with tall and thin barriers. We present and analyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for these problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be understood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical potential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then provide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is short and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where tunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime. However, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution involving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided level-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic QA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not unique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an exponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a classical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic QA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic transitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling and classical spin vector dynamics.

abstract: We discuss the abstract structure of sequential weak measurement (WM) of general observables. In all orders, the sequential WM correlations without post-selection yield the corresponding correlations of the Wigner function, offering direct quantum tomography through the moments of the canonical variables. Spin-half sequential measurements are, on the contrary, constrained kinematically, they are equivalent with single WMs. In sequential WMs with post-selection, a new anomaly occurs, different from the weak value anomaly of single WMs. In particular, the spread of polarization $\hat\sigma$, as measured in double WMs of $\hat\sigma$, will diverge for certain orthogonal pre- and post-selected states.

abstract: The GBAR experiment will time the free fall of cold antihydrogen atoms dropped onto an annihilation plate to test the universality of free fall on antimatter. In this contribution, we study the quantum reflection of the anti-atom resulting from the Casimir-Polder attraction to the plate. We evaluate the Casimir-Polder potential and the associated quantum reflection amplitudes and find that reflection is enhanced for weaker potentials. A Liouville transformation of the Schr\"odinger equation is used to map the quantum reflection problem onto an equivalent problem of scattering on a barrier, leading to an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon.

abstract: A general expression for the local power of a quantum system is derived. Defined as the time rate of change of the kinetic energy evaluated in a finite volume $\Omega$ of the physical space, the local power exhibits contributions from both many-body classical and quantum correlations. Significantly, quantum correlations are manifested through the presence of non-local sources/sinks of power and through the action of local forces with no classical counterpart. The soundness of our results is proved along three limits of particular relevance: the closed-system limit ($\Omega \to \infty$), the limit of non-interacting particles, and invoking classicality. Interestingly, we show that quantum fingerprints arise on the local power expression only when the volume $\Omega$ is finite. Otherwise we recover a classical-like expression. This work could be of particular interest in the field of nanoelectronics, where the realization of a zero-power technology constitutes a long standing challenge.

abstract: Nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger model is quantised and exactly solved using the canonical framework. It is found that the usual canonical quantisation of the model leads to a theory with pathological inner product. This problem is resolved by constructing another inner product over the vector space of the theory. The resultant theory is found to be identical to that of nonrelativistic bosons with delta function interaction potential, devoid of any nonlocality. The exact eigenstates are found using the Bethe ansatz technique.

abstract: Multiparty quantum states are useful for a variety of quantum information and computation protocols. We define a multiparty entanglement measure based on local measurements on the multiparty quantum state, and an entanglement measure averaged on the post-measurement ensemble. Using the generalized geometric measure as the measure of multipartite entanglement for the ensemble, we demonstrate, in the case of several well-known classes of multipartite pure states, that the localized multipartite entanglement can exceed the entanglement present in the original state. We also show that measurement over multiple parties may be beneficial in enhancing localizable multipartite entanglement. We point out that, compared to the generalized geometric measure, localizable generalized geometric measure works better in signaling quantum critical phenomena occurring in well-known quantum spin models even when considerable finite-size effect is present in the system.

abstract: Quantum light-matter interfaces are at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. Quantum memories for photons are a prominent consequence of superb control over interactions between light and matter, where non-classical states of photons are mapped onto stationary matter states and preserved for subsequent retrieval into photonic excitations. The ability of quantum memories to synchronize probabilistic events makes them a key component in quantum repeaters and quantum computation based on linear optics. This has motivated several groups to dedicate theoretical and experimental research to develop quantum memory devices. In recent years, exciting new applications and more advanced developments of quantum memories have proliferated. In this review, we outline some of the emerging applications of quantum memories in optical signal processing, quantum computation, and nonlinear optics. We review recent experimental and theoretical developments, and their impacts on more advanced photonic quantum technologies based on quantum memories.

abstract: We study chaos and scrambling in unitary channels by considering their entanglement properties as states. Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.

abstract: We study how to describe the quantum dynamics of a magnetic rigid rotor in the mesoscopic scale where the Einstein-De Haas effect is predominant. In particular, we consider a single-domain magnetic nanoparticle with uniaxial anisotropy in a magnetic trap. Starting from the basic Hamiltonian of the system under the macrospin approximation, we derive a bosonized Hamiltonian describing the center-of-mass motion, the total angular momentum, and the macrospin degrees of freedom of the particle treated as a rigid body. This bosonized Hamiltonian can be approximated by a simple quadratic Hamiltonian that captures the rich physics of a nanomagnet tightly confined in position, nearly not spinning, and with its macrospin anti-aligned to the magnetic field. The theoretical tools derived and used here can be applied to other quantum mechanical rigid rotors.

This is the first non-trivial result on the computational complexity of this problem, which naively amounts to a quadratically-constrained program. Our result applies in particular to the Kronecker polytopes, and therefore to the problem of deciding positivity of the stretched Kronecker coefficients. In contrast, it has recently been shown that deciding positivity of a single Kronecker coefficient is NP-hard in general [Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter, arXiv:1507.02955]. We discuss the consequences of our work in the context of complexity theory and the quantum marginal problem.

abstract: We show that the shape resonances induced by a one dimensional well of delta functions disappear as soon as a small constant electric field is applied. In particular, in any compact subset below the positive real axis there are no resonances if the non-zero field is small enough. In contrast to the lack of convergence of the lifetimes computed from the widths of the resonances we show that the "experimental lifetimes" are continuous at zero field. The shape resonances are replaced by an infinite set of other resonances whose location and number we analyze.

abstract: In this paper we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing if a symbolic matrix in {\emph non-commuting} variables over $\mathbb{Q}$ is invertible or not. The analogous question for commuting variables is the celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time [IQS15] (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the "word problem" for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential-time algorithms prior to this work. The main (and simple) technical contribution of this paper is an analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits which solved the same problem in some special cases. We also extend the algorithm to compute the (non-commutative) rank of a symbolic matrix, yielding a factor 2 approximation on the commutative rank. Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections. In particular we explain how some of these sources played an important role in the development of Gurvits' algorithm and in our analysis of it here.

For the $N=2$ case, we show that RQME is robust against pathologies one sees in the conventional Lindblad equation approaches. It gives results which agree with exact analytical results for steady state properties and with exact numerics for time-dependent properties. These results can be experimentally relevant for cold atoms, cavity QED and far-from-equilibrium quantum dot experiments.

abstract: Understanding the thermalization process in a pure quantum system is a challenge in theoretical physics. In this work, we explore possible thermalization mechanism in Yang-Mills(YM) theory by using a positive semi-definite quantum distribution function called a Husimi function which is given by a coarse graining of the Wigner function within the minimum uncertainty. Then entropy is defined in terms of the Husimi function, which is called the Husimi-Wehrl(HW) entropy. We propose two numerical methods to calculate the HW entropy. We find that it is feasible to apply the semi-classical approximation with the use of classical YM equation. It should be noted that the semi-classical approximation is valid in the systems of physical interest including the early stage of heavy-ion collisions. Using a product ansatz for the Husimi function, which is confirmed to reproduce the HW entropy within 20% error (overestimate) for a few-body quantum system, we succeed in a numerical evaluation of HW entropy of YM fields and show that it surely has a finite value and increases in time.

abstract: The stochastic mean-field (SMF) approach allows to treat correlations beyond mean-field using a set of independent mean-field trajectories with appropriate choice of fluctuating initial conditions. We show here, that this approach is equivalent to a simplified version of the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy between one-, two-, ..., N-body degrees of freedom. In this simplified version, one-body degrees of freedom are coupled to fluctuations to all orders while retaining only specific terms of the general BBGKY hierarchy. The use of the simplified BBGKY is illustrated with the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. We show that a truncated version of this hierarchy can be useful, as an alternative to the SMF, especially in the weak coupling regime to get physical insight in the effect beyond mean-field. In particular, it leads to approximate analytical expressions for the quantum fluctuations both in the weak and strong coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, it can only be used for short time evolution. In that case, it gives information on the evolution time-scale close to a saddle point associated to a quantum phase-transition. For long time evolution and strong coupling, we observed that the simplified BBGKY hierarchy cannot be truncated and only the full SMF with initial sampling leads to reasonable results.

abstract: We prove that a quantum harmonic oscillator governed by a Lindblad master equation where the typical drive and loss channels are multi-photon processes instead of single-photon ones, converges to a protected subspace spanned by a finite set of coherent states with the same amplitude and uniformly distributed phases. We also show that this convergence features a finite set of bounded invariant observables (Hermitian operators), such that the final state in the protected subspace can be directly predicted from the initial state. The proof includes the full arguments towards the well-posedness of the corresponding dynamics in proper Banach spaces of Hermitian trace-class operators equipped with adapted nuclear norms. It relies on Hille-Yosida theorem and Lyapunov convergence analysis.

abstract: Boundary conditions on non-relativistic wavefunctions are generally not completely constrained by the basic precepts of quantum mechanics, so understanding the set of possible self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian is required. For real physical systems, non-trivial self-adjoint extensions have been used to model contact potentials when those interactions are expected a priori. However, they must be incorporated into the effective description of any quantum mechanical system in order to capture possible short-distance physics that does not decouple in the low energy limit. Here, an approach is described wherein an artificial boundary is inserted at an intermediate scale on which boundary conditions may encode short-distance effects that are hidden behind the boundary. Using this approach, an analysis is performed of the free particle, harmonic oscillator, and Coulomb potential in three dimensions. Requiring measurable quantities, such as spectra and cross sections, to be independent of this artificial boundary, renormalization group-type equations are derived that determine how the boundary conditions flow with the scale of the boundary. Generically, observables differ from their canonical values and symmetries are anomalously broken. Connections are made to well-studied physical systems, such as the deuteron and condensed matter systems that employ Feshbach resonances.
