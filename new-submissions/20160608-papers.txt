abstract: Adiabatic quantum algorithms represent a promising approach to universal quantum computation. Whilst in a closed system these algorithms are limited by avoided level crossings, where the gap becomes exponentially small in the system size, their robustness in open systems remains unresolved. We study the dynamics in the proximity of such an avoided level crossing associated with the adiabatic quantum search algorithm in a quantum system that is coupled to a generic environment. At zero temperature, we find that the algorithm remains scalable provided the noise spectral density of the environment decays sufficiently fast at low frequencies. At finite temperature, however, scattering processes render the algorithm inefficient and no quantum speedup can be achieved. Owing to the generic nature of our model, we expect our results to be widely applicable to other adiabatic quantum algorithms.

abstract: The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store information in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and process information using a strategy that can be summarized as distill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such magic state provides one good $T$ gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the optimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many $T$ gates interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood for multi-qubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and multi-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the same number of $T$-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic error suppression. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a costly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional results on the multi-qubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient algorithm for synthesising unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling as optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing controlled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly optimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by $T$-count, is often strictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also presented.

abstract: The leading paradigm for performing computation on quantum memories can be encapsulated as distill-then-synthesize. Initially, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity magic states that provide one good T-gate, an essential quantum logic gate. Subsequently, gate synthesis intersperses many T-gates with Clifford gates to realise a desired circuit. We introduce a unified framework that implements one round of distillation and multi-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. Typically, our method uses the same number of T-gates as conventional synthesis, but with the added benefit of quadratic error suppression. Because of this, one less round of magic state distillation needs to be performed, leading to significant resource savings.

abstract: Random quantum processes play a central role both in the study of fundamental mixing processes in quantum mechanics related to equilibration, thermalisation and fast scrambling by black holes, as well as in quantum process design and quantum information theory. In this work, we present a framework describing the mixing properties of continuous-time unitary evolutions originating from local Hamiltonians having time-fluctuating terms, reflecting a Brownian motion on the unitary group. The induced stochastic time evolution is shown to converge to a unitary design. As a first main result, we present bounds to the mixing time. By developing tools in representation theory, we analytically derive an expression for a local k-th moment operator that is entirely independent of k, giving rise to approximate unitary k-designs and quantum tensor product expanders. As a second main result, we introduce tools for proving bounds on the rate of decoupling from an environment with random quantum processes. By tying the mathematical description closely with the more established one of random quantum circuits, we present a unified picture for analysing local random quantum and classes of dissipative processes.

abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on the generation of coherent light in engineered hybrid quantum systems, we investigate gain in a microwave photonic cavity coupled to quantum dot structures, and develop concrete directions for achieving a giant amplification in photon transmission. We propose two architectures for scaling up the electronic gain medium: (i) $N$ double quantum dot systems (N-DQD), (ii) $M$ quantum dots arranged in series akin to a quantum cascade laser setup. In both setups, the fermionic reservoirs are voltage biased, and the quantum dots are coupled to a single-mode cavity. Optical amplification is explained based on a sum rule for the transmission function, and it is determined by an intricate competition between two different processes: charge density response in the gain medium, and cavity losses to input and output ports. The same design principle is also responsible for the corresponding giant amplification in other photonic observables, mean photon number and emission spectrum, thereby realizing a quantum device that behaves as a giant microwave amplifier.

abstract: Bell inequalities can be studied both as constraints in the space of probability distributions and as expectation values of multipartite operators. The latter approach is particularly useful when considering outcomes as eigenvalues of unitary operators. This brings the possibility of exploiting the complex structure of the coefficients in the Bell operators. We investigate this avenue of though in the known case of two outcomes, and find new Bell inequalities for the cases of three outcomes and $n=3,4,5$ and $6$ parties. We find their corresponding classical bounds and their maximum violation in the case of qutrits. We further propose a novel way to generate Bell inequalities based on a mapping from maximally entangled states to Bell operators and produce examples for different outcomes and number of parties.

It turns out that quantization can be interpreted in terms of the Riemann surface corresponding to the multivalent $\operatorname{Ln}\Psi $ function. A visual interpretation of "trajectories" of the quantum system and of the Feynman's path integral is presented. A magnetic dipole having a magnetic charge that satisfies the Dirac quantization rule was obtained.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement introduced in 1935 deals with two particles that are entangled in their positions and momenta. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of EPR position-momentum entanglement of narrowband photon pairs generated from cold atoms. By using two-photon quantum ghost imaging and ghost interference, we demonstrate explicitly that the narrowband photon pairs violate the separability criterion, confirming EPR entanglement. We further demonstrate continuous variable EPR steering for positions and momenta of the two photons. Our new source of EPR-entangled narrowband photons is expected to play an essential role in spatially-multiplexed quantum information processing, such as, storage of quantum correlated images, quantum interface involving hyper-entangled photons, etc.

abstract: The existence of an undetectable eavesdropping of dense coded information has been already demonstrated by Pavi\v{c}i\'c for the quantum direct communication based on the ping-pong paradigm. However, a) the explicit scheme of the circuit is only given and no design rules are provided, b) the existence of losses is implicitly assumed, c) the attack has been formulated against qubit based protocol only and it is not clear whether it can be adapted to higher dimensional systems. These deficiencies are removed in the presented contribution. A new generic eavesdropping scheme built on a firm theoretical background is proposed. In contrast to the previous approach, it does not refer to the properties of the vacuum state, so it is fully consistent with the absence of losses assumption. Moreover, the scheme applies to the communication paradigm based on signal particles of any dimensionality. It is also shown that some well known attacks are special cases of the proposed scheme.

abstract: We report an experiment in which long-lived quantum memories for photonic polarization qubits (PPQs) are controllably released into any one of multiple separate channels. The PPQs are implemented with an arbitrarily-polarized coherent signal light pulses at the single-photon level and are stored in cold atoms by means of electromagnetic-induced-transparency scheme. Reading laser pulses propagating along the direction at a small angle relative to quantum axis are applied to release the stored PPQs into an output channel. By changing the propagating directions of the read laser beam, we controllably release the retrieved PPQs into 7 different photonic output channels, respectively. At one of the output channels, the measured maximum quantum-process fidelity for the PPQs is 94.2% at storage time of t= 0.85ms. At storage time of 6 ms, the quantum-process fidelity is still beyond 78%, the threshold for the violation of the Bell inequality. The demonstrated controllable release of the stored PPQs may extend the capabilities of the quantum information storage technique.

abstract: Power dissipation and effective resistance are ubiquitous quantities in electric circuits. We connect these classical notions with a new quantum phenomenon, proving that a discrete-time quantum walk oscillates between two states if the power dissipation on a related electric network is low. By applying this framework to starting states along a single edge of the graph, we show that low effective resistance implies oscillatory localization of the quantum walk. This includes a large variety of regular graphs, such as edge-transitive, expander, and high degree graphs. As a corollary, it follows that high edge-connectivity also implies localization of these states, since it is closely related to electric resistance.

abstract: Discrete-time quantum walks are well-known for exhibiting localization, a quantum phenomenon where the walker remains at its initial location with high probability. In companion with a joint Letter, we introduce oscillatory localization, where the walker alternates between two states. The walk is given by the flip-flop shift, which is easily defined on non-lattice graphs, and the Grover coin. Extremely simple examples of the localization exist, such as a walker jumping back and forth between two vertices of the complete graph. We show that only two kinds of states, called flip states and uniform states, exhibit exact oscillatory localization. So the projection of an arbitrary state onto these gives a lower bound on the extent of oscillatory localization. Thus we completely characterize the states that oscillate under the quantum walk.

abstract: Quantum metrology has been intensively studied for a wide range of systems with static Hamiltonians. For systems with time-varying Hamiltonians, however, significant difficulty emerges, due to no explicit solution is available for the dynamics in general. This results in a lack of knowledge about quantum metrology for these more complex systems so far. In this paper, we investigate quantum metrology with time-dependent Hamiltonians to bridge this gap. We obtain the optimal solution to Fisher information, and show that proper Hamiltonian control gives an advantage in maximizing the Fisher information. We derive the optimal Hamiltonian control, and with a minimal example of a qubit in a rotating magnetic field, we find a surprising result that with the assistance of Hamiltonian control, the fundamental limit of time scaling $T^{2}$ for Fisher information can be violated with time-dependent Hamiltonians, which reaches $T^{4}$ in estimating the rotation frequency of the field. We further consider level crossings in the parametric derivatives of the Hamiltonians, and point out that additional Hamiltonian control is necessary for that case.

abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of $N$ quantum spins with Lindblad generator consisting of operators scaling as fluctuations, namely with the inverse square-root of $N$. In the large $N$ limit, the microscopic dissipative time-evolution converges to a non-Markovian unitary dynamics on strictly local operators, while at the mesoscopic level of fluctuations it gives rise to a dissipative non-Markovian dynamics. The mesoscopic time-evolution is Gaussian and exhibits either a stable or an unstable asymptotic character; furthermore, the mesoscopic dynamics builds correlations among fluctuations that survive in time even when the original microscopic dynamics is unable to correlate local observables.

abstract: Understanding how correlations can be used for quantum communication protocols is a central goal of quantum information science. While many authors have linked global measures of correlations such as entanglement or discord to the performance of specific protocols, in general the protocols may require only on correlations between specific observables. Here, we introduce a pairwise measure of correlations between local observables, based on the classical mutual information, and show how it can be used to classify the quantum states and assess the role of correlations in specific protocols in a standard way. We exemplify our approach in a two-qubit scenario. We first focus on states with maximally mixed marginals (MMMS) and show that pairwise correlations between local observables are complementary to the coherence of the product bases they define, and that the purity and the symmetry of the states determines the average correlations. Next, we address the role of correlations in the remote state preparation protocol (RSP). One can introduce a proper figure-of-merit for RSP that depends only on a subset of relevant observables. While for MMMS the corresponding relevant correlations are always useful, i.e., they can be fruitfully used for RSP, for non-MMMS only a subset of the relevant correlations has this feature. In both cases, one can define a gain function that quantifies the benefit of using the useful correlations, which turns out to coincide with the average correlations between the useful observables. The gain provides a measure of correlations tied to the specific protocol and one can show that purity and symmetry are the resources that determine the overall performance. Optimizing the protocol means maximizing the useful correlations and thus minimizing the corresponding coherence. The scheme we propose can be straightforwardly extended to other communication protocols.

abstract: The strong coupling between the acoustic and optical fields confined in GaAs/AlAs superlattice cavities makes them appealing systems for cavity optomechanics. We have developed a novel mathematical model based on the scattering matrix that allows the acoustic guided modes to be predicted in nano and micropillar superlattice cavities. We demonstrate here that the reflection at the surface boundary considerably modifies the acoustic quality factor and leads to significant confinement at the micropillar center. Our mathematical model also predicts unprecedented acoustic Fano resonances on nano-pillars featuring small mode volumes and very high mechanical quality factors, making them attractive systems for optomechanical applications.

abstract: We consider Bell tests in which the distant observers can perform local filtering before testing a Bell inequality. Notably, in this setup, certain entangled states admitting a local hidden variable model in the standard Bell scenario can nevertheless violate a Bell inequality after filtering, displaying so-called hidden nonlocality. Here we ask whether all entangled states can violate a Bell inequality after well-chosen local filtering. We answer this question in the negative by showing that there exist entangled states without hidden nonlocality. Specifically, we prove that some two-qubit Werner states still admit a local hidden variable model after any possible local filtering on a single copy of the state.

abstract: Plenoptic imaging is a novel optical technique for three-dimensional imaging in a single shot. It is enabled by the simultaneous measurement of both the location and the propagation direction of light in a given scene. In the standard approach, the maximum spatial and angular resolutions are inversely proportional, and so are the resolution and the maximum achievable depth of focus of the 3D image. We have recently proposed a method to overcome such fundamental limits by combining plenoptic imaging with an intriguing correlation remote-imaging technique: ghost imaging. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that correlation plenoptic imaging can be effectively achieved by exploiting the position-momentum entanglement characterizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon pairs. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we shall show that correlation plenoptic imaging with entangled photons may enable the refocusing of an out-of-focus image at the same depth of focus of a standard plenoptic device, but without sacrificing diffraction-limited image resolution.

abstract: Linear system games are a generalization of Mermin's magic square game introduced by Cleve and Mittal. They show that perfect strategies for linear system games in the tensor-product model of entanglement correspond to finite-dimensional operator solutions of a certain set of non-commutative equations. We investigate linear system games in the commuting-operator model of entanglement, where Alice and Bob's measurement operators act on a joint Hilbert space, and Alice's operators must commute with Bob's operators. We show that perfect strategies in this model correspond to possibly-infinite-dimensional operator solutions of the non-commutative equations. The proof is based around a finitely-presented group associated to the linear system which arises from the non-commutative equations.

abstract: We obtain analytic expressions for the conductivity of pristine (pure) graphene in the framework of the Dirac model using the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensions defined along the real frequency axis. It is found that at both zero and nonzero temperature $T$ the in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities of graphene are equal to each other with a high precision and essentially do not depend on the wave vector. At $T=0$ the conductivity of graphene is real and equal to $\sigma_0=e^2/(4\hbar)$ up to small nonlocal corrections in accordance with many authors. At some fixed $T\neq 0$ the real part of the conductivity varies between zero at low frequencies $\omega$ and $\sigma_0$ for optical $\omega$. If $\omega$ is fixed, the conductivity varies between $\sigma_0$ at low $T$ and zero at high $T$. The imaginary part of the conductivity of graphene is shown to depend on the ratio of $\omega$ to $T$. In accordance to the obtained asymptotic expressions, at fixed $T$ it varies from infinity at $\omega=0$ to a negative minimum value reached at some $\omega$, and then approaches to zero with further increase of $\omega$. At fixed $\omega$ the imaginary part of the conductivity varies from zero at $T=0$, reaches a negative minimum at some $T$ and then goes to infinity together with $T$. The numerical computations of both the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity are performed. The above results are obtained in the framework of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature and can be generalized for graphene samples with nonzero mass gap parameter and chemical potential.

abstract: Two level quantum mechanical systems like spin 1/2 particles lend themselves as a natural qubit implementation. However, encoding a single qubit in several spins reduces the resources necessary for qubit control and can protect from decoherence channels. While several varieties of such encoded spin qubits have been implemented, accurate control remains challenging, and leakage out of the subspace of valid qubit states is a potential issue. Here, we realize high-fidelity single qubit operations for a qubit encoded in two electron spins in GaAs quantum dots by iterative tuning of the all-electrical control pulses. Using randomized benchmarking, we find an average gate fidelity of $\mathcal{F} = (98.5 \pm 0.1)\,\%$ and determine the leakage rate between the computational subspace and other states to $\mathcal{L} = (0.4\pm0.1)\,\%$. These results also demonstrate that high fidelity gates can be realized even in the presence of nuclear spins as in III-V semiconductors.

abstract: Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices provide one of the most promising platforms for analog quantum simulations of complex quantum many-body systems. Large-size systems can now routinely be reached and are already used to probe a large variety of different physical situations, ranging from quantum phase transitions to artificial gauge theories. At the same time, measurement techniques are still limited and full tomography for these systems seems out of reach. Motivated by this observation, we present a method to directly detect and quantify to what extent a quantum state deviates from a local Gaussian description, based on available noise correlation measurements from in-situ and time-of-flight measurements. This is an indicator of the significance of strong correlations in ground and thermal states, as Gaussian states are precisely the ground and thermal states of non-interacting models. We connect our findings, augmented by numerical tensor network simulations, to notions of equilibration, disordered systems and the suppression of transport in Anderson insulators.

abstract: In a collinear antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy, symmetry guarantees that the spin wave modes are doubly degenerate. The two modes carry opposite spin angular momentum and exhibit opposite chirality. Using a honeycomb antiferromagnet in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we show that a longitudinal temperature gradient can drive the two modes to opposite transverse edges, realizing a spin Nernst effect of magnons with vanishing thermal Hall current. We find that magnons around the Gamma-point and the K-point contribute oppositely to the transverse spin transport, and their competition leads to a sign change of the spin Nernst coefficient at finite temperature. Possible material candidates are discussed.

abstract: Classical imaging works by scattering photons from an object to be imaged, and achieves resolution scaling as $1/\sqrt{t}$, with $t$ the imaging time. By contrast, the laws of quantum mechanics allow one to utilize quantum coherence to obtain imaging resolution that can scale as quickly as $1/t$ -- the so-called "Heisenberg limit." However, ambiguities in the obtained signal often preclude taking full advantage of this quantum enhancement, while imaging techniques designed to be unambiguous often lose this optimal Heisenberg scaling. Here, we demonstrate an imaging technique which combines unambiguous detection of the target with Heisenberg scaling of the resolution. We also demonstrate a binary search algorithm which can efficiently locate a coherent target using the technique, resolving a target trapped ion to within 3% of the $1/e^2$ diameter of the excitation beam.

abstract: When a mesoscopic conductor is coupled to a high-quality electromagnetic cavity the flow of charges and the flux of photons leaking out of the cavity can both depend strongly on the coupled quantum dynamics of the system. Using a voltage-biased Josephson junction as a model system, we demonstrate that there is a simple connection between the full counting statistics of the charges and the photons in the long time limit. We then reveal the intimate relation between the counting statistics and the nonlinear dynamics of the system, uncovering novel regimes of coherent charge and photon transport associated with bifurcations in the classical dynamics of the system.

The analysis is done by relating the variance of error in the initial state to the recovery of the correct memory and the surprising result is obtained that the relationship between the two is essentially linear.

abstract: I show that the kernel of the random phase approximation (RPA) matrix based on a stable Hartree, Hartree-Fock, Hartree-Bogolyubov or Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov mean field solution is decomposed into a subspace with a basis whose vectors are associated, in the equivalent formalism of a classical Hamiltonian linear in canonic coordinates, with conjugate momenta of cyclic coordinates (Goldstone modes) and a subspace with a basis whose vectors are associated with pairs of conjugate canonic coordinates that do not enter the Hamiltonian at all. In a subspace complementary to the one spanned by all these coordinates including the conjugate coordinates of the Goldstone momenta, the RPA matrix behaves as in the case of a zerodimensional kernel. This result was derived very recently by Nakada as a corollary to a general analysis of RPA matrices based on both stable and unstable mean field solutions. The present proof does not rest on Nakada's general results.

abstract: We discuss the adiabatic theorem and the leading non-adiabatic corrections in periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. We show that these corrections have a two-fold origin: (i) conventional ones originating from the gradually changing Floquet Hamiltonian and (ii) corrections originating from changing the micro-motion operator. These corrections conspire to give a Hall-type linear response for non-stroboscopic (time-averaged) observables allowing one to measure the Berry curvature and the Chern number related to the Floquet Hamiltonian. We further show that the non-zero Floquet Chern number allows one to realize the Thouless energy pump, where one can adiabatically add energy to the system in discrete units of the driving frequency. We discuss the validity of Floquet Adiabatic Perturbation Theory (FAPT) using five different models covering linear and non-linear few and many-particle systems. We argue that in interacting systems, even in the stable high-frequency regimes, FAPT breaks down at ultra slow ramp rates due to avoided crossings of Floquet (many-body) resonances leading to a counter-intuitive stronger heating at slower ramp rates. Nevertheless, we find large windows in the ramp rate, for which the physics of interacting driven systems is well captured by FAPT.

abstract: We measure a transverse momentum kick in a Sagnac interferometer using weak-value amplification with two postselections. The first postselection is controlled by a polarization dependent phase mismatch between both paths of a Sagnac interferometer and the second postselection is controlled by a polarizer at the exit port. By monitoring the darkport of the interferometer, we study the complementary amplification of the concatenated postselections, where the polarization extinction ratio is greater than the contrast of the spatial interference. In this case, we find an improvement in the amplification of the signal of interest by introducing a second postselection to the system.
