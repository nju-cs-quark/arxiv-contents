abstract: The relationships between quantum entangled states and braid matrices have been well studied in recent years. However, most of the results are based on qubits. In this paper, We investigate the applications of 2-qutrit entanglement in the braiding associated with $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion. The 2-qutrit entangled state $|\Psi(\theta)\rangle$, generated by acting the localized unitary solution $\breve{R}(\theta)$ of YBE on 2-qutrit natural basis, achieves its maximal $\ell_1$-norm and maximal von Neumann entropy simultaneously at $\theta=\pi/3$. Meanwhile, at $\theta=\pi/3$, the solutions of YBE reduces braid matrices, which implies the role of $\ell_1$-norm and entropy plays in determining real physical quantities. On the other hand, we give a new realization of 4-anyon topological basis by qutrit entangled states, then the $9\times9$ localized braid representation in 4-qutrit tensor product space $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 4}$ are reduced to Jones representation of braiding in the 4-anyon topological basis. Hence, we conclude that the entangled states are powerful tools in analysing the characteristics of braiding and $\breve{R}$-matrix.

abstract: Single-photon devices at microwave frequencies are important for applications in quantum information processing and communication in the microwave regime. In this work, we describe a proposal of a multi-output single-photon device. We consider two superconducting resonators coupled to a gap-tunable qubit via both its longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. Thus, this qubit-resonator coupling differs from the coupling in standard circuit quantum-electrodynamic systems described by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We demonstrate that an effective quadratic coupling between one of the normal modes and the qubit can be induced, and this induced second-order nonlinearity is much larger than that for conventional Kerr-type systems exhibiting photon blockade. Assuming that a coupled normal mode is resonantly driven, we observe that the output fields from the resonators exhibit strong sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics and photon antibunching. Contrary to previous studies on resonant photon blockade, the first-excited state of our device is a pure single-photon Fock state rather than a polariton state, i.e., a highly hybridized qubit-photon state. In addition, it is found that the optical state truncation caused by the strong qubit-induced nonlinearity can lead to an entanglement between the two resonators, even in their steady state under the Markov approximation.

abstract: We show how to transform a Dirac equation in curved spacetime into a Dirac equation in flat spacetime. In particular, we show that any solution of the free massless Dirac equation in a 1+1 dimensional flat spacetime can be transformed via a local phase transformation into a solution of the corresponding Dirac equation in a curved background, where the spacetime metric is encoded into the phase. In this way, the existing quantum simulators of the Dirac equation can naturally incorporate curved spacetimes. As a first example we use our technique to obtain solutions of the Dirac equation in a particular family of interesting spacetimes in 1+1 dimensions.

abstract: By analyzing the optical tomogram of a linear superposition of coherent states, we show that distinctive signatures of the macroscopic superposition states are displayed directly in the optical tomograms of the states. We also study the effect of decoherence on the optical tomograms of the macroscopic superposition states. Since the wave packet fractional revivals are associated with the generation of macroscopic superposition states, these signatures help in visualizing the revivals and fractional revivals occurring in a nonlinear medium directly in the optical tomogram of the time-evolved state. We found that the optical tomogram of the time-evolved state at the instants of fractional revivals show structures with sinusoidal strands. Using a class of initial superposed wave packets evolving in the Kerr-like medium, we further show that the condition for the occurrence of fractional revival phenomenon depends on the number of wave packets composing the initial superposition state. In the case of a two-mode electromagnetic field, we investigate the entanglement of the state directly using the optical tomogram. We have shown that the signatures of entanglement can be observed directly in the single-mode optical tomogram of the state without reconstructing the density matrix of the system. We also analyze the effect of decoherence on the optical tomograms of the entangled states. Further, we examine the optical tomograms of the entangled states generated using a beam splitter with a Kerr medium placed into one of its input modes. We have found the signatures of entanglement in the optical tomogram for the entangled states generated at the instants of two- and three-subpacket fractional revival times.

abstract: We study the measurement-induced geometric discord based on the trace norm and generalize some properties known for qutrits to qudits. Previous preliminary results for bipartite qutrit systems (i.e. d=3 systems) are here strictly proved for arbitrary d. Present study supports observations, coming also from other approaches, that systems with $d \geq 3$ show similar behaviour when quantum correlations are concerned, but there is pronounced difference between d=2 and d=3. Underlying geometry of state spaces and related Lie groups are responsible for that.

abstract: Topological insulators and superconductors at finite temperature can be characterised by the topological Uhlmann phase. However, the direct experimental measurement in condensed matter systems has remained elusive. We explicitly demonstrate that the topological Uhlmann phase can be measured with the help of ancilla states in systems of entangled qubits that simulate a topological insulator. We propose a novel state-independent measurement protocol which does not involve prior knowledge of the system state. With this construction, otherwise unobservable phases carrying topological information about the system become accessible. This enables the measurement of a complete phase diagram including environmental effects. We explicitly consider a realization of our scheme using a circuit of superconducting qubits. This measurement scheme is extendible to interacting particles and topological models with a large number of bands.

abstract: A spin-polarizing electron beam splitter is described which relies on an arrangement of linearly polarized laser waves of nonrelativistic intensity. An incident electron beam is first coherently scattered off a bichromatic laser field, splitting the beam into two portions, with electron spin and momentum being entangled. Afterwards, the partial beams are coherently superposed in an interferometric setup formed by standing laser waves. As a result, the outgoing electron beam is separated into its spin components along the laser magnetic field, which is shown by both analytical and numerical solutions of Pauli's equation. The proposed laser field configuration thus exerts the same effect on free electrons like an ordinary Stern-Gerlach magnet does on atoms.

abstract: The "zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics" (ZSM) answer to Wallstrom's criticism, introduced in the companion paper [1], is extended to many particles. We first formulate the many-particle generalization of Nelson-Yasue stochastic mechanics (NYSM), incorporating external and classical interaction potentials. Then we formulate the many-particle generalization of the classical zitterbewegung \emph{zbw} model introduced in Part I, for the cases of free particles, particles interacting with external fields, and classically interacting particles. On the basis of these developments, ZSM is constructed for classically free particles, as well as for particles interacting both with external fields and through inter-particle scalar potentials. Throughout, the beables of ZSM (based on the many-particle formulation) are made explicit. Subsequently, we assess the plausibility and generalizability of the\emph{zbw} hypothesis. We close with an appraisal of other proposed answers, and compare them to ZSM.

abstract: Quantum Zeno Dynamics is the phenomenon that the observation or strong driving of a quantum system can freeze its dynamics to a subspace, effectively truncating the Hilbert space of the system. It represents the quantum version of the famous flying arrow Zeno paradox. Here, we study how temporal stochasticity in the system observation (or driving) affects the survival probability of the system in the subspace. In particular, we introduce a strong and a weak Zeno regime for which we quantify the confinement by providing an analytical expression for this survival probability. We investigate several dissipative and coherent protocols to confine the dynamics, and show that they can be successfully adapted to the stochastic version. In the weak Zeno regime the dynamics within the subspace effectively acts as an additional source of stochasticity in the confinement protocol. Our analytical predictions are numerically tested and verified on a paradigmatic spin chain. As practical implications different coherent and dissipative confinement protocols allow to choose a trade-off between a probabilistic scheme with high fidelity (compared to perfect subspace dynamics) and a deterministic one with a slightly lower fidelity, which is a step towards better control in future quantum technologies.

abstract: We theoretically consider the response of a many-body localized system to a local quench. We find that for highly excited states the local quench triggers an {\it unbounded} logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy in spite of many-body localization. This entanglement growth gives rise to a logarithmic lightcone, saturating the Lieb-Robinson bound of quantum information propagation. Strikingly, the final states after the local quench exhibit volume law entanglement, in sharp contrast to the ground state which manifests a {\it bounded} entanglement growth following the local quench.

abstract: We use an external spin as a dynamical probe of many body localization. The probe spin is coupled to an interacting and disordered environment described by a Heisenberg spin chain in a random field. The spin-chain environment can be tuned between a thermalizing delocalized phase and non-thermalizing localized phase, both in its ground- and high-energy states. We study the decoherence of the probe spin when it couples to the environment prepared in three states: the ground state, the infinite temperature state and a high energy N\'eel state. In the non-thermalizing many body localized regime, the coherence shows scaling behaviour in the disorder strength. The long-time dynamics of the probe spin shows a logarithmic dephasing in analogy with the logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy for a bi-partition of a many-body localized system. In summary, we show that decoherence of the probe spin provides clear signatures of many-body localization.

abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of the ground state of the repulsive fermionic SU($3$) Hubbard model on the Lieb lattice from weak to strong interactions, by means of mean-field approximation. To see how well the mean-field method works, we first study the magnetic properties of the ground state of SU($2$) Hubbard model at the mean-field level, and find that our results are consistent with known rigorous theorems. We then extend the mean-field calculation for Hubbard model with SU($3$) symmetry. We find that, at $4/9$ filling, SU$(3)$ symmetry spontaneously breaks into SU$(2)\times$U$(1)$ symmetry in the ground state, resulting in a staggered ferromagnetic state for any $U$ at zero temperature. At finite temperature, the long-range order is absent by Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, the quasi long-range magnetic order may exist. Our mean-field calculation estimate the quasi long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuation, but it can persist up to a finite temperature. These results are relevant to current experiments with fermionic alkaline-earth (-like) atoms loaded into optical lattice, and could be observed in experiments.

abstract: We construct doubled lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theories with discrete gauge group $G$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. Here, these theories are considered on a square spatial lattice and the fundamental degrees of freedom are defined on pairs of links from the direct lattice and its dual, respectively. This provides a natural lattice construction for topologically-massive gauge theories, which are invariant under parity and time-reversal symmetry. After defining the building blocks of the doubled theories, paying special attention to the realization of gauge transformations on quantum states, we examine the dynamics in the group space of a single cross, which is spanned by a single link and its dual. The dynamics is governed by the single-cross electric Hamiltonian and admits a simple quantum mechanical analogy to the problem of a charged particle moving on a discrete space affected by an abstract electromagnetic potential. Such a particle might accumulate a phase shift equivalent to an Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is manifested in the doubled theory in terms of a nontrivial ground-state degeneracy on a single cross. We discuss several examples of these doubled theories with different gauge groups including the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}(k)\subset U(1)$, the symmetric group $S_3\subset O(2)$, the binary dihedral (or quaternion) group $\bar{D}_2\subset SU(2)$, and the finite group $\Delta(27)\subset SU(3)$. In each case the spectrum of the single-cross electric Hamiltonian is determined exactly. We examine the nature of the low-lying excited states in the full Hilbert space, and emphasize the role of the center symmetry for the confinement of charges. Whether the investigated doubled models admit a non-Abelian topological state which allows for fault-tolerant quantum computation will be addressed in a future publication.

abstract: The source-free Maxwell action is invariant under electric-magnetic duality rotations in arbitrary spacetimes. This leads to a conserved classical Noether charge. We show that this conservation law is broken at the quantum level in presence of a background classical gravitational field with a non-trivial Chern-Pontryagin invariant, in a parallel way to the chiral anomaly for massless Dirac fermions. Among the physical consequences, the net polarization of the quantum electromagnetic field is not conserved.

We also prove some weighted Lieb-Thirring estimates for negative eigenvalues of such operators. In the process we find explicit spectral representations for all self-adjoint realisations of massless Coulomb-Dirac operators on the half-line.
