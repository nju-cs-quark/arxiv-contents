abstract: Squeezed states of spin systems are an important entangled resource for quantum technologies, particularly quantum metrology and sensing. Here we consider the generation of spin squeezed states by interacting the spins with a dissipative ancillary system. We show that spin squeezing can be generated in this model by two different mechanisms: one-axis twisting and driven collective relaxation. We can interpolate between the two mechanisms by simply adjusting the detuning between the dissipative ancillary system and the spin system. Interestingly, we find that for both mechanisms, ancillary system dissipation need not be considered an imperfection in our model, but plays a positive role in spin squeezing. To assess the feasibility of spin squeezing we consider two different implementations with superconducting circuits. We conclude that it is experimentally feasible to generate a squeezed state of hundreds of spins either by one-axis twisting or by driven collective relaxation.

abstract: We revisit the self-contained quantum refrigerator in the strong-internal-coupling regime by employing the quantum optical master equation. It is shown that strong internal coupling reduces the cooling ability of the refrigerator. In contrast to the weak-coupling case, strong internal coupling could lead to quite different and even converse thermodynamic behaviors.

abstract: We report on an experimental observation of a two-photon ghost interference experiment. A distinguishing feature of our experiment is that the photons are generated via a non-degenerated spontaneous four-wave mixing process in a hot atomic ensemble; therefore the photon has narrow bandwidth. Besides, there is a large difference in frequency between two photons in a pair. Our works may be important to achieve more secure, large transmission capacity long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: I explore the use of quantum information as a security enabler for the future driverless vehicle. Specifically, I investigate the role combined classical and quantum information can have on the most important characteristic of the driverless vehicle paradigm - the vehicle location. By using information-theoretic verification frameworks, coupled with emerging quantum-based location-verification procedures, I show how vehicle positions can be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in classical-only networks. I also discuss how other quantum applications can be seamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure required for location verification. The two technology enablers required for the driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory timescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular communication infrastructure (underway). I argue the enhanced safety features delivered by the `Quantum Car' mean its eventual deployment is inevitable.

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has enormous applications. Multi-dimensional NMR has been a standard technique to characterize correlations between nuclei and hence molecule structures. Multi-dimensional spectroscopy has also been extended to optics to study correlations in molecules and many-body effects in semiconductors. Towards the ultimate goal of single-molecule NMR, dynamical decoupling (DD) enhanced diamond quantum sensing has enabled detection of single nuclear spins and nanoscale NMR. However, there is still lack of a standard method in DD-based quantum sensing for correlation spectroscopy of single molecules. Here we present a scheme of multi-dimensional DD-based quantum sensing, as a universal method for correlation spectroscopy of single nuclear spins. The multi-dimensional DD sequence contains multiple sets of periodic DD sequences with multiple pulse intervals matched to different transition frequencies. Then the sensor coherence patterns as a joint function of multiple DD pulse numbers, unambiguously determine the correlation types between different transitions. This work offers a standard approach to single-molecule structural analysis.

abstract: A custom-built and precisely controlled quantum system may offer access to a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analog quantum simulator that makes the relevant observables, interactions, and states of a quantum model accessible could permit experimental insight into complex quantum dynamics that are intractable on conventional computers. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here we characterise two-dimensional arrays of three ions trapped by radio-frequency fields in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80 micrometer. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as tuning of crucial couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards an analog quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

abstract: We report on a precision measurement of the $D$ line tune-out wavelength of $^{87}$Rubidium in the hyperfine ground state $|F=1, m_F=0,\pm1 \rangle$ manifold at 790 nm, where the scalar ac Stark shifts of the $D_1$ and the $D_2$ lines cancel. This wavelength is sensitive to usually neglected contributions from vector and tensor ac Stark shifts, transitions to higher principle quantum numbers, and core electrons. The ac Stark shift is probed by Kapitza-Dirac scattering of a Rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice in free space and controlled magnetic environment. The tune-out wavelength of the magnetically insensitive $m_F=0$ state was determined to 790.01858(23) nm with sub pm accuracy. An in situ absolute polarization, and magnetic background field measurement is performed by employing the ac vector Stark shift for the $m_F=\pm 1$ states. Comparing our findings to theory, we get quantitative insight into atomic physics beyond commonly used two-level atom approximations or the neglect of inner shell contributions.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We address the dynamics of quantum correlations for a bipartite continuous-variable quantum system interacting with its fluctuating environment. In particular, we consider two independent quantum oscillators initially prepared in a Gaussian state, e.g. a squeezed thermal state, and compare the dynamics resulting from local noise, i.e. oscillators coupled to two independent external fields, to that originating from common noise, i.e. oscillators interacting with a single common field. We prove non-Markovianity (non-divisibility) of the dynamics in both regimes and analyze the connections between non-divisibility, backflow of information and revivals of quantum correlations. Our main results may be summarized as follows: (i) revivals of quantumness are present in both scenarios, however, the interaction with a common environment better preserves the quantum features of the system; (ii) the dynamics is always non-divisible but revivals of quantum correlations are present only when backflow of information is present as well. We conclude that non-divisibility in its own is not a resource to preserve quantum correlations in our system, i.e. it is not sufficient to observe recoherence phenomena. Rather, it represents a necessary prerequisite to obtain backflow of information, which is the true ingredient to obtain revivals of quantumness.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the coupling of an erbium doped crystal to a three-dimensional superconducting cavity of a $10^5$ $Q$-factor at zero magnetic field. A tunable loop-gap resonator is used to match the cavity frequency to the hyperfine transitions of an erbium sample. The observed spectrum differs from what predicted by the published spin Hamiltonian parameters. The narrow cavity linewidth also enables the observations of asymmetric lineshapes of these hyperfine transitions, which are understood as the super-hyperfine interactions between the erbium ions and their adjacent yttrium ions. Such a broadly tunable superconducting cavity architecture, from 1.6 GHz to 4.0 GHz in the current design, is promising in building hybrid quantum systems.

abstract: Based on the modified weak measurement scheme in [Y-X Zhang, S Wu and Z-B Chen, arXiv: 1504.07130], a modified direct state measurement (MDSM) is proposed without inherent bias. Compared with the existing direct state measurement (DSM), MDSM is more efficient and valid for any coupling strength. Through accurate Monte Carlo simulations, we get the optimal coupling strength to attain high efficiency. For the same reconstruction precision, we compare the number of copies needed in MDSM and the one in conventional quantum state tomography (QST) by simulations. We find MDSM is less efficient than conventional QST. However, MDSM is much easier to be realized in actual experiments, and might be more useful.

abstract: In recent decades it was established that the quantum measurements of physical quantities in space-time points divided by space-like intervals may be correlated. Though such correlation follows from the formulas of quantum mechanics its physics so far remains unclear and there is a number of different and rather contradictory interpretations. They concern particularly the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox where the momentary action at a distance together with non-local entangled states is used for the interpretation. We assume that the quantum theory can be formulated as local and look for the consequences of this assumption. Accordingly we try to explain the correlation phenomena in a local way looking for the origin of correlation. To exclude a presupposed correlation of participating quantum particles we consider two independent particle sources and two detectors that are independent as well. We show that the origin of the correlation is the feature that the occupation number of a particle (and other its measurable quantities) is formed by a pair of complex conjugated wave functions with in general arbitrary phases. We consider this point as crucial as it provides interpretation of the observed correlation phenomena that may otherwise look puzzling. We briefly discuss a special type of noise that is typical for the quantum correlation phenomena.

abstract: We extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum field theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and unstable states. Our derivation is a quite minimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar products, invariance under complex Lorentz transformations, and a non-standard but nonetheless perfectly legitimate interpretation of charge conjugation as an anti-linear operator. The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an anti-linear symmetry. The latter two requirements then force this anti-linear symmetry to be $CPT$, while forcing the Hamiltonian to be real rather than Hermitian. Our work justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the lifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. We show that the Euclidean time path integrals of a $CPT$ symmetric theory must always be real. In the quantum-mechanical limit the key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are recovered, with the $C$-operator of the $PT$ symmetry program being identified with the linear component of the charge conjugation operator.

abstract: Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into complex problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. Here we study non-equilibrium, quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of $^9$Be$^+$ ions in a Penning trap. We verify entanglement in the form of spin-squeezed states for up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0$\pm$0.9 dB of spectroscopic enhancement. We also observe evidence of non-Gaussian, over-squeezed states in the full counting statistics. We find good agreement with ab-initio theory that includes competition between entanglement and decoherence, laying the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, for which numerical solutions are, in general, classically intractable.

abstract: One examines putative corrections to the Bell operator due to the noncommutativity in the phase-space. Starting from a Gaussian squeezed envelop whose time evolution is driven by commutative (standard quantum mechanics) and noncommutative dynamics respectively, one concludes that, although the time evolving covariance matrix in the noncommutative case is different from the standard case, the squeezing parameter dominates and there are no noticeable noncommutative corrections to the Bell operator. This indicates that, at least for squeezed states, the privileged states to test Bell correlations, noncommutativity versions of quantum mechnics remains as non-local as quantum mechanics itself.

The complexity of the quantum algorithm scales with the inverse square root of the spectral gap of an associated stochastic matrix. This represents a quadratic quantum speedup, in terms of the gap, with respect to classical simulated annealing.

abstract: We discuss the behaviour of holographic entanglement entropy following a local quench in 2+1 dimensional strongly coupled CFTs. The entanglement generated by the quench propagates along an emergent light-cone, reminiscent of the Lieb-Robinson light-cone propagation of correlations in non-relativistic systems. We find the the speed of propagation is bounded from below by the entanglement tsunami velocity obtained earlier for global quenches in holographic systems, and from above by the speed of light. The former is realized for sufficiently broad quenches, while the latter pertains for well localized quenches. The non-universal behavior in the intermediate regime appears to stem from finite-size effects. We also note that the entanglement entropy of subsystems reverts to the equilibrium value exponentially fast, in contrast to a much slower equilibration seen in certain spin models.

abstract: A detailed study of the $g$-factor anisotropy of electrons and holes in InAs/In$_{0.53}$Al$_{0.24}$Ga$_{0.23}$As self-assembled quantum dots emitting in the telecom spectral range of $1.5-1.6$ $\mu$m (around 0.8 eV photon energy) is performed by time-resolved pump-probe ellipticity using a superconducting vector magnet. All components of the $g$-factor tensors are measured, including their spread in the QD ensemble. Surprisingly, the electron $g$ factor shows a large anisotropy changing from $g_{\mathrm{e},x}= -1.63$ to $g_{\mathrm{e},z}= -2.52$ between directions perpendicular and parallel to the dot growth axis, respectively, at an energy of 0.82 eV. The hole $g$-factor anisotropy at this energy is even stronger: $|g_{\text{h},x}|= 0.64$ and $|g_{\text{h},z}|= 2.29$. On the other hand, the in-plane anisotropies of electron and hole $g$ factors are small. The pronounced out-of-plane anisotropy is also observed for the spread of the $g$ factors, determined from the spin dephasing time.

abstract: Nonlinear and nonlocal effects are discussed in the interaction of laser fields with thermal Rydberg atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency configuration. We show that under the crucial approximation that the time variation in the dipole-dipole interactions due to atomic motions can be neglected in an ensemble average, an analytical form can be obtained for the nonlocal nonlinear atomic response of the thermal medium, and study it for different parameter cases. We further propose a generalized model to describe the modulational instability (MI) in absorptive nonlinear media, in order to understand the propagation dynamics in the thermal Rydberg medium. Interestingly, this model predicts that at short propagation distances, each wave component exhibits the MI effect in absorptive nonlinear media, unlike in the purely dispersive case.

abstract: Holographic systems require monogamous mutual information for validity of semiclassical geometry. This is encoded by the sign of the tripartite information ($I3$). We investigate the behaviour of $I3$ for all partitionings of systems in states which are highly entangled in a multipartite or bipartite sense. In the case of multipartite entanglement we propose an algorithmic construction that we conjecture can be used to build local maxima of $I3$ for any partitioning. In case of bipartite entanglement we classify the possible values of $I3$ for perfect states and investigate, in some examples, the effect on its sign definiteness due to deformations of the states. Finally we comment on the proposal of using $I3$ as a parameter of scrambling, arguing that in general its average over qubits permutations could be a more sensible measure.
