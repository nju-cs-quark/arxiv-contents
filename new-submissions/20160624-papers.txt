abstract: In this work, we present a new class of one-way steerable two-qubit states. The unidirectional quantum steering can be shown with fewer measurement settings, thus is more efficient than the result in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 200402 (2014)]. A 9-setting linear steering inequality has been presented explicitly, it would be interesting to test the one-way steering in experiment.

abstract: This study was started to know mysterious classicality of nuclei. This time, I found a new rule for decoherence. I used a model without chaos. As a result, it was shown that not only the intersection of classical trajectories but also branching of classical trajectories are needed for decoherence. In other words, it was shown that interactions between a main system and environments have to make enough branchings of classical trajectories of the main system for decoherence.

abstract: We consider a notion of relative homology (and cohomology) for surfaces with two types of boundaries. Using this tool, we study a generalization of Kitaev's code based on surfaces with mixed boundaries. This construction includes both Bravyi and Kitaev's and Freedman and Meyer's extension of Kitaev's toric code. We argue that our generalization offers a denser storage of quantum information. In a planar architecture, we obtain a three-fold overhead reduction over the standard architecture consisting of a punctured square lattice.

abstract: It is shown that dynamical equations for quantum tomograms retain the normalization conditions of their solutions during evolution only if the solutions satisfy a set of special conditions. These conditions are found explicitly. On the contrary, it is also shown that the classical Liouville equation, Moyal equation for Wigner function, and evolution equation for Husimi function retain normalization of any initially normalized and quickly decaying at infinity functions on the phase space. Other necessary and sufficient conditions for optical and symplectic tomogram-like functions to be tomograms of physical states are discussed.

abstract: We present Hamiltonian realizations of a large class of (3+1)D models based on special unitary fusion 2-categories called unitary G-crossed braided fusion categories. This construction comes with a wealth of examples from the literature of symmetry-enriched topological phases. The corresponding unitary state sum topological quantum fields theories (TQFT) appear to capture all known constructions in the literature, including the Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang and 2-Group gauge theory models. We also present Hamiltonian realizations of a state sum TQFT recently constructed by Kashaev whose relation to existing models was previously unknown. We argue that this TQFT is captured as a special case of the Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang model, in some cases with a premodular category.

abstract: We study the performance of the D-Wave 2X quantum annealing machine on systems with well-controlled ground-state degeneracy. While obtaining the ground-state of a spin-glass benchmark instance represents a difficult task, the gold standard for any optimization algorithm or machine is to sample all solutions that minimize the Hamiltonian with more or less equal probability. Our results show that while naive transverse-field quantum annealing on the D-Wave 2X device can find the ground-state energy of the problems, it is not well suited in identifying all degenerate ground-state configurations associated to a particular instance. Even worse, some states are exponentially suppressed, in agreement with previous studies on toy model problems [New J. Phys. 11, 073021 (2009)]. These results suggest that more complex driving Hamiltonians, which introduce transitions between all states with equal weights, are needed in future quantum annealing machines to ensure a fair sampling of the ground-state manifold.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg (LG) test of macroscopic realism involves a series of dichotomic non-invasive measurements that are used to calculate a function which has a fixed upper bound for a macrorealistic system and a larger upper bound for a quantum system. The quantum upper bound depends on both the details of the measurement and the dimension of the system. Here we present an LG experiment on a three-level quantum system, which produces a larger theoretical quantum upper bound than that of a two-level quantum system. The experiment is carried out in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and consists of the LG test as well as a test of the ideal assumptions associated with the experiment, such as measurement non-invasiveness. The non-invasive measurements are performed via the modified ideal negative result measurement scheme on a three-level system. Once these assumptions are tested, the violation becomes small, despite the fact that the LG value itself is large. Our results showcase the advantages of using the modified measurement scheme that can reach the higher LG values, as they give more room for hypothetical malicious errors in a real experiment

abstract: We consider continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit in the circuit QED setup with a moderate bandwidth of the measurement resonator, i.e., when the "bad cavity" limit is not applicable. The goal is a simple description of the quantum evolution due to measurement, i.e., the measurement back-action. Extending the quantum Bayesian approach previously developed for the "bad cavity" regime, we show that the evolution equations remain the same, but now they should be applied to the entangled qubit-resonator state, instead of the qubit state alone. The derivation uses only elementary quantum mechanics and basic properties of coherent states, thus being accessible to non-experts.

abstract: A Hamiltonian is presented, which can be used to convert any asymmetric state $|\varphi \rangle_{a}|\phi \rangle_{b}$ of two oscillators $a$ and $b$ into an entangled state. Furthermore, with this Hamiltonian and local operations only, two oscillators, initially in any asymmetric initial states, can be entangled with a third oscillator. The prepared entangled states can be engineered with an arbitrary degree of entanglement. A discussion on the realization of this Hamiltonian is given. Numerical simulations show that, with current circuit QED technology, it is feasible to generate high-fidelity entangled states of two microwave optical fields, such as entangled coherent states, entangled squeezed states, entangled coherent-squeezed states, and entangled cat states. Our finding opens a new avenue for creating not only two-color or three-color entanglement of light but also wave-like or particle-like entanglement or novel wave-like and particle-like hybrid entanglement.

abstract: Some nonlinear radiations such as superfluorescence can be understood as cooperative effects between atoms. We regard the cooperative radiation as a manifested effect secondary to the intrinsic cooperativity among the atoms and propose a time-resolved measure of cooperativity on a cavity-coupled dual-qubit system using multi-partite concurrence measures. We find that the cooperativity features a time delay characterisitic to superfluorescent pulses in its evolution, which coincides with the duration for the qubits to synchronize with each other. Thereafter, the cooperativity monotonically increases to a stationary value while the measure of asynchronicity dives to a steady minimum. Furthermore, the asynchronicity experiences a continuous transition to nonzero values when the coupling strength crosses from the weak to the strong coupling regime.

abstract: Schr\"odinger's illustration of an imaginary cat in a box, neither alive nor dead, leads to a question of whether and how long a macroscopic quantum superposition can exist in various situations. It is well known that a macroscopic superposition is destroyed very quickly by environmental effects called decoherence. On the contrary, it is often believed that a macroscopic superposition continues to "survive" if it is ideally isolated from its environment. In this paper, using a well-established measure of macroscopic superpositions and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, we show that macroscopic superpositions even in ideally closed systems are destroyed by thermalization processes. We further investigate specific examples of a disordered Heisenberg spin chain varied between the thermalization phase and the many-body localization (MBL) phase. Consistent results are obtained that initial macroscopic superpositions that undergo thermalization disappear while they are preserved in the MBL phase in which thermalization does not occur.

abstract: We demonstrate a coherence time of 2.1(1)~s for electron spin superposition states of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. The coherence time, measured with a spin-echo experiment, corresponds to residual rms magnetic field fluctuations $\leq$~2.7$\times$10$^{-12}$~T. The suppression of decoherence induced by fluctuating magnetic fields is achieved by combining a two-layer $\mu$-metal shield, which reduces external magnetic noise by 20 to 30~dB for frequencies of 50~Hz to 100~kHz, with Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ permanent magnets for generating a quantizing magnetic field of 0.37~mT. Our results extend the coherence time of the simple-to-operate spin qubit to ultralong coherence times which so far have been observed only for magnetic insensitive transitions in atomic qubits with hyperfine structure.

After a brief review of these issues, we present an experimental test of the error-disturbance uncertainty relations in photon polarization measurement. Using generalized, strength-variable measurement of a single photon polarization state, we experimentally evaluate the error and disturbance in the measurement process and demonstrate the validity of recently proposed uncertainty relations.

abstract: We propose force sensing protocols using linear ion chain which can operate beyond the quantum standard limit. We show that oscillating forces that are off-resonance with the motional trap frequency can be detected very efficiently by using quantum probes represented by various spin-boson models. We demonstrate that the temporal evolution of a quantum probe described by the Dicke model can be mapped on the nonlinear Ramsey interferometry which allows to detect far-detuned forces simply by measuring the collective spin populations. Moreover, we show that the measurement uncertainty can reach the Heisenberg limit by using initial spin correlated states, instead of motional entangled states. An important advantage of the sensing technique is its natural robustness against the thermally induced dephasing, which extends the coherence time of the measurement protocol. Furthermore, we introduce sensing scheme that utilize the strong spin-phonon coupling to improve the force estimation. We show that for quantum probe represented by quantum Rabi model the force sensitivity can overcome those using simple harmonic oscillator as a force sensor.

abstract: Results of theoretical studies of the quantum unstable systems caused that there are rather widespread belief that a universal feature od the quantum decay process is the presence of three time regimes of the decay process: the early time (initial) leading to the Quantum Zeno (or Anti Zeno) Effects, "exponential" (or "canonical") described by the decay law of the exponential form, and late time characterized by the decay law having inverse--power law form. Based on the fundamental principles of the quantum theory we give the proof that there is no time interval in which the survival probability (decay law) could be a decreasing function of time of the purely exponential form but even at the "exponential" regime the decay curve is oscillatory modulated with a smaller or a large amplitude of oscillations depending on parameters of the model considered.

abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative quantum communications protocol which exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate unconditionally secure cryptographic keying material between two geographically separated parties. The unique nature of QKD shows promise for high-security applications such as those found in banking, government, and military environments. However, QKD systems contain implementation non-idealities which can negatively impact their performance and security.In particular, QKD systems often employ the decoy state protocol to improve system throughput and mitigate the threat of Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attacks. In this work, a detailed analysis of the decoy state protocol is conducted which optimizes both performance in terms of quantum throughput and security with respect to detecting PNS attacks. The results of this study uniquely demonstrate that the decoy state protocol can ensure PNS attacks are detected with high confidence, while maximizing the secure key generation rate at no additional cost. Additionally, implementation security guidance is provided for QKD system developers and users.

abstract: In recent years, the use of integrated technologies for applications in the field of quantum information processing and communications has made great progress. The resulting devices feature valuable characteristics such as scalability, reproducibility, low cost and interconnectivity, and have the potential to revolutionize our computation and communication practices in the future, much in the way that electronic integrated circuits have drastically transformed our information processing capacities since the last century. Among the multiple applications of integrated quantum technologies, this review will focus on typical components of quantum communication systems and on overall integrated system operation characteristics. We are interested in particular in the use of photonic integration platforms for developing devices necessary in quantum communications, including sources, detectors and both passive and active optical elements. We also illustrate the challenges associated with performing quantum communications on chip, by using the case study of quantum key distribution - the most advanced application of quantum information science. We conclude with promising perspectives in this field.

abstract: Ground-state cooling of mechanical oscillators in cavities opens a new arena for exploration of quantum mechanics at mesoscopic to macroscopic scales. But extracting quantum signatures, unambiguously distinct from very cold classical oscillators, remains challenging. An established technique detects asymmetry in the {\em heights} of motional sidebands of the cavity output light. We propose instead a scheme where the {\em shape} of detected sidebands also alters when correlations between quantum back-action and incoming quantum noise become significant. We show this can be achieved by simultaneously modulating the light-mechanical coupling $g$ and mechanical frequency $\omega_M$ - slowly and out-of-phase. Such modulations are generic but occur in optically trapped set-ups where the equilibrium point of the oscillator is varied cyclically. We analyse recently observed split-sideband structures, in thermal regimes, and predict how their shapes would change in the quantum limit.

abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis is the process in which an arbitrary unitary operation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set, typically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and fault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the need is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the circuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact, multi-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and circuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a handful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may lead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the size of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized physically as a result of having more efficient circuits. We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks. Also termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point is chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct a parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version performing optimal $T$-count synthesis over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. We use our software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant speedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full adder has optimal $T$-count 7 and $T$-depth 3.

abstract: The reduced density matrices of a many-body quantum system form a convex set, whose three-dimensional projection $\Theta$ is convex in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The boundary $\partial\Theta$ of $\Theta$ may exhibit nontrivial geometry, in particular ruled surfaces. Two physical mechanisms are known for the origins of ruled surfaces: symmetry breaking and gapless. In this work, we study the emergence of ruled surfaces for systems with local Hamiltonians in infinite spatial dimension, where the reduced density matrices are known to be separable as a consequence of the quantum de Finetti's theorem. This allows us to identify the reduced density matrix geometry with joint product numerical range $\Pi$ of the Hamiltonian interaction terms. We focus on the case where the interaction terms have certain structures, such that ruled surface emerge naturally when taking a convex hull of $\Pi$. We show that, a ruled surface on $\partial\Theta$ sitting in $\Pi$ has a gapless origin, otherwise it has a symmetry breaking origin. As an example, we demonstrate that a famous ruled surface, known as the oloid, is a possible shape of $\Theta$, with two boundary pieces of symmetry breaking origin separated by two gapless lines.

abstract: Microwave resonators have been used to realize qubit readout, two-qubit gates, and state shuttling between distant quantum systems. Strong coupling between a spin qubit and a resonator may be achieved using an inhomogeneous magnetic field generated with a nanomagnet. We consider a spin qubit in a double quantum dot exposed to a stray magnetic field with transverse and longitudinal components with respect to an applied external field. We show that this geometry leads to transverse and longitudinal couplings of ~1 MHz between the spin qubit and the resonator. Using realistic simulations of a GaAs device, we show how precise placement of the nanomagnet allows to select between transverse and longitudinal coupling. We also explain how to mitigate new dephasing and relaxation channels that are inherent to this coupling scheme. This analysis gives a clear route towards realization of coherent state transfer between a microwave resonator and a single spin in quantum dots with a fidelity above 90%. Improved dynamical decoupling sequences, low-noise environments, and longer-lived microwave cavities may lead to substantially higher fidelities in the near future.

abstract: In 4 dimensional Maxwell gauge theory, we study the changes of (Renyi) entangle-ment entropy which are defined by subtracting the entropy for the ground state from the one for the locally excited states generated by acting with the gauge invariant local operators on the state. The changes for the operators which we consider in this paper reflect the electric-magnetic duality. The late-time value of changes can be interpreted in terms of electromagnetic quasi-particles. When the operator constructed of both electric and magnetic fields acts on the ground state, it shows that the operator acts on the late-time structure of quantum entanglement differently from free scalar fields.

abstract: The achievement of quantum-degenerate Bose gases composed of atoms with sizeable magnetic dipole moments has realized quantum ferrofluids, a form of fluid which combines the extraordinary properties of superfluidity and ferrofluidity. A hallmark of superfluids is that they are constrained to circulate through vortices with quantized circulation. These excitations underpin a variety of rich phenomena, including vortex lattices, quantum turbulence, the Berenzinksii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and Kibble-Zurek defect formation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the theory of vortices and vortex lattices in quantum ferrofluids created from dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, exploring the interplay of magnetism with vorticity and contrasting this with the established behaviour in non-dipolar condensates. Our discussion is based on the mean-field theory provided by the dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii equation, from analytic treatments based on the Thomas-Fermi and variational approaches to full numerical simulations. We cover single vortex solutions, including their structure, energy and stability, and the interactions and dynamics of vortex pairs. Routes to generate vortices in dipolar condensates are discussed, with particular attention to rotating condensates, where surface instabilities drive the nucleation of vortices, and lead to the emergence of rich and varied vortex lattice structures. Finally we present an outlook, including potential extensions to degenerate Fermi gases, quantum Hall physics, toroidal systems and the Berenzinkskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

abstract: In the setup of isolated quantum systems, it is proved that the thermodynamic entropy and the diagonal entropy must increase extensively in any nontrivial quantum quench. The extensive increase of the thermodynamic entropy is shown for any initial state (even for a pure state) that represents thermal equilibrium. On the other hand, the extensive increase of the diagonal entropy is shown for any stationary initial state under the condition that both the pre-quench and the post-quench Hamiltonians satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

By submitting an atomic wave packet to a pulsed, periodically shifted laser standing wave, we induce an oscillation of ERO in time and explain it in terms of a periodic, reversible dephasing in the weak-localization interference sequences responsible for ERO. Monitoring the temporal decay of ERO, we exploit its quantum coherent nature to quantify the decoherence rate of the atomic system.

abstract: We numerically investigate the distribution of Drude weights $D$ of many-body states in disordered one-dimensional interacting electron systems across the transition to a many-body localized phase. Drude weights are proportional to the spectral curvatures induced by magnetic fluxes in mesoscopic rings. They offer a method to relate the transition to the many-body localized phase to transport properties. In the delocalized regime, we find that the Drude weight distribution at a fixed disorder configuration agrees well with the random-matrix-theory prediction $P(D) \propto (\gamma^2+D^2)^{-3/2}$, although the distribution width $\gamma$ strongly fluctuates between disorder realizations. A crossover is observed towards a distribution with different large-$D$ asymptotics deep in the many-body localized phase. We show that the average distribution width, an estimate for the typical magnitude of Drude weights, decays exponentially for increasing system size in this phase.
