abstract: We review the geometrical formulation of Quantum Mechanics to identify, according to Klein's programme, the corresponding group of transformations. For closed systems, it is the unitary group. For open quantum systems, the semigroup of Kraus maps contains, as a maximal subgroup, the general linear group. The same group emerges as the exponentiation of the $C^{*}$--algebra associated with the quantum system, when thought of as a Lie algebra. Thus, open quantum systems seem to identify the general linear group as associated with quantum mechanics and moreover suggest to extend the Klein programme also to groupoids. The usual unitary group emerges as a maximal compact subgroup of the general linear group.

abstract: We present a scheme to generate entangled photons using the NV centers in diamond. We show how the long-lived nuclear spin in diamond can mediate entanglement between multiple photons thereby increasing the length of entangled photon string. With the proposed scheme one could generate both n-photon GHZ and cluster states. We present an experimental scheme realizing the same and estimating the rate of entanglement generation both in the presence and absence of a cavity.

abstract: The concept of non-Markovianity (NM) in quantum dynamics is still an open debate. Understanding how to generate and measure NM in specific models may aid in this quest. In quantum optics, an engineered electromagnetic environment coupled to a single atom can induce NM. The most common scenario of structured electromagnetic environment is an optical cavity, composed by a pair of mirrors. Here, we show how to generate and measure NM on a two-level system coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide with no mirrors required. The origin of the non-Markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field, prepared as a single-photon packet. We analyze how NM depends on two experimentally controllable parameters, namely, the linewidth of the packet and its central frequency. We relate the presence of NM to a $\pi$-phase shift between incoming and emitted fields. We also show how the two output channels of the waveguide provide distinct signatures of NM, both experimentally accessible.

abstract: We show that single-slit two-photon ghost diffraction can be explained very simply by using a wave-packet evolution of a generalised EPR state. Diffraction of a wave travelling in the x-direction can be described in terms of the spreading in time of the transverse (z-direction) wave-packet, within the Fresnel approximation. The slit is assumed to truncate the transverse part of the wavefunction of the photon to within the width of the slit. The analysis reproduces all features of the two-photon single-slit ghost diffraction.

abstract: An on-demand single photon source is a key element in a series of prospective quantum technologies and applications. We demonstrate the operation of a tuneable on-demand microwave photon source based on a fully controllable superconducting artificial atom strongly coupled to an open-end transmission line (a 1D half-space). The atom emits a photon upon excitation by a short microwave $\pi$-pulse applied through a control line weakly coupled to the atom. The emission and control lines are well decoupled from each other, preventing the direct leakage of radiation from the $\pi$-pulses used for excitation. The estimated efficiency of the source is higher than 75\% and remains to be about 50\% or higher over a wide frequency range from 6.7 to 9.1 GHz continuously tuned by an external magnetic field.

abstract: We use photon pairs hyperentangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum to implement a novel entanglement-enhanced quantum state communication technique, known as SuperDense Teleportation, to communicate a specific class of single-photon ququart states between two remote parties, with an average fidelity of 87.0(1)%, almost twice the classical limit of 44%. We compare this technique with quantum teleportation and remote state preparation and show that SuperDense teleportation requires less classical information and fewer experimental resources. We discuss the information content of this constrained set of states and demonstrate that this set has an exponentially larger state space volume than the lower dimensional general states with the same number of state parameters.

abstract: The spatial modes of light have grasped great research interests because of its great potentials in optical communications, optical manipulation and trapping, optical metrology and quantum information processing. Here we report on generating of photon pairs in Hermite-Gaussian (HG) mode in a type-I optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operated far below threshold. The bandwidths of the photon pairs are 11.4 MHz and 20.8MHz for two different HG modes respectively, which is capable to be stored in cold Rubidium atomic ensembles. From correlation measurements, non-classical properties of HG modes in different directions are verified by tuning the cavity. Our study provides an effective way to generate photon pairs with narrow bandwidth in high order spatial modes for high dimensional quantum communication.

abstract: A large number of inequalities have been proposed for the detection of bipartite continuous variable entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Many of these are based on either measured or inferred variances and are relatively easily measured via homodyne detection of optical outputs. In this work we examine a number of bipartite inequalities in the process of cascaded downconversion and sum-frequency generation inside an optical cavity. This has previously been predicted to be a potential source of continuous-variable tripartite entanglement, therefore we know that there are no separable bipartitions. In this work we investigate the performance of the chosen inequalities in the stable, below threshold regime. We show that detection of the existing entanglement is sensitive to the actual inequalities chosen, with some criteria missing it completely. Our results are explained by the fact that violation of the chosen inequalities is sufficient but not necessary to demonstrate the non-classical relationships between the modes, and highlights the outstanding problem of developing a reliable continuous-variable entanglement measure.

abstract: Progress in quantum simulation has fostered the research on far-from-equilibrium dynamics. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism is the paradigmatic framework to account for the non adiabatic critical dynamics of a system driven across a phase transition in a finite time. Its study in the quantum regime is hindered by the requisite of ground state cooling. We report the experimental quantum simulation of critical dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model by a set of non-equilibrium processes in the pseudo-momentum space, that can be probed with high accuracy using a single trapped ion. Our results support the validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the quantum regime and advance the quantum simulation of critical systems far-away from equilibrium.

abstract: We study quantum teleportation via Bell-diagonal mixed states of two qubits in the context of the intrinsic properties of the quantum discord. We show that when the quantum-correlated state of the two qubits is used for quantum teleportation the character of the teleportation efficiency changes substantially depending on the Bell-diagonal-state parameters, which can be seen when the worst-case-scenario or best-case-scenario fidelity is studied. Depending on the parameter range, one of two types of single qubit states is hardest/easiest to teleport. The transition between these two parameter ranges coincides exactly with the transition between the range of classical correlation decay and quantum correlation decay characteristic for the evolution of the quantum discord. The correspondence provides a physical interpretation for the prominent feature of the decay of the quantum discord.

abstract: We investigate non-Markovianity measure using two-time correlation functions for open quantum systems. We define non-Markovianity measure as the difference between the exact two-time correlation function and the one obtained in the Markov limit. Such non-Markovianity measure can easily be measured in experiments. We found that the non-Markovianity dynamics in different time scale crucially depends on the system-environment coupling strength and other physical parameters such as the initial temperature of the environment and the initial state of the system. In particular, we obtain the short-time and long-time behaviors of non-Markovianity for different spectral densities. We also find that the thermal fluctuation always reduce the non-Markovian memory effect. Also, the non-Markovianity measure shows non-trivial initial state dependence in different time scales.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new interferometry paradigm: a self-interfering clock. We split a clock into two spatially separated wave packets, and observe an interference pattern with a stable phase showing that the splitting was coherent, i.e., the clock was in two places simultaneously. We then make the clock wave packets "tick" at different rates to simulate a proper time lag. The entanglement between the clock's time and its path yields "which path" information, which affects the visibility of the clock's self-interference. By contrast, in standard interferometry, time cannot yield "which path" information. As a clock we use an atom prepared in a superposition of two spin states. This first proof-of-principle experiment may have far-reaching implications for the study of time and general relativity and their impact on fundamental quantum effects such as decoherence and wave packet collapse.

abstract: We introduce a method of characterization of non-Markovianity using coherence of a system interacting with the environment. We show that under the allowed incoherent operations, monotonicity of a valid coherence measure is affected due to non-Markovian features of the system-environment evolution. We also define a measure to quantify non-Markovianity of the underlying dynamics based on the non-monotonic behavior of the coherence measure. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity marker in the behavior of dephasing and dissipative dynamics for one and two qubit cases. We also show that our proposed measure captures the back-flow of information from the environment to the system and compatible with well known distinguishability criteria of non-Markovianity.

abstract: A complex quantum system can be constructed by coupling simple quantum elements to one another. For example, trapped-ion or superconducting quantum bits may be coupled by Coulomb interactions, mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. Alternatively quantum objects can be coupled by the exchange of real photons, particularly when driven within resonators that amplify interactions with a single electro-magnetic mode. However, in such an open system, the capacity of a coupling channel to convey quantum information or generate entanglement may be compromised. Here, we realize phase-coherent interactions between two spatially separated, near-ground-state mechanical oscillators within a driven optical cavity. We observe also the noise imparted by the optical coupling, which results in correlated mechanical fluctuations of the two oscillators. Achieving the quantum backaction dominated regime opens the door to numerous applications of cavity optomechanics with a complex mechanical system. Our results thereby illustrate the potential, and also the challenge, of coupling quantum objects with light.

abstract: The results of a study of Dirac's Hamiltonian for a point electron in the zero-gravity Kerr--Newman spacetime are reported; here, "zero-gravity" means G to 0, where G is Newton's constant of universal gravitation, and the limit is effected in the Boyer--Lindquist coordinate chart of the maximal analytically extended, topologically nontrivial, Kerr--Newman spacetime. In a nutshell, the results are: the essential self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian; the reflection symmetry about zero of its spectrum; the location of the essential spectrum, exhibiting a gap about zero; and (under two smallness assumptions on some parameters) the existence of a point spectrum in this gap, corresponding to bound states of Dirac's point electron in the electromagnetic field of the zero-G Kerr--Newman ring singularity. The symmetry result of the spectrum extends to Dirac's Hamiltonian for a point electron in a generalization of the zero-G Kerr--Newman spacetime with different ratio of electric-monopole to magnetic-dipole moment. The results are discussed in the context of the general-relativistic Hydrogen problem. Also, some interesting projects for further inquiry are listed in the last section.

Experiments that allow for the creation of structurally pure samples and the investigation of their molecular dynamics and chemical function have developed tremendeously over the last few decades, although "there's plenty of room at the bottom" for better control as well as further applications. Here, we describe the use of inhomogeneous electric fields for the manipulation of neutral molecules in the gas-phase, \ie, for the separation of complex molecules according to size, structural isomer, and quantum state. Current applications of these controlled samples are summarized and interesting future applications discussed.

abstract: We study the transmission probability in an AB-stacked bilayer graphene of Dirac fermions scattered by a double barrier structure in the presence of a magnetic field. We take into account the full four bands of the energy spectrum and use the boundary conditions to determine the transmission probability. Our numerical results show that for energies higher than the interlayer coupling, four ways for transmission probabilities are possible while for energies less than the height of the barrier, Dirac fermions exhibits transmission resonances and only one transmission channel is available. We show that, for AB-stacked bilayer graphene, there is no Klein tunneling at normal incident. We find that the transmission displays sharp peaks inside the transmission gap around the Dirac point within the barrier regions while they are absent around the Dirac point in the well region. The effect of the magnetic field, interlayer electrostatic potential and various barrier geometry parameters on the transmission probabilities are also discussed.

abstract: Although the general theory macroscopic quantum entanglement of is still in its infancy, consideration of the matter in the framework of action-at-a distance electrodynamics predicts for the random dissipative processes observability of the advanced nonlocal correlations. These correlations were really revealed in our previous experiments with some large-scale heliogeophysical processes as the source ones and the lab detectors as the probe ones. Recently a new experiment has been performing on the base of Baikal Deep Water Neutrino Observatory. The thick water layer is an excellent shield against any local impacts on the detectors. The first annual series 2012/2013 has demonstrated that detector signals respond to the heliogeophysical processes and causal connection of the signals directed downwards: from the Earth surface to the Baikal floor. But this nonlocal connection proved to be in reverse time. In addition advanced nonlocal correlation of the detector signal with the regional source-process: the random component of hydrological activity in the upper layer was revealed and the possibility of its forecast on nonlocal correlations was demonstrated. But the strongest macroscopic nonlocal correlations are observed at extremely low frequencies, that is at periods of several months. Therefore the above results should be verified in a longer experiment. We verify them by data of the second annual series 2013/2014 of the Baikal experiment. All the results have been confirmed, although some quantitative parameters of correlations and time reversal causal links turned out different due to nonstationarity of the source-processes. A new result is displaying of the advanced response of nonlocal correlation detector to the earthquake. This opens up the prospect of the earthquake forecast on the new physical principle, although further confirmation in the next events is certainly needed.

abstract: Magnetized neutron stars constitute a special class of compact objects harbouring gravitational fields that deviate strongly from the Newtonian weak field limit. Moreover strong electromagnetic fields anchored into the star give rise to non-linear corrections to Maxwell equations described by quantum electrodynamics (QED). Electromagnetic fields close to or above the critical value of $\BQ=4.4\times10^9$~T are probably present in some pulsars and for most of the magnetars. To account properly for emission emanating from the neutron star surface like for instance thermal radiation and its polarization properties, it is important to include general relativistic (GR) effects simultaneously with non-linear electrodynamics. This can be achieved through a 3+1 formalism known in general relativity and that incorporates QED perturbations to Maxwell equations. Starting from the lowest order corrections to the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field, as given for instance by Born-Infeld or Euler-Heisenberg theory, we derive the non-linear Maxwell equations in general relativity including quantum vacuum effects. We also derive a prescription for the force-free limit and show that these equations can be solved with classical finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. It is therefore straightforward to include general relativity and quantum electrodynamics in the description of neutron star magnetospheres by using standard classical numerical techniques borrowed from Maxwell and Newton theory. As an application, we show that spin-down luminosity corrections associated to QED effects are negligible with respect to GR corrections.
