abstract: To evade the well-known impossibility of unconditionally secure quantum two-party computations, previous quantum private comparison protocols have to adopt a third party. Here we study how far we can go with two parties only. We propose a very feasible and efficient protocol. Intriguingly, although the average amount of information leaked cannot be made arbitrarily small, we find that it never exceeds 14 bits for any length of the bit-string being compared.

abstract: We propose and examine the use of biphoton pairs, such as those created in parametric down conversion or four-wave mixing, to enhance the precision and the resolution of measuring optical displacements by position-sensitive detection. We show that the precision of measuring a small optical beam displacement with this method can be significantly enhanced by the correlation between the two photons, given the same optical mode. The improvement is largest if the correlations between the photons are strong, and falls off as the biphoton correlation weakens. More surprisingly, we find that the smallest resolvable parameter of a simple split detector scales as the inverse of the number of biphotons for small biphoton number ("Heisenberg scaling"), because the Fisher information diverges as the parameter to be estimated decreases in value. One usually sees this scaling only for systems with many entangled degrees of freedom. We discuss the transition for the split-detection scheme to the standard quantum limit scaling for imperfect correlations as the biphoton number is increased. An analysis of an $N$-pixel detector is also given to investigate the benefit of using a higher resolution detector. The physical limit of these metrology schemes is determined by the uncertainty in the birth zone of the biphoton in the nonlinear crystal.

abstract: The quantumness of a generic state is the resource of many applications in quantum information theory and it is interesting to survey the measures which are able to detect its trace in the properties of the state. In this work we study the quantum discord and fully entangled fraction of two classes of bipartite states and compare their behaviors. These classes are complements to the $d\otimes d$ Werner and isotropic states, in the sense that each class possesses the same purification as the corresponding complemental class of states. Our results show that maximally entangled mixed states are also maximally discordant states, leading to a generalization of the well-known fact that all maximally entangled pure states have also maximum quantum discord. Moreover, it is shown that the separability-entanglement boundary of a Werner or isotropic state is manifested as an inflection point in the diagram of quantum discord of the corresponding complemental state.

abstract: Fermi's golden rule is of great importance in quantum dynamics. However, in many textbooks on quantum mechanics, its content and limitation are obscured by the approximations and arguments in the derivation, which are inevitable because of the generic setting considered. Here we propose to introduce it by an ideal model, in which the quasi-continuum band consists of equaldistant levels extending from $-\infty $ to $+\infty $, and each of them couples to the discrete level with the same strength. For this model, the transition probability in the first order perturbation approximation can be calculated analytically by invoking the Poisson summation formula. It turns out to be a \emph{piecewise linear} function of time, demonstrating on one hand the key features of Fermi's golden rule, and on the other hand that the rule breaks down beyond the Heisenberg time, even when the first order perturbation approximation itself is still valid.

abstract: We investigate the ground state behavior of the Dicke-Hubbard model including counter-rotating-terms. By developing an extended coherent state approach within mean-field theory, we self-consistently obtain the ground state energy and delocalized order parameter. Particularly, localization-delocalization quantum phase transition of photons is clearly observed by breaking the parity symmetry, which is in sharp contrast to the Dicke-Hubbard model under rotating-wave approximation. The corresponding phase boundaries are stabilized in the weak inter-site photon hopping limit, which makes it easier to detect the critical behaviors, compared to the Rabi-Hubbard model. Moreover, we find that concurrence is greatly enhanced as the order parameter emerges, which implies a promising way to detect the criticality by utilizing quantum entanglement.

abstract: Quasiprobability representations, such as the Wigner function, play an important role in various research areas. The inevitable appearance of negativity in such representations is often regarded as a signature of nonclassicality, which also has profound implications for quantum computation. However, little is known about the minimal negativity that is necessary in general quasiprobability representations. Here we focus on a natural class of quasiprobability representations that is distinguished by simplicity and economy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the representations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum channels, respectively. Quite surprisingly, all three measures lead to the same representations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the elusive symmetric informationally complete measurements. In addition, most representations with minimal negativity are automatically covariant with respect to the Heisenberg-Weyl groups. Furthermore, our study reveals an interesting tradeoff between negativity and symmetry in quasiprobability representations.

abstract: Violation of the action-reaction principle is shown to occur in the van der Waals interaction between two atoms, one of which is excited. It is accompanied by the transfer of linear momentum to the electromagnetic vacuum. The vacuum momentum results from the asymmetric interference of the virtual photons scattered off each atom along the interatomic direction, which is in itself a manifestation of the optical theorem. This momentum, of equal strength and opposite direction to the momentum gained by the two-atom system, is ultimately released through directional spontaneous emission. A quantitative prediction of this phenomenon is made in a two-alkali atom system. It is conjectured that action-reaction violation takes place in any asymmetrically excited system.

abstract: We develop a systematic method for deriving a quantum optical multi-mode Hamiltonian for the interaction of photons and phonons in nanophotonic dielectric materials by applying perturbation theory to the electromagnetic Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian covers radiation pressure and electrostrictive interactions on equal footing. As a paradigmatic example, we apply our method to a cylindrical nanoscale waveguide, and derive a Hamiltonian description of Brillouin quantum optomechanics. We show that in nanoscale waveguides radiation pressure dominates over electrostriction, in agreement with recent experimental observations. The calculated photon-phonon coupling parameters are used to infer gain parameters of Stokes Brillouin scattering in good agreement with experimental observations.

abstract: The quantum backflow effect is a counterintuitive behavior of the probability current of a free particle, which may be negative even for states with vanishing negative momentum component. Here we address the notion of nonclassicality arising from the backflow effect, i.e. from the negativity of the probability current, and analyze its relationships with the notion of nonclassicality based on the negativity of the Wigner function. Our results suggest that backflow is linked to a different, and in fact more restrictive, notion of nonclassicality, the negativity of the Wigner function being only a necessary prerequisite for its occurrence. This hierarchical structure may be confirmed by looking at the addition of thermal noise, which more easily destroys the negativity of the probability current than the negativity of the Wigner function itself.

abstract: Pure dephasing processes limit the fidelities achievable in driven-dissipative schemes for stabilization of entangled states of qubits. We propose a scheme which, combined with already existing entangling methods, purifies the desired entangled state by driving out of equilibrium auxiliary dissipative cavity modes coupled to the qubits. We lay out the specifics of our scheme and compute its efficiency in the particular context of two superconducting qubits in a cavity-QED architecture, where the strongly coupled auxiliary modes provided by collective cavity excitations can drive and sustain the qubits in maximally entangled Bell states with fidelities reaching 90 percent for experimentally accessible parameters.

abstract: We study a restricted class of correlator product states (CPS) for a spin-half chain in which each spin is contained in just two overlapping plaquettes. This class is also a restriction upon matrix product states (MPS) with local dimension $2^n$ ($n$ being the size of the overlapping regions of plaquettes) equal to the bond dimension. We investigate the trade-off between gains in efficiency due to this restriction against losses in fidelity. The time-dependent variational principle formulated for these states is numerically very stable. Moreover, it shows significant gains in efficiency compared to the naively related matrix product states - the evolution or optimisation scales as $2^{3n}$ for the correlator product states versus $2^{4n}$ for the unrestricted matrix product state. However, much of this advantage is offset by a significant reduction in fidelity. Correlator product states break the local Hilbert space symmetry by the explicit selection of a local basis. We investigate this dependence in detail and formulate the broad principles under which correlator product states may be a useful tool. In particular, we find that scaling with overlap/bond order may be more stable with correlator product states allowing a more efficient extraction of critical exponents - we present an example in which the use of correlator product states is several orders of magnitude quicker than matrix product states.

abstract: We present a proposal of a set-up to measure the work distribution due to an arbitrary unitary process acting on the spatial transverse degrees of freedom of a light beam. Hermite-Gaussian optical modes representing a quantum harmonic oscillator are prepared in a thermal state and sent through an interferometer. We show that the Fourier transform of the work distribution, or the characteristic function, can be obtained by measuring the intensity at the output of the interferometer. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by calculating the work distribution for a unitary operation that displaces the linear momentum of the oscillator. We discuss the feasibility of the experiment, which can be realized with simple linear optical components.

We show that the noise addition increases wave packet spreading rate, which has a significant influence on flux amplitude and may play both destructive and constructive role. This depends on the form and amplitude of external deterministic field.

abstract: We discuss the realization of quantum advantage in a system without quantum entanglement but with non-zero quantum discord. We propose an optical realization of symmetric two-qubit $X$-states with controllable anti-diagonal elements. This approach does not requires initially entangled states, and it can generate states that have quantum discord, with or without entanglement. We discuss how quantum advantage can be attained in the context of a two-qubit game. We show that when entanglement is not present, the maximum quantum advantage is 1/3 bit. A comparable quantum advantage, 0.311 bit, can be realized with a simplified transaction protocol involving one vs. the three unitary operations needed for the maximum advantage.

abstract: We solve the problem of estimating the angular or linear separation between two point-like sources emitting light in an arbitrary state, by using a diffraction-limited linear-optical imaging device in the paraxial approximation. First we show that this problem is formally equivalent to the estimation of the loss parameters of two lossy bosonic channels, i.e., the transmissivities of two beam splitters. Then we determine the sources whose separation can be estimated optimally. We find that entangled sources can be super-resolved at the sub-Rayleigh scale and that the ultimate precision bound scales with the number of collected photons according to the standard quantum limit.

abstract: We introduce the notion of a small quantum world (SQW) , which in our opinion, is very helpful in the situations when an experimenter's tools for preparing quantum states and (or) for measuring the observables of a quantum system under study are restricted due to some kind of reasons. In this case it is advisable to use as original an appropriate subspace of complete Hilbert space of states and respectively to utilize observables acting only in this subspace. If this subspace possesses some additional symmetries, the structure of a pure states set, as a rule, is simpler by far than in general case. Moreover in such SQWs some specific irreducible entangled states may appear. The similar states could be very helpful in various tasks connected with quantum informational applications. In the present paper main ideas outlined above are developed in detail in the simple and instructive case of a two-qubit system in which the accessible space of states possesses the additional symmetry structure of permutation group of three elements.

abstract: The last two decades have witnessed tremendous advancements in the area of nanophotonics and plasmonics. Undoubtedly, the introduction of metallic structures has opened a path towards light con?nement and manipulation at the subwavelength scale { a regime that was previously thought to be out of reach in optics. Of central importance is to devise e?cient light sources to power up the future nanoscale optical circuits. Coaxial resonators can provide a platform to implement such subwavelength sources. They support ultrasmall cavity modes and o?er large mode-emitter overlap as well as multifold scalability. Given their large modulation bandwidth, they hold promise for high speed optical interconnects { where they can be used for light generation and modulation simultaneously. In addition, the possibility of thresholdless operation in such devices may have implications in developing the next generation of e?cient lighting systems. In this review article, the physics and applications of coaxial nanolasers will be discussed.

abstract: In systems that exhibit an excited state quantum phase (ESQPT), the ground state quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs in parallel with a singularity in the energy spectrum. This corresponds to a local divergence in the density of states that propagates to higher energies as the control parameter increases beyond the ground state critical point. The analysis of the spectrum has been a main tool for the detection of an ESQPT. Studies of the effects of this transition on the system dynamics are more limited. Here, we extend our previous works and show that the evolution of an initial state with energy close to the ESQPT critical point may be extremely slow. This result is surprising, because it may take place in systems with long-range interactions, where the dynamics is usually expected to be very fast. A timely example is the one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with infinite-range Ising interaction in a transverse field, accessible to experiments with ion traps. Its Hamiltonian has a U(2) algebraic structure. More generally, ESPQTs can occur in any U(v+1) Hamiltonian that exhibits a QPT between its limiting U(v) and SO(v+1) dynamical symmetries. In this work, we compare the results for v=1, 2, and 3. They represent, respectively, the one-, two-, and three-dimensional limits of the molecular vibron model.

abstract: The reflectivity properties of graphene with nonzero mass-gap parameter are investigated in the framework of Dirac model using the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. For this purpose, a more simple explicit representation for the polarization tensor along the real frequency axis is found. The approximate analytic expressions for the polarization tensor and for the reflectivities of graphene are obtained in different frequency regions at any temperature. We show that the nonzero mass-gap parameter has a profound effect on the reflectivity of graphene. Specifically, at zero temperature the reflectivity of gapped graphene goes to zero with vanishing frequency. At nonzero temperature the same reflectivities are equal to unity at zero frequency. We also find the resonance behavior of the reflectivities of gapped graphene at both zero and nonzero temperature at the border frequency determined by the width of the gap. At nonzero temperature the reflectifities of graphene drop to zero in the vicinity of some frequency smaller than the border frequency. Our analytic results are accompanied with numerical computations performed over a wide frequency region. The developed formalism can be used in devising nanoscale optical detectors, optoelectronic switches and in other optical applications of graphene.

Here, instead, we develop a different set of q-Gamow states for which the associated q-Breit-Wigner distribution could easily be found at intermediate energies, for which accelerators are available at many locations. In this context, it should be strongly emphasized [Physica A {\bf 388} (2009) 601] that, empirically, one never exactly and unambiguously "detects" pure Gaussians, but rather q-Gaussians. A prediction is made via Eq.(3.30)

abstract: Coherent conversion of photons to magnons, and back, provides a natural mechanism for rapid control of interactions between stationary spins with long coherence times and high-speed photons. Despite the large frequency difference between optical photons and magnons, coherent conversion can be achieved through a three-particle interaction between one magnon and two photons whose frequency difference is resonant with the magnon frequency, as in optomechanics with two photons and a phonon. The large spin density of a transparent ferromagnetic insulator (such as the ferrite yttrium iron garnet) in an optical cavity provides an intrinsic photon-magnon coupling strength that we calculate to exceed reported optomechanical couplings. A large cavity photon number and properly selected cavity detuning produce a predicted effective coupling strength sufficient for observing electromagnetically induced transparency and the Purcell effect, and even to reach the ultra-strong coupling regime.

We describe the spin dynamics in quantum dots by the central spin model. We use analytic solutions for uniform couplings and the time dependent density-matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) for non-uniform couplings. With these tools we calculate the dynamics of the central spin for large baths of nuclear spins with or without external magnetic field applied to the central spin. The focus of our study is the influence of initial mixtures with narrowed distributions of the Overhauser field and of applied magnetic fields on the decoherence of the central spin.

abstract: Bad cavity lasers are experiencing renewed interest in the context of active optical frequency standards, due to their enhanced robustness against fluctuations of the laser cavity. The gain medium would consist of narrow-linewidth atoms, either trapped inside the cavity or intersecting the cavity mode dynamically. A finite velocity distribution, atomic interactions, or interactions of realistic multilevel atoms with external field leads to an inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic gain profile. This can bring the bad cavity laser to operate in unstable regimes characterized by complex temporal patterns of the field amplitude. We present a new and efficient method for the stability analysis of bad cavity lasers with inhomogeneously broadened gain. We apply this method to identify the steady-state solutions for the metrology-relevant case of spin-1/2 atoms interacting with an external magnetic field.

abstract: Direct dynamics methods using Gaussian wavepackets have to rely only on local properties, such as gradients and hessians at the center of the wavepacket, so as to be compatible with the usual quantum chemistry methods. Matrix elements of the potential energy surfaces between wavepackets therefore usually have to be approximated. It is shown, that if a modified form of valence bond theory is used instead of the usual MO-based theories, the matrix elements can be obtained exactly. This is so because the molecular Hamiltonian only contains the Coulomb potential, for which matrix elements between different basis functions (consisting of Gaussian nuclear and electronic orbitals) are all well-known. In valence bond theory the self-consistent field calculation can be avoided so that the matrix elements are analytical functions of the nuclear coordinates. A method for simulating non-adiabatic quantum dynamics is sketched, where coherent state trajectories are propagated "on the fly" on adiabatic potential energy surfaces without making approximations to the matrix elements responsible for the coupling between trajectories.

abstract: An $n\times n$ matrix $X$ is called completely positive semidefinite (cpsd) if there exist $d\times d$ Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ (for some $d\ge 1$) such that $X_{ij}= {\rm Tr}(P_iP_j),$ for all $i,j \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the smallest $d\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we initiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the cpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank of a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is physically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a quantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior. In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the completely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix, no general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we show that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically, for any $n\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz cone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the connection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a known lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum correlations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional elliptope. Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every doubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a graph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a subgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs.

abstract: Recent experiments on silicon nanostructures have seen breakthroughs toward scalable, long-lived quantum information processing. The valley degree of freedom plays a fundamental role in these devices, and the two lowest-energy electronic states of a silicon quantum dot can form a valley qubit. In this work, we show that a single-atom high step at the silicon/barrier interface induces a strong interaction of the qubit and in-plane electric fields, and analyze the consequences of this enhanced interaction on the dynamics of the qubit. The charge densities of the qubit states are deformed differently by the interface step, allowing non-demolition qubit readout via valley-to-charge conversion. A gate-induced in-plane electric field together with the interface step enables fast control of the valley qubit via electrically driven valley resonance. We calculate single- and two-qubit gate times, as well as relaxation and dephasing times, and present predictions for the parameter range where the gate times can be much shorter than the relaxation time and dephasing is reduced.

abstract: Geometric entanglement(GE), as a measure of multipartite entanglement, has been investigated as a universal tool to detect phase transitions in quantum many-body lattice models. We outline a systematic method to compute GE for two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body lattice models based on the translational invariant structure of infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) representations. By employing this method, the $q$-state quantum Potts model on the square lattice with $q \in \{2, 3 ,4, 5\}$ is investigated as a prototypical example. Further, we have explored three 2D Heisenberg models, such as the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXX and antiferromagnetic anisotropic XYX models in an external magnetic field, and the spin-1 antiferromagnetic XXZ model. We find that continuous GE does not guarantee a continuous phase transition across a phase transition point. We observe and thus classify three different types of continuous GE across a phase transition point: (i) GE is continuous with maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous, (ii) GE is continuous with maximum value at the transition point but the phase transition is discontinuous, and (iii) GE is continuous with non-maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous. For the models under consideration we find that the second and the third types are related to a point of dual symmetry and a fully polarized phase, respectively.
