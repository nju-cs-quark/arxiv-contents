abstract: Interference between independent single photons is perhaps the most fundamental interaction in quantum optics. It has become increasingly important as a tool for optical quantum information science, as one of the rudimentary quantum operations, together with photon detection, for generating entanglement between non-interacting particles. Despite this, demonstrations of large-scale photonic networks involving more than two independent sources of quantum light have been limited due to the difficulty in constructing large arrays of high-quality single photon sources. Here, we solve the key challenge, reporting a novel array of more than eighteen near-identical, low-loss, high-purity, heralded single photon sources achieved using spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) on a silica chip. We verify source quality through a series of heralded Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments, and further report the experimental three-photon extension of the entire Hong-Ou-Mandel interference curves, which map out the interference landscape between three independent single photon sources for the first time.

abstract: We study a quantum algorithm that consists of a simple quantum Markov process, and we analyze its behavior on restricted versions of Quantum 2-SAT. We prove that the algorithm solves this decision problem with high probability for n qubits, L clauses, and promise gap c in time O(n^2 L^2 c^{-2}). If the Hamiltonian is additionally polynomially gapped, our algorithm efficiently produces a state that has high overlap with the satisfying subspace. The Markov process we study is a quantum analogue of Sch\"oning's probabilistic algorithm for k-SAT.

abstract: From Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80(1998)4999] one knows that the quantum states secretly chosen from a certain set can be probabilistically cloned with positive cloning efficiencies if and only if all the states in the set are linearly independent. In this paper, we focus on the probabilistic quantum cloning (PQC) of linearly dependent states with nonnegative cloning efficiencies. We show that a linearly independent subset of the linearly dependent quantum states can be probabilistically cloned if and only if any one state in the subset can not be expressed as the linear superposition of the other states in the set. The optimal possible cloning efficiencies are also investigated.

abstract: The one- and two-photon scattering matrix S is obtained analytically for a one-dimensional waveguide a point-like scatterer with N excited levels (generalized V -type atom). We compute the two photon resonance fluorescence. We argue that a two-photon input state contains sufficient information to distinguish between different level structures which are equivalent for single-photon scattering, such as an atom with N = 2 excited levels and two two-level systems (2LS). Finally, we find two-photon Electromagnetic Induced Transparency (EIT), where the nonlinear part of the two-photon scattering matrix vanishes as each incident photon fulfills single-photon EIT conditions.

abstract: We present two results which combined enable one to reliably detect multimode, multipartite entanglement in the presence of measurement errors. The first result leads to a method to compute the best (approximated) physical covariance matrix given a measured non-physical one. The other result states that a widely used entanglement condition is a consequence of negativity of partial transposition. Our approach can quickly verify entanglement of experimentally obtained multipartite states, which is demonstrated on several realistic examples. Compared to existing detection schemes, ours is very simple and efficient. In particular, it does not require any complicated optimizations.

abstract: Quantum coherent feedback control is a measurement-free control method fully preserving quantum coherence. In this paper we show how time-delayed quantum coherent feedback can be used to control the degree of squeezing in the output field of a cavity containing a degenerate parametric oscillator. We focus on the specific situation of Pyragas-type feedback control where time-delayed signals are fed back directly into the quantum system. Our results show how time-delayed feedback can enhance or decrease the degree of squeezing as a function of time delay and feedback strength.

abstract: We introduce a new aspect of nonlocality which arises when the task of quantum states distinguishability is considered under local operations and shared entanglement in the absence of classical communication. We find the optimal amount of entanglement required to accomplish the task perfectly for sets of orthogonal states and argue that it quantifies information nonlocality.

abstract: Nanomechanical resonators strongly coupled to the electromagnetic field are a promising resource for quantum-limited mass and force sensors, and as transducers for coupling otherwise incompatible quantum systems such as microwave and optical photons. In particular, suspended nanomem-branes obtained by chemical release of a high-tensile stress layer are an advantageous platform for such transducers, combining an extremely high mechanical quality factor and a low mass. We demonstrate the successful implementation of a photonic-crystal reflector on a high-tensile stress $Si\_3N\_4$ nanomembrane, enabling its direct coupling to a high-finesse optical cavity. This approach is particularly well suited for hybrid opto-electro-mechanical transducers, where the membrane motion is simultaneously coupled to an optical and a microwave cavity. We provide an illustration of the physical process underlying the high reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the photonic-crystal membrane inside a high-finesse cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.79 $\pm$ 0.02%, and show that the material absorption is not the main source of optical losses.

abstract: We study the coherent dynamics of a two-level parabolic model and ways to enhance population transfer and even to obtain complete population inversion in such models. Motivated by the complete population inversion effect of zero-area pulses found in [1], we consider a scheme where a given coupling function is transformed to a zero-area coupling by performing phase-jump in the middle of the evolution. We also derive a universal formula for the effect of the phase-jump.

abstract: We investigate the maximum rates for transmitting quantum information, distilling entanglement and distributing secret keys between a sender and a receiver in a multipoint communication scenario, with the assistance of unlimited two-way classical communication involving all parties. First we consider the case where a sender communicates with an arbitrary number of receivers, so called quantum broadcast channel. Here we also provide a simple analysis in the bosonic setting where we consider quantum broadcasting through a sequence of beamsplitters. Then, we consider the opposite case where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with a single receiver, so called quantum multiple-access channel. Finally, we study the general case of a quantum interference channel where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with an arbitrary number of receivers. Since our bounds are formulated for quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, they can be applied to many different physical scenarios involving multipoint quantum communication.

abstract: This article sets up a new formalism to investigate stochastic thermodynamics of out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, where stochasticity primarily comes from quantum measurement. In the absence of any bath, we define a purely quantum component to heat exchange, that corresponds to energy fluctuations induced by measurement back-action. By providing a central position to quantum measurement, our formalism bridges the gap between quantum optics and quantum thermodynamics: Thermal signatures of measurement induced irreversibility are identified in a simple implementation of Jarzynski equality, while quantum thermodynamics sheds new light on textbook paradoxical trajectories in quantum optics.

abstract: Equidistant and non-equidistant single pulse "bang-bang" dynamical controls are investigated in the context of mean ergodic theorems. We show the requirements in which the limit of infinite pulse control for both the equidistant and the non-equidistant dynamical control converges to the same unitary evolution. It is demonstrated that the generator of this evolution can be obtained by projecting the generator of the free evolution onto the commutant of the unitary operator representing the pulse. Inequalities are derived to prove this statement and in the case of non-equidistant approach these inequalities are optimised as a function of the time intervals.

abstract: The sensitivity of classical and quantum sensing is impaired in a noisy environment. Thus, one of the main challenges facing sensing protocols is to reduce the noise while preserving the signal. State of the art quantum sensing protocols that rely on dynamical decoupling achieve this goal under the restriction of long noise correlation times. We implement a proof of principle experiment of a protocol to recover sensitivity by using an error correction for photonic systems that does not have this restriction. The protocol uses a protected entangled qubit to correct a bit-flip error. Our results show a recovery of about 87% of the sensitivity, independent of the noise rate.

abstract: We discuss a model of quantum photosynthesis with degeneracy in the light-harvesting system. We consider interaction of excitons in chromophores with light and phonons (vibrations of environment). These interactions have dipole form but are different (are related to non-parallel vectors of "bright" states). We show that this leads to excitation of non-decaying "dark" states. We discuss relation of this model to the known from spectroscopical experiments phenomenon of existence of photonic echo in quantum photosynthesis.

The observed rapid decay rate is accompanied by its counterpart, the cooperative Lamb shift. The rate of the strongly directional decay, and the associated shift, scale linearly with the number of atoms and show a strong dependence on the sample shape, demonstrating the collective nature of the observed quantities.
