abstract: We systematically study several classical-quantum correspondence properties of the dissipative modified kicked rotator, a paradigmatic ratchet model. We explore the behavior of the asymptotic currents for finite $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ values in a wide range of the parameter space. We find that the correspondence between the classical currents with thermal noise providing uctuations of size $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ and the quantum ones without it, is very good in general with the exception of specific regions. We systematically consider the spectra of the corresponding classical Perron-Frobenius operators and quantum superoperators. By means of an average distance between the classical and quantum sets of eigenvalues we find that the correspondence is unexpectedly quite uniform. This apparent contradiction is solved with the help of the Weyl-Wigner distributions of the equilibrium eigenvectors, which reveal the key role of quantum effects by showing surviving coherences in the asymptotic states.

abstract: The time-local master equation for a driven boson system interacting with a boson environment is derived by way of a time-local Heisenberg--Langevin equation. Extension to the driven qubit fails---except for weak excitation---due to the lost linearity of the system-environment interaction. We show that a reported time-local master equation for the driven qubit is incorrect.

abstract: We present the conditions for the classicality of a macroscopic quantum system during an individual experiment. We show that a Bohmian trajectory of the center of mass of a quantum object with a large number of identical particles follows a Newtonian trajectory. This result can also be interpreted as a single-experiment generalization of the well-known multiple-experiment Ehrenfest theorem. We also demonstrate the pure quantum origin of the (non-linear) wave equation for classical mechanics, providing clear evidence for a quantum-classical inter-theory unification and a deeper understanding of decoherence.

abstract: A scheme for the detection of low-intensity optical coherent signals is presented based on non-linear operations which rely on the probabilistic amplifier by Ralph and Lund and/or on a partial dephasing transformation of the received signals, preserving the zero and one photon-number subspace while destroying any further coherence. The success probability gains up to ~1.85% with respect to the optimized Kennedy receiver and, when employed in an adaptive strategy, approaches the Helstrom bound appreciably faster than the Dolinar receiver. An optical cavity implementation of the partial dephaser is proposed and its performances are analyzed.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.04037
abstract: There are many ways to decompose the Hilbert space of a composite quantum system into tensor product subspaces. Different subsystem decompositions generally imply different interaction Hamiltonians V, and therefore different expectation values for subsystem observables. This means that the uniqueness of physical predictions is not guaranteed, despite the uniqueness of the total Hamiltonian H and the total Hilbert space. Here we use Clausius' version of the second law of thermodynamics (CSL) and standard identifications of thermodynamic quantities to identify possible subsystem decompositions. It is shown that agreement with the CSL is obtained, whenever the total Hamiltonian and the subsystem-dependent interaction Hamiltonian commute (i.e. [H, V ] = 0). Not imposing this constraint can result in the transfer of heat from a cooler to a hotter subsystem, in conflict with thermodynamics. We also investigate the status of the CSL with respect to non- standard definitions of thermodynamic quantities and quantum subsystems.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.04072
abstract: We introduce quantum sensing schemes for measuring very weak forces with a single trapped ion. They use the spin-motional coupling induced by the laser-ion interaction to transfer the relevant force information to the spin-degree of freedom. Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the force with a sensitivity beyond the yN $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ range, i.e. in the xN$ /\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ (xennonewton, $10^{-27}$). The Jahn-Teller protocol, in particular, can be used to implement a two-channel vector spectrum analyzer for measuring ultra-low voltages.

abstract: Using a relation between a bi-orthogonal set of equiseparable bases and the weak values of the density matrix we derive an explicit formula for its tomographic reconstruction completely analogous to the standard mutually unbiased bases expansion. With the simple example of a qubit is evidenced the relationship between weak values, measured probabilities and the separation between non-orthogonal bases.

abstract: We consider the transversal modes of ions in a linear radio frequency (rf) trap where we control the time dependent axial confinement to show that we can excite quanta of motion via a two-mode squeezing process. This effect is analogous to phenomena predicted to occur during the evaporation of black holes and cosmological particle creation, in general out of reach for experimental investigation. As substantial advantage of this proposal in comparison to previous ones we propose to exploit radial and axial modes simultaneously to permit experimental access of these effects based on state-of-the-art technology. In addition, we propose to create and explore entanglement, starting with two ions, and relate the results to fundamental aspects of the entropy of black holes.

abstract: Electromagnetic vector potential has physical significance in quantum mechanics as revealed by the Aharonov-Bohm effect for charged particles. However, till date it is thought that we cannot measure the vector potential directly as this is not a gauge invariant quantity. Contrary to this belief, here we show that one can indeed measure the electromagnetic vector potential using the notion of weak value. We show that it is simply the difference between the weak value of the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the presence and absence of magnetic field. This suggests that the vector potential is not only a physical entity but can be measured directly in the experiment.

abstract: We classify two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians in terms of their computational complexity. Suppose one has a two-qubit commuting Hamiltonian H which one can apply to any pair of qubits, starting in a computational basis state. We prove a dichotomy theorem: either this model is efficiently classically simulable or it allows one to sample from probability distributions which cannot be sampled from classically unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, the only simulable Hamiltonians are those which fail to generate entanglement. This shows that generic two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians can be used to perform computational tasks which are intractable for classical computers under plausible assumptions. Our proof makes use of new postselection gadgets and Lie theory.

The phase function describes symmetries of the resource state of the MBQC, specifies the computational output, and acts as a contextuality witness. It is also a topological object, namely a 1-cocycle in group cohomology. Non-triviality of the cocycles reveals the presence of contextuality, and is a precondition for quantum speedup.

abstract: In large quantum systems multipartite entanglement can be found in many inequivalent classes under local operations and classical communication. Preparing states of arbitrary size in different classes is important for performing a wide range of quantum protocols. W states, in particular, constitute a class with a variety of quantum networking protocols. However, all known schemes for preparing W states are probabilistic, with resource requirements increasing at least sub-exponentially. We propose a deterministic scheme for preparing W states that requires no prior entanglement and can be performed locally. We introduce an all-optical setup that can efficiently prepare W states of arbitrary size. Our scheme advances the use of W states in real-world quantum networks and could be extended to other physical systems.

abstract: We study the effects of external magnetic fields on the precision of parameter estimation with thermal entanglement of two spins in XX model, in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Calculating the quantum Fisher information, we show that homogeneous magnetic field B, inhomogeneous magnetic field b or DM interaction D increases the precision of parameter estimation, overwhelming the destructive effects of thermalization. We also show that for the model in consideration, the effects of b and D are the same. However, the existence of both b and B (or both D and B) decreases the precision. We find that in order to increase the precision in parameter estimation tasks, applying b in the ferromagnetic case and B in the antiferromagnetic case should be preferred.

abstract: We demonstrate that a thermal transistor can be made up with a quantum system of 3 interacting subsystems , coupled to a thermal reservoir each. This thermal transistor is analogous to an electronic bipolar one with the ability to control the thermal currents at the collector and at the emitter with the imposed thermal current at the base. This is achieved determining the heat fluxes by means of the strong-coupling formalism. For the case of 3 interacting spins, in which one of them is coupled to the other 2, that are not directly coupled, it is shown that high amplification can be obtained in a wide range of energy parameters and temperatures. The proposed quantum transistor could, in principle, be used to develop devices such as a thermal modulator and a thermal amplifier in nano systems.

abstract: Robust, accurate and efficient quantum tomography is key for future quantum technologies. Traditional methods are impractical for even medium sized systems and are not robust against noise and errors. Here we report on an experimental demonstration of self-guided quantum tomography; an autonomous, fast, robust and precise technique for measuring quantum states with significantly less computational resources than standard techniques. The quantum state is iteratively learned by treating tomography as a projection measurement optimization problem. We experimentally demonstrate robustness against both statistical noise and experimental errors on both single qubit and entangled two-qubit states. Our demonstration provides a method of full quantum state characterization in current and near-future experiments where standard techniques are unfeasible.

abstract: The geometry and topology of quantum systems have deep connections to quantum dynamics. In this paper, I show how to measure the non-Abelian Berry curvature and its related topological invariant, the second Chern number, using dynamical techniques. The second Chern number is the defining topological characteristic of the four-dimensional generalization of the quantum Hall effect and has relevance in systems from three-dimensional topological insulators to Yang-Mills field theory. I illustrate its measurement using the simple example of a spin-3/2 particle in an electric quadrupole field. I show how one can dynamically measure diagonal components of the Berry curvature in an over-complete basis of the degenerate ground state space and use this to extract the full non-Abelian Berry curvature. I also show that one can accomplish the same ideas by stochastically averaging over random initial states in the degenerate ground state manifold. Finally I show how this system can be manufactured and the topological invariant measured in a variety of realistic systems, from superconducting qubits to trapped ions and cold atoms.

abstract: The coupled quantum dynamics of excitonic and vibrational degrees of freedom is investigated for high-dimensional models of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. This includes a seven and an eight-site model with 518 and 592 harmonic vibrational modes, respectively. The coupling between local electronic transitions and vibrations is described within the Huang-Rhys model using parameters that are obtained by discretization of an experimental spectral density. Different pathways of excitation energy flow are analyzed in terms of the reduced one-exciton density matrix, focussing on the role of vibrational and vibronic excitation. Distinct features due to both competing time scales of vibrational and exciton motion and vibronically-assisted transfer are observed. The question of the effect of initial state preparation is addressed by comparing the case of an instantaneous Franck-Condon excitation at a single site with that of a laser field excitation.

abstract: In quantum field theory, the vacuum is a fluctuating medium which behaves as a nonlinear polarizable material. In this article, we perform the first rigorous derivation of the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg effective energy, a nonlinear functional that describes the effective fluctuations of the quantum vacuum in a classical magnetic field. We start from a classical magnetic field in interaction with a quan-tized Dirac field in its ground state, and we study a limit in which the classical magnetic field is slowly varying. After a change of scales, this is equivalent to a semi-classical limit $\hbar\to0$, with a strong magnetic field of order $1/\hbar$. In this regime, we prove that the energy of Dirac's polarized vacuum converges to the Euler-Heisenberg functional. The model has ultraviolet divergences, which we regularize using the Pauli-Villars method. We also discuss how to remove the regularization of the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, using charge renormaliza-tion, perturbatively to any order of the coupling constant.

abstract: It is shown that all of the basic properties of the hydrogen atom can be consistently described in terms of classical electrodynamics instead of taking the electron to be a particle; we consider an electrically charged classical wave field, an "electron wave", which is held in a limited region of space by the electrostatic field of the proton. It is shown that quantum mechanics must be considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in the spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with difficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the spontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually derived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. It is shown that there are no discrete states and discrete energy levels of the atom: the energy of the atom and its states change continuously. An explanation of the conventional corpuscular-statistical interpretation of atomic phenomena is given. It is shown that this explanation is only a misinterpretation of continuous deterministic processes. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is obtained, which accounts for the inverse action of self-electromagnetic radiation of the electron wave and completely describes the spontaneous emissions of an atom.

abstract: The Interaction Enhanced Imaging technique allows to detect the spatial distribution of strongly interacting impurities embedded within a gas of background atoms used as a contrast medium. Here we present a detailed study of this technique, applied to detect Rydberg $P$ states. We experimentally realize fast and efficient three-photon excitation of $P$ states, optimized according to the results of a theoretical effective two-level model. Few Rydberg $P$-state atoms, prepared in a small cloud with dimensions comparable to the blockade radius, are detected with a good sensitivity by averaging over 50 shots. The main aspects of the technique are described with a hard-sphere model, finding good agreement with experimental data. This work paves the way to a non-destructive optical detection of single Rydberg atoms with high spatial and temporal resolution.
