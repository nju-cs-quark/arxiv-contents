abstract: It is well known that in a two-slit interference experiment, if the information, on which of the two paths the particle followed, is stored in a quantum path detector, the interference is destroyed. However, in a setup where this path information is "erased", the interference can reappear. Such a setup is known as a quantum eraser. A generalization of quantum eraser to a three-slit interference is theoretically analyzed. It is shown that three complementary interference patterns can arise out of the quantum erasing process. However, unlike the two-slit case, only one of these patterns can represent true 3-slit interference.

abstract: We discuss the hypothesis that the debate about the interpretation of the orthodox formalism of quantum mechanics (QM) might have been misguided right from the start by a biased metaphysical interpretation of the formalism and its inner mathematical relations. In particular, we focus on the orthodox interpretation of the congruence relation, '=', which relates equivalent classes of different mathematical representations of a vector in Hilbert space, in terms of metaphysical identity. We will argue that this seemingly "common sense" interpretation, at the semantic level, has severe difficulties when considering the syntactic level of the theory.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a bipartite quantum system in a way such that its formal description keeps holding even if one of its parts becomes macroscopic: the problem is related with the analysis of the quantum-to-classical crossover, but our approach implies that the whole system stays genuinely quantum. Aim of the work is to understand 1) if, 2) to what extent, and possibly 3) how, the evolution of a macroscopic environment testifies to the coupling with its microscopic quantum companion. To this purpose we consider a magnetic environment made of a large number of spin-1/2 particles, coupled with a quantum mechanical oscillator, possibly in the presence of an external magnetic field. We take the value of the total environmental-spin S constant and large, which allows us to consider the environment as one single macroscopic system, and further deal with the hurdles of the spin-algebra via approximations that are valid in the large-S limit. We find an insightful expression for the propagator of the whole system, where we identify an effective "back-action" term, i.e. an operator acting on the magnetic environment only, and yet missing in the absence of the quantum principal system. This operator emerges as a time-dependent magnetic anisotropy whose character, whether uniaxial or planar, also depends on the detuning between the level-splitting in the spectrum of the free magnetic system, induced by the possible presence of the external field, and the frequency of the oscillator. The time-dependence of the anisotropy is analysed, and its effects on the dynamics of the magnet, as well as its relation with the entangling evolution of the overall system, are discussed.

abstract: We study the dynamics of two two-level atoms embedded near to the interface of paired meta-material slabs, one of negative permeability and the other of negative permittivity. The interface behaves as a plasmonic waveguide composed of surface-plasmon polariton modes. It is found that significantly different dynamics occur for the resonant and an off-resonant couplings of the plasma field to the atoms. In the case of the resonant coupling, the plasma field does not appear as a dissipative reservoir to the atoms. We adopt the image method and show that the dynamics of the two atoms are completely equivalent to those of a four-atom system. Moreover, two threshold coupling strengths exist, one corresponding to the strength of coupling of the plasma field to the symmetric and the other the antisymmetric mode of the two-atom system. The thresholds distinguish between the non-Markovian (memory preserving) and Markovian (memoryless) regimes of the evolutions that different time scales of the evolution of the memory effects and entanglement can be observed. The Markovian regime is characterized by exponentially decaying whereas the non-Markovian regime by sinusoidally oscillating contributions to the evolution of the probability amplitudes. The solutions predict a large and long living entanglement mediated by the plasma field in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes of the evolution. We also show that a simultaneous Markovian and non-Markovian regime of the evolution may occur in which the memory effects exist over a finite evolution time. In the case of an off-resonant coupling of the atoms to the plasma field, the atoms interact with each other by exchanging virtual photons which results in the dynamics corresponding to those of two atoms coupled to a common reservoir. In addition, the entanglement is significantly enhanced under the off-resonant coupling.

abstract: The optomechanical force sensor in non-Markovian environment for a mechanical oscillator is presented. By performing homodyne detection we obtain an generally expression for the output signal. It is shown that the weak force detection is sensitive to the non-Markovian environment. The additional noise can be obviously reduced comparing to the Markovian condition. Moreover, the optimal additional noise can be maintained in a rather low level without using assistant system or squeezing under available experimental condition in unsolved sideband regime. Our results provides a promising platform for reducing the additional noise by using engineered non-Markovian reservoir in ultrasensitive detection.

abstract: We consider a quantum system dynamics caused by successive selective and non-selective measurements of the probe coupled to the system. For the finite measurement rate $\tau^{-1}$ and the system-probe interaction strength $\gamma$ we derive analytical evolution equations in the stroboscopic limit $\tau \rightarrow 0$ and $\gamma^2 \tau = {\rm const}$, which can be considered as a deviation from the Zeno subspace dynamics on a longer timescale $T \sim (\gamma^2 \tau)^{-1} \gg \gamma^{-1}$. Non-linear quantum dynamics is analyzed for selective stroboscopic projective measurements of an arbitrary rank. Non-selective measurements are shown to induce the semigroup dynamics of the system-probe aggregate. Both non-linear and decoherent effects become significant at the timescale $T \sim (\gamma^2 \tau)^{-1}$, which is illustrated by a number of examples.

abstract: We ask, and answer, the question of what's computable by Turing machines equipped with time travel into the past: that is, closed timelike curves or CTCs (with no bound on their size). We focus on a model for CTCs due to Deutsch, which imposes a probabilistic consistency condition to avoid grandfather paradoxes. Our main result is that computers with CTCs can solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem, and that this is true whether we consider classical or quantum computers. Previous work, by Aaronson and Watrous, studied CTC computers with a polynomial size restriction, and showed that they solve exactly the problems in PSPACE, again in both the classical and quantum cases. Compared to the complexity setting, the main novelty of the computability setting is that not all CTCs have fixed-points, even probabilistically. Despite this, we show that the CTCs that do have fixed-points suffice to solve the halting problem, by considering fixed-point distributions involving infinite geometric series. The tricky part is to show that even quantum computers with CTCs can be simulated using a Halt oracle. For that, we need the Riesz representation theorem from functional analysis, among other tools. We also study an alternative model of CTCs, due to Lloyd et al., which uses postselection to "simulate" a consistency condition, and which yields BPP_path in the classical case or PP in the quantum case when subject to a polynomial size restriction. With no size limit, we show that postselected CTCs yield only the computable languages if we impose a certain finiteness condition, or all languages nonadaptively reducible to the halting problem if we don't.

abstract: In this theoretical work, we study a double quantum dot interacting strongly with a microcavity, while undergoing resonant tunneling. Effects of interdot tunneling on the light-matter hybridized states are determined, and tunability of their brightness degrees and associated dipole moments is demonstrated. These results predict dipolariton generation in artificial molecules coupled to optical resonators, and provide a promising scenario for control of emission efficiency and coherence times of exciton polaritons.

abstract: We give a quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs). It has worst case running time O(n^{1/2}m^{1/2}sR^{10}/delta^{10}), with n and s the dimension and sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, m the number of constraints, delta the accuracy of the solution, and R an upper bound on the trace of an optimal solution. This gives a square-root unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in n and m. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved giving a Omega(n^{1/2} + m^{1/2}) quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant s, R and delta. We then argue that in some instances the algorithm offer even exponential speed-ups. This is the case whenever the quantum Gibbs states of Hamiltonians given by linear combinations of the input matrices of the SDP can be prepared efficiently on a quantum computer. An example are SDPs in which the input matrices have low-rank: For SDPs with the maximum rank of any input matrix bounded by r, we show the quantum algorithm runs in time poly(log(n), log(m), r, R, delta)m^{1/2}. This constitutes an exponential speed-up in terms of the dimension of the input matrices over the best known classical method. Moreover, we prove solving such low-rank SDPs (already with m = 2) is BQP-complete, i.e. it captures everything that can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer. The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on an classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need of solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest.

abstract: The proofs of quantum nonlocality due to GHZ and Hardy are quantitatively different from that of Bell insofar as they rely only on a consideration of whether events are possible or impossible, rather than relying on specific experimental probabilities. Here, we consider the computational task of determining whether or not a given table of possibilities constitutes a departure from possibilistic local realism. By considering the case in which one party has access to measurements with two outcomes and the other three, it is possible to see at exactly which point this task becomes computationally difficult.

abstract: In [\href{this http URL}{Phys. Lett. A {\bf 166}, 293 (1992)}] Popescu characterized nonlocality of pure $n$-partite entangled systems by studying bipartite violation of local realism when $n-2$ number of parties perform projective measurements on their particles. A pertinent question in this scenario is whether similar characterization is possible for $n$-partite mixed entangled states also. In the present work we have followed an analogous approach so as to explore whether given a tripartite mixed entangled state the conditional bipartite states obtained by performing projective measurement on the third party, demonstrate a weaker form of nonlocality, quantum steering. We also compare this new phenomenon of conditional steering to the existing notions of tripartite correlations. Interestingly we find that the tripartite state need not be nonlocal to demonstrate conditional steering.

abstract: It is shown that the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian is exactly solvable when the quantum number of the total angular momentum of the system is an integer after the Jordan-Schwinger (differential) boson realization of the SU(2) algebra. Algebraic Bethe ansatz is used to get the exact solution with the help of the SU(1,1) algebraic structure, from which a set of Bethe ansatz equations of the problem is derived. It is shown that solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations can be obtained more easily as zeros of the Heine-Stieltjes polynomials. The total number of the four sets of the zeros equals exactly to $2J+1$ for a given integer angular momentum quantum number $J$, which proves the completeness of the solutions. It is also shown that double degeneracy in level energies may also occur in the $J\rightarrow\infty$ limit for integer $J$ case except a unique non-degenerate level with zero excitation energy.

abstract: The search for new, application-specific quantum computers designed to outperform any classical computer is difficult and ambitious, yet strongly driven by the ending of Moore's law and the great quantum advantages obtainable. Boson sampling photonic networks are highly promising examples of this, with preliminary experimental demonstrations and strong potential for obtaining the first quantum computer to solve classically impossible problems. We develop novel complex phase-space software for simulating these photonic networks, and apply this to two outstanding challenges: boson sampling experiments, and calculating the decoherence of quantum Fourier metrology. We obtain a novel, highly scalable channel-combination verification strategy for boson sampling, and simulate a hundred qubit Fourier transform interferometer far larger than in conventional calculations, demonstrating that this quantum metrology technique is robust against decoherence.

abstract: We derive the explicit analytical form of the time-dependent coupling parameter to an external field for perfect absorption of traveling single photon fields with arbitrary temporal profiles by a tunable single input-output open quantum system, which can be realized as either a single qubit or single resonator system. However, the time-dependent coupling parameter for perfect absorption has a singularity at $t=0$ and constraints on real systems prohibit a faithful physical realization of the perfect absorber. A numerical example is included to illustrate the absorber's performance under practical limitations on the coupling strength.

abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a membrane inside a cavity in the situation where this optomechanical system possesses a reflection symmetry. Symmetry breaking occurs through supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations of the static fixed point solutions. Both bifurcations can be observed through variation of the laser-cavity detuning, which gives rise to a boomerang-like fixed point pattern with hysteresis. The symmetry breaking fixed points evolve into self-sustained oscillations when the laser intensity is increased. In addition to the analysis of the accompanying Hopf bifurcations we describe these oscillations at finite amplitudes with an ansatz that fully accounts for the frequency shift relative to the natural membrane frequency. We complete our study by following the route to chaos for the membrane dynamics.

abstract: In a previous paper [J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 682 (2016) 012032}, arXiv:1605.05593] we studied analytically the energy spectra of a finite-size spin $\tfrac12$ XY chain (molecule) coupled at an arbitrary spin site to a single mode of an electromagnetic field via the Jaynes-Cummings model. We considered spin rings and open spin molecules with up to 4 spins and an interaction restricted to nearest-neighbours. Here we extend our investigation, addressing numerically the energy spectra of molecules of up to 10 spins with nearest-neighbour or long-range interaction. Furthermore we analyze the behaviour of an invariant operator, constructed by combining the magnetization of the spin-chain and the total number of photons in the system. We found a strong dependence on the number (even or odd) of sites in the molecules. This study is aimed at finding the appropriate combination of the physical parameters that could make the system suitable for use in quantum computations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.05742
abstract: The Clausius inequality (CI) form of the second law of thermodynamics relates information changes (entropy) to changes in the first moment of the energy (heat and indirectly also work). We use the Bregman divergence to derive families of generalized Clausius inequalities (gCI) that relate changes in higher moments of the energy to information measures. The formalism follows the standard second law and has the same mathematical structure. This includes the CI form, and no cyclic extraction of higher order energy flows from a single bath. As a motivation for the gCI we study cases where a thermal bath interacts with a system without any heat exchange. In this case the standard second law does not provide any information. However, this type of interaction has non zero higher order heat flows which are thermodynamically limited by the gCI. In addition, in certain cases we derive results which are tighter compared to the standard second law. For example, for heat machines, we find an efficiency bound which is tighter than the Carnot bound. The gCI are also used to study new types of heat machines (zero and half-zero heat machines) where the performance is limited only by the gCI and not by the standard second law. This study adds another layer to the fundamental connection between energy and information. It is intriguing to fully map the regime of validity of the new gCI and extend the present results to more general scenarios including quantum coherences in the energy basis of the system.

abstract: We investigate measurement-based quantum communication with noisy resource states that are generated by entanglement purification. We consider the transmission of encoded information via noisy quantum channels using a measurement-based implementation of encoding, error correction and decoding. We show that such an approach offers advantages over direct transmission, gate-based error correction and measurement-based schemes with direct generation of resource states. We analyze the noise structure of resource states generated by entanglement purification and show that a local error model, i.e. noise acting independently on all qubits of the resource state, is a good approximation in general, and provides an exact description for $GHZ$-states. The latter are resources for a measurement-based implementation of error correction codes for bit-flip or phase flip errors. This provides a first link between the recently found very high thresholds for fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum information processing based on local error models for resource states, to error thresholds for gate based computational models.

abstract: We consider the problem of deciding if a set of quantum one-qudit gates $\mathcal{S}=\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}\subset G$ is universal, i.e when the closure $\overline{<\mathcal{S}>}$ is equal to $G$. To every gate in $\mathcal{S}$ we associate its image under the adjoint representation, i.e. $\mathrm{Ad}:G\rightarrow SO(\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. Matrices $\mathrm{Ad}_{g_i}$ play the major role in deciding universality of the set $\mathcal{S}$. We prove that $\overline{<\mathcal{S}>}$ is infinite if the spectra of $\mathrm{Ad}_{g_i}$'s satisfy some finite number of conditions. On the other hand, the infinite $\overline{<\mathcal{S}>}$ is the whole $G$ if the simultaneous commutant of all $\mathrm{Ad}_{g_i}$ is equal to the simultaneous commutant of all $\mathrm{Ad}_{g}$, $g\in G$. We relate these conditions with the conditions for universal Hamiltonians. Our approach is illustrated by concrete problems concerning $SU(2)$, $SO(3)$ and $SU(3)$ universal gates.

abstract: In this letter we consider the quantum analogue of the butterfly effect which is well known in the field of classical non-linear dynamics. Recently, it has been proposed to measure the effect using an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) between two local operators. Effectively measuring the degree of non-commutativity in time, this correlator describes the phenomenon of information scrambling in quantum information. Here we show that the butterfly effect can be recast as a two-measurement scheme inspired from the field of non-equilibrium quan- tum thermodynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an OTOC can emerge as the characteristic function of the work distribution. Our realisation not only offers a physically intuitive thermodynamical interpretation of the quantum butterfly effect, it also inspires novel experimental schemes to study the problem of quantum information scrambling.

abstract: I discuss how a quantum annealer may be employed for an inference task of finding the likely lowest energy state for a system of qubits with uncertainty values for the state of individual qubits and clusters of qubits depending on the structure of the driver Hamiltonian. These calls to an annealer can be used as a computational primitive for hybrid computations. In particular, such a computational primitive can be used quite naturally as a directed mutation engine for genetic algorithms. I discuss how this can be done, as well as other ways in which such annealer calls can be applied to solving problems. I further discuss the practicality of implementing such a protocol on real devices, and furthermore demonstrate that these methods are compatible with many of the current efforts by others to improve the performance of annealers, including the use of non-stoquastic drivers, synchronizing freeze times for individual bits, and belief propagation techniques which allow problems to be solved which do not fit on the hardware graph.

abstract: The learning process for multi layered neural networks with many nodes makes heavy demands on computational resources. In some neural network models, the learning formulas, such as the Widrow-Hoff formula, do not change the eigenvectors of the weight matrix while flatting the eigenvalues. In infinity, this iterative formulas result in terms formed by the principal components of the weight matrix: i.e., the eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues. In quantum computing, the phase estimation algorithm is known to provide speed-ups over the conventional algorithms when it is used for the eigenvalue related problems. Therefore, it is appealing to ask whether we can model such learning formulas in quantum computing and gain a computational speed-up. Combining the quantum amplitude amplification with the phase estimation algorithm, a quantum implementation model for artificial neural networks using the Widrow-Hoff learning rule is presented. In addition, the complexity of the model is found to be linear in the size of the weight matrix. This provides a quadratic improvement over the classical algorithms.

abstract: Matrix product purifications (MPP) are a very efficient tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures. When a system features symmetries, these can be used to reduce computation costs substantially. It is straightforward to compute an MPP of a grand-canonical ensemble, also when symmetries are exploited. This paper provides and demonstrates efficient methods to compute MPPs of canonical ensembles under utilization of symmetries. Furthermore, we present a scheme for the evaluation of global quantum number distributions using matrix product density operators (MPDO). We give exact matrix product representations for canonical infinite-temperature states, and discuss how they can be constructed alternatively by applying matrix product operators to vacuum-type states or by using entangler Hamiltonians. A demonstration of the techniques for Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains explains why the difference in the energy densities of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles decays as 1/L.

abstract: We introduce a general framework to construct many-body lattice wavefunctions starting from the conformal blocks (CBs) of rational conformal field theories (RCFTs). We discuss the different ways of encoding the physical degrees of freedom of the lattice system using both the internal symmetries of the theory and the fusion channels of the CBs. We illustrate this construction both by revisiting the known Haldane-Shastry model and by providing a novel implementation for the Ising RCFT. In the latter case, we find a connection to the Ising transverse field (ITF) spin chain via the Kramers-Wannier duality and the Temperley-Lieb-Jones algebra. We also find evidence that the ground state of the finite-size critical ITF Hamiltonian corresponds exactly to the wavefunction obtained from CBs of spin fields.

We construct a new Gross-Pitaevskii action for the BEC regime in which dimers are represented by coupled fields, which enables us to determine how simply bosonic they really are. To exemplify this we construct vortex solutions. We find that there is a difference, which although very small in the deep BEC regime, becomes significant when the BCS regime is approached.

Here the concept of $\mathcal{PT}$ mode-locking of a laser is introduced, in which active phase locking of cavity axial modes is realized by asymmetric mode coupling in a complex time crystal. $\mathcal{PT}$ mode-locking shows a transition from single to double pulse emission as the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point is crossed. The transition can show a turbulent behavior, depending on a dimensionless modulation parameter that plays the same role as the Reynolds number in hydrodynamic flows.

abstract: For the first time, a direct detection BOTDR is demonstrated for distributed dynamic strain sensing incorporating double-edge technique, time-division multiplexing technique and upconversion technique. The double edges are realized by using the transmission curve and reflection curve of an all-fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI). Benefiting from the low loss of the fiber at, the time-division multiplexing technique is performed to realize the double-edge technique by using only a single-channel FPI and only one piece of a detector. In order to detect the weak spontaneous Brillouin backscattering signal efficiently, a fiber-coupled upconversion detector is adopted to upconvert the backscattering signal at 1548.1 nm to 863 nm, which is detected by a Si-APD finally. In the experiment, dynamic strain disturbance up to 1.9m{\epsilon} over 1.5 km of polarization maintaining fiber is detected at a sampling rate of 30 Hz. An accuracy of 30{\mu}{\epsilon} and spatial resolution of 0.6 m is realized.

abstract: By using the technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we study a quasi exactly solvable (QES) extension of the $N$-particle rational Calogero model with harmonic confining interaction. Such QES many particle system, whose effective potential in the radial direction yields a supersymmetric partner of the radial harmonic oscillator, is constructed by including new long-range interactions to the rational Calogero model. An infinite number of bound state energy levels are obtained for this system under certain conditions. We also calculate the corresponding bound state wave functions in terms of the recently discovered exceptional orthogonal Laguerre polynomials.

abstract: We study the Anderson transition on a generic model of random graphs with a tunable branching parameter $1<K\le 2$, through a combination of large scale numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. We find that a single Anderson transition separates a localized phase from an unusual delocalized phase which is ergodic at large scales but strongly non-ergodic at smaller scales. The critical regime is characterized by multifractal wavefunctions located on few branches of the graph. Two different scaling laws apply on both sides of the transition: a linear scaling as a function of the linear size of the system on the localized side, and an unusual volumic scaling on the delocalized side. The critical scalings and exponents are found to be independent of the branching parameter and should describe all infinite dimensional random graphs without boundary.
