abstract: The desiderata for an ideal photon source are high brightness, high single-photon purity, and high indistinguishability. Defining brightness at the first collection lens, these properties have been simultaneously demonstrated with solid-state sources, however absolute source efficiencies remain close to the 1% level, and indistinguishability only demonstrated for photons emitted consecutively on the few nanosecond scale. Here we demonstrate solid-state photon sources with an absolute brightness at the output of a single-mode fibre of 14% and purities of 97.1--99.0%. Our sources are quantum dots deterministically coupled to micropillar cavities with emission lifetimes of a few hundred picoseconds. When quasi-resontantly excited, they emit long streams of photons that exhibit an indistinguishability up to 70%---above the classical limit of 50%---even after 33 consecutively emitted photons, a 400 ns separation between them. When resonantly excited we observe near-optimal indistinguishability values: 95% at short timescales, remaining above 90% at timescales as large as 160 ns. Our devices bring solid-state emitters into a regime suitable for scalable implementations.

abstract: The general view is that all fundamental physical laws should be formulated within the framework given by quantum mechanics (QM). In a sense, QM therefore has the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to derive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general, philosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated epistemic principles. A key assumption is that in a proper physical theory, the introduction of entities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle is in conflict with the theory. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like knowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the potential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges from this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities are defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means that the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of description, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space $\mathcal{S}=\{Z\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These elements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world. The evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution of the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase space. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\in \mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\rightarrow n+1$ each time an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time $n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances between events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about the temporal relations between present and past events.

abstract: A variety of dynamics in this world can be approximately treated by a model: a driven and damped parametric oscillator. An intensive investigate of this time-dependent model from both classical and quantum mechanical points of view provides a dynamical insight to resolve the classical and quantum dynamics in order to understand the more complicated time-dependent evolutions not only happens in the macroscopic classical scale for the synchronized behaviors but also in the coherent microscopic scale for a quantum state control. By using a Lie transformation on a general time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian, we exactly solve the dynamical behaviors of the driven and damped parametric oscillator to give a universal physical mechanism for the classical parametric control on the quantum state evolution in a dissipation system.

abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for resonance fluorescence radiating from a two-level system (TLS) driven by any periodic driving and coupled to multiple reservoirs. The formalism is derived analytically based on the combination of Floquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple resonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that the present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the fluorescence spectrum of periodically strongly driven TLSs.

abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference unveils a distinct behavior of identical particles which cannot be distinguished from each other. Especially for bosons, two separated identical particles passing through a beamsplitter always go together into one of the output ports, but that is not the case with other particles including fermions or classical ones. So far many elemental properties of quantum physics and information have been discovered through the concatenated HOM effects, which has been demonstrated in photons and recently in plasmons, atoms and phonons. However, all demonstrations in optical region employed two particles in different spatial modes. Here we first report the HOM interference between two photons in a single spatial mode with different frequencies (energies) by using a partial frequency conversion. The demonstrated frequency-domain interferometer allows us to replace spatial optical paths by optical frequency multiplexing, which opens up a distinct architecture of the quantum interferometry.

abstract: In [J. Chem. Phys. 143, 054102 (2015)] I have derived conditions to characterize the kernel of the retarded response function, under the assumption that the initial state is a ground state. In this article I demonstrate its generalization to mixed states (ensembles). To make the proof work, the weights in the ensemble need to be decreasing for increasing energies of the pure states from which the mixed state is constructed. The resulting conditions are not easy to verify, but under the additional assumptions that the ensemble weights are directly related to the energies and that the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian participates in the ensemble, it is shown that potentials only belong to the kernel of the retarded response function if they commute with the initial Hamiltonian. These additional assumptions are valid for thermodynamic ensembles, which makes this result also physically relevant. The conditions on the potentials for the thermodynamic ensembles are much stronger than in the pure state (zero temperature) case, leading to a much less involved kernel when the conditions are applied to the retarded one-body reduced density matrix response function.

abstract: We consider a scheme of multiplexed cold atomic ensembles that generate a frequency-entangled biphoton state with controllable entropy of entanglement. The biphoton state consists of a telecommunication photon (signal) immediately followed by an infrared one (idler) via four-wave mixing with two classical pump fields. Multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency and phase-shifted signal and idler emissions, we can manipulate and control the spectral property of the biphoton state. Mapping out the entropy of entanglement in the scheme provides the optimal configuration for entanglement resources. This paves the way for efficient long-distance quantum communication and for potentially useful multimode structures in quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum mechanical objects or nanoobjects have been proposed as bits for information storage. While time-averaged properties of magnetic, quantum-mechanical particles have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, experimental investigations of the real time evolution of magnetization in the quantum regime were not possible until recent developments in pump-probe techniques. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of effective spin systems by means of analytical and numerical treatments. Particular attention is paid to the quantum revival time and its relation to the magnetization tunneling. The quantum revival time has been initially defined as the recurrence time of a total wave-function. Here we show that the quantum revivals of wave-functions and expectation values in spin systems may be quite different which gives rise to a more sophisticated definition of the quantum revival within the realm of experimental research. Particularly, the revival times for integer spins coincide which is not the case for half-integer spins. Furthermore, the quantum revival is found to be shortest for integer ratios between the on-site anisotropy and an external magnetic field paving the way to novel methods of anisotropy measurements. We show that the quantum tunneling of magnetization at avoided level crossing is coherent to the quantum revival time of expectation values, leading to a connection between these two fundamental properties of quantum mechanical spins.

abstract: We consider two separate atoms interacting with a single-mode optical resonator. When the frequency of the resonator field is twice the atomic transition frequency, we show that there exists a resonant coupling between one photon and two atoms, via intermediate virtual states connected by counter-rotating processes. If the resonator is prepared in its one-photon state, the photon can be jointly absorbed by the two atoms in their ground state which will both reach their excited state with probability close to one. Like ordinary quantum Rabi oscillations, this process is coherent and reversible, so that two atoms in their excited state will undergo a downward transition jointly emitting a single cavity photon. This joint absorption and emission processes can also occur with three atoms. The parameters used to investigate this process correspond to experimentally demonstrated values in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an intermediate type of quantum nonlocality which lies between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is interesting to know what kind of states can generate EPR nonlocal correlations in the simplest nontrivial scenario, that is, two projective measurements for each party that share a two-qubit state. In this paper we settle this problem by deriving a necessary and sufficient analytical criterion. It turns out that a two-qubit state can demonstrate EPR nonlocal correlations in this scenario iff it can demonstrate Bell nonlocal correlations. This phenomenon is in sharp contrast with the strict hierarchy expected between the two forms of nonlocality. However, the strict hierarchy can emerge if both parties are restricted to performing mutually unbiased measurements. In addition, we clarify the relationships between entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality. In our study, we introduce the concept of restricted local hidden state models, which is useful in connecting different steering scenarios and is of interest in a wider context.

abstract: We discuss Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism on an arbitrary four-dimensional curved spacetime (gauge invariance of the classical theory and covariant quantization, wave equations for the massive spin-1 field $A_\mu$, for the auxiliary Stueckelberg scalar field $\Phi$ and for the ghost fields $C$ and $C^\ast$, Ward identities, Hadamard representation of the various Feynman propagators and covariant Taylor series expansions of the corresponding coefficients). This permits us to construct, for a Hadamard quantum state, the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor associated with the Stueckelberg theory. We provide two alternative but equivalent expressions for this result. The first one is obtained by removing the contribution of the "Stueckelberg ghost" $\Phi$ and only involves state-dependent and geometrical quantities associated with the massive vector field $A_\mu$. The other one involves contributions coming from both the massive vector field and the auxiliary Stueckelberg scalar field and it has been constructed in such a way that, in zero-mass limit, the massive vector field contribution reduces smoothly to the result obtained from Maxwell's theory. As an application of our results, we consider the Casimir effect outside a perfectly conducting medium with a plane boundary. We discuss the results obtained using Stueckelberg but also de Broglie-Proca electromagnetism and we consider the zero-mass limit of the vacuum energy in both theories. We finally compare the de Broglie-Proca and Stueckelberg formalisms and highlight the advantages of the Stueckelberg point of view, even if, in our opinion, the de Broglie-Proca and Stueckelberg approaches of massive electromagnetism are two faces of the same field theory.

abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is one of the key models of condensed matter physics, which holds a potential for explaining the mystery of high-temperature superconductivity. Recent progress in ultracold atoms in optical lattices has paved the way to studying the model's phase diagram using the tools of quantum simulation, which emerged as a promising alternative to the numerical calculations plagued by the infamous sign problem. However, the temperatures achieved using elaborate laser cooling protocols so far have been too high to show the appearance of antiferromagnetic and superconducting quantum phases directly. In this work, we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative quantum state engineering, one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order in present-day experiments with ultracold fermions. The core of the approach is to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic state emerges as the dark state of the driven-dissipative dynamics. In order to elucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two complementary techniques: Monte Carlo wave function simulations for small systems and a recently proposed variational method for open quantum systems, operating in the thermodynamic limit. The controlled dissipation channels described in this work are straightforward to add to already existing experimental setups.
