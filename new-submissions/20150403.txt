abstract: Quantum sensitivity is an important issue in the field of quantum metrology where sub-Planck scale structures play crucial role in the Heisenberg limited measurement. We investigate the mesoscopic superposition structures, particularly for well-known cat-like and compass-like states, in the rotating Morse system where sub-Planck scale structures originate in the dynamics of a suitably constructed SU(2) coherent state. A detail study of the sensitivity analysis reveals that rotational coupling in the vibrational wave packet can be used as a probe to enhance the sensitivity limit in a diatomic molecule. The maximum sensitivity limit is identified with the rotational amendment, and a quantitative measure of the angle of rotation for different rotational levels is also given. The correspondence of the numerical result with the angle of rotation is also delineated in phase-space Wigner representation.

abstract: Studies on symmetric extendibility of quantum states become especially important in a context of analysis of one-way quantum measures of entanglement, distilabillity and security of quantum protocols. In this paper we analyze composite systems containing a symmetric extendible part with a particular attention devoted to one-way security of such systems. Further, we introduce a new one-way monotone based on the best symmetric approximation of quantum state and differentiate symmetric extendibility into weak and strong type. We underpin those results with geometric observations on structures of multi-party settings which posses in sub-spaces substantial symmetric extendible components. Finally, we state a very important conjecture linking symmetric-extendibility with one-way distillability and security of all quantum states analyzing behavior of private key in neighborhood of symmetric extendible states.

abstract: A novel quantum imaging technique has recently been demonstrated in an experiment, where the photon used for illuminating an object is not detected; the image is obtained by interfering two beams, none of which ever interacts with the object. Here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the experiment. We show that the object information is present only in the interference term and not in the individual intensities of the interfering beams. We also theoretically establish that the magnification of the imaging system depends on two wavelengths: the average wavelength of the photon that illuminates the object and the average wavelength of the photon that is detected. Our analysis affirms that the imaging process is based on the principle that quantum interference occurs when interferometric path information is unavailable.

abstract: We formulate the adiabatic approximation for the imaginary-time Schroedinger equation. The obtained adiabatic condition consists of two inequalities, one of which coincides with the conventional adiabatic condition for the real-time Schroedinger equation, but the other does not. We apply this adiabatic approximation to the analysis of Markovian dynamics of the classical Ising model, which can be formulated as an imaginary-time Schroedinger equation, to obtain the asymptotic form of the probability that the system reaches the ground state in the limit of long annealing time in simulated annealing. Using this formula, we amend the theory of Somma, Batista and Ortiz for a convergence condition of simulated annealing.

abstract: A two-site Ising model is implemented as an injection-locked laser network consisting of a single master laser and two mutually coupled slave lasers. We observed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in the in-phase and out-of-phase couplings between the two slave lasers. Their phase difference is locked to either 0 or p even if the coupling path is continuously modulated. The system automatically selects the oscillation frequency to satisfy the in-phase or out-of-phase coupling condition, when the mutual coupling dominates over the injection-locking by the master laser.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the real-time emission spectrum of a two-level atom coupled to an optomechanical cavity (OMC). Using quantum trajectory approach we obtain the single-photon time-dependent spectrum in this hybrid system where the influence of a strong atom-cavity coupling and a strong optomechanical interaction are studied. We find a dressed state picture can explain the spectra by predicting the exact peak locations as well as the relative peak heights. In our analysis we also include the effect of mechanical losses (under weak mechanical damping limit) and single-photon loss through spontaneous emission from the two-level emitter.

abstract: We address the question of finding the most effective convex decompositions into boundary elements (so-called boundariness) for sets of quantum states, observables and channels. First we show that in general convex sets the boundariness essentially coincides with the question of the most distinguishable element, thus, providing an operational meaning for this concept. Unexpectedly, we discovered that for any interior point of the set of channels the optimal decomposition necessarily contains a unitary channel. In other words, for any given channel the best distinguishable one is some unitary channel. Further, we prove that boundariness is sub-multiplicative under composition of systems and explicitly evaluate its maximal value that is attained only for the most mixed elements of the considered convex structures.

abstract: It is still unclear how thermal states dynamically emerge from a microscopic quantum description. A complete understanding of the long time evolution of closed quantum systems may resolve the tension between a microscopic description and the one offered by equilibrium statistical mechanics. In an attempt in this direction, we consider a simple bipartite system (a quantum scalar field propagating in black-hole background) and study the evolution of the entanglement entropy --- by tracing over the degrees of freedom inside the event-horizon --- at different times. We define entanglement temperature which is similar to the one used in the microcanonical ensemble picture in statistical mechanics and show that (i) this temperature is a finite quantity while the entanglement entropy diverges and (ii) matches with the Hawking temperature for all several black-hole space-times. We also discuss the implications of our result for the laws of black-hole mechanics and eigen-state thermalization.

title: Entanglement entropy of composite fermions realized by (deformed) fermions vs. that of composite bosons

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: In our two preceding papers we studied bipartite composite boson (or quasiboson) systems through their realization in terms of deformed oscillators. Therein, the entanglement characteristics such as the entanglement entropy and purity were found and expressed, for both one-quasiboson and more complex states, through the parameter of deformation. In this work we initiate an analogous study of composite fermions for two major cases: (i) "boson + fermion" composites; (ii) "deformed-boson + fermion" composites. Both the entanglement entropy and purity of composite fermions are dealt with, their dependence on the relevant parameters established, and for some particular two- or three-mode cases depicted graphically. In a few special cases the entanglement entropy turns out to be constant $S_0=\ln 2$ (or $\ln 3$) or $S_0=0$, while in the rest of the cases which we considered it varies between zero and $\ln 2$ (or $\ln 3$).

abstract: We study the occurrence of errors in a continuously decoupled two-qubit state during a $\sqrt{SWAP}$ quantum operation under decoherence. We consider a realization of this quantum gate based on the Heisenberg exchange interaction, which alone suffices for achieving universal quantum computation. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous-dynamical-decoupling scheme that commutes with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian to protect it from the amplitude damping and dephasing errors caused by the system-environment interaction. We consider two error-protection settings. One protects the qubits from both amplitude damping and dephasing errors. The other features the amplitude damping as a residual error and protects the qubits from dephasing errors only. In both settings, we investigate the interaction of qubits with common and independent environments separately. We study how errors affect the entanglement and fidelity for different environmental spectral densities.

abstract: In the present work, we investigate the intrinsic relation between quantum fidelity susceptibility (QFS) and the dynamical structure factor. We give a concise proof of the QFS beyond the perturbation theory. With the QFS in the Lehmann representation, we point out that the QFS actually the negative-two-power moment of dynamical structure factor, and illuminate the inherent relation between physical quantities in the linear response theory. Moreover, we discuss the generalized fidelity susceptibility (GFS) of any quantum relevant operator, that may not be coupled to the driving parameter, present similar scaling behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that the QFS can not capture the fourth-order quantum phase transition in a spin-1/2 anisotropic XY chain in the transverse alternating field, while a lower-order GFS can seize the criticalities.

abstract: We review an explicit regularization of the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence, that preserves all isometries of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. This scheme is useful to characterize the space of the unitary evolution operators that describe the dynamics of the microstates of extremal black holes in four spacetime dimensions. Using techniques from algebraic number theory to evaluate the transition amplitudes, we remark that the regularization scheme expresses the fast quantum computation capability of black holes as well as its chaotic nature.

abstract: The numerical extraction of resonant states of open quantum systems is usually a difficult problem. Regularization techniques, such as the mapping to complex coordinates or the addition of Complex Absorbing Potentials are typically employed, as they render resonant wavefunctions localized and therefore normalizable. Physically relevant metastable states have energies that do not depend on the chosen regularization method. Their identification therefore involves cumbersome comparisons between multiple regularised calculations, often performed graphically, which require fine-tuning and specific intuition to avoid approximated, if not wrong, results. In this Letter, we define an operator that explicitly measures such invariance, valid for any arbitrary mapping of spatial coordinates. Resonant states of the system can eventually simply be identified evaluating the expectation value of this operator. Our method eases the extraction of resonant states even for numerical potentials that are difficult to scale to complex coordinates, and avoids the need for ad hoc complex absorbing potentials. We provide explicit evidence of our findings discussing one-dimensional case-studies,also in the presence of external electric fields.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00583
abstract: We consider the time-dependent bi-coherent states that are essentially the Gazeau-Klauder coherent states for the two dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator. Starting from some q-deformations of the oscillator algebra for which the entire deformed Fock space can be constructed explicitly, we define the q-deformed bi-coherent states. We verify the generalized Heisenberg's uncertainty relations projected onto these states. For the initial value in time the states are shown to satisfy a generalized version of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations. For the initial value in time and for the parameter of noncommutativity $\theta =0$, the inequalities are saturated for the simultaneous measurement of the position-momentum observables. When the time evolves the uncertainty products are different from their values at the initial time and do not always respect the generalized uncertainty relations.
