abstract: Device concepts in semiconductor spintronics make long spin lifetimes desirable, let alone the requirements put on spin control by schemes of quantum information processing. Alas, due to spin-orbit coupling electron spins in semiconductors are generically subject to rather fast decoherence. In two-dimensional quantum wells, however, the spin-orbit interaction can be engineered in such a way that persistent spin structures with extraordinary long spin lifetimes arise even in the presence of disorder and imperfections. We review experimental and theoretical developments on that matter both for n-doped and p-doped structures, and we discuss possible device applications.
