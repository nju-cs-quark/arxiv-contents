abstract: Bell inequalities (BIs) derived in terms of quantum probability statistics are extended to general bipartite-entangled states of arbitrary spins with parallel polarization. The original formula of Bell for the two-spin singlet is slightly modi?ed in the parallel con?guration, while, the inequality for- mulated by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt remains not changed. The violation of BIs indeed resulted from the quantum non-local correlation for spin-1=2 case. However, the inequalities are always sat- is?ed for the spin-1 entangled states regardless of parallel or antiparallel polarizations of two spins. The spin parity e?ect originally demonstrated with the antiparallel spin-polarizations (Mod. Phys. Lett. B28, 145004) still exists for the parallel case. The quantum non-locality does not lead to the violation for integer spins due to the cancellation of non-local interference e?ects by the quantum statistical-average. Again the violation of BIs seems a result of the measurement induced nontrivial Berry-phase for half-integer spins.

abstract: Dicke's original thought experiment with two spins coupled to a photon mode has recently been experimentally realized. We propose extending this experiment to N spins and show that it naturally gives rise to highly entangled states. In particular, it gives rise to dark states which have resonating valence bond (RVB) character. We first consider a system of N two level spins in a cavity with only one spin in the excited state. This initial state is a linear combination of a dark state and a bright state. We point out the dark state is a coherent superposition of singlets with resonating valence bond character. We show that the coupling to the photon mode takes the spin system into a mixed state with an entangled density matrix. We next consider an initial state with half of the spins in the excited state. We show that there is a non-zero probability for this to collapse into a dark state with RVB character. In the lossy cavity limit, if no photon is detected within several decay time periods, we may deduce that the spin system has collapsed onto the dark RVB state. We show that the probability for this scales as 2/N, making it possible to generate RVB states of 20 spins or more.

abstract: A minimal approach to the measurement problem and the quantum-to-classical transition assumes a universally valid quantum formalism, i.e. unitary time evolution governed by a Schr\"odinger-type equation. As had been pointed out long ago, in this view the measurement process can be described by decoherence which results in a "Many-Worlds" or "Many-Minds" scenario according to Everett and Zeh. A silent assumption for decoherence to proceed is however, that there exists incomplete information about the environment our object system gets entangled with in the measurement process. This paper addresses the question where this information is traced out and - by adopting recent approaches to model consciousness in neuroscience - argues that a rigorous interpretation results in a modern perspective on the von-Neumann-Wigner interpretation - namely that the information that is or is not available in the consciousness of the observer is crucial for the definition of the environment. As such the quantum-to-classical transition while being difficult or impossible to probe in physics may become testable in psychology.

abstract: The interaction of a quantum system with its environment causes decoherence, setting a fundamental limit on the suitability of a system for quantum information processing. However, we show that if the quantum system consists of coupled parts with different internal energy scales then the interaction of one part with a thermal bath need not lead to loss of coherence from the other. Remarkably, we find that the protected part can become more coherent when the coupling to the bath becomes stronger or the temperature is raised. Our theory will enable the design of decoherence-resistant hybrid quantum computers.

abstract: We study the behavior of a single laser-driven trapped ion inside a microscopic optical Fabry-Perot cavity. In particular, we demonstrate a fiber Fabry-Perot cavity operating on the principal $S_{1/2}\to P_{1/2}$ electric dipole transition of an Yb$^+$ ion at $369\,$nm with an atom-ion coupling strength of $g=2\pi\times 67(1)\,$MHz. We employ the cavity to study the generation of single photons and observe cavity-induced back-action in the Purcell-enhanced emission of photons. Tuning of the amplitude and phase of the back-action allows us to enhance or suppress the total rate of photoemission from the ion-cavity system.

abstract: The De Moivre-Laplace theorem applied to a Galton board says that probability distribution of $N$ balls over output bins takes a Gaussian form as $N\to \infty$. A quantum version of the theorem for $N$ noninteracting indistinguishable bosons (fermions) in a unitary $M$-mode network is discovered: the average probability distribution of particles over bins in a random network converges to a Gaussian law as $N\to\infty$, where their quantum statistics enters through the particle density $N/M$. The quantum De Moivre-Laplace theorem applies to an arbitrary partition of output modes into small number of bins and, moreover, for a given network with averaging over allowed input configurations. For $N\gg 1$ the Gaussian law is a good approximation for an exact probability distribution over bins in a network without symmetries. In the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$ a finite difference in probability in a random network between indistinguishable bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles is possible only at a non-vanishing particle density and occurs for a singular binning of output events.

abstract: We present a scheme, based on Gilbert's algorithm for quadratic minimization [SIAM J. Contrl., vol. 4, pp. 61-80, 1966], to prove separation between a point and an arbitrary convex set $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via calls to an oracle able to perform linear optimizations over $S$. Compared to other methods, our scheme has almost negligible memory requirements and the number of calls to the optimization oracle does not depend on the dimensionality $n$ of the underlying space. We study the speed of convergence of the scheme under different promises on the shape of the set $S$ and/or the location of the point, validating the accuracy of our theoretical bounds with numerical examples. Finally, we present some applications of the scheme in quantum information theory. There we find that our algorithm out-performs existing linear programming methods for certain large scale problems, allowing us to certify nonlocality in bipartite scenarios with upto $42$ measurement settings. We apply the algorithm to upper bound the visibility of two-qubit Werner states, hence improving known lower bounds on Grothendieck's constant $K_G(3)$. Similarly, we compute new upper bounds on the visibility of GHZ states and on the steerability limit of Werner states for a fixed number of measurement settings.

abstract: Multi-dimensional entanglement offers interesting possibilities in quantum information e.g. quantum cryptography. Here we report the characterization of two-photon multi-dimensional energy-time entanglement between many temporal modes, after one photon has been stored in a solid-state quantum memory. We develop a method for entanglement quantification which makes use of only very sparse data, namely coincidences in the time-of-arrival basis and coherences between two neighboring temporal modes. This allows us to certify that the quantum state after storage in our experiment features at least 1.18 ebits of entanglement of formation. The theoretical methods we develop can be readily extended to a wide range of experimental platforms, while our experimental results demonstrate the suitability of energy-time multi-dimensional entanglement for a quantum repeater architecture.

abstract: The Schmidt number is a fundamental parameter characterizing the properties of quantum states, and the local projections are a fundamental operation in quantum physics. We investigate the relation between the Schmidt numbers of bipartite states and their projected states. We show that there exist bipartite positive-partial-transpose (PPT) entangled states of any given Schmidt number. We further construct the notion of joint Schmidt number for multipartite states, and its relation with the Schmidt number of bipartite reduced density operators.

authors: Fu-Lin Zhang, Teng Wang
comments: 6 pages with 4 figures

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.05134
abstract: We study the procedure to unambiguously discriminate two nonorthogonal states of a qubit $S$, prepared in an entangled state with another one $C$, and assisted by an auxiliary system $A$. The initial coherence between $S$ and $C$ enhances the optimal success probability, and provides the total intrinsic coherence required in the tripartite process. We show that, the transformations between different contributions of intrinsic coherence increase with the overlap between the two states to recognize, and are influenced by the genuine tripartite coherence generated in this precess. The later depends on the phase of the inner product of two parts of the initial entangled state, the Berry phase $\gamma$. The process with $\gamma=0$ or $\pi$ is a key step of the probabilistic teleportation protocol. Entanglement of the quantum channel increases the total tripartite intrinsic coherence, but decreases the contribution between the bipartition of $A:SC$, which characterizes the reliance on an ancilla of the procedure.

abstract: We consider the dynamics of strongly localized systems subject to dephasing noise with arbitrary correlation time. Although noise inevitably induces delocalization, transport in the noise-induced delocalized phase is subdiffusive in a parametrically large intermediate-time window. We argue for this intermediate-time subdiffusive regime both analytically and using numerical simulations on single-particle localized systems. Furthermore, we show that normal diffusion is restored in the long-time limit, through processes analogous to variable-range hopping. Our qualitative conclusions are also valid for interacting systems in the many-body localized phase.

abstract: We investigate combined effects of nontrivial topology, induced by a cosmic string, and boundaries on the fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor for a massive fermionic field. As geometry of boundaries we consider two plates perpendicular to the string axis on which the field is constrained by the MIT bag boundary condition. By using the Abel-Plana type summation formula, the VEVs in the region between the plates are decomposed into the boundary-free and boundary-induced contributions for general case of the planar angle deficit. The boundary-induced parts in both the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor vanish on the cosmic string. Fermionic condensate is positive near the string and negative al large distances, whereas the vacuum energy density is negative everywhere. The radial stress is equal to the energy density. For a massless field, the boundary-induced contribution in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero in the region between the plates only and it does not depend on the coordinate along the string axis. In the region between the plates and at large distances from the string, the decay of the topological part is exponential for both massive and massless fields. This behavior is in contrast to that for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the boundary-free geometry with the power law decay for a massless field. The vacuum pressure on the plates is inhomogeneous and vanishes at the location of the string. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive.

We also generalize some Welch--type inequalities from the literature.

abstract: The Casimir force is a universal interaction induced by electromagnetic quantum fluctuations between any types of objects. The expansion of the graphene family by adding silicene, germanene, and stanene, 2D allotropes of Si, Ge, and Sn, lands itself as a platform to probe Dirac-like physics in honeycomb staggered systems in such a ubiquitous interaction. We discover Casimir force phase transitions between these staggered 2D materials induced by the complex interplay between Dirac physics, spin-orbit coupling, and externally applied fields. In particular, we find that the interaction energy experiences different power law distance decays, magnitudes, and dependences on characteristic physical constants. Furthermore, due to the topological properties of these materials, repulsive and quantized Casimir interactions become possible.
