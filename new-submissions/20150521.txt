abstract: We develop a dynamic description of an effective Dirac theory in metamaterials, in which the wavefunction is modeled by the corresponding electric and magnetic field in the metamaterial. This electro-magnetic field can be probed in the experimental setup, which means that the wavefunction of the effective theory is directly accessible by measurement. Our model is based on a plane wave expansion, which ravels the identification of Dirac spinors with single-frequency excitations of the electro-magnetic field in the metamaterial. The characteristic Zitterbewegung is shown to emerge in simulations of the effective theory and we verify this signature with an analytic solution.

abstract: A model of reality is called separable if the state of a composite system is equal to the union of the states of its parts, located in different regions of space. Spekkens has argued that it is trivial to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics using a separable ontological model, provided one allows for arbitrary violations of `dynamical locality'. However, since dynamical locality is strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of whether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and dynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an ontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the original formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that measurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can alternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's theorem does apply. We find that the resulting model violates local causality, but satisfies both separability and dynamical locality, making it a candidate for the `most local' ontological model of quantum mechanics.

abstract: A new form to construct complex superpotentials that produce real energy spectra in supersymmetric quantum mechanics is presented. This is based on the relation between the nonlinear Ermakov equation and a second order differential equation of the Schrodinger type. The superpotentials so constructed are characterized by the Ermakov parameters in such a way that they are always complex-valued. As applications we construct new supersymmetric partners of the free particle potential that include complex periodic PT-symmetric potentials as well as complex regular PT-symmetric potentials of the Poschl-Teller form. We also construct new complex oscillators with real frequencies that have the energies of the harmonic oscillator plus an additional real eigenvalue.

abstract: A cavity QED implementation of the non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces is proposed with nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled commonly to the whispering-gallery mode of a microsphere cavity, where a universal set of quantum gates can be realized on the qubits. In our implementation, with the assistant of the appropriate driving fields, the quantum evolution is insensitive to the cavity field state, which is only virtually excited. The implemented non-adiabatic holonomies, utilizing optical transitions in the {\Lambda} type of three-level configuration of the nitrogen-vacancy centers, can be used to construct a universal set of quantum gates on the encoded logical qubits. Therefore, our scheme opens up the possibility of realizing universal holonomic quantum computation with cavity assisted interaction on solid-state spins characterized by long coherence times.

We formally define Quantum Cheque and present the first Unconditionally Secure Quantum Cheque Scheme based on quantum one way functions and the monogamy of entanglement. The proposed Quantum Cheque can be stored in physical devices equipped with quantum memory as well as be streamed in the anticipated quantum internet via quantum channels, possibly without the necessity of quantum memories.

abstract: We study the quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems, especially the infinite dimensional bosonic systems in Fock space. We show that given the energy constraints, the relative entropy of coherence serves as a well-defined quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems. Via using the relative entropy of coherence, we also generalize the problem to multi-mode Fock space and special examples are considered. It is shown that with a finite average particle number, increasing the number of modes of light can enhance the relative entropy of coherence. With the mean energy constraint, our results can also be extended to other infinite-dimensional systems.

abstract: Quantum optics is a field of research based on the quantum theory of light. Here, we show that the classical theory of light can be equally effective in explaining a cornerstone of quantum optics: the quantization of the free radiation field. The quantization lies at the heart of quantum optics and has never been obtained classically. Instead, we find it by taking into account the degeneracy of the spherical harmonics that appear in multipole terms of the ordinary Maxwell theory of the free electromagnetic field. In this context, the number of energy quanta is determined by a finite countable set of spherical harmonics of higher order than the fundamental (monopole). This one plays, instead, the role of the electromagnetic vacuum that, contrary to the common view, has its place in the classical theory of light.

abstract: Optimal control theory is a powerful tool for solving control problems in quantum mechanics, ranging from the control of chemical reactions to the implementation of gates in a quantum computer. Gradient-based optimization methods are able to find high fidelity controls, but require considerable numerical effort and often yield highly complex solutions. We propose here to employ a two-stage optimization scheme to significantly speed up convergence and achieve simpler controls. The control is initially parametrized using only a few free parameters, such that optimization in this pruned search space can be performed with a simplex method. The result, considered now simply as an arbitrary function on a time grid, is the starting point for further optimization with a gradient-based method that can quickly converge to high fidelities. We illustrate the success of this hybrid technique by optimizing a holonomic phasegate for two superconducting transmon qubits coupled with a shared transmission line resonator, showing that a combination of Nelder-Mead simplex and Krotov's method yields considerably better results than either one of the two methods alone.

abstract: The impact of disorder in the vibrational bath of an ensemble of open quantum systems is explored, arising either from variation in the overall coupling strength or from uncertainty in the shape of the environment spectral function. Such disorder leads to an additional source of decoherence of subsystem ensembles, due to variation in the reorganization energy. Additionally, vibrational disorder induces a shift in the oscillation frequency of the coherence between ground and excited states. This shift is temperature dependent, and in the high temperature limit $\delta \omega \propto T$. This latter finding could be of particular relevance to biological systems exhibiting long lived coherences in highly disordered environments, where temperature-dependent quantum beats have been observed.

abstract: We argue first that translational invariant Matrix Product can be interpreted as a stationary sea of particles. Next, rather than starting from some local Hamiltonian with random potentials, we consider fluctuations of the local tensors of a continuous one-parameter family of Matrix Product States. This leads to a mapping from 1+1+0 to 0+1+1, being time-space-$\lambda$. We argue that both pictures are equivalent. Finally, the holography principle and an operational argumentation is used to map the problem onto 1+0+1. Localization in 1-dimension, can be understood from a simple study spectral and mixing properties of finite dimensional quantum channels.

abstract: We demonstrate how to implement extremely high-dimensional compressive imaging on a bi-photon probability distribution. When computationally reconstructing the two-party system, compressive imaging requires a sensing matrix that may drastically exceed practical limits for conventional computers. These limitations are virtually eliminated via fast-Hadamard transform Kronecker-based compressive sensing. We list, in detail, the operations necessary to implement this method and provide an experimental demonstration in which we measure and reconstruct a 16.8 million-dimensional bi-photon probability distribution. Instead of requiring over a year to raster scan or over 2 terabytes of computer memory to perform a reconstruction, we performed the experiment in approximately twenty hours, required between 8 and 32 gigabytes of computer memory, and reconstructed the full distribution in approximately twenty minutes.

abstract: We argue that the dimensionality of the space of quantum systems' states should be considered as a legitimate resource for quantum information tasks. The assertion is supported by the fact that quantum states with discord-like capacities can be obtained from classically correlated states in spaces of dimension large enough. We illustrate things with some simple examples that justify our claim.

abstract: Long-range order in quantum many-body systems is usually associated with equilibrium situations. Here, we experimentally investigate the quasicondensation of strongly-interacting bosons at finite momenta in a far-from-equilibrium case. We prepare an inhomogeneous initial state consisting of one-dimensional Mott insulators in the center of otherwise empty one-dimensional chains in an optical lattice with a lattice constant $d$. After suddenly quenching the trapping potential to zero, we observe the onset of coherence in spontaneously forming quasicondensates in the lattice. Remarkably, the emerging phase order differs from the ground-state order and is characterized by peaks at finite momenta $\pm (\pi/2) (\hbar / d)$ in the momentum distribution function.

abstract: We observe Wannier-Stark localization in curved photonic lattices, realized using arrays of evanescently coupled optical waveguides. By correctly tuning the strength of inter-site coupling in the lattice, we observe that Wannier-Stark states become increasingly localized, and eventually fully localized to one site, as the curvature of the lattice is increased. We then demonstrate that tunneling can be successfully restored in the lattice by applying a sinusoidal modulation to the lattice position, an effect that is a direct analogue of photon-assisted tunneling. This precise tuning of the tunneling matrix elements, through laser-fabricated on-site modulations, opens a novel route for the creation of gauge fields in photonic lattices.

abstract: Coulomb crystals composed of atomic ions and molecular ions are an ideal system for performing high-precision spectroscopy with applications in astrochemistry and fundamental physics. Here we show that this same system can be coupled with a broadband laser to discover new molecular transitions. We use three-ion chains of Ca$^{+}$ and CaH$^{+}$ to observe vibrational transitions via resonance enhanced multiphoton dissociation detected by Ca$^{+}$ fluorescence. Based on theoretical calculations, we assign the observed peaks to the transition from the ground vibrational state, $\nu=0$, to $\nu=9$ and $\nu=10$. Our method allows us to track single molecular events, and it can be extended to work with any molecule by using normal mode frequency shifts to detect the dissociation. This survey spectroscopy serves as a bridge to the precision spectroscopy required for molecular ion control.

abstract: It shown that the five Regge transformations act as a spectrometric splitter on any 6-j symbol. Four unknown partitions are brought out: S4(0), S4(1), S(2) and S4(5). They are stable subsets, with well defined parameters depending only on triangles and quadrangles. These findings are easily generalized to super 6-jS symbols, properly labelled by their own parity alpha, beta, gamma. Super Regge symmetry is reduced only for beta where S4(2), S4(5) vanish. In addition, all tools for computing exact values of any 6-jS are provided.

abstract: The prospect of coherent dynamics and excitonic delocalization across several light-harvesting structures in photosynthetic membranes is of considerable interest, but challenging to explore experimentally. Here we demonstrate theoretically that the excitonic delocalization across extended domains involving several light-harvesting complexes can lead to unambiguous signatures in the optical response, specifically, linear absorption spectra. We characterize, under experimentally established conditions of molecular assembly and protein-induced inhomogeneities, the optical absorption in these arrays from polarized and unpolarized excitation, and demonstrate that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the coherent coupling among iso-energetic light-harvesting structures. The knowledge of these couplings would then provide further insight into the dynamical properties of transfer, such as facilitating the accurate determination of F\"orster rates.
