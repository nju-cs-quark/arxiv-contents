abstract: The goal of this study is to provide an exact unitary quantum cellular automata that, under discrete time steps, converges towards the Generalized Dirac Equation (GDE) in the continuum limit. The evolutionary rules for such a single particle walk are discussed in this paper, and it is shown that this quantum celluar automata will maintain similar properties to the GDE.

abstract: Random local measurements have recently been proposed to construct entanglement witnesses and thereby detect the presence of bipartite entanglement. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of one such scheme on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor. We show that a set of three random local measurements suffices to detect the entanglement of a general two-qubit state. We experimentally generate states with different amounts of entanglement, and show that the scheme is able to clearly witness entanglement. We perform complete quantum state tomography for each state and compute state fidelity to validate our results. Further, we extend previous results and perform a simulation using random local measurements to optimally detect bipartite entanglement in a hybrid system of $2\otimes 3$ dimensionality.

abstract: High quality factor coplanar resonators are critical elements in superconducting quantum circuits. We describe the design, fabrication and measurement of stepped impedance resonators (SIRs), which have more compact size than commonly used uniform impedance resonators (UIRs). With properly chosen impedance ratio, SIRs can be much shorter in total length than that of UIRs. Two kinds of designs containing both SIRs and UIRs are fabricated and measured. The power dependence of the extracted internal quality factors (Qi) for all the resonators indicated that SIRs and UIRs had comparable performance at high incident power. However, as the incident power decreased, the internal quality factor of SIRs decreased much slower than that of UIRs. All the SIRs in design I kept near half-million Qi at single-photon level, while the two UIRs on the same chip decreased heavily to less than $2\times10^5$. These results indicate potential advantages of SIRs in quantum computer architectures: they consume less space than UIRs, while perform excellent under single-photon level. The resonators in design II were measured under a large residual magnetic field. The measured results showed that the internal quality factor of all the SIRs and UIRs were more or less suppressed. Such behavior confirmed that trapped vortices in the coplanar resonators provide another loss channel.

abstract: We study remote creation of coherence (RCC) for a quantum system, A, with the help of quantum operations on another system, B, and one-way classical communication.We show that all the nonincoherent quantum states are useful for RCC and all the incoherent-quantum states are not. The necessary and sufficient conditions of RCC for the quantum operations on system B are presented for pure states. The upper bound of average RCC is derived, giving a relation among the entanglement (concurrence), the RCC of the given quantum state, and the RCC of the corresponding maximally entangled state. Moreover, for two-qubit systems we find a simple factorization law for the average remote-created coherence.

abstract: We examine the propagation of a weak probe light through a coherently driven $Y$-type system. Under the condition that the excited atomic levels decay via same vacuum modes, the effects of quantum interference in decay channels are considered. It is found that the interference in decay channels results in a lossless anomalous dispersion between two gain peaks. We demonstrate that the probe pulse propagation can in principle be switched from subluminal to superluminal due to the decay-induced interference. We also show that the system exhibits a high index of refraction with negligible absorption for the driving fields. A dressed-state picture of the atom-light interaction is described to explain the numerical results.

abstract: A small quantum system is studied which is a superposition of states localized in different positions in a static gravitational field. The time evolution of the correlation between different positions is investigated, and it is seen that there are two time scales for such an evolution (decoherence). Both time scales are inversely proportional to the red shift difference between the two points. These time scales correspond to decoherences which are linear and quadratic, respectively, in time.

abstract: The effect of non-orthogonality of an entangled non-orthogonal state based quantum channel is investigated in detail in the context of the teleportation of a qubit. Specifically, average fidelity, minimum fidelity and minimum assured fidelity (MASFI) are obtained for teleportation of a single qubit state using all the Bell type entangled non-orthogonal states known as quasi Bell states. Using Horodecki criterion, it is shown that the teleportation scheme obtained by replacing the quantum channel (Bell state) of the usual teleportation scheme by a quasi Bell state is optimal. Further, the performance of various quasi Bell states as teleportation channel is compared in an ideal situation (i.e., in the absence of noise) and under different noise models (e.g., amplitude and phase damping channels). It is observed that the best choice of the quasi Bell state depends on the amount non-orthogonality, both in noisy and noiseless case. A specific quasi Bell state, which was found to be maximally entangled in the ideal conditions, is shown to be less efficient as a teleportation channel compared to other quasi Bell states in particular cases when subjected to noisy channels. It has also been observed that usually the value of average fidelity falls with an increase in the number of qubits exposed to noisy channels (viz., Alice's, Bob's and to be teleported qubits), but the converse may be observed in some particular cases.

abstract: Encoding qubits in multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system allows less-decoherence quantum information processing with much less quantum resources. We present a compact and scalable quantum circuit to determinately implement a hyper-parallel controlled-controlled-phase-flip (hyper-$\rm{C^2PF}$) gate on a three-photon system in both the polarization and spatial DOFs. In contrast with the one with many qubits encoding in one DOF only, our hyper-$\rm{C^2PF}$ gate operating two independent $\rm{C^2PF}$ gates on a three-photon system with less decoherence, and reduces the quantum resources required in quantum information processing by a half. Additional photons, necessary for many approaches, are not required in the present scheme. Our calculation shows that this hyper-$\rm{C^2PF}$ gate is feasible in experiment.

abstract: We propose a new classification for the entanglement in graph states based on generalized con- currence. The numerical results indicate that the eight different three-qubit graph states in three categories, 64 four-qubit graph states in five categories and 1024 five-qubit graph states are in ten classes. We also compare this classification with equivalence classes of these graph states under local complementation (LC) operator, and the obtained result suggests that classification by generalized concurrence is not in contradiction with the LC-rule.

abstract: Slow swift electrons with low self-inertia interact differently with matter and light in comparison with their relativistic counterparts: they are easily recoiled, reflected, and also diffracted form optical gratings and nanostructures. As a consequence, they can be also better manipulated into the desired shape. For example, they get bunched quite fast in interaction with acceleration gratings in presence of an external electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon which can be desirable in development of superradiant coherent light sources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior of pulsed electron wave packets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and optical gratings, using a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which is introduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very fast in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a synchronicity condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely deflected from the grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is necessary. It is found that even in this configuration, diffraction due to the interaction of the electron with the standing-wave light inside the gap between the gratings, is a source of defocusing. Moreover, the longitudinal broadening of the electron pulse directly affects the final shape of the electron wave packet due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon scatterings. These investigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient electron-driven photon sources and accelerators.

abstract: We compare the irreversible work produced in an infinitesimal sudden quench of a quantum system at zero temperature with its ground state fidelity susceptibility, giving an explicit relation between the two quantities. We find that the former is proportional to the latter but for an extra term appearing in the irreversible work which includes also contributions from the excited states. We calculate explicitly the two quantities in the case of the quantum Ising chain, showing that at criticality they exhibit different scaling behavior. The irreversible work, rescaled by square of the quench's amplitude, exhibits a divergence slower than the fidelity susceptibility one. As a consequence, the two quantities obey also different finite-size scaling relations.

abstract: How small can a thermal bath be? Can the smallest baths properly drive microscopic heat machines? A closed small quantum system that includes both the machine and the baths will have recurrences and oscillate in time between engine and refrigerator operation. We show that these oscillations can be eliminated by inducing a partial Zeno effect via external dephasing of the baths. The machine keeps operating as a quantum heat machine until a global steady state is achieved with zero energy flows. Experimentally, dephasing is often easy to implement, and therefore it can be considered as a "free operation". We show analytically that in the limit of strong dephasing the dynamics of a system connected to a Zeno bath is Markovian - regardless of how small the bath is. In addition, we derived a simple reduced equation that accurately describes the non-Markovian dynamics in short evolution time or when the dephasing is weak. When starting out of equilibrium the Zeno bath monotonically relaxes to a generalized Gibbs state that maximizes the entropy under the constraints of the relevant conservation laws. These generalized Gibbs states contain information on classical correlations inside the bath. Despite the role of this correlation in entropy dynamics, we show that Carnot theorem and the standard second law still hold without any alteration. Present technology seems to be sufficient for the construction of such baths in various physical systems. Zeno baths can be used as a fundamental building block in experiments in quantum thermodynamics and stochastic thermodynamics. In addition, these baths give rise to new theoretical questions and challenges.

abstract: Compared with a qubit, a qutrit (i.e., three-level quantum system) has a larger Hilbert space and thus can be used to encode more information in quantum information processing and communication. Here, we propose a scheme to transfer an arbitrary quantum state between two flux qutrits coupled to two resonators. This scheme is simple because it only requires two basic operations. The state-transfer operation can be performed fast because of using resonant interactions only. Numerical simulations show that high-fidelity transfer of quantum states between the two qutrits is feasible with current circuit-QED technology. This scheme is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the same task for other solid-state qutrits coupled to resonators.

As an illustration of our formulas we have applied them to two exactly solvable problems and to a nontrivial problem.

abstract: The discovery of the intriguing phenomenon that certain kinds of quantum correlations remain impervious to noise up to a specific point in time and then suddenly decay, has generated immense recent interest. We exploit dynamical decoupling sequences to prolong the persistence of time-invariant quantum discord in a system of two NMR qubits decohering in independent dephasing environments. We experimentally prepare two-qubit Bell-diagonal quantum states that interact with individual dephasing channels and demonstrate the effect of dynamical decoupling on the preservation of both quantum and classical correlations. We are able to freeze quantum discord over long time scales in the presence of noise, using dynamical decoupling. We use robust state-independent dynamical decoupling schemes for state preservation and demonstrate that these schemes are able to successfully preserve quantum discord.

abstract: We theoretically investigate optical detection of a weak classical force acting on a free particle in a dissipative coupling optomechanical system with a degenerate parametric amplifier (PA). We show that the PA allows one to achieve the force sensitivity far better than the standard quantum limit (SQL) over a broad range of the detection frequencies. The improvement depends on the parametric gain and the driving power. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the mechanical damping and the thermal noise on the force sensitivity. We find that the robustness of the force sensitivity much better than the SQL against the mechanical damping and the thermal noise is achievable in the presence of the PA with a high parametric gain. For the temperature $T = 1$ K, the improvement in sensitivity is better by a factor of about 20 when the driving power is set at a value corresponding to the SQL with no PA.

In particular, we show that measurements with two probes reveal the system's non-local two-point density correlations, for probe-system contact interactions. We illustrate our findings with analytic and numerical calculations for the Bose-Hubbard model in the weakly and strongly-interacting regimes, in conditions relevant to ongoing experiments in cold atom systems.

abstract: We introduce a diversity extraction for multicarrier continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD). The diversity extraction utilizes the resources that are injected into the transmission by the additional degrees of freedom of the multicarrier modulation. The multicarrier scheme granulates the information into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and divides the physical link into several Gaussian sub-channels for the transmission. We prove that the exploitable extra degree of freedom in a multicarrier CVQKD scenario significantly extends the possibilities of single-carrier CVQKD. The diversity extraction allows for the parties to reach decreased error probabilities by utilizing those extra resources of a multicarrier transmission that are not available in a single-carrier CVQKD setting. The additional resources of multicarrier CVQKD allow the achievement of significant performance improvements that are particularly crucial in an experimental scenario.

abstract: We define an iterative error-minimizing secret key adapting method for multicarrier CVQKD. A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CVs) for the transmission. The proposed method allows for the parties to reach a given target secret key rate with minimized error rate through the Gaussian sub-channels by a sub-channel adaption procedure. The adaption algorithm iteratively determines the optimal transmit conditions to achieve the target secret key rate and the minimal error rate over the sub-channels. The solution requires no complex calculations or computational tools, allowing for easy implementation for experimental CVQKD scenarios.

abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a universal model for quantum computation. The combinatorial characterisation of determinism in this model, powered by measurements, and hence, fundamentally probabilistic, is the cornerstone of most of the breakthrough results in this field. The most general known sufficient condition for a deterministic MBQC to be driven is that the underlying graph of the computation has a particular kind of flow called Pauli flow. The necessity of the Pauli flow was an open question. We show that the Pauli flow is necessary for real-MBQC, and not in general providing counterexamples for (complex) MBQC. We explore the consequences of this result for real MBQC and its applications. Real MBQC and more generally real quantum computing is known to be universal for quantum computing. Real MBQC has been used for interactive proofs by McKague. The two-prover case corresponds to real-MBQC on bipartite graphs. While (complex) MBQC on bipartite graphs are universal, the universality of real MBQC on bipartite graphs was an open question. We show that real bipartite MBQC is not universal proving that all measurements of real bipartite MBQC can be parallelised leading to constant depth computations. As a consequence, McKague techniques cannot lead to two-prover interactive proofs.

abstract: Even if the parameters determining a system's state are varied smoothly, the behavior of quantum correlations alike to quantum discord, and of its classical counterparts, can be very peculiar, with the appearance of non-analyticities in its rate of change. Here we review this sudden change phenomenon (SCP) discussing some important points related to it: Its uncovering, interpretations, and experimental verifications, its use in the context of the emergence of the pointer basis in a quantum measurement process, its appearance and universality under Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, its theoretical and experimental investigation in some other physical scenarios, and the related phenomenon of double sudden change of trace distance discord. Several open questions are identified, and we envisage that in answering them we will gain significant further insight about the relation between the SCP and the symmetry-geometric aspects of the quantum state space.

We also present a possible realization of the corresponding spin chain with a one-dimensional ensemble of cold atoms with strong contact interactions.

We introduce a real-space picture and argue which coupling terms may arise in leading order in the spatial derivatives. This picture allows us to discuss quantum noise, dissipation, and the correct boundary conditions at the waveguide entrance. The connections both to optomechanical arrays as well as to the theory of Brillouin scattering in waveguides are highlighted. We identify the 'strong coupling regime' of continuum optomechanics that may be accessible in future experiments.

We pass atoms, also subject to decay, through the cavity and surprisingly show that both decays allow the measurement of $s$-parametrized quasiprobability distributions. In fact, if we consider only atomic decay, we show that the Wigner function may be reconstructed. Because these distributions contain whole information of the initial field state, it is possible to recover information after both atomic and field decays occur.

abstract: A fiber-integrated spectrograph for single-photon pulses based upon frequency-to-time mapping, implemented by chromatic group delay dispersion (GDD), and precise temporally-resolved single photon counting is presented. A chirped fiber Bragg grating provides low-loss GDD mapping the frequency distribution of an input pulse onto the temporal envelope of the output pulse. Time-resolved detection with fast single-photon-counting modules enables the monitoring of the 825 nm to 835 nm wavelength range with nearly uniform efficiency with 55 pm resolution (24 GHz at 830 nm). To demonstrate the versatility of this technique spectral interference of heralded single photons and the joint spectral intensity distribution of a photon-pair source are measured. This approach to single-photon-level spectral measurements provides a route to realize applications of time-frequency quantum optics at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, where multiple spectral channels must be simultaneously monitored.

Established approaches to light pulse atom interferometry rely on laser cooling to concentrate a large ensemble of atoms into a velocity class resonant with the atom optical light pulse. In our experiment, we show that clear interference signals may be obtained without laser cooling. This effect relies on the Doppler selectivity of the atom interferometer resonance. This interferometer may be configured to measure accelerations, and we demonstrate that multiple interferometers may be operated simultaneously by addressing multiple velocity classes.

Using numerical simulations, we calculated the bit error rate taking into account parameter mismatch noise and Gaussian noise in the input optical power. The conditions for error rate of up to 15% during key generation are shown.

We describe this set in two ways. First, as a quotient space of (a subset of) the $rd_B\times d_A$ dimensional Stiefel manifold. Secondly, as the set of all Choi-states of a fixed rank $r$. These two descriptions are topologically equivalent. This allows us to show that the set of all Choi-states corresponding to extreme channels from system $A$ to system $B$ of a fixed Kraus rank $r$ is a smooth submanifold of dimension $2rd_Ad_B-d_A^2-r^2$ of the set of all Choi-states of rank $r$. As an application, we derive a lower bound on the number of parameters required for a quantum circuit topology to be able to approximate all extreme channels from $A$ to $B$ arbitrarily well.

title: Scalable orbital-angular-momentum sorting without destroying photon states

abstract: Single photons with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have attracted substantial attention from researchers. A single photon can carry infinite OAM values theoretically. Thus, OAM photon states have been widely used in quantum information and fundamental quantum mechanics. Although there have been many methods for sorting quantum states with different OAM values, the nondestructive and efficient sorter of high-dimensional OAM remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a scalable OAM sorter which can categorize different OAM states simultaneously, meanwhile, preserving both OAM and spin angular momentum. Fundamental elements of the sorter are composed of symmetric multiport beam splitters (BSs) and Dove prisms with cascading structure, which in principle can be flexibly and effectively combined to sort arbitrarily high-dimensional OAM photons. The scalable structures proposed here greatly reduce the number of BSs required for sorting high-dimensional OAMstates. In view of the nondestructive and extensible features, the sorters can be used as fundamental devices not only for high-dimensional quantum information processing, but also for traditional optics.

abstract: We study the generation and propagation of local perturbations in a quantum many-body spin system. In particular, we study the Ising model in transverse field in the presence of a local field defect at one edge. This system possesses a rich phase diagram with different regions characterized by the presence of one or two Majorana zero modes. We show that their localized character {\it i}) enables a characterization of the Ising phase transition through a local-only measurement performed on the edge spin, and {\it ii}) strongly affects the propagation of quasiparticles emitted after the sudden removal of the defect, so that the dynamics of the local magnetization show clear deviations from a ballistic behavior in presence of the Majorana fermions.

abstract: We investigate tunneling behavior between two bright solitons in a Bose-Einstein condensate with attractive contact interactions between atoms. The explicit tunneling properties including tunneling particles and oscillation period are described analytically, which indicates that the periodic tunneling form is a nonlinear Josephson type oscillation. The results suggest that the breathing behavior of solitons comes from the tunneling mechanism in an effective double-well potential, which is quite different from the modulational instability mechanism for Akhmediev breather and K-M breather. Furthermore, we obtain a phase diagram for two soliton interaction which admits tunneling property, particle-like property, interference property, and a resonant interaction case. The explicit conditions for them are clarified based on the defined critical distance $d_c$ and spatial interference period $D$.

abstract: We investigate the conditional average and the conditional variance of dissipated energy considering, as a prototypical example, a driven spin-boson system. We follow a measurement protocol in which the spin is prepared in a certain initial state before undergoing a periodic driving. Subsequently, the spin is projected onto a post-selected final state. We compare the conditional average of dissipated energy to the lower bound which directly follows from the well known fluctuation relations. We further report that a special selection of the initial (pre-selected) and final (post-selected) spin states leads to an enhanced energy emission with simultaneous noise suppression at driving times of order of the relaxation time.

abstract: We analyse a quantum Otto refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit coupled to two LC-resonators each including a resistor acting as a reservoir. We find various operation regimes: nearly adiabatic (low driving frequency), ideal Otto cycle (intermediate frequency), and non-adiabatic coherent regime (high frequency). In the nearly adiabatic regime, the cooling power is quadratic in frequency, and we find substantially enhanced coefficient of performance $\epsilon$, as compared to that of an ideal Otto cycle. Quantum coherent effects lead invariably to decrease in both cooling power and $\epsilon$ as compared to purely classical dynamics. In the non-adiabatic regime we observe strong coherent oscillations of the cooling power as a function of frequency. We investigate various driving waveforms: compared to the standard sinusoidal drive, truncated trapezoidal drive with optimized rise and dwell times yields higher cooling power and efficiency.

abstract: Novel bound states are obtained for manifolds with singular potentials. These singular potentials require proper boundary conditions across boundaries. The number of bound states match nicely with what we would expect for black holes. Also they serve to model membrane mechanism for the black hole horizons in simpler contexts. The singular potentials can also mimic expanding boundaries elegantly, there by obtaining appropriately tuned radiation rates.

abstract: We investigate the role of a repulsive s-wave interaction in the two-body problem in the presence of spin orbit couplings, motivated by current interests in exploring exotic superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases. For weak spin orbit coupling where the density of states is not significantly altered, we analytically show that the high-energy states become more important in determining the binding energy when the interaction strength decreases. Consequently, tuning the interaction gives rise to a rich ground state behavior, including a zigzag of the ground state momentum or inducing transitions among the meta-stable states. By exactly solving the two-body problem for a spin-orbit coupled Fermi mixture, we demonstrate that our analysis can also apply to the case when the density of states is significantly modified by the spin-orbit coupling. Our findings pave the way for understanding and controlling the paring of fermions in the presence of spin orbit couplings.

abstract: Among quantum Langevin equations describing the unitary time evolution of a quantum system in contact with a quantum bath, we completely characterize those equations which are actually driven by classical noises. The characterization is purely algebraic, in terms of the coefficients of the equation. In a second part, we consider general quantum Langevin equations and we prove that they can always be split into a maximal part driven by classical noises and a purely quantum one.

abstract: We show how it is possible to trap two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields, as long as the formed magnetic quantum dot (or ring) is of a slowly decaying nature. It is found that a modulation of the depth of the magnetic quantum dot leads to successive confinement-deconfinement transitions of vortexlike states with a certain angular momentum, until a regime is reached where only states with one sign of angular momentum are supported. We illustrate these characteristics with both exact solutions and a hitherto unknown quasi-exactly solvable model utilizing confluent Heun functions.
