abstract: We obtain a partial differential equation for a pulse travelling inside a Bose-Einstein condensate under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency. The equation is valid for a weak probe pulse. We solve the equation for the case of a three-level BEC in $\Lambda$ configuration with one of its ground state spatial profiles initially constant. The solution characterizes, in detail, the effect that the evolution of the condensate wave function has on pulse propagation, including the process of stopping and releasing it.

abstract: Why is thermalisation a universal phenomenon? How does a quantum system reach thermodynamical equilibrium? These questions are not new, dating even from the very birth of quantum theory and have been the subject of a renewed interest over the two last decades (see for instance the review in Eisert et al, Nature Physics 2015). In this work, we propose a universal model demonstrating that thermalisation of a small quantum system is an emergent property of the unitary evolution under a Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a larger composite system, whose initial state can be arbitrary. We show that the origin of universality lies in the phenomenon of 'measure concentration', which provides self-averaging properties for the reduced density matrix characterizing the state of the small subsystem. Using our framework, we focus on the asymptotic state at long times and consider its stationary properties. In typical macroscopic conditions, we recover the canonical state and the Boltzmann distribution well known from statistical thermodynamics. This findings lead us to propose an alternative and more general definition of the canonical partition function which also allow us to describe non thermal stationary states.

abstract: Superoscillations, i.e., the phenomenon that a bandlimited function can temporary oscillate faster than its highest Fourier component, are being much discussed for their potential for `superresolution' beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we consider systems that are driven with a time dependence that is off-resonance for the system, in the Fourier sense. We show that superoscillating sources can temporarily induce resonance during the period when the source is behaving superoscillatory. This observation poses the question as to how the system `undoes' the `false resonance' after the full source has acted and its band limitation is apparent. We discuss several examples of systems which might be capable of distilling the temporary excitation through some non-harmonic effects, such as dissipation or dispersion at high frequencies, opening up the possibility of low frequency detection of `fast' microphysics through superoscillations. We conclude that, either superoscillations really can beat the bandlimit and achieve superresolution (`kinematic superresolution') or the superoscillating high frequency is absorbed and we gain dynamical access to the physics of high frequency processes with low frequency signals (`dynamical superresolution').

abstract: Temperature determines the relative probability of observing a physical system in an energy state when that system is energetically in equilibrium with its environment. In this manuscript, we present a theory for engineering the temperature of a quantum system different from its ambient temperature, that is basically an analog version of the quantum metropolis algorithm. We define criteria for an engineered quantum bath that, when couples to a quantum system with Hamiltonian $H$, drives the system to the equilibrium state $\frac{e^{-H/T}}{{{\rm{Tr}}}(e^{-H/T})}$ with a tunable parameter $T$. For a system of superconducting qubits, we propose a circuit-QED approximate realization of such an engineered thermal bath consisting of driven lossy resonators. We consider an artificial thermal bath as a simulator for many-body physics or a controllable temperature knob for a hybrid quantum-thermal annealer.

abstract: The technological world is in the midst of a quantum computing and quantum information revolution. Since Richard Feynman's famous "plenty of room at the bottom" lecture, hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum mechanics, the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in understanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the foundational requirements for building one. We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.

abstract: We study the thermalization of an elementary quantum system modeled by a two-level atom interacting with stationary electromagnetic fields out of thermal equilibrium near a dielectric slab. The slab is held at a temperature different from that of the region where the atom is located. We find that when the slab is a nonabsorbing and nondispersive dielectric of a finite thickness $ d$, no out of thermal equilibrium effects appear as far as the thermalization of the atom is concerned, and a finite thick dielectric slab with a tiny imaginary part in the relative permittivity $\operatorname{Im} \epsilon$ behaves like a half space dielectric substrate if $\frac{\operatorname{Im} \epsilon}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Re}\epsilon-1}} \frac{d}{\lambda_0} > 1$ is satisfied, where $\lambda_0$ is the transition wavelength of the atom. This condition can serve as a guide for an experimental verification, using a dielectric substrate of a finite thickness, of the effects that arise from out of thermal equilibrium fluctuations with a half-space (infinite thickness) dielectric.

abstract: Quantum algorithm is an algorithm for solving mathematical problems using quantum systems encoded as information, which is found to outperform classical algorithms in some specific cases. The objective of this study is to develop a quantum algorithm for finding the roots of nth degree polynomials where n is any positive integer. In classical algorithm, the resources required for solving this problem increase drastically when n increases and it would be impossible to practically solve the problem when n is large. It was found that any polynomial can be rearranged into a corresponding companion matrix, whose eigenvalues are roots of the polynomial. This leads to a possibility to perform a quantum algorithm where the number of computational resources increase as a polynomial of n. In this study, we construct a quantum circuit representing the companion matrix and use eigenvalue estimation technique to find roots of polynomial.

abstract: One of the missing elements for realising an integrated optical circuit is a rectifying device playing the role of an optical diode. A proposal based on a pair of two-level atoms strongly coupled to a one-dimenisonal waveguide showed a promising behavior based on a semi-classical study [Fratini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 243601 (2014)]. Our study in the full quantum regime shows that, in such a device, rectification is a purely multi-photon effect. For an input field in a coherent state, rectification reaches up to $70\%$ for the range of power in which one of the two atoms is excited, but not both.

abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model of two anisotropically interacting spins in a magnetic field is proposed as a working substance of a quantum Otto engine to explore and exploit the anisotropy effects for the optimization of engine operation. Three different cases for the adiabatic branches of the cycle have been considered. In the first two cases, either the magnetic field or coupling strength are changed; while in the third case, both the magnetic field and the coupling strength are changed by the same ratio. The system parameters, for which the engine can operate similar to or dramatically different than the engines of a single qubit or of non-interacting or non-isotropic interacting spins are determined. The role of anisotropy to open new operational windows, inaccessible to single spin or non-interacting or non-isotropic interacting spins, to enhance cooperative work, and to optimize maximum work with high efficiency, as well as to operate the engine near the Carnot bound is revealed.

abstract: We examine one asymmetric adnd two fully symmetric Gaussian continuous-variable systems in terms of their tripartite and bipartite entanglement properties. We treat pure states and are able to find analytic solutions using the undepleted pump approximation for the Hamiltonian models, and standard beamsplitter relations for a model that mixes the outputs of optical parametric oscillators. Our two symmetric systems exhibit perfect tripartite correlations, but only in the unphysical limit of infinite squeezing. For more realistic squeezing parameters, all three systems exhibit both tripartite and bipartite entanglement. We conclude that none of the outputs are completely analogous to either GHZ or W states, but there are parameter regions where they produce T states introduced by Adesso \etal The qualitative differences in the output states for different interaction parameters indicate that continuous-variable tripartite quantum information systems offer a versatility not found in bipartite systems.

abstract: By harnessing quantum effects, we nowadays can use encryption that is in principle proven to withstand any conceivable attack. These fascinating quantum features have been implemented in metropolitan quantum networks around the world. In order to interconnect such networks over long distances, optical satellite communication is the method of choice. Standard telecommunication components allow one to efficiently implement quantum communication by measuring field quadratures (continuous variables). This opens the possibility to adapt our Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) to quantum key distribution (QKD). First satellite measurement campaigns are currently validating our approach.

abstract: The quantum mechanical one-dimensional (1D) Coulomb-like potential $1/|x|$ is treated in this paper by direct Fourier transformation of the Schroedinger equation. To this purpose, a specific regularization technique is introduced, the solutions turning out to be independent of the regularization parameter. Projecting the momentum space from the real line on the circle, in an analogy with Fock's treatment of the 3D case, the equation is found to admit an $O(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is responsible for the double degeneracy of energy levels. Employing the boundary condition of vanishing wave function at infinite momenta, the symmetry spontaneously breaks, removing the unwanted degeneracy.

By splitting an incoming single photon in two via parametric down-conversion, we herald the photon's arrival from an independent photon source while preserving its quantum information with up to $92.3\pm0.6$ % fidelity. With reduced detector dark counts, precertification will be immediately useful in quantum communication.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.04573
abstract: Nonfreeness is an entropy functional that ascribes an amount of "correlation" to many-fermion states. The nonfreeness of a many-fermion state equals the minimum of its entropy relative to all "free" states, the states we deem to be "uncorrelated." Slater determinant states and their "substates" are free; the remaining free states are limits of such states. Correlation functionals closely related to nonfreeness can be defined in terms of Renyi entropies; nonfreeness is the one that uses Shannon entropy. These correlation functionals all share desirable additivity and monotonicity properties, but nonfreeness has additional attractive properties related to entropy maximization and statistical mechanics.

abstract: We define a deformed kinetic energy operator for a discrete position space with finite number of points. The structure may be either periodic or nonperiodic with well-defined end points. It is shown that for the nonperiodic case, the translation operator becomes nonunitary due to the end points. This uniquely defines an algebra which has the desired unique representation. Energy eigenvalues and energy wave functions for both cases are found. At the continuum limit, the solution for the nonperiodic case becomes the same as the solution of infinite one dimensional square well and the periodic case solution becomes the same as the solution of a particle in a box with periodic boundary conditions.

abstract: Broadband quantum memories hold great promise as multiplexing elements in future photonic quantum information protocols. Alkali vapour Raman memories combine high-bandwidth storage, on-demand read-out, and operation at room temperature without collisional fluorescence noise. However, previous implementations have required large control pulse energies and suffered from four-wave mixing noise. Here we present a Raman memory where the storage interaction is enhanced by a low-finesse birefringent cavity tuned into simultaneous resonance with the signal and control fields, dramatically reducing the energy required to drive the memory. By engineering anti-resonance for the anti-Stokes field, we also suppress the four-wave mixing noise and report the lowest unconditional noise floor yet achieved in a Raman-type warm vapour memory, $(15\pm2)\times10^{-3}$ photons per pulse, with a total efficiency of $(9.5\pm0.5)$%.

A gas of particles obeying generalized exclusion statistics is considered as a working substance that includes noninteracting bosons, semions, and fermions as limiting cases. We report many-particle effects that enhance the optimal work output per cycle and the associated engine efficiency for exclusion statistics varying from bosons to semions and decrease it otherwise. In particular, we report for Bose statistics a many-particle quantum enhancement of the engine efficiency by up to $\sim$50 percent with respect to the single-particle case.

abstract: We study the dynamics of photonic quantum circuits consisting of nodes coupled by quantum channels. We are interested in the regime where time delay in communication between the nodes is significant. This includes the problem of quantum feedback, where a quantum signal is fed back on a system with a time delay. We develop a matrix product state approach to solve the Quantum Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation with time delays, which accounts in an efficient way for the entanglement of nodes with the stream of emitted photons in the waveguide, and thus the non-Markovian character of the dynamics. We illustrate this approach with two paradigmatic quantum optical examples: two coherently driven distant atoms coupled to a photonic waveguide with a time delay, and a driven atom coupled to its own output field with a time delay as an instance of a quantum feedback problem.

We then extend the metaplectic representation to the metaplectic (or oscillator) semigroup and study the properties of such an extension using Bargmann-Fock space. The shape geometry of squeezing is analyzed and noncommuting elements from the symplectic semigroup are proposed to be used in simultaneous monitoring of noncommuting quantum variables - which should lead to fractal patterns on the manifold of squeezed states.

abstract: Quantum Stein's Lemma is a cornerstone of quantum statistics and concerns the problem of correctly identifying a quantum state, given the knowledge that it is one of two specific states ($\rho$ or $\sigma$). It was originally derived in the asymptotic i.i.d. setting, in which arbitrarily many (say, $n$) identical copies of the state ($\rho^{\otimes n}$ or $\sigma^{\otimes n}$) are considered to be available. In this setting, the lemma states that, for any given upper bound on the probability $\alpha_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\sigma$, the probability $\beta_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\rho$ decays exponentially in $n$, with the rate of decay converging to the relative entropy of the two states. The second order asymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing, which establishes the speed of convergence of this rate of decay to its limiting value, was derived in the i.i.d. setting independently by Tomamichel and Hayashi, and Li. We extend this result to settings beyond i.i.d.. Examples of these include Gibbs states of quantum spin systems (with finite-range, translation-invariant interactions) at high temperatures.

abstract: The simulation of quantum transport in a realistic, many-particle system is a nontrivial problem with no quantitatively satisfactory solution. While real-time propagation has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of conventional transport methods, this approach is prone to finite size effects that are associated with modeling an open system on a closed spatial domain. Using a master equation framework, we exploit an equivalence between the superoperators coupling an open system to external particle reservoirs and non-Hermitian terms defined at the periphery of a quantum device. By taking the mean-field limit, the equation of motion for the single-particle reduced density matrix becomes equivalent to real-time time-dependent density functional theory in the presence of imaginary source and sink potentials. This method may be used to converge nonequilibrium steady states for a many-body quantum system using a previously reported constraint algorithm.

abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum annealing as a heuristic optimization method to find the absolute minimum of various continuous models, including landscapes with only two wells and also models with many competing minima and with disorder. The simulations performed using a projective quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm are compared with those based on the finite-temperature path-integral QMC technique and with classical annealing. We show that the projective QMC algorithm is more efficient than the finite-temperature QMC technique, and that both are inferior to classical annealing if this is performed with appropriate long-range moves. However, as the difficulty of the optimization problem increases, classical annealing looses efficiency, while the projective QMC algorithm keeps stable performance and is finally the most effective optimization tool. We discuss the implications of our results for the outstanding problem of testing the efficiency of adiabatic quantum computers using stochastic simulations performed on classical computers.
