abstract: We develop a semi-analytical approach beyond the Born-Markov approximation to study the quench dynamics of the spin-boson model in the strong-coupling regime ($\alpha\leq1/2$) for the Ohmic bath. The basic idea in our approach is to write an effective time-dependent model for the dynamics of the system coupled to the bosonic bath after integrating out high-frequency bath modes. By applying this procedure to the Heisenberg equations of motion, we derive a set of flow equations for the system parameters as a function of time. The final flow equations look similar to those of the equilibrium renormalization-group theory; however, in our derivation the scaling parameter is set by the real time. We solve the equations of motion with time-dependent renormalized parameters and show that the resulting dynamics is in decent agreement with the exact NRG calculations as well as the non-interacting blip approximation that is a well-known good solution in this limit.

abstract: One of the main problems that optical quantum computing has to overcome is the efficient construction of two-photon gates. Theoretically these gates can be realized using Kerr-nonlinearities, but the techniques involved are experimentally very difficult. We therefore employ linear optics with projective measurements to generate these non-linearities. The downside is that the measurement-induced nonlinearities achieved with linear optics are less versatile and the success rate can be quite low. This project is mainly the result of a literature study but also a theoretical work on the physics behind quantum optical multiports which is essential for realizing two-photon gates. By applying different postcorrection techniques we increase the probability of success in a modifed non-linear sign shift gate which is foundational for the two photon controlled-NOT gate. We prove that it's not possible to correct the states by only using a single beam splitter. We show that it might be possible to increase the probability of success using a more complex setup with at least two error-correcting beam splitters.

abstract: We have discovered a new domain of optical coherence, and show that it is the third and last member of a previously unreported fundamental triad of coherences. These are unified by our derivation of a parallel triad of coherence constraints that take the form of complementarity relations. We have been able to enter this new coherence domain experimentally and we describe the novel tomographic approach devised for that purpose.

abstract: We map the Hilbert space of the quantum Harmonic oscillator to the space of Glauber's $n$th-order intensity correlators, in effect showing "the correlations between the correlators" for a random sampling of the quantum states. In particular, we show how the popular $g^{(2)}$ function is correlated to the mean population and how a recurrent criterion to identify single-particle states or emitters, namely $g^{(2)}<1/2$, is incorrect as states exist that satisfy this condition with average population larger than one. Our charting of the Hilbert space allows to capture its structure in a simpler and physically more intuitive way that can be used to classify quantum sources by surveying which territory they can access.

abstract: We propose a method to achieve strong coupling between a spin ensemble and a large Josephson junctions (LJJ). Then, the strong coupling between two spin ensembles can be induced by a LJJ. A non-adiabatic holonomic single-qubit quantum gates is realized. Moreover, with the dispersive interaction between the spin ensembles and the LJJ, the high-fidelity two-qubit phase gate can be implemented with two spin ensembles within an operation time 0.41 ns and $\pi$ phase-swap gate can be realized within an operation time 103.11 ns with a high fidelity greater than 99%.

abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity have been each successfully tested in numerous experiments. However, the regime where both theories are jointly required to explain physical phenomena remains untested by laboratory experiments, and is also not fully understood by theory. This contribution reviews recent ideas for a new type of experiments: quantum interference of "clocks", which aim to test novel quantum effects that arise from time dilation. "Clock" interference experiments could be realised with atoms or photons in near future laboratory experiments.

abstract: We show how to implement topological or Thouless pumping of interacting photons in one dimensional nonlinear resonator arrays, by simply modulating the frequency of the resonators periodically in space and time. The interplay between interactions and the adiabatic modulations enables robust transport of Fock states with few photons per site. We analyze the transport mechanism via an effective analytic model and study its topological properties and its protection to noise. We conclude by a detailed study of an implementation with existing circuit QED architectures.

abstract: This paper proposes a new method for numerically solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with finite spectral bandwidth, which applies to both weak and strong coupling, periodic and non-periodic cases. We borrowed the concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) from classical control technology, and proved any time-dependent Hamiltonian can be approximated by a sequence of on and off "Hamiltonian Pulses", called Hamiltonian in PWM form. In particular, we revealed the existing Second-Order Split Operator Method can be treated as the extremal case of PWM forms but with lower accuracy; also, we revealed PWM is rather advantageous for accelerating computational quantum simulation especially at high precision. To combine PWM with experimental quantum simulation, we proposed the potential realization of PWM with imperfect switch, and showed the PWM pulses is very robust for possible noise.

abstract: Up to now, experiments involving M\"ossbauer nuclei driven by x-rays have been restricted to the low-excitation regime. Here, a setup is proposed which promises significant excitation, ideally exceeding full inversion of the nuclear ensemble, at x-ray light sources under construction. We further introduce a method to experimentally verify such inversions, in which population inversions manifest themselves in symmetry flips of suitably recorded spectra. It neither requires per-shot spectra of the incoming x-ray pulses, nor absolute measurements of the scattered light intensity.

abstract: Using the process of cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), we generate a narrow-band polarization-entangled photon pair resonant on the rubidium (Rb) D1 line (795 nm). The degenerate single-mode photon pair is selected by multiple temperature controlled etalons. The linewidth of generated polarization-entangled photon pairs is 15 MHz which matches the typical atomic memory bandwidth. The measured Bell parameter for the polarization-entangled photons S=2.73+-0.04 which violates the Bell-CHSH inequality by ~18 standard deviations. The presented entangled photon pair source could be utilized in quantum communication and quantum computing based on quantum memories in atomic ensemble.

It has been shown that there is a significant connection between the synchronization of the rotating bodies and their quantum friction.

abstract: Recent experiments using innovative optical detectors and techniques have strongly increased the capacity of testing the violation of the Bell's inequalities in the Nature. Most of them have used the Eberhardt's inequality (EI) to close the "detection" loophole. Closing the "locality" loophole has been attempted by space-like separated detections and fast and random changes in the setting of the bases of observation. Also, pulsed pumping and time stamped data to close the "time-coincidence" loophole, and sophisticated statistical methods to close the "memory" loophole, have been used. In this paper, the meaning of the EI is reviewed. A simple hidden-variables theory based on a relaxation of the condition of "measurement independence", which was devised long ago for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality, is adapted to the EI case. It is used here to evaluate the significance of the results of the new experiments, which are briefly described. A Table summarizes the main results.

abstract: Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory are often presented as featuring "retrocausal" effects in addition to the usual forward notion of causation. This paper examines the ontological implications of certain timesymmetric theories, and finds that no dynamical notion of causation applies to them, either forward or backward. It is concluded that such theories actually describe a static picture, in which the notion of causation is relegated to a descriptor of static relationships among events. In addition, these theories lead to an epistemic rather than ontologically referring, realist view of quantum states.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.04203
abstract: It is now a well-known fact that the correlations arising from local dichotomic measurements on an entangled quantum state may exhibit intrinsically non-classical features. In this paper we delve into a comprehensive study of random instances of such bipartite correlations. The main question we are interested in is: given a quantum correlation, taken at random, how likely is it that it is truly non-explainable by a classical model? We show that, under very general assumptions on the considered distribution, a random correlation which lies on the border of the quantum set is with high probability outside the classical set. What is more, we are able to provide the Bell inequality certifying this fact. On the technical side, our results follow from (i) estimating precisely the "quantum norm" of a random matrix, and (ii) lower bounding sharply enough its "classical norm", hence proving a gap between the two. Along the way, we need a non-trivial upper bound on the $\infty{\rightarrow}1$ norm of a random orthogonal matrix, which might be of independent interest.

abstract: We study the asymptotic dynamics of arbitrary linear quantum open systems which are periodically driven while coupled with generic bosonic reservoirs. We obtain exact results for the heat flowing into the network, which are valid beyond the usual weak coupling or Markovian approximations. We prove the validity of the dynamical third law of thermodynamics (Nernst unattainability principle), showing that the ultimate limit for cooling is imposed by a fundamental heating mechanism which becomes dominant at low temperatures: the non resonant creation of pairs of excitations in the reservoirs induced by the driving field. This quantum effect, which is missed in the weak coupling approximation, restores the unattainability principle whose validity was recently challenged.

We prove a Nash inequality and a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Gaussian states. The former leads to an ultracontractivity result. This in turn implies that the largest eigenvalue and the purity of any state, evolving under the action of the semigroup, decrease inverse polynomially in time, while its entropy increases logarithmically in time.

abstract: We present a protocol to generate a large degree of squeezing of a boson (light) field mode strongly coupled to a two-level system in the dispersive regime. Our protocol exploits the strong dispersive coupling to introduce a time dependent frequency change of the boson field. With an appropriately timed sequence of sudden frequency changes, the quantum noise fluctuations in one quadrature of the field can be reduced well below the standard quantum limit, with a correspondingly increased uncertainty in the orthogonal quadrature. Even in the presence of realistic noise and imperfections, the protocol should be capable of generating substantial squeezing with present experimental capabilities.

abstract: We consider the Laplace operator in a tubular neighbourhood of a conical surface of revolution, subject to an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field supported on the axis of symmetry and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of the domain. We show that there exists a critical total magnetic flux depending on the aperture of the conical surface for which the system undergoes an abrupt spectral transition from infinitely many eigenvalues below the essential spectrum to an empty discrete spectrum. For the critical flux we establish a Hardy-type inequality. In the regime with infinite discrete spectrum we obtain sharp spectral asymptotics with refined estimate of the remainder and investigate the dependence of the eigenvalues on the aperture of the surface and the flux of the magnetic field.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.03901
abstract: I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds in any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of theorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a "purely boundary" interpretation of the formula. I also extend a recent theorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when interpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more physical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I include a self-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of entropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge transformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which basically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the formula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics. Moreover they suggest a boundary interpretation of the "bit threads" recently introduced by Freedman and Headrick.

abstract: Since the discovery of topological insulators, many topological phases have been predicted and realized in a range of different systems, providing both fascinating physics and exciting opportunities for devices. And although new materials are being developed and explored all the time, the prospects for probing exotic topological phases would be greatly enhanced if they could be realized in systems that were easily tuned. The flexibility offered by ultracold atoms could provide such a platform. Here, we review the tools available for creating topological states using ultracold atoms in optical lattices, give an overview of the theoretical and experimental advances and provide an outlook towards realizing strongly correlated topological phases.

abstract: The wavefunction for indistinguishable fermions is anti-symmetric under particle exchange, which directly leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, and hence underlies the structure of atoms and the properties of almost all materials. In the dynamics of collisions between two indistinguishable fermions this requirement strictly prohibits scattering into 90 degree angles. Here we experimentally investigate the collisions of ultracold clouds fermionic $\rm^{40}K$ atoms by directly measuring scattering distributions. With increasing collision energy we identify the Wigner threshold for p-wave scattering with its tell-tale dumb-bell shape and no $90^\circ$ yield. Above this threshold effects of multiple scattering become manifest as deviations from the underlying binary p-wave shape, adding particles either isotropically or axially. A shape resonance for $\rm^{40}K$ facilitates the separate observation of these two processes. The isotropically enhanced multiple scattering mode is a generic p-wave threshold phenomenon, while the axially enhanced mode should occur in any colliding particle system with an elastic scattering resonance.

abstract: Decoherence of electron spins in nanoscale systems is important to quantum technologies such as quantum information processing and magnetometry. It is also an ideal model problem for studying crossover between quantum and classical phenomena. At low temperatures or in light-element materials where the spin-orbit coupling is weak, the phonon scattering in nanostructures is less important and the fluctuations of nuclear spins become the dominant decoherence mechanism for electron spins. Since 1950s, semiclassical noise theories have been developed for understanding electron spin decoherence. In spin-based solid-state quantum technologies, the relevant systems are in the nanometer scale and the nuclear spin baths are quantum objects which require a quantum description. Recently, quantum pictures have been established to understand the decoherence and quantum many-body theories have been developed to quantitatively describe this phenomenon. Anomalous quantum effects have been predicted and some have been experimentally confirmed. A systematically truncated cluster correlation expansion theory has been developed to account for the many-body correlations in nanoscale nuclear spin baths that are built up during the electron spin decoherence. The theory has successfully predicted or explained a number of experimental results in a wide range of physical systems. In this review, we will cover these recent progresses. The limitations of the present quantum many-body theories and possible directions for future development will also be discussed.

abstract: A Gibbs operator $e^{-\beta H}$ for a 2D lattice system with a Hamiltonian $H$ can be represented by a 3D tensor network, the third dimension being the imaginary time (inverse temperature) $\beta$. Coarse-graining the network along $\beta$ results in an accurate 2D projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) with a finite bond dimension. The coarse-graining is performed by a tree tensor network of isometries that are optimized variationally to maximize the accuracy of the PEPO. The algorithm is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on an infinite square lattice. Benchmark results are obtained that are consistent with the best cluster dynamical mean-field theory and power series expansion in the regime of parameters where they yield mutually consistent results.

abstract: In this paper we achieve the quantization of a particle moving on the three-dimensional sphere $S^{3}$ by using group-theoretical methods. For this purpose, a fundamental role is played by contact, non-point symmetries, i.e., symmetries that leave the Poincar\'e-Cartan form semi-invariant at the classical level, although not necessarily the Lagrangian. Special attention is paid to the role played by the basic quantum commutators, which depart from the canonical, Heisenberg-Weyl ones, as well as the relationship between the integration measure in the Hilbert space of the system and the non-trivial topology of the configuration space. Also, the quantization on momentum space is briefly outlined.

abstract: We present an overview of our recent investigations of long-range interactions in an ultracold Cs Rydberg gas. These interactions are studied by high-resolution photoassociation spectroscopy, using excitation close to one-photon transitions into $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg states with pulsed and continuous-wave ultraviolet laser radiation, and lead to the formation of long-range Cs$_2$ molecules. We observe two types of molecular resonances. The first type originates from the correlated excitation of two atoms into Rydberg-atom-pair states interacting at long range via multipole-multipole interactions. The second type results from the interaction of one atom excited to a Rydberg state with one atom in the electronic ground state. Which type of resonances is observed in the experiments depends on the laser intensity and frequency and on the pulse sequences used to prepare the Rydberg states. We obtain insights into both types of molecular resonances by modelling the interaction potentials, using a multipole expansion of the long-range interaction for the first type of resonances and a Fermi-contact pseudo-potential for the second type of resonances. We analyse the relation of these long-range molecular resonances to molecular Rydberg states and ion-pair states, and discuss their decay channels into atomic and molecular ions. In experiments carried out with a two-colour two-photon excitation scheme, we observe a large enhancement of Rydberg-excitation probability, which we interpret as a saturable autocatalytic antiblockade phenomenon.

Such optical media are locally isotropic, non-magnetic and belong to the recently discovered class of Kramers-Kronig media [{\it Nature Photon.} 9, 436 (2015)], i.e. the spatial profiles of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity are related each other by a Hilbert transform. The transition from unidirectional to bidirectional invisibility, and the possibility to realize sharp reflection above a cut-off incidence angle, are also discussed.

abstract: We carry out the complete group classification of the class of (1+1)-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with complex-valued potentials. After introducing the notion of uniformly semi-normalized classes of differential equations, we compute the equivalence groupoid of the class under study and show that it is uniformly semi-normalized. More specifically, each admissible transformation in the class is the composition of a linear superposition transformation of the corresponding initial equation and an equivalence transformation of this class. This allows us to apply the new version of the algebraic method based on uniform semi-normalization and reduce the group classification of the class under study to the classification of low-dimensional appropriate subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra. The partition into classification cases involves two integers that characterize Lie symmetry extensions and are invariant with respect to equivalence transformations.

abstract: Optomechanical arrays are a promising future platform for studies of transport, many-body dynamics, quantum control and topological effects in systems of coupled photon and phonon modes. We introduce disordered optomechanical arrays, focusing on features of Anderson localization of hybrid photon-phonon excitations. It turns out that these represent a unique disordered system, where basic parameters can be easily controlled by varying the frequency and the amplitude of an external laser field. We show that the two-species setting leads to a non-trivial frequency dependence of the localization length for intermediate laser intensities. This could serve as a convincing evidence of localization in a non-equilibrium dissipative situation.

abstract: We introduce and study a new Banded Random Matrix model describing sparse, long range quantum hopping in one dimension. Using a series of analytic arguments, numerical simulations, and a mapping to a long range epidemics model, we establish the phase diagram of the model. A genuine localisation transition, with well defined mobility edges, appears as the hopping rate decreases slower than $\ell^{-2}$, where $\ell$ is the distance. Correspondingly, the decay of the localised states evolves from a standard exponential shape to a stretched exponential and finally to a novel $\exp(-C\ln^\kappa \ell)$ behaviour, with $\kappa > 1$.

abstract: Using the worldline formalism of the Dirac field with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry we show how to describe the matter field transforming in an arbitrary representation of the gauge group. Colour degrees of freedom are carried on the worldline by auxiliary fields, responsible for providing path ordering and the Wilson-loop coupling. The Hilbert space of these fields is reducible but we make use of recent work in order to project onto a single, arbitrary, irreducible representation. By functionally quantising the resulting theory we show that this procedure correctly generates the Wilson-loop interaction between the gauge field and the matter field taken to transform in a chosen representation. This work has direct application to physical observables such as scattering amplitudes in the presence of such a matter multiplet and lifts the restriction on the type of matter that has previously featured in worldline calculations.
