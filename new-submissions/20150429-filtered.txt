abstract: We formulate Grover's unstructured search algorithm as a chiral quantum walk, where transitioning in one direction has a phase conjugate to transitioning in the opposite direction. For small phases, this breaking of time-reversal symmetry is too small to significantly affect the evolution: the system still approximately evolves in its ground and first excited states, rotating to the marked vertex in time $\pi \sqrt{N} / 2$. Increasing the phase does not change the runtime, but rather changes the support for the 2D subspace, so the system evolves in its first and second excited states, or its second and third excited states, and so forth. Apart from the critical phases corresponding to these transitions in the support, which become more frequent as the phase grows, this reveals that our model of quantum search is robust against time-reversal symmetry breaking.

abstract: We show that the Dirac quantum cellular automaton [Ann. Phys. 354 (2015) 244] shares many properties in common with the discrete-time quantum walk. These similarities can be exploited to redefine the automaton as a unitary process that takes place at regular time steps on a one-dimensional lattice with an arbitrary lattice spacing. In this way, it becomes an alternative to the quantum walk, with a dispersion relation that can be controlled by a mass parameter, playing a similar role to the coin angle in the quantum walk. Moreover, the Dirac Hamiltonian is recovered under a suitable limit. We also provide two independent analytical approximations to the long term probability distribution. It is shown that, starting from localized conditions, the asymptotic value of the entropy of entanglement between internal and motional degrees of freedom overcomes the known limit that is approached by the quantum walk for the same initial conditions, and are similar to the ones achieved by highly localized states of the Dirac equation.
