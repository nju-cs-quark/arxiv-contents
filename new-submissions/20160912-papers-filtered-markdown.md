**1.    How many bits specify a quantum state?**  
Barbara Drossel

<blockquote>
<p>
Wave functions are reproducible only when they represent long-lived eigenstates in a bound system, or when a well-controlled preparation procedure is available. If we admit that otherwise their precision is limited, we find that the classical and the quantum mechanical description of macroscopic systems can converge, with both of them including particle localization and stochastic effects. This argument is developped using a finite-temperature gas confined in a box as an example.

**2.    Energy localization and ground-state cooling of mechanical resonator from room temperature in optomechanics using a gain cavity**

<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that the energy flows from the hot (gain) system to the cold (loss) one when they are coupled to each other. We present a counterintuitive theory for the ground-state cooling of the mechanical resonator in optomechanics via a gain cavity. Here, the energy flows first from the mechanical resonator to the loss cavity, then to the gain cavity, and finally localizes there. The energy localization in the gain cavity dramatically enhances the cooling rate of the mechanical resonator. Moreover, we show that unconventional optical spring effect, e.g., giant frequency shift and optically induced damping of the mechanical resonator, can be realized. Those feature a pre-cooling free ground-state cooling, i.e., the mechanical resonator can directly be cooled to the ground state from the room temperature.
