abstract: Quantum complementarity states that particles, e.g. electrons, can exhibit wave-like properties such as diffraction and interference upon propagation. \textit{Electron waves} defined by a helical wavefront are referred to as twisted electrons~\cite{uchida:10,verbeeck:10,mcmorran:11}. These electrons are also characterised by a quantized and unbounded magnetic dipole moment parallel to their propagation direction, as they possess a net charge of $-|e|$~\cite{bliokh:07}. When interacting with magnetic materials, the wavefunctions of twisted electrons are inherently modified~\cite{lloyd:12b,schattschneider:14a,asenjo:14}. Such variations therefore motivate the need to analyze electron wavefunctions, especially their wavefronts, in order to obtain information regarding the material's structure~\cite{harris:15}. Here, we propose, design, and demonstrate the performance of a device for measuring an electron's azimuthal wavefunction, i.e. its orbital angular momentum (OAM) content. Our device consists of nanoscale holograms designed to introduce astigmatism onto the electron wavefunctions and spatially separate its phase components. We sort pure and superposition OAM states of electrons ranging within OAM values of $-10$ and $10$. We employ the device to analyze the OAM spectrum of electrons having been affected by a micron-scale magnetic dipole, thus establishing that, with a midfield optical configuration, our sorter can be an instrument for nano-scale magnetic spectroscopy.

abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of simple barrier tunneling problems, which are related to using quantum annealing to find the global optimum of cost functions defined over n bits. Specifically we look at the problem of having an n qubit system tunnel through a barrier of width and height proportional to n^a. We show that with these quantum annealing problems, the asymptotic, $n\to\infty$, behavior of the spectral gap does not accurately describe the behavior of the gap at finite n until extremely large values of n (n>10^{12}). We prove that this deficiency of the asymptotic expression is a feature of simple one-dimensional tunneling problems themselves, casting doubt on whether asymptotic analysis is an appropriate tool for studying tunneling problems in quantum annealing for reasonably sized systems.

abstract: We prove a new result on the spectral gap and mixing time of a Markov chain with Glauber dynamics on the space of Dyck paths (i.e., Catalan paths) and their generalization, which we call colored Dyck paths. The proof uses the comparison theorem of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste and our previous results. Denoting by $2n$ the number of spins, we prove that the gap of the Fredkin spin chain Hamiltonian is $\Theta(n^{-c})$ with $c\ge2$. Our result on the spectral gap of the Markov chain above is used to prove a lower bound of $O(n^{-13/2})$ on the energy gap of the Fredkin quantum spin chain. We prove an upper bound of $O(n^{-2})$ using the universality of Brownian motion and convergence of Dyck random walks to Brownian excursions. Lastly, the 'unbalanced' ground state energies are proved to be polynomially small in $n$ by mapping the Hamiltonian to an effective hopping Hamiltonian with next nearest neighbor interactions and analytically solving its ground state.

abstract: Quantum mechanics allows paraparticles with mixed Bose-Fermi statistics that have not been experimentally confirmed. We propose a trapped-ion scheme whose effective dynamics are equivalent to a driven parabose oscillator of even order. Our mapping suggest highly entangled vibrational and internal ion states as the laboratory equivalent of quantum simulated parabosons. Furthermore, we show the generation of coherent oscillations and Gilmore-Perelomov parabose coherent states and their reconstruction from population inversion measurements in the laboratory frame. Our proposal, apart from demonstrating an analog quantum simulator of parabose oscillators, foreshadows the potential use of paraparticle dynamics in the design of quantum information systems.

abstract: Quantum communication provides us with an absolute-security advantage, which has been widely developed in the past thirty years. As an important branch of quantum communications, quantum secure direct communicationcan promote high security and instantaneousness in communication through directly transmitting messages over a quantum channel. The full implementation of quantum protocol always requires the ability to control the transfer of message effectively in time domain, it is thus indispensable to combine quantum direct secure communication with quantum memory to accomplish the communication task. Here we report the experimental demonstration of quantum secure direct communication with the state of the art of atomic quantum memory for the first time. We utilize polarization degree of freedom of photons as the information carriers, and the fidelity of entanglement decoding is verified as ~90%. Our work completed a fundamental step towards practical quantum secure direct communication and demonstrated a potential application for long-distance quantum communication in a quantum network.

abstract: The purpose of the paper is mainly to investigate the quantum critical behavior of twodimensional XY spin system by calculating the quantum correlation and monogamy relation through implementation of quantum renormalization group theory. Numerical analysis indicates that quantum correlation as well as quantum nonlocality can be used to efficiently detect the quantum critical property in two-dimensional XY spin system. The nonanalytic behavior of the first derivative of the quantum correlation approaches infinity and the critical point is reached as the size of the model increases. Furthermore, we discuss the quantum correlation distribution in this model based on the square of concurrence (SC) and square of quantum discord (SQD). The monogamous properties of SC and SQD are obtained for this model. Particularly, we show that the monogamy score can be used to capture the quantum critical point.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of quantum linear systems where the input signals are multi-channel multi-photon states, namely states determined by a definite number of photons superposed in multiple input channels. In contrast to most existing studies on separable input states in the literature, we allow the existence of quantum correlation (for example quantum entanglement) in these multi-channel multi-photon input states. Due to the prevalence of quantum correlations in the quantum regime, the results presented in this paper are very general. Moreover, the multi-channel multi-photon states studied here are reasonably mathematically tractable. Three types of multi-photon states are considered: 1) $m$ photons are superposed among $m$ channels, 2) $N$ photons are superposed among $m$ channels where $N\geq m$, and 3) $N$ photons are superposed among $m$ channels where $N$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Formulae for intensities and states of output fields are presented. Examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.

abstract: Separability conditions for a bipartite quantum systems of finite-dimensional subsystems are formulated in terms of R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Since entangled states underlie many protocols of quantum information, methods of entanglement detection are of great importance. Entropic functions provide a good quantitative measure in studying various questions including uncertainty in quantum measurement. Entropic uncertainty relations often give rise to entanglement criteria. Our approach is based on the convolution operation applied to discrete probability distributions. Measurements on a total system are constructed of local ones according to the convolution scheme. Separability conditions are derived on the base of uncertainty relations of the Maassen-Uffink type as well as majorization relations. On each of subsystems, we use a pair of sets of subnormalized vectors that form rank-one POVMs. We also obtain entropic separability conditions for local measurements with a special structure, such as mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements. Their extensions known as mutually unbiased measurements and general SIC-POVMs are addressed as well.

abstract: We propose to use the integrated aluminum nitride waveguide with engineered width variation to achieve optical frequency conversion based on $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear effect on a photonic chip. We show that in an adiabatically tapered waveguide, the frequency conversion has a much broader bandwidth and the efficiency within the bandwidth is almost constant, which is favorable for short pulses. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically an "area law" for the frequency conversion, i.e. the product of bandwidth and efficiency is conserved as long as peak conversion efficiency does not saturate. The adiabatic structure shows higher saturation thresholds in pump power or interaction length, outperforming the conventional uniform waveguide design. With our approach, high-efficiency and wavefront-keeping conversion for short pulses is possible on a photonic chip, which will surely find applications for scalable on-chip information processing.

abstract: A paramount topic in quantum foundations, rooted in the study of the EPR paradox and Bell inequalities, is that of characterizing quantum theory in terms of the space-like correlations it allows. Here we show that to focus only on space-like correlations is not enough: we explicitly construct a toy model theory that, though being perfectly compatible with classical and quantum theories at the level of space-like correlations, displays an anomalous behavior in its time-like correlations. We call this anomaly, quantified in terms of a specific communication game, the "hypersignaling" phenomena. We hence conclude that the "principle of quantumness," if it exists, cannot be found in space-like correlations alone: nontrivial constraints need to be imposed also on time-like correlations, in order to exclude hypersignaling theories.

abstract: Communication games are collaborative information processing tasks involving a number of players with limited communication. Such games are useful tools for studying physical theories. A physical theory exhibits preparation contextuality whenever observed behaviour cannot be explained by a preparation noncontextual model. Here we show that there is a fundamental connection between the performance in communication games and the degree of preparation (non)contextuality. For this purpose, we present a general framework that allows us to construct communication games such that the game performance corresponds to a measure of preparation (non)contextuality. We illustrate the power of this framework by deriving several tests of preparation contextuality, using it to explain previous results, and solve one open problem. Specifically, we provide a simple explanation for the quantum preparation contextuality found by [A. Ambainis et al. arXiv:1607.05490] and construct a communication game that reveals the preparation contextuality of the maximally mixed quantum state in any dimension.

abstract: We introduce universally robust sequences for dynamical decoupling, which simultaneously compensate pulse imperfections and the detrimental effect of a dephasing environment to an arbitrary order, work with any pulse shape, and improve performance for any initial condition. Moreover, the number of pulses in a sequence grows only linearly with the order of error compensation. Our universal sequences outperform all known sequences for robust dynamical decoupling. Beyond the theoretical proposal, we also present convincing experimental data for dynamical decoupling of atomic coherences in a solid-state optical memory.

abstract: The conflict between quantum theory and the theory of relativity is exemplified in their treatment of time. We examine the ways in which their conceptions differ, and describe a semiclassical clock model combining elements of both theories. The results obtained with this clock model in flat spacetime are reviewed, and the problem of generalizing the model to curved spacetime is discussed, before briefly describing an experimental setup which could be used to test of the model. Taking an operationalist view, where time is that which is measured by a clock, we discuss the conclusions that can be drawn from these results, and what clues they contain for a full quantum relativistic theory of time.

abstract: We present a composable security proof, valid against arbitrary attacks and including finite-size effects, for a high dimensional time-frequency quantum key distribution (TFQKD) protocol based upon spectrally entangled photons. Previous works have focused on TFQKD schemes as it combines the impressive loss tolerance of single-photon QKD with the large alphabets of continuous variable (CV) schemes, which enables the potential for more than one bit of secret key per transmission. However, the finite-size security of such schemes has only been proven under the assumption of collective Gaussian attacks. Here, by combining recent advances in entropic uncertainty relations for CVQKD with decoy state analysis, we derive a composable security proof that predicts key rates on the order of Mbits/s over metropolitan distances (40km or less) and maximum transmission distances of up to 140km.

Rev. Lett. 113, 080401 (2014)]. We demonstrate a potential application of Gr\"obner basis to the identifiability test of the Hamiltonian, and provide the necessary experimental resources, such as the lower bound in the number of the required measurement points, the upper bound in total required evolution time, and thus the total measurement time. Focusing on the examples of the identifiability in the spin chain model with nearest-neighboring interaction, we classify the spin-chain Hamiltonian based on its identifiability, and provide the control protocols to engineer the non-identifiable Hamiltonian to be an identifiable Hamiltonian.

abstract: Reichenbach's principle asserts that if two observed variables are found to be correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations. Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner Reichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for quantum causal models, and provide examples of how the formalism works.

abstract: Since its first isolation in 2004, graphene has been found to host a plethora of unusual electronic transport phenomena, making it a fascinating system for fundamental studies in condensed-matter physics as well as offering tremendous opportunities for future electronic and sensing devices. However, to fully realise these goals a major challenge is the ability to non-invasively image charge currents in monolayer graphene structures and devices. Typically, electronic transport in graphene has been investigated via resistivity measurements, however, such measurements are generally blind to spatial information critical to observing and studying landmark transport phenomena such as electron guiding and focusing, topological currents and viscous electron backflow in real space, and in realistic imperfect devices. Here we bring quantum imaging to bear on the problem and demonstrate high-resolution imaging of current flow in graphene structures. Our method utilises an engineered array of near-surface, atomic-sized quantum sensors in diamond, to map the vector magnetic field and reconstruct the vector current density over graphene geometries of varying complexity, from mono-ribbons to junctions, with spatial resolution at the diffraction limit and a projected sensitivity to currents as small as 1 {\mu}A. The measured current maps reveal strong spatial variations corresponding to physical defects at the sub-{\mu}m scale. The demonstrated method opens up an important new avenue to investigate fundamental electronic and spin transport in graphene structures and devices, and more generally in emerging two-dimensional materials and thin film systems.

We consider the constraints coming from recent experimental results on models generalising the inverse power law chameleons such as $f(R)$ gravity in the large curvature regime, the environmentally dependent dilaton and symmetrons. Using the tomographic description of these models, we find that only symmetrons with masses smaller than the dark energy scale can be efficiently tested. In this regime, the resulting constraints complement the bounds from the E\"otwash experiment and exclude small values of the symmetron self-coupling.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.09258
abstract: We investigate the relation between the classical ergodicity and the quantum eigenstate thermalization in the fully-connected Ising ferromagnets. In the case of spin-1/2, an expectation value of an observable in a single energy eigenstate coincides with the long-time average in the underlying classical dynamics, which is the trivial result of the WKB approximation. In the case of spin-1, the underlying classical dynamics is not necessarily ergodic. In that case, it turns out that, in the thermodynamic limit, the statistics of the expectation values of an observable in the energy eigenstates coincides with the statistics of the long-time averages in the underlying classical dynamics starting from random initial states sampled uniformly from the classical phase space. This feature seems to be a general property in semiclassical systems such as several fully-connected many-body systems, and the result presented here clarifies a close relationship between the long-time behavior of classical dynamics and the property of individual energy eigenstates.

This theoretical system comes mainly from bouncing drops experiments and also a sliding bead on a vibrating string experiment. This system is studied by the way of a very common and easy mathematic formalism. We write the equation motion of the bead and also the wave equation of the system. We introduce the effective velocity of the bead with respect to the elastic media and also the wave $\psi$, due to the bead, which modulates the natural wave of the media. $\psi$ obeys to the true analog of the free Schr\"odinger equation (provided some conditions). For the linear and spherical cavities, the particles values of the bead (through the effective velocity) are proportional to the corresponding wave values of the system.

abstract: We propose to utilize the sub-system fidelity (SSF), defined by comparing a pair of reduced density matrices derived from the degenerate ground states, to identify and/or characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) states in one-dimensional interacting many-body systems. The SSF tells whether two states are locally indistinguishable (LI) by measurements within a given sub-system. Starting from two polar states (states that could be distinguished on either edge), the other combinations of these states can be mapped onto a Bloch sphere. We prove that a pair of orthogonal states on the equator of the Bloch sphere are LI, independently of whether they are SPT states or cat states (symmetry-preserving states by linear combinations of states that break discrete symmetries). Armed with this theorem, we provide a scheme to construct zero-energy exitations that swap the LI states. We show that the zero mode can be located anywhere for cat states, but is localized near the edge for SPT states. We also show that the SPT states are LI in a finite fraction of the bulk (excluding the two edges), whereas the symmetry-breaking states are distinguishable. This can be used to pinpoint the transition from SPT states to the symmetry-breaking states.

abstract: We study high temperature spin transport in a disordered Heisenberg chain in the ergodic regime when bulk dephasing is present. We find that while dephasing always renders the transport diffusive, there is nonetheless a remnant of the diffusive to sub-diffusive transition found in a system without dephasing manifested in the behaviour of the diffusion constant with the dephasing strength. By studying finite-size effects we show numerically and theoretically that this feature is caused by the competition between large crossover length scales associated to disorder and dephasing that control the dynamics observed in the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate that this competition may lead to a dephasing enhanced transport in this model.

abstract: The Dirac equation for an electron in a finite dipole potential has been studied within the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The Coulomb potential of the nuclei that compose a dipole is regularized, by considering the finite nuclear size. It is shown that if the dipole momentum reaches a certain critical value, the novel type of supercriticality occurs; namely, the wave function of the highest occupied electron bound state changes its localization from the negatively charged nucleus to the positively charged one. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a spontaneous creation of an electron-positron pair in vacuum, with each of the created particles being in the bound state with the corresponding nucleus and partially screening it.

abstract: The prospect of studying topologically nontrivial phases with the precision and control of atomic physics has driven the development of many techniques for engineering artificial magnetic fields and spin-orbit interactions in atomic gases. Recently, the idea of engineering nontrivial topology through the use of discrete internal (or external) atomic states as effective "artificial dimensions" has garnered attraction for its versatility and promise of immunity from sources of heating. Here, we directly engineer tunable artificial gauge fields through the local control of tunneling phases in an effectively two-dimensional manifold of discrete atomic momentum states. We demonstrate the ability to engineer homogeneous artificial gauge fields of arbitrary value, directly imaging the site-resolved dynamics of induced chiral currents. We furthermore engineer the first inhomogeneous artificial gauge fields for cold atoms, enabling the observation of magnetic reflection of atoms incident upon a step-like variation of an artificial vector potential. These results open up new possibilities for the study of topological phases and localization phenomena in cold atomic gases.

This Wigner equation is coupled to the appropriate Maxwell equations to form a self-consistent mean-field model. A set of semiclassical Vlasov equations with spin effects is obtained by expanding the full quantum model to first order in the Planck constant. The corresponding hydrodynamic equations are derived by taking velocity moments of the phase-space distribution function. A simple closure relation is proposed to obtain a closed set of hydrodynamic equations.
