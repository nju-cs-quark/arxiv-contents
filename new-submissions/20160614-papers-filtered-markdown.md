**1.    LISA pathfinder appreciably constrains collapse models**  
Bassam Helou, Bram Slagmolen, David E. McClelland, Yanbei Chen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.03637  
<blockquote>
<p>
LISA Pathfinder's measurement of a relative acceleration noise between two free-falling test masses with a square root of the power spectral density of $5.2 \pm 0.1 \mbox{ fm s}^{-2}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ appreciably constrains collapse models. In particular, we bound the localization rate parameter, $\lambda_{\rm CSL}$, in the continuous spontaneous localization model (CSL) to be at most $\left( 2.96 \pm 0.12 \right) \times 10^{-8} \mbox{ s}^{-1}$. Moreover, we bound the regularization scale, $\sigma_{\rm DP}$, used in the Diosi-Penrose (DP) model to be at least $40.1 \pm 0.5 \mbox{ fm}$. These bounds significantly constrain the validity of these models. In particular: (i) a lower bound of $2.2 \times 10^{-8\pm2} \mbox{s}^{-1}$ for $\lambda_{\rm CSL}$ has been proposed in (although a lower bound of about $10^{-17} \mbox{s}^{-1}$ is sometimes used), in order for the collapse noise to be substantial enough to explain the phenomenology of quantum measurement, and (ii) 40 fm is larger than the size of any nucleus, while the regularization scale has been proposed to be the size of the nucleus.

**2.    Exact simulation of coined quantum walks with the continuous-time model**  
Pascal Philipp, Renato Portugal  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.04030  
<blockquote>
<p>
The connection between coined and continuous-time quantum walk models has been addressed in a number of papers. In most of those studies, the continuous-time model is derived from coined quantum walks by employing dimensional reduction and taking appropriate limits. In this work, we produce the evolution of a coined quantum walk on a generic graph using a continuous-time quantum walk on a larger graph. In addition to expanding the underlying structure, we also have to switch on and off edges during the continuous-time evolution to accommodate the alternation between the shift and coin operators from the coined model. In one particular case, the connection is very natural, and the continuous-time quantum walk that simulates the coined quantum walk is driven by the graph Laplacian on the dynamically changing expanded graph.

**3.    Efficient molecular quantum dynamics in coordinate and phase space using pruned bases**  
Henrik R. Larsson, Bernd Hartke, David J. Tannor  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.04004  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient implementation of dynamically pruned quantum dynamics, both in coordinate space and in phase space. We combine the ideas behind the biorthogonal von Neumann basis (PvB) with the orthogonalized momentum-symmetrized Gaussians (Weylets) to create a new basis, projected Weylets, that takes the best from both methods. We benchmark pruned dynamics using phase-space-localized PvB, projected Weylets, and coordinate-space-localized DVR bases, with real-world examples in up to six dimensions. We show that coordinate-space localization is most important for efficient pruning and that pruned dynamics is much faster compared to unpruned, exact dynamics. Phase-space localization is useful for more demanding dynamics where many basis functions are required. There, projected Weylets offer a more compact representation than pruned DVR bases.
