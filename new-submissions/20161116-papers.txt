abstract: When applied to matter and antimatter states, the Pauli master equation (PME) may have two forms: time-symmetric, which is conventional, and time-antisymmetric, which is suggested in the present work. The symmetric and antisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of thermodynamics from matter to antimatter --- this is demonstrated by proving the corresponding H-theorem. The two forms are based on the thermodynamic similarity of matter and antimatter and differ only in the directions of thermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric case and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that, while the symmetric form of PME predicts an equi-balance between matter and antimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion of antimatter into matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally justified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of thermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties of macroscopic objects made of antimatter, but experiments of this kind may become possible in the future.

abstract: An experimental test of Bell's inequality allows to rule out any local-realistic description of nature by measuring correlations between distant systems. While such tests are conceptually simple, there are strict requirements concerning the detection efficiency of the involved measurements, as well as the enforcement of space-like separation between the measurement events. Only very recently both loopholes could be closed simultaneously. Here we present an event-ready loophole-free test based on combining heralded entanglement of atoms separated by 398 m with fast and efficient measurements of the atomic spin states. We obtain a violation of $S=2.22\pm0.033$ (compared to the maximal value of $2$ achievable with local-hidden variable models) which allows us to refute the hypothesis of local-realism with a significance level $P<1.05\cdot10^{-9}$.

abstract: Sensing static or slowly varying magnetic fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution is critical to many applications in fundamental physics, bioimaging and materials science. Several versatile magnetometry platforms have emerged over the past decade, such as electronic spins associated with Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. However, their high sensitivity to external fields also makes them poor sensors of DC fields. Indeed, the usual method of Ramsey magnetometry leaves them prone to environmental noise, limiting the allowable interrogation time to the short dephasing time T2*. Here we introduce a hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that allows sensing static magnetic fields with interrogation times up to the much longer T2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field sensitivity. While more generally applicable, we demonstrate the method for an electronic NV sensor and a nuclear ancilla. It relies on frequency upconversion of transverse DC fields through the ancilla, allowing quantum lock-in detection with low-frequency noise rejection. In our experiments, we demonstrate sensitivities better than 6uT/vHz, comparable to the Ramsey method, and narrow-band signal noise filtering better than 64kHz. With technical optimization, we expect more than an one order of magnitude improvement in each of these parameters. Since our method measures transverse fields, in combination with the Ramsey detection of longitudinal fields, it ushers in a compelling technique for sensitive vector DC magnetometry at the nanoscale.

abstract: Multipartite entangled states are a fundamental resource for a wide range of quantum information processing tasks. In particular, in quantum networks it is essential for the parties involved to be able to verify if entanglement is present before they carry out a given distributed task. Here we design and experimentally demonstrate a protocol that allows any party in a network to check if a source is distributing a genuinely multipartite entangled state, even in the presence of untrusted parties. The protocol remains secure against dishonest behaviour of the source and other parties, including the use of system imperfections to their advantage. We demonstrate the verification protocol in a three- and four-party setting using polarization-entangled photons, highlighting its potential for realistic photonic quantum communication and networking applications.

abstract: The uncertainty principle is considered to be one of the most striking features in quantum mechanics. In the textbook literature, uncertainty relations usually refer to the preparation uncertainty which imposes a limitation on the spread of measurement outcomes for a pair of non-commuting observables. In this work, we study the preparation uncertainty for the angular momentum, especially in the spin-1/2 representation. We derive uncertainty relations encompassing the triple components of angular momentum, and show that compared with the relations involving only two components, a triple constant $2/\sqrt{3}$ often arises. Intriguingly, this constant is the same for the position and momentum case. Experimental verification is carried out on a single spin in diamond, and the results confirm the triple constant in a wide range of experimental parameters.

abstract: We introduce and experimentally implement a method for the absolute detector calibration of photon-number-resolving time-bin multiplexing layouts based on the measured click statistics of superconduncting nano-wire detectors. In particular, the quantum efficiencies, the dark count rates, and the positive operator-valued measures of these measurement schemes are directly obtained with high accuracy. The method is based on the moments of the click counting statistics for coherent states with different coherent amplitudes. The strength of our analysis is that we can directly conclude -- on a quantitative basis -- that the detection strategy under study is well described by a linear response function for the light-matter interaction and that it is sensitive to the polarization of the incident light field. Moreover, our method is further extended to a two-mode detection scenario. Finally, we present possible applications for such well characterized detectors, such as sensing of atmospheric loss channels and phase sensitive measurements.

abstract: We present a tuneup protocol for qubit gates with tenfold speedup over traditional methods reliant on qubit initialization by energy relaxation. This speedup is achieved by constructing a cost function for Nelder-Mead optimization from real-time correlation of non-demolition measurements interleaving gate operations without pause. Applying the protocol on a transmon qubit achieves 0.999 average Clifford fidelity in one minute, as independently verified using randomized benchmarking and gate set tomography. The adjustable sensitivity of the cost function allows detecting fractional changes in gate error with nearly constant signal-to-noise ratio. The restless concept demonstrated can be readily extended to the tuneup of two-qubit gates and measurement operations.

abstract: We describe a novel method for producing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in cold atoms coupled to a superconducting coplanar cavity. In the proposed scheme, atoms interact between each other by virtual photon exchange via a cavity mode. These interactions cause an asymmetric Rydberg blockade mechanism that suppresses simultaneous excitations into different atomic Rydberg levels, thus forcing all atoms to occupy the same Rydberg state. This mechanism has effect even if the atoms are separated by distances of the order of millimeters. The atomic populations are transferred adiabatically from the ground state into the entangled state by following a collective dark state with low dissipation rates.

abstract: Ilya Schmelzer wrote recently: {\it Nieuwenhuizen argued that there exists some "contextuality loophole" in Bell's theorem. This claim in unjustified}. It is made clear that this arose from attaching a meaning to the title and the content of the paper different from the one intended by Nieuwenhuizen. "Contextual loophole" means only that if the supplementary parameters describing measuring instruments are correctly introduced, Bell and Bell-type inequalities may not be proven. It is also stressed that a hidden variable model suffers from a "contextuality loophole" if it tries to describe different sets of incompatible experiments using a unique probability space and a unique joint probability distribution.

abstract: We analyze a method for preparing low-entropy many-body states in isolated quantum optical systems of atoms, ions and molecules. Our approach is based upon shifting entropy between different regions of a system by spatially modulating the magnitude of the effective Hamiltonian. We conduct two case studies, on a topological spin chain and the spinful fermionic Hubbard model, focusing on the key question: can a "conformal cooling quench" remove sufficient entropy within experimentally accessible timescales? Finite temperature, time-dependent matrix product state calculations reveal that even moderately sized "bath" regions can remove enough energy and entropy density to expose coherent low temperature physics. The protocol is particularly natural in systems with long-range interactions such lattice-trapped polar molecules and Rydberg dressed atoms where the magnitude of the Hamiltonian scales directly with the density. To this end, we propose a simple implementation of conformal cooling quenches in a dilutely-filled optical lattice, where signatures of quantum magnetism can be observed.

abstract: We argue that the late time behavior of horizon fluctuations in large anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes is governed by the random matrix dynamics characteristic of quantum chaotic systems. Our main tool is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which we use as a simple model of a black hole. We use an analytically continued partition function $|Z(\beta +it)|^2$ as well as correlation functions as diagnostics. Using numerical techniques we establish random matrix behavior at late times. We determine the early time behavior exactly in a double scaling limit, giving us a plausible estimate for the crossover time to random matrix behavior. We use these ideas to formulate a conjecture about general large AdS black holes, like those dual to 4D super-Yang-Mills theory, giving a provisional estimate of the crossover time. We make some preliminary comments about challenges to understanding the late time dynamics from a bulk point of view.

abstract: The Gross Pitaevski map is a discrete time, split operator version of the Gross Pitaevski dynamics in the circle, of possible relevance to the physics of Bose-Einstein condensates, for which exponential instability has been recently reported. Here it is studied as a classical dynamical system. A systematic analysis of Lyapunov exponents exposes strongly chaotic behavior. Exponential growth of energy is then shown to be a direct consequence of rotational invariance and for stationary solutions the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents is analytically computed. The present analysis includes the resonant case, when the free rotation period is commensurate to $2\pi$, and the map has countably many constants of the motion. Except for lowest order resonances, this case exhibits an integrable-chaotic transition.

abstract: The study of lattice gauge theories with Monte Carlo simulations is hindered by the infamous sign problem that appears under certain circumstances, in particular at non-zero chemical potential. So far, there is no universal method to overcome this problem. However, recent years brought a new class of non-perturbative Hamiltonian techniques named tensor networks, where the sign problem is absent. In previous work, we have demonstrated that this approach, in particular matrix product states in 1+1 dimensions, can be used to perform precise calculations in a lattice gauge theory, the massless and massive Schwinger model. We have computed the mass spectrum of this theory, its thermal properties and real-time dynamics. In this work, we review these results and we extend our calculations to the case of two flavours and non-zero chemical potential. We are able to reliably reproduce known analytical results for this model, thus demonstrating that tensor networks can tackle the sign problem of a lattice gauge theory at finite density.

abstract: In many materials or equilibrium statistical systems the information of boundary conditions is lost inside the bulk of the material. In contrast, we describe here static classical statistical probability distributions for which bulk properties depend on boundary conditions. Such "static memory materials" can be realized if no unique equilibrium state exists. The propagation of information from the boundary to the bulk is described by a classical wave function or a density matrix, which obey generalized Schr\"odinger or von Neumann equations. For static memory materials the evolution within a subsector is unitary, as characteristic for the time evolution in quantum mechanics. The space-dependence in static memory materials can be used as an analogue representation of the time evolution in quantum mechanics - such materials are "quantum simulators". For example, an asymmetric Ising model represents the time evolution of relativistic fermions in two-dimensional Minkowski space.

abstract: Integrable models such as the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the Lieb-Liniger or the one-dimensional Hubbard model are known to avoid thermalization, which was also demonstrated in several quantum-quench experiments. Another dramatic consequence of integrability is the zero-frequency anomaly in transport coefficients, which results in ballistic finite-temperature transport, despite the presence of strong interactions. While this aspect of nonergodic dynamics has been known for a long time, there has so far not been any unambiguous experimental realization thereof. We make a concrete proposal for the observation ballistic transport via local quantum quench experiments in fermionic quantum-gas microscopes. Such an experiment would also unveil the coexistence of ballistic and diffusive transport channels in one and the same system and provide a means of measuring finite-temperature Drude weights. The connection between local quenches and linear-response functions is established via time-dependent Einstein relations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1611.04876
abstract: We consider a spinless ultracold Fermi gas tightly trapped along the axis of an optical resonator and transversely illuminated by a laser closely tuned to a resonator mode. At a certain threshold pump intensity the homogeneous gas density breaks a $\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry towards a spatially periodic order, which collectively scatters pump photons into the cavity. We show that this known self-ordering transition also occurs for low field seeking fermionic particles when the laser light is blue-detuned to an atomic transition. The emergent superradiant optical lattice in this case is homopolar and possesses two distinct dimerizations. Depending on the spontaneously chosen dimerization the resulting Bloch bands can have a non-trivial topological structure characterized by a non-vanishing Zak phase. In the case the Fermi momentum is close to half the cavity-mode wavenumber, a Peierls-like instability here creates a topoloical insulator with a gap at the Fermi surface, which hosts a pair of edge states. The topological features of the system can be non-destructively observed via the cavity output: the Zak phase of the bulk coincides with the relative phase between laser and cavity field, while the fingerprint of edge states can be observed as additional broadening in a well defined frequency window of the cavity spectrum.

The review contains important amendments, clarifying subtle points in derivation of the Master equations and their validity. This completes the earlier works on the subject. It is demonstrated that the derivation does not assume weak coupling with the environment and reservoirs, but needs only high bias condition. This condition is very essential for validity of the Markovian Master equations, widely used for a phenomenological description of different physical processes.

abstract: We introduce a new spin chain which is a deformation of the Fredkin spin chain and has a phase transition between bounded and extensive entanglement entropy scaling. In this chain, spins have a local interaction of three nearest neighbors. The Hamiltonian is frustration-free and its ground state can be described analytically as a weighted superposition of Dyck paths. In the purely spin $1/2$ case, the entanglement entropy obeys an area law: it is bounded from above by a constant, when the size of the block $n$ increases (and $t>1$). When a local color degree of freedom is introduced the entanglement entropy increases linearly with the size of the block (and $t>1$). The entanglement entropy of half of the chain is tightly bounded by ${ n}\log s$ where $n$ is the size of the block, and $s$ is the number of colors. Our chain fosters a new example for a significant boost to entropy and for the existence of the associated critical rainbow phase where the entanglement entropy scales with volume that has recently been discovered in Zhang et al. (arXiv:1606.07795)

abstract: We demonstrate that current experiments using cold bosonic atoms trapped in one-dimensional optical lattices and designed to measure the second-order Renyi entanglement entropy S_2, can be used to verify detailed predictions of conformal field theory (CFT) and estimate the central charge c. We discuss the adiabatic preparation of the ground state at half-filling where we expect a CFT with c=1. This can be accomplished with a very small hoping parameter J, in contrast to existing studies with density one where a much larger J is needed. We provide two complementary methods to estimate and subtract the classical entropy generated by the experimental preparation and imaging processes. We compare numerical calculations for the classical O(2) model with a chemical potential on a 1+1 dimensional lattice, and the quantum Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian implemented in the experiments. S_2 is very similar for the two models and follows closely the Calabrese-Cardy scaling, (c/8)\ln(N_s), for N_s sites with open boundary conditions, provided that the large subleading corrections are taken into account.
