abstract: Matchgates are a restricted set of two-qubit gates known to be classically simulable under particular conditions. Specifically, if a circuit consists only of nearest-neighbour matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible if either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation requires computing probabilities of multi-qubit outcomes (including also adaptive measurements), or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the most general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary input states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits, and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary single-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical simulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other restricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear optics, where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar modifications.

abstract: We introduce an accurate non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger-type approximation of Bloch optical equations for two-level systems. This approximation provides a complete description of the excitation, relaxation and decoherence dynamics in both weak and strong laser fields. In this approach, it is sufficient to propagate the wave function of the quantum system instead of the density matrix, providing that relaxation and dephasing are taken into account via automatically-adjusted time-dependent gain and decay rates. The developed formalism is applied to the problem of scattering and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by a thin layer comprised of interacting two-level emitters.

abstract: We explore quantum and classical correlations along with coherence in the ground states of spin-1 Heisenberg chains, namely the one-dimensional XXZ model and the one-dimensional bilinear biquadratic model, with the techniques of density matrix renormalization group theory. Exploiting the tools of quantum information theory, that is, by studying quantum discord, quantum mutual information and three recently introduced coherence measures in the reduced density matrix of two nearest neighbor spins in the bulk, we investigate the quantum phase transitions and special symmetry points in these models. We point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of correlation and coherence measures as figures of merit to witness the quantum phase transitions and symmetry points in the considered spin-1 Heisenberg chains. In particular, we demonstrate that as none of the studied measures can detect the infinite order Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XXZ model, they appear to be able to signal the existence of the same type of transition in the biliear biquadratic model. However, we argue that what is actually detected by the measures here is the SU(3) symmetry point of the model rather than the infinite order quantum phase transition. Moreover, we show in the XXZ model that examining even single site coherence can be sufficient to spotlight the second-order phase transition and the SU(2) symmetry point.

abstract: Encoding many qubits in different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons is one of the routes towards enlarging the Hilbert space spanned by a photonic quantum state. Hyperentangled photon states (i.e. states showing entanglement in multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both fundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing the number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and integration of the basic elements and functions to guarantee the set-up stability. This motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise control of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use of path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum circuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on both DOFs. Our results pave the way towards the full integration on a chip of hybrid multiqubit multiphoton states.

abstract: Fundamental modifications of the standard Schr\"odinger equation by additional nonlinear terms have been considered for various purposes over the recent decades. It came as a surprise when, inverting Abner Shimony's observation of "peaceful coexistence" between standard quantum mechanics and relativity, N. Gisin proved in 1990 that any (deterministic) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation would allow for superluminal communication. This is by now the most spectacular and best known anomaly. We discuss further anomalies, simple but foundational, less spectacular but not less dramatic.

abstract: Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a trademark of quantum mechanics. In its original form it states that one cannot gain information about a system without disturbing it, which is a core of novel cryptographic techniques based on quantum effects. The principle can be derived from mathematical formalism of quantum theory. However the formalism itself is very abstract - unlike in classical mechanics, it does not directly refer to what we perceive. The question arises: can we derive the principle from more comprehensible assumptions? Here we derive Heisenberg trade-off from two assumptions: impossibility of instantaneous messaging at a distance (no-signaling), and violation of Bell inequalities (non-locality). The former is a natural and simple assumption, while the latter is an observable phenomenon implied by quantum mechanics. That the trade-off is a consequence of the above two assumptions is indirectly implied by existing schemes of secure cryptography based on the above two assumptions. Surprisingly, despite of vast literature on such crypto-systems, no direct connection between no-signaling, non-locality and Heisenberg principle was ever proposed. We also analyze a Bayesian trade-off, and note that there exists a range of parameters, where assumptions of no-signaling precisely reconstruct quantum predictions.

abstract: In this paper we define and study a new class of states (the empty states). These states are the superposition of two identical states (self-superposition state). We defined three different representations of theses states, namely, the source, the operator, and the self-superposition representations. Then, we apply the empty state to an elementary example state and find its three different representations. We apply the empty state to Fock states and find an undetermined state. Then, we apply the empty state to the coherent state to produce the empty state of the coherent state (the EC state), and determine some of its mathematical, statistical and nonclassical properties.

abstract: A general and in principle exact approach for the continuous variable entanglement in a system of coupled harmonic oscillators in contact with a thermal bath is formulated. This allows a generalization to describe entanglement's existence between two sites in any system of this kind. It is employed a method of simultaneous diagonalization of two quadratic forms to obtain the uncoupled quantum Hamiltonian. Making use of the transformations that uncouple the system, the covariance matrix for two positions is constructed, and through a modification of the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT-criterion), the condition that determines the existence or not of quantum correlation between the sites is obtained.

abstract: In this paper we consider a situation in which several quantum particles are located relatively far away from each other. We assume that each particle remains in a sharply localised state throughout time, a peaked soliton, due to the existence of some confinement mechanism, for instance a self-focusing non-linear interaction. In a previous work we showed that in this case there exist a class of solutions of the quantum dynamics such that at the zero order of perturbation the peaked quantum solitons (solitary waves) obey a generalized de Broglie-Bohm (dB-B) guidance equation. Here we show that, at the first order of perturbation, our model predicts the appearance of an effective gravitational field.

abstract: The entangled "Schrodinger's cat" state of a quantum and its measurement apparatus is not a superposition of quantum states but is instead a non-paradoxical superposition of nonlocal correlations between quantum states. This elucidation of entanglement is demonstrated by experiments conducted in 1990 using entangled photon pairs. Thus the Schrodinger's cat state does not predict a dead-and-alive cat. Instead of indefinite superpositions, it predicts indeterminate but definite outcomes. When a superposed quantum entangles with a measurement apparatus, the composite system instantly collapses locally to incoherent mixtures of definite outcomes of the quantum and of the apparatus, while the global superposition of correlations maintains its unitary evolution. This transfer of coherence from the quantum system to correlations between the system and its measuring apparatus is the reason instantaneous local collapse can occur upon measurement without interrupting the smooth global evolution that follows Schrodinger's equation. Objections to this resolution (namely improper density operators, and basis ambiguity) are rebutted.

abstract: To date, both quantum theory, and Einstein's theory of general relativity have passed every experimental test in their respective regimes. Nevertheless, almost since their inception, there has been debate surrounding whether they should be unified and by now there exists strong theoretical arguments pointing to the necessity of quantising the gravitational field. In recent years, a number of experiments have been proposed which, if successful, should give insight into features at the Planck scale. Here we review some of the motivations, from the perspective of semi-classical arguments, to expect new physical effects at the overlap of quantum theory and general relativity. We conclude with a short introduction to some of the proposals being made to facilitate empirical verification.

abstract: Thermal noise generally greatly exceeds quantum noise in optomechanical devices unless the mechanical frequency is very high or the thermodynamic temperature is very low. This paper addresses the design concept for a novel optomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror Sloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a Membrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation pressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that practical devices could operate at frequencies up to $\sim$ 200 kHz with an optically diluted quality factor up to $\sim 10^{11}$ and discuss methods of fabrication for devices with membrane or nanowire suspension. Applications for such devices include white light cavities for improvement of gravitational wave detectors, or sensors able to operate near the quantum limit.

abstract: Gate control of donor electrons near interfaces is a generic ingredient of donor-based quantum computing. Here, we address the question: how is the phonon-assisted qubit relaxation time $T_1$ affected as the electron is shuttled between the donor and the interface? We focus on the example of the `flip-flop qubit' [Tosi et al., arXiv:1509.08538v1], defined as a combination of the nuclear and electronic states of a phosphorous donor in silicon, promising fast electrical control and long dephasing times when the electron is halfway between the donor and the interface. We theoretically describe orbital relaxation, flip-flop relaxation, and electron spin relaxation. We estimate that the flip-flop qubit relaxation time can be of the order of $100 \, \mu\text{s}$, 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the value for an on-donor electron in bulk silicon, and a few orders of magnitude shorter (longer) than the predicted inhomogeneous dephasing time (gate times). All three relaxation processes are boosted by (i) the nontrivial valley structure of the electron-phonon interaction, and (ii) the different valley compositions of the involved electronic states.

abstract: The many-body problem is ubiquitous in the theoretical description of physical phenomena, ranging from the behavior of elementary particles to the physics of electrons in solids. Most of our understanding of many-body systems comes from analyzing the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian and states: the most striking example are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of systems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several approaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge theories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation platforms have been put forward for the realization of synthetic gauge theories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum information concepts have been formulated. In this review we present an introduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and highlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and report the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.

abstract: We study a model for quantum lightcone fluctuations in which vacuum fluctuations of the electric field and of the squared electric field in a nonlinear dielectric material produce variations in the flight times of probe pulses. When this material has a non-zero third order polarizability, the flight time variations arise from squared electric field fluctuations, and are analogous to effects expected when the stress tensor of a quantized field drives passive spacetime geometry fluctuations. We also discuss the dependence of the squared electric field fluctuations upon the geometry of the material, which in turn determines a sampling function for averaging the squared electric field along the path of the pulse. This allows us to estimate the probability of especially large fluctuations, which is a measure of the probability distribution for quantum stress tensor fluctuations.
