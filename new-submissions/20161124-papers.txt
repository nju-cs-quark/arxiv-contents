abstract: I present a reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation which allows to propagate fractions of the quantum mechanical probability distribution. As an example, I propagate a probability distribution which is initially located at the lower slit of a double-slit experiment. Despite the distribution emerges only from one slit, interference can still be observed. Furthermore, I show that my formalism goes over into the de-Broglie Bohm theory for a limiting case. This work may help to gain a deeper understanding of the Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: Principally, there are two forms of coupling energy when particle is moving around the micro-ring resonator, which is generated by the construction (creation) and the destruction (annihilation) energies that can disturb the centre nonlinear microring resonator and lead the system unstable from the harmonic motion, from which the squeezing state of the particle can occur. The detected outputs either electrons and their spins or photons can be useful for the new era of electronic devices and circuits, where the classical electronics, plasmonic electronics, spintronic electronics and quantum electronics can be combined and realized.

abstract: Approximate quantum error-correcting codes are codes with "soft recovery guarantees" wherein information can be approximately recovered. In this article, we propose a complementary "soft code-spaces" wherein a weighted prior distribution is assumed over the possible logical input states. The performance for protecting information from noise is then evaluated in terms of entanglement fidelity. We apply a recent construction for approximate recovery maps, which come with a guaranteed lower-bounds on the decoding performance. These lower bound are straightforwardly obtained by evaluating entropies on marginals of the mixed state which represents the "soft code-space". As an example, we consider thermal states of the transverse field Ising model at criticality and provide numerical evidence that the entanglement fidelity admits non-trivial recoverability from local errors. This provides the first concrete interpretation of a bonafide conformal field theory as a quantum error-correcting code. We further suggest, that quantum source-channel codes could provide a framework to interpret the information structure of holography.

abstract: We investigate the open dynamics of a quantum system when it is rapidly repeatedly updated by a quantum channel. Specifically, we analyze when this dynamics can purify the system. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for such purification effects to occur and characterize their strength. We thoroughly analyze the specific scenario of a quantum system undergoing rapid unitary interactions with a sequence of ancillary quantum systems. We find that while the purification effects are generally present, in order for these effects to be strong compared to the decoherence effects the interaction Hamiltonian must have a minimum degree of complexity. Specifically, a tensor product interaction $\hat{Q}_\text{S}\otimes\hat{R}_\text{A}$, as well as many common light-matter interactions cannot purify efficiently.

The strategies are tested with a culled random set of mixed satisfiability problems, yielding results that generalize to guidelines regarding which parameter setting strategies to use for different classes of problems, and how to choose other necessary hardware quantities as well. Alternate methods of changing the hardware implementation of an application problem are also considered and their utility discussed.

abstract: The single photon detection efficiency of the detector unit is crucial for the security of common quantum key distribution protocols like Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84). A low value for the efficiency indicates a possible eavesdropping attack that exploits photon receiver's imperfections. We present a method for estimating the detection efficiency, and calculate the corresponding secure key generation rate. The estimation is done by testing gated detectors using a randomly activated photon source inside the receiver unit. Additional realistic assumptions on the equipment are enforced by adding extra optical components in the receiver. The result is a quantum key distribution scheme that is secure against any attack that exploits detector imperfections.

abstract: We consider three different communication tasks for quantum broadcast channels, and we determine the capacity region of a Hadamard broadcast channel for these various tasks. We define a Hadamard broadcast channel to be such that the channel from the sender to one of the receivers is entanglement-breaking and the channel from the sender to the other receiver is complementary to this one. As such, this channel is a quantum generalization of a degraded broadcast channel, which is well known in classical information theory. The first communication task we consider is classical communication to both receivers, the second is quantum communication to the stronger receiver and classical communication to other, and the third is entanglement-assisted classical communication to the stronger receiver and unassisted classical communication to the other. The structure of a Hadamard broadcast channel plays a critical role in our analysis: the channel to the weaker receiver can be simulated by performing a measurement channel on the stronger receiver's system, followed by a preparation channel. As such, we can incorporate the classical output of the measurement channel as an auxiliary variable and solve all three of the above capacities for Hadamard broadcast channels, in this way avoiding known difficulties associated with quantum auxiliary variables.

abstract: Since the beginning of quantum mechanics, many puzzling phenomena which distinguish the quantum from the classical world, have appeared such as complementarity, entanglement or contextuality. All of these phenomena are based on the existence of non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, theses effects generate advantages which allow quantum technologies to surpass classical technologies. In this lecture note, we investigate two prominent examples of these phenomenons: complementarity and entanglement. We discuss some of their basic properties and introduce general methods for their experimental investigation. In this way, we find many connections between the investigation of complementarity and entanglement. One of these connections is given by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which helps to formulate quantitative measurement procedures to observe complementarity as well as entanglement.

abstract: We consider inter-atomic forces due to resonant dipole-dipole interactions within a dimer of highly excited Rydberg atoms, embedded in an ultra-cold gas. These forces rely on a coherent superposition of two-atom electronic states, which is destroyed by continuous monitoring of the dimer state through a detection scheme utilizing controllable interactions with the background gas atoms. We show that this intrinsic decoherence of the molecular energy surface can gradually deteriorate a repulsive dimer state, causing a mixing of attractive and repulsive character. For sufficiently strong decoherence, a Zeno-like effect causes a complete arrest of interatomic forces. We finally show how short decohering pulses can controllably redistribute population between the different molecular energy surfaces.

abstract: Quantum attributes of light have been related to non-classicality so far, i. e. to incompatibility with mixtures of coherent states. The progress in quantum optics indicates that this feature does not suffice to witness exotic behavior of light. Contrary, quantum non-Gaussianity is starting to appear as a promising and applicable property reflecting interesting states of light that are suitable for quantum protocols. We investigate a newly introduced hierarchy of criteria of quantum non-Gaussianity and predict this attribute can be observed on light emitted from many single photon emitters, even if the light undergoes realistic optical losses. It contrasts negativity of Wigner function, that is unreachable in experimental platforms with losses above fifty percent.

abstract: We study superdense coding with uniformly accelerated particle in single mode approximation and beyond single mode approximation. We use four different functions, the capacity of superdense coding, negativity, discord and the probability of success for evaluating the final results. In single mode approximation, all the four functions behave as expected, however in beyond single mode approximation, except the probability of success, the other three functions represent peculiar behaviors at least for special ranges where the beyond single mode approximation is strong.

abstract: Quantum repeaters provide an efficient solution to distribute Bell pairs over arbitrarily long distances. While scalable architectures are demanding regarding the number of qubits that need to be controlled, here we present a quantum repeater scheme aiming to extend the range of present day quantum communications that could be implemented in the near future with trapped ions in cavities. We focus on an architecture where ion-photon entangled states are created locally and subsequently processed with linear optics to create elementary links of ion-ion entangled states. These links are then used to distribute entangled pairs over long distances using successive entanglement swapping operations performed deterministically using ion-ion gates. We show how this architecture can be implemented while encoding the qubits in a decoherence free subspace to protect them against collective dephasing. This results in a protocol that can be used to violate a Bell inequality over distances of about 800 km assuming state of the art parameters. We discuss how this could be improved to several thousand kilometers in future setups.

abstract: Bogoliubov transformations have been successfully applied in several Condensed Matter contexts, e.g., in the theory of superconductors, superfluids, and antiferromagnets. These applications are based on bulk models where translation symmetry can be assumed, so that few degrees of freedom in Fourier space can be `diagonalized' separately, and in this way it is easy to find the approximate ground state and its excitations. As translation symmetry cannot be invoked when it comes about nanoscopic systems, the corresponding multidimensional Bogoliubov transformations are more complicated. For bosonic systems it is much simpler to proceed using phase-space variables, i.e., coordinates and momenta. Interactions can be accounted for by the self-consistent harmonic approximation, which is naturally developed using phase-space Weyl symbols. The spin-flop transition in a short antiferromagnetic chain is illustrated as an example. This approach, rarely used in the past, is expected to be generally useful to estimate quantum effects, e.g., on phase diagrams of ordered vs disordered phases.

The development of approximate quantum adders enhances the toolbox of quantum information protocols, paving the way for novel applications in quantum technologies.

abstract: Adiabatic invariants are introduced and shown to provide an approximate second integral of motion for the non-integrable Dicke model, in the energy region where the system exhibits a regular dynamics. This low-energy region is always present and has been described both in a semiclassical and a full quantum analysis. Its Peres lattices exhibit that many observables vary smoothly with energy, along lines which beg for a formal description. It is shown how the adiabatic invariants provide a rationale to their presence in many cases. They are built employing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, valid when a fast system is coupled to a much slower one. As the Dicke model has a one bosonic and one fermionic degree of freedom, two versions of the approximation are used, depending on which one is the faster. In both cases a noticeably accord with exact numerical results is obtained. The employment of the adiabatic invariants provides a simple and clear theoretical framework to study the physical phenomenology associated to this energy regime, far beyond the energies where the quadratic approximation can be employed.

abstract: Harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics offers the possibility to deliver new technologies that can fundamentally outperform their classical counterparts. These technologies only deliver advantages when components operate with performance beyond specific thresholds. For optical quantum metrology, the biggest challenge that impacts on performance thresholds is optical loss. Here we demonstrate how including an optical delay and an optical switch in a feed-forward configuration with a stable and efficient correlated photon pair source reduces the detector efficiency required to enable quantum enhanced sensing down to the detection level of single photons. When the switch is active, we observe a factor of improvement in precision of 1.27 for transmission measurement on a per input photon basis, compared to the performance of a laser emitting an ideal coherent state and measured with the same detection efficiency as our setup. When the switch is inoperative, we observe no quantum advantage.

abstract: Engineering apparatus that harness quantum theory offers practical advantages over current technology. A fundamentally more powerful prospect is the long-standing prediction that such quantum technologies could out-perform any future iteration of their classical counterparts, no matter how well the attributes of those classical strategies can be improved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such an instance of \textit{absolute} advantage per photon probe in the precision of optical direct absorption measurement. We use correlated intensity measurements of spontaneous parametric downconversion using a commercially available air-cooled CCD, a new estimator for data analysis and a high heralding efficiency photon-pair source. We show this enables improvement in the precision of measurement, per photon probe, beyond what is achievable with an ideal coherent state (a perfect laser) detected with $100\%$ efficient and noiseless detection. We see this absolute improvement for up to $50\%$ absorption, with a maximum observed factor of improvement of 1.46. This equates to around $32\%$ reduction in the total number of photons traversing an optical sample, compared to any future direct optical absorption measurement using classical light.

abstract: Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be achieved with paramagnetic defects such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres under the control of periodic dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences. While the application of DD can significantly extend the coherence time of the electron spin in the defect and amplify weak signals, spurious resonances occur due to the finite duration of DD pulses and lead to false identification of NMR signals. In this work we use Floquet theory to obtain an analytic expression for \emph{all} experimental signals generated by periodic DD even at high duty cycles. Furthermore it is shown that, counterintuitively, spurious resonances can provide with improved spectral resolution.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a dispersive qubit readout scheme where two-mode squeezing is generated directly in the measurement cavities. The resulting suppression of noise enables fast, high- fidelity readout of naturally weakly coupled qubits, and the possibility to protect strongly coupled qubits from decoherence by weakening their coupling. Unlike other approaches exploiting squeezing, our setup avoids the difficult task of transporting and injecting with high fidelity an externally-generated squeezed state. Our setup is also surprisingly robust against unwanted non-QND backaction effects, as interference naturally suppresses Purcell decay: the system acts as its own Purcell filter. Our setup is compatible with the experimental state-of-the-art in circuit QED systems, but the basic idea could also be realized in other systems.

abstract: The possibility of performing simultaneous measurements in quantum mechanics is investigated in the context of the Curie-Weiss model for a projective measurement. Concretely, we consider a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system simultaneously interacting with two magnets, which act as measuring apparatuses of two different spin components. We work out the dynamics of this process and determine the final state of the measuring apparatuses, from which we can find the probabilities of the four possible outcomes of the measurements. The measurement is found to be non-ideal, as (i) the joint statistics do not coincide with the one obtained by separately measuring each spin component, and (ii) the density matrix of the spin does not collapse in either of the measured observables. However, we give an operational interpretation of the process as a generalised quantum measurement, and show that it is fully informative: The expected value of the measured spin components can be found with arbitrary precision for sufficiently many runs of the experiment.

abstract: We propose a novel approach to precisely synthesize arbitrary polarization states of light with a high modulation bandwidth. Our approach consists in superposing two laser light fields with the same wavelength, but with opposite circular polarizations, where the phase and amplitude of each light field are individually controlled. To assess the precision of the synthesized polarization states, we characterize static spatial variations of the polarization over the wavefront, as well as the noise spectral density of temporal fluctuations. We find that static polarization distortions limit the extinction ratio to $2\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a 0.01% reduction of the degree of polarization (DOP). We also obtain that temporal fluctuations give rise to a $0.2^\circ$ uncertainty in the state of polarization (SOP). We recently demonstrated an application of the polarization synthesizer (Robens et al., arXiv:1608.02410) to create two fully independent, controllable optical lattices, which trap atoms depending on their internal spin state. Probing ultracold atoms in polarization-synthesized optical lattices, we obtain an independent, complementary characterization of the optical performance of the polarization synthesizer.

abstract: Characterization of the multipartite mixed state entanglement is still a challenging problem. Since due to the fact that the entanglement for the mixed states, in general, is defined by a convex-roof extension. That is the entanglement measure of a mixed state \r{ho} of a quantum system can be defined as the minimum average entanglement of an ensemble of pure states. In this Letter, we give an explicit formula for the polynomial entanglement measures of degree 2 of even-N qubits mixed states that is similar to Wooters formula in [1]. Then we discuss our findings in the framework of X density matrices and show that our formula for this type of density matrices is in the full agreement with the genuine multipartite (GM) entanglement of these states.

abstract: A pair of atoms interacts with non-resonant light via its anisotropic polarizability. This effect can be used to tune the scattering properties of the atoms. Although the light-atom interaction varies with interatomic separation as $1/R^{3}$, the effective s-wave potential decreases more rapidly, as $1/R^{4}$ such that the field-dressed scattering length can be determined without any formal difficulty. The scattering dynamics are essentially governed by the long-range part of the interatomic interaction and can thus be accurately described by an asymptotic model [Crubellier et al., New J. Phys. 17, 045020 (2015)]. Here we use the asymptotic model to determine the field-dressed scattering length from the s-wave radial component of a particular threshold wave function. Applying our theory to the scattering of two strontium isotopes, we calculate the variation of the scattering length with the intensity of the non-resonant light. Moreover, we predict the intensities at which the scattering length becomes infinite for any pair of atoms.

abstract: After more than a decade, direct observation of the odd frequency triplet pairing state in super- conducting hybrid structures remains elusive. We propose an experimentally feasible setup that can unambiguously reveal the zero energy peak due to proximity-induced equal spin superconducting triplet correlations. We theoretically investigate a two dimensional Josephson junction in the diffu- sive regime. The nanostructure consists of a normal metal sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers with spiral magnetization patterns. By applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the junction plane, vortices nucleate in the normal metal. The calculated energy and spatially resolved density of states, along with the pair potential, reveal that remarkably, only triplet Cooper pairs survive in the vortex cores. These isolated odd frequency triplet correlations result in well defined zero energy peaks in the local density of states that can be identified through tunneling spectroscopy experiments. Moreover, the diffusive regime considered here rules out the possibility of Andreev bound states in the vortex core as contributors to the zero energy peaks.

abstract: We propose a definition of partial transpose for a fermionic density matrix based on time-reversal transformation in the Grassmannian coherent state representation of fermions. Using this definition, we present a path-integral picture and develop methods to compute the entanglement negativity associated with the partial time-reversal. For noninteracting fermions, we derive an exact formula for the entanglement negativity which can be straightforwardly computed for any lattice models. We benchmark our method against two examples: Majorana chain and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where we also provide analytical expressions for the negativity in the fixed-point limits of topological phases as well as at the criticality. The results at the criticality match with previous conformal field theory calculations. Our definition of partial transpose is intrinsically fermionic and goes beyond previous definitions by capturing not only the singlet bonds but also the Majorana bonds between two subsystems. Finally, we uncover the first concrete microscopic calculation of the entanglement negativity in the random singlet phase of disordered spin chains.

abstract: Interferometry is one of the central organizing principles of optics. Key to interferometry is the concept of optical delay, which facilitates spectral analysis in terms of time-harmonics. In contrast, when analyzing a beam in a Hilbert space spanned by spatial modes -- a critical task for spatial-mode multiplexing and quantum communication -- basis-specific principles are invoked that are altogether distinct from that of `delay.' Here, we extend the traditional concept of temporal delay to the spatial domain, thereby enabling the analysis of a beam in an arbitrary spatial-mode basis -- exemplified using Hermite-Gaussian and radial Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Such generalized delays correspond to optical implementations of fractional transforms; for example, the fractional Hankel transform is the generalized delay associated with the space of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, and an interferometer incorporating such a `delay' obtains modal weights in the associated Hilbert space. By implementing an inherently stable, reconfigurable spatial-light-modulator-based polarization- interferometer, we have constructed a `Hilbert-space analyzer' capable of projecting optical beams onto any modal basis.

abstract: The variance and uncertainty product of the position and momentum many-particle operators of structureless bosons interacting by a long-range inter-particle interaction and trapped in a single-well potential are investigated. In the first example, of an out-of-equilibrium interaction-quench scenario, it is found that, despite the system being fully condensed, already when a fraction of a particle is depleted differences with respect to the mean-field quantities emerge. In the second example, of the pathway from condensation to fragmentation of the ground state, we find out that, although the cloud's density broadens while the system's fragments, the position variance actually decreases, the momentum variance increases, and the uncertainty product is not a monotonous function but has a maximum. Implication are briefly discussed.

abstract: We present systematic constructions of tensor-network wavefunctions for bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases respecting both onsite and spatial symmetries. From the classification point of view, our results show that in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, the cohomological bosonic SPT phases protected by a general symmetry group $SG$ involving onsite and spatial symmetries are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(SG,U(1))$, in which both the time-reversal symmetry and mirror reflection symmetries should be treated as anti-unitary operations. In addition, for every SPT phase protected by a discrete symmetry group and some SPT phases protected by continous symmetry groups, generic tensor-network wavefunctions can be constructed which would be useful for the purpose of variational numerical simulations. As a by-product, our results demonstrate a generic connection between rather conventional symmetry enriched topological phases and SPT phases via an anyon condensation mechanism.

abstract: Photonic integration is an enabling technology for photonic quantum science, offering greater scalability, stability, and functionality than traditional bulk optics. Here, we describe a scalable, heterogeneous III-V/silicon integration platform to produce Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic circuits incorporating GaAs-based nanophotonic devices containing self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots. We demonstrate pure singlephoton emission from individual quantum dots in GaAs waveguides and cavities - where strong control of spontaneous emission rate is observed - directly launched into Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides with > 90 % efficiency through evanescent coupling. To date, InAs/GaAs quantum dots constitute the most promising solidstate triggered single-photon sources, offering bright, pure and indistinguishable emission that can be electrically and optically controlled. Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides offer low-loss propagation, tailorable dispersion and high Kerr nonlinearities, desirable for linear and nonlinear optical signal processing down to the quantum level. We combine these two in an integration platform that will enable a new class of scalable, efficient and versatile integrated quantum photonic devices

abstract: The experimental realization of 2D Bose gases with a tunable interaction strength is an important challenge for the study of ultracold quantum matter. Here we report on the realization of an optical accordion creating a lattice potential with a spacing that can be dynamically tuned between 11$\,\mu$m and 2$\,\mu$m. We show that we can load ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms into a single node of this optical lattice in the large spacing configuration and then decrease nearly adiabatically the spacing to reach a strong harmonic confinement with frequencies larger than $\omega_z/2\pi=10\,$kHz. Atoms are trapped in an additional flat-bottom in-plane potential that is shaped with a high resolution. By combining these tools we create custom-shaped uniform 2D Bose gases with tunable confinement along the transverse direction and hence with a tunable interaction strength.

abstract: We explore the ground state properties of cold atomic gases, loaded into a bichromatic lattice, focusing on the cases of non-interacting fermions and hard-core (Tonks-Girardeau) bosons, trapped by the combination of two potentials with incommensurate periods. For such systems, two limiting cases have been thoroughly established. In the tight-binding limit, the single-particle states in the lowest occupied band show a localization transition, as the strength of the second potential is increased above a certain threshold. In the continuous limit, when the tight-binding approximation does not hold anymore, a mobility edge is found, whose position in energy depends upon the strength of the second potential. Here, we study how the crossover from the discrete to the continuum behavior occurs, and prove that signatures of the localization transition and mobility edge clearly appear in the generic many-body properties of the systems. Specifically, we evaluate the momentum distribution, which is a routinely measured quantity in experiments with cold atoms, and demonstrate that, even in the presence of strong boson-boson interactions, the single particle mobility edge can be observed in the ground state properties.

abstract: Electric resistance in conducting media is related to heat (or entropy) production in presence of electric fields. In this paper, by using Araki's relative entropy for states, we mathematically define and analyze the heat production of free fermions within external potentials. More precisely, we investigate the heat production of the non-autonomous C*-dynamical system obtained from the fermionic second quantization of a discrete Schr\"odinger operator with bounded static potential in presence of an electric field that is time- and space-dependent. It is a first preliminary step towards a mathematical description of transport properties of fermions from thermal considerations. This program will be carried out in several papers. The regime of small and slowly varying in space electric fields is important in this context, and is studied the present paper. We use tree-decay bounds of the $n$-point, $n\in 2\mathbb{N}$, correlations of the many-fermion system to analyze this regime. We verify below the 1st law of thermodynamics for the system under consideration. The latter implies, for systems doing no work, that the heat produced by the electromagnetic field is exactly the increase of the internal energy resulting from the modification of the (infinite volume) state of the fermion system. The identification of heat production with an energy increment is, among other things, technically convenient. We initially focus our study on non-interacting (or free) fermions, but our approach will be later applied to weakly interacting fermions.

abstract: We consider free lattice fermions subjected to a static bounded potential and a time- and space-dependent electric field. For any bounded convex region $\mathcal{R}\subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d\geq 1$) of space, electric fields $\mathcal{E}$ within $\mathcal{R}$ drive currents. At leading order, uniformly with respect to the volume $\left| \mathcal{R}\right| $ of $\mathcal{R}$ and the particular choice of the static potential, the dependency on $\mathcal{E}$ of the current is linear and described by a conductivity distribution. Because of the positivity of the heat production, the real part of its Fourier transform is a positive measure, named here (microscopic) conductivity measure of $\mathcal{R}$, in accordance with Ohm's law in Fourier space. This finite measure is the Fourier transform of a time-correlation function of current fluctuations, i.e., the conductivity distribution satisfies Green-Kubo relations. We additionally show that this measure can also be seen as the boundary value of the Laplace-Fourier transform of a so-called quantum current viscosity. The real and imaginary parts of conductivity distributions satisfy Kramers-Kronig relations. At leading order, uniformly with respect to parameters, the heat production is the classical work performed by electric fields on the system in presence of currents. The conductivity measure is uniformly bounded with respect to parameters of the system and it is never the trivial measure $0\,\mathrm{d}\nu $. Therefore, electric fields generally produce heat in such systems. In fact, the conductivity measure defines a quadratic form in the space of Schwartz functions, the Legendre-Fenchel transform of which describes the resistivity of the system. This leads to Joule's law, i.e., the heat produced by currents is proportional to the resistivity and the square of currents.

abstract: We extend [Bru-de Siqueira Pedra-Hertling, J. Math. Phys. 56 (2015) 051901] in order to study the linear response of free fermions on the lattice within a (independently and identically distributed) random potential to a macroscopic electric field that is time- and space-dependent. We obtain the notion of a macroscopic AC-conductivity measure which only results from the second principle of thermodynamics. The latter corresponds here to the positivity of the heat production for cyclic processes on equilibrium states. Its Fourier transform is a continuous bounded function which is naturally called (macroscopic) conductivity. We additionally derive Green-Kubo relations involving time-correlations of bosonic fields coming from current fluctuations in the system. This is reminiscent of non-commutative central limit theorems.

abstract: The problem of reconstructing information on a physical system from data acquired in long sequences of direct (projective) measurements of some simple physical quantities - histories - is analyzed within quantum mechanics; that is, the quantum theory of indirect measurements, and, in particular, of non-demolition measurements is studied. It is shown that indirect measurements of time-independent features of physical systems can be described in terms of quantum-mechanical operators belonging to an algebra of asymptotic observables. Our proof involves associating a natural measure space with certain sets of histories of a system and showing that quantum-mechanical states of the system determine probability measures on this space. Our main result then says that functions on that space of histories measurable at infinity (i.e., functions that only depend on the tails of histories) correspond to operators in the algebra of asymptotic observables.

abstract: The nonrelativistic limit of nonlocal modifications to the Klein Gordon operator is studied, and the experimental possibilities of casting stringent constraints on the nonlocality scale via planned and/or current optomechanical experiments are discussed. Details of the perturbative analysis and semianalitical simulations leading to the dynamical evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator in the presence of non locality reported in [1], together with a comprehensive account of the experimental methodology with particular regard to sensitivity limitations related to thermal decoherence time and active cooling of the oscillator, are given. Finally, a strategy for detecting non-locality scales of the order of $10^{- 22} \div 10^{- 26}$ m by means of the spontaneous time periodic squeezing of quantum coherent states is provided.

abstract: We explore, both experimentally and theoretically, the propagation dynamics of spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons). Characterization of entanglement is done via the Schmidt number, which is a universal measurement of the degree of entanglement directly related to the non-separability of the state into its subsystems. We develop expressions for the terms of the Schmidt number that depend on the amplitude and phase of the commonly used double-Gaussian approximation for the biphoton wave function, and demonstrate migration of entanglement between amplitude and phase upon propagation. We then extend this analysis to incorporate both phase curvature in the pump beam and higher spatial frequency content of more realistic non-Gaussian wave functions. Specifically, we generalize the classical beam quality parameter $M^2$ to the biphotons, allowing the description of more information-rich beams and more complex dynamics. Agreement is found with experimental measurements using direct imaging and Fourier optics.
