abstract: Grover's algorithm constitutes the optimal quantum solution to the search problem and provides a quadratic speed-up over all possible classical search algorithms. Quantum interference between computational paths has been posited as a key resource behind this computational speed-up. However there is a limit to this interference, at most pairs of paths can ever interact in a fundamental way. Could more interference imply more computational power? Sorkin has defined a hierarchy of possible interference behaviours---currently under experimental investigation---where classical theory is at the first level of the hierarchy and quantum theory belongs to the second. Informally, the order in the hierarchy corresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible interaction in a multi-slit experiment. In this work, we consider how Grover's speed-up depends on the order of interference in a theory. Surprisingly, we show that the quadratic lower bound holds regardless of the order of interference. Thus, at least from the point of view of the search problem, post-quantum interference does not imply a computational speed-up over quantum theory.

abstract: The prospect of quantum simulating lattice gauge theories opens exciting possibilities for understanding fundamental forms of matter. Here, we show that trapped ions represent a promising platform in this context when simultaneously exploiting internal pseudo-spins and external phonon vibrations. We illustrate our ideas with two complementary proposals for simulating lattice-regularized quantum electrodynamics (QED) in (1+1) space-time dimensions. The first scheme replaces the gauge fields by local vibrations with a high occupation number. By numerical finite-size scaling, we demonstrate that this model recovers Wilson's lattice gauge theory in a controlled way. Its implementation can be scaled up to tens of ions in an array of micro-traps. The second scheme represents the gauge fields by spins 1/2, and thus simulates a quantum link model. As we show, this allows the fermionic matter to be replaced by bosonic degrees of freedom, permitting small-scale implementations in a linear Paul trap. Both schemes work on energy scales significantly larger than typical decoherence rates in experiments, thus enabling the investigation of phenomena such as string breaking, Coleman's quantum phase transition, and false-vacuum decay. The underlying ideas of the proposed analog simulation schemes may also be adapted to other platforms, such as superconducting qubits.

abstract: We report experimental observations of large Bragg reflection from arrays of cold atoms trapped near a one-dimensional nanoscale waveguide. By using an optical lattice in the evanescent field surrounding a nanofiber with a period close to commensurate with the resonant wavelength, we observe a reflectance up to 75% for the guided mode. Each atom behaves as a partially-reflecting mirror and an ordered chain of about 2000 atoms is sufficient to realize an efficient Bragg mirror. Measurements of the reflection spectra as a function of the lattice period and the probe polarization are reported. The latter shows the effect of the chiral character of nanoscale waveguides on this reflection. The ability to control photon transport in 1D waveguides coupled to spin systems would allow for novel quantum network capabilities and many-body effects emerging from long-range interactions.

abstract: This paper presents two realizations of linear quantum systems for covariance assignment corresponding to pure Gaussian states. The first one is called a cascade realization; given any covariance matrix corresponding to a pure Gaussian state, we can construct a cascaded quantum system generating that state. The second one is called a locally dissipative realization; given a covariance matrix corresponding to a pure Gaussian state, if it satisfies certain conditions, we can construct a linear quantum system that has only local interactions with its environment and achieves the assigned covariance matrix. Both realizations are illustrated by examples from quantum optics.

abstract: The "thermal operations" (TO) framework developed in past works is used to model the evolution of microscopic quantum systems in contact with thermal baths. Here we extend the TO model to describe hybrid devices consisting of quantum systems controlled by macroscopic or otherwise classical elements external to the system-bath setup. We define the operations of such hybrid devices as conditioned thermal operations (CTO), and their deviation from thermal equilibrium as conditional athermality. We develop the resource theory of conditional athermality, including its characterization, quantification, and manipulation. We find that our formalism unifies those of thermo-majorization (M. Horodecki and J. Oppenheim, Nat. Commun. 4, 2013) and conditional majorization (G. Gour et al., arXiv:1506.07124, 2015). After introducing conditional athermality monotones, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for single-copy resource conversion, as well as the asymptotic rate of many-copy conversion. As an application, we derive the conditions for probabilistic conversion of athermality, and find them to be analogous to results on stochastic entanglement manipulation (D. Jonathan and M. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1455, 1999; G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1046, 1999).

abstract: We argue that if, in order to reverse an object's dynamics, we need to be able to keep track of it with enough precision, then there is an upper bound on the size of the object whose dynamics we can reverse - even using all the available resources of the universe. Using a bound from the holographic principle and treating the universe as the ultimate quantum computer, we show that if we want to reverse the dynamics of an object which has evolved since the beginning of time, its radius cannot exceed ten microns. If this computation is performed irreversibly, the object must be much smaller. This places a lower bound on the size of the smallest possible quantum measurement device.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.03282
abstract: A much simplified proof of the separability criterion for two-qubit systems, which is referred to as "Hefei inequality" in literature, is presented. This inequality gives a necessary and sufficient separability criterion for any mixed two-qubit system unlike the Bell-CHSH inequality which cannot test the separability of mixed-states such as the Werner state. It is shown that this inequality is a translation of the non-negativity of the partial-transposed density matrix of Peres-Hodrodecki and derived without referring to the uncertainty relation which played a primary role in the original derivation. Our novel approach, which exhibits an interesting analogy to the 4-dimensional Dirac equation, may shed light on this inequality. This separability criterion is illustrated for an exact treatment of the Werner state.

abstract: Motion-induced dephasing is a dominant decoherence mechanism for atom-gas quantum memories. In this paper, we develop a new coherent manipulation technique which enables arbitrary engineering of the spin-wave momentum with neglectable noise. By zeroing the spin-wave momentum, motion-induced dephasing can be frozen completely. We experimentally demonstrate this scheme with laser-cooled atoms in a DLCZ configuration. By applying the freezing pulses, memory lifetime gets extended significantly to the limit of atom cloud expansion and does not depend on the detection angle anymore. The observed high cross-correlation above 20 proves that high-fidelity memory operation is well preserved after coherent manipulation.

abstract: Random numbers are a fundamental resource in science and engineering with important applications in simulation and cryptography. The inherent randomness at the core of quantum mechanics makes quantum systems a perfect source of entropy. Quantum random number generation is one of the most mature quantum technologies with many alternative generation methods. We discuss the different technologies in quantum random number generation from the early devices based on radioactive decay to the multiple ways to use the quantum states of light to gather entropy from a quantum origin. We also discuss randomness extraction and amplification and the notable possibility of generating trusted random numbers even with untrusted hardware using device independent generation protocols.

abstract: Motivated by transitionless quantum driving, we construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three-atom system to create a singlet state with the help of quantum zeno dynamics and non-resonant lasers. The influence of various decoherence processes is discussed by numerical simulation and the results reveal that the scheme is fast and robust against decoherence and operational imperfection. We also investigate how to select the experimental parameters to control the cavity dissipation and atomic spontaneous emission which will have an application value in experiment.

abstract: In both quantum optics and cold atom physics, the behaviour of bosonic photons and atoms is often treated using phase space methods, where mode annihilation and creation operators are represented by c-number phase space variables, with the density operator equivalent to a distribution function of these variables. The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation operators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables to represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill and Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in quantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion coherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics. This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on distribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve Grassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation, creation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper for fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator is replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space variables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This further development of the theory is important for the situation when large numbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat separately. Here Grassmann fields, distribution functionals, functional Fokker-Planck equations and Ito stochastic field equations are involved. Typical applications to a trapped Fermi gas of interacting spin 1/2 fermionic atoms and to multi-component Fermi gases with non-zero range interactions are presented, showing that the Ito stochastic field equations are local in these cases. Solutions for spin 1/2 fermions either free or in lattices are found.

abstract: We apply the framework of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics to the physics of quenched small-size bosonic quantum gases in a harmonic trap. By studying the temporal behaviour of the Loschmidt echo and of the atomic density profile within the trap, which are informative of the non-equilibrium physics and the correlations among the particles, we establish a link with the statistics of (irreversible) work done on the system. This highlights interesting connections between the degree of inter-particle entanglement and the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the system.

The experiment can be carried out in a laboratory and it provides a test of relativity in the quantum domain.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.03391
abstract: A recent framework of quantum theory with no global causal order predicts the existence of "causally nonseparable" processes. Some of these processes produce correlations incompatible with any causal order (they violate so-called "causal inequalities" analogous to Bell inequalities) while others do not (they admit a "causal model" analogous to a local model). Since the only processes known to be physically implementable have a causal model, it is tempting to conjecture that having a causal model singles out physically realizable processes. Here we provide evidence against this conjecture. We show for the first time that bipartite causally nonseparable processes with a causal model exist, and argue that they have no clear physical interpretation. We also provide an algorithm to generate processes of this kind and show that they have nonzero measure in the set of all processes. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of processes which stop violating causal inequalities but are still causally nonseparable when mixed with a certain amount of "white noise". This is reminiscent of the behavior of Werner states in the context of entanglement and nonlocality.

We show that the most natural extension of the inequality does not hold in general, and we describe the violations of this inequality in detail. We investigate alternative ways to extend the monogamy inequality to express a constraint on entanglement sharing valid for all four-qubit states, and perform an extensive numerical analysis of randomly generated four-qubit states to explore the properties of such extensions.

abstract: Coherent backscattering is a coherence effect in the propagation of waves through disordered media involving two or more scattering events. Here, we report on the observation of coherent backscattering from individual atoms and their mirror images. This system displays two important advantages: First, the effect can be observed at low optical densities, which allows to work in very dilute clouds or far from resonance. Second, due to the fact that the radiation of an atom interferes constructively with that of its own image, the phenomenon is much more robust to dephasing induced by strong saturation. In particular, the contribution of inelastically scattered photons to the interference process is demonstrated.

abstract: Integrated optics provides the platform for the experimental implementation of highly complex and compact circuits for quantum information applications. In this context integrated waveguide sources represent a powerful resource for the generation of quantum states of light due to their high brightness and stability. However, the confinement of the light in a single spatial mode limits the realization of multi-channel sources. Due to this challenge one of the most adopted sources in quantum information processes, i.e. a source which generates spectrally indistinguishable polarization entangled photons in two different spatial modes, has not yet been realized in a fully integrated platform. Here we overcome this limitation by suitably engineering two periodically poled waveguides and an integrated polarization splitter in lithium niobate. This source produces polarization entangled states with fidelity of F = 0.973(3) and a test of Bell's inequality results in a violation larger than 14 standard deviations. It can work both in pulsed and continuous wave regime. This device represents a new step toward the implementation of fully integrated circuits for quantum information applications.

abstract: We find a strong-converse bound on the private capacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited two-way classical communication. The bound is based on the max-relative entropy of entanglement and its proof uses a new inequality for the sandwiched R\'{e}nyi divergences based on complex interpolation techniques. We provide explicit examples of quantum channels where our bound improves both the transposition bound (on the quantum capacity assisted by classical communication) and the bound based on the squashed entanglement introduced by Takeoka et al.. As an application we study a repeater version of the private capacity assisted by classical communication and provide an example of a quantum channel with negligible private repeater capacity.

We then define a heat operator by extending the stochastic energetics and show that this operator satisfies properties corresponding to the first and second laws in thermodynamics. We further find that the upper bound of the heat flux depends on the memory effect induced by quantum fluctuations and hence the maximum extractable work can be qualitatively modified in quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: We show that the Lyapunov exponents of quantum systems under monitoring are sensitive to the choice of measurement strategy. In particular, there is a region between the deep quantum regime and the classical limit where the choice of monitoring has a crucial effect on the complex behaviour of the system, leading to either the emergence or suppression of chaos. Our work shows that this effect stems from the interplay between the underlying nonlinear dynamics and the ways the system couples to the quantum noise for different measurement scenarios.

abstract: The spin-1 classical Blume-Capel model on a square lattice is known to exhibit a finite-temperature phase transition described by the tricritical Ising CFT in 1+1 space-time dimensions. This phase transition can be accessed with classical Monte Carlo simulations, which, via a replica-trick calculation, can be used to study the shape-dependence of the classical R\'enyi entropies for a torus divided into two cylinders. From the second R\'enyi entropy, we calculate the Geometrical Mutual Information (GMI) introduced by St\'ephan et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 127204 (2014)] and use it to extract a numerical estimate for the value of the central charge near the tricritical point. By comparing to the known CFT result, $c=7/10$, we demonstrate how this type of GMI calculation can be used to estimate the position of the tricritical point in the phase diagram.

abstract: The thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to periodically modulated heat baths and work reservoirs is developed. By identifying affinities and fluxes, the first and second law are formulated consistently. In the linear response regime, entropy production becomes a quadratic form in the affinities. Specializing to Lindblad-dynamics, we identify the corresponding kinetic coefficients in terms of correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. Reciprocity relations follow from symmetries with respect to time reversal. The kinetic coefficients can be split into a classical and a quantum contribution subject to a new constraint, which follows from a natural detailed balance condition. This constraint implies universal bounds on efficiency and power of quantum heat engines. In particular, we show that Carnot efficiency can not be reached whenever quantum coherence effects are present, i.e., when the Hamiltonian used for work extraction does not commute with the bare system Hamiltonian. For illustration, we specialize our universal results to a driven two-level system in contact with a heat bath of sinusoidally modulated temperature.

abstract: Mean-field theory (MFT) is one of the main available tools for analytical calculations entailed in investigations regarding many-body systems. Recently, there have been an urge of interest in ameliorating this kind of method, mainly with the aim of incorporating geometric and correlation properties of these systems. The correlated cluster MFT (CCMFT) is an improvement that succeeded quite well in doing that for classical spin systems. Nevertheless, even the CCMFT presents some deficiencies when applied to quantum systems. In this article, we address this issue by proposing the quantum CCMFT (QCCMFT), which, in contrast to its former approach, uses general quantum states in its self-consistent mean-field equations. We apply the introduced QCCMFT to the transverse Ising model in honeycomb, square, and simple cubic lattices and obtain fairly good results both for the Curie temperature of thermal phase transition and for the critical field of quantum phase transition. Actually, our results match those obtained via exact solutions, series expansions or Monte Carlo simulations.
