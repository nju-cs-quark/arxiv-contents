abstract: Envariance - entanglement assisted invariance - is a recently discovered symmetry of composite quantum systems. In this work, it is shown that thermodynamic equilibrium states are fully characterized by their envariance. In particular, the microcanonical equilibrium of a system $\mathcal{S} $ with Hamiltonian $H_\mathcal{S}$ can be described as an "even", i.e., envariant under any unitary transformation, fully energetically degenerate quantum state. The representation of the canonical equilibrium then follows from simply counting degenerate energy states. Our conceptually novel approach is free of mathematically ambiguous notions such as probability, ensemble, randomness, etc. .

abstract: Traditionally, the field of quantum foundations has been preoccupied with different forms of the question "How can an observer be in a state of quantum superposition?". In this paper, I approach this question by exploring a timeless interpretation of quantum mechanics \emph{of closed systems}, solely in terms of path integrals in non-relativistic timeless configuration space. What prompts a fresh look at the foundational problems in this context, is the advent of multiple gravitational models in which Lorentz symmetry is only emergent. In this setting, I propose a new understanding of records as certain relations between two configurations, the recorded one and the record-holding one. These relations are formalized through a factorization of the amplitude kernel, which forbids unwanted `recoherence' of branches. On this basis, I show that in simple cases the Born rule emerges from counting the relative density of observers with the same records. Furthermore, unlike what occurs in consistent histories, in this context there is indeed a preferred notion of coarse-grainings: those centered around piece-wise classical paths in configuration space. Thus, this new understanding claims to resolve aspects of the measurement problem which are still deemed controversial in the standard approaches.

abstract: The procedure proposed recently by J.Bougie, A.Gangopadhyaya and J.V.Mallow to study the general form of shape invariant potentials in one-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM) is generalized to the case of Higher Order SUSY QM with supercharges of second order in momentum. A new shape invariant potential is constructed by this method. It is singular at the origin, it grows at infinity, and its spectrum depends on the choice of connection conditions in the singular point. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is solved explicitly: the wave functions are constructed analytically, and the energy spectrum is defined implicitly via the transcendental equation which involves Confluent Hypergeometric functions.

abstract: We propose a protocol for measurement of the phonon number distribution of a harmonic oscillator based on selective mapping to a discrete spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We consider a system of a harmonically trapped ion, where a transition between two long lived states can be driven with resolved motional sidebands. The required unitary transforms are generated by amplitude-modulated polychromatic radiation fields, where the time-domain ramps are obtained from numerical optimization by application of the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior of the attainable fidelities and required times for the mapping transform with respect to the size of the Hilbert space. As one application we show how the mapping can be employed as a building block for experiments which require measurement of the work distribution of a quantum process.

abstract: We theoretically study the quantum receivers with adaptive measurements feedback for discriminating quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) coherent states in terms of average symbol error rate. For rectangular 16-QAM signal set, with different stages of adaptive measurements, the effects of realistic imperfection parameters including the sub-unity quantum efficiency and the dark counts of on-off detectors, as well as the transmittance of beam splitters and the mode mismatch factor between the signal and local oscillating fields on the symbol error rate are separately investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. Using photon-number-resolving detectors (PNRD) instead of on-off detectors, all the effects on the symbol error rate due to the above four imperfections can be suppressed in a certain degree. The finite resolution and PNR capability of PNRDs are also considered. We find that for currently available technology, the receiver shows a reasonable gain from the standard quantum limit (SQL) with moderate stages.

abstract: We analyze theoretically the measurement of the mean output work and its fluctuations in a recently proposed optomechanical quantum heat engine [K. Zhang {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf112}, 150602 (2014)]. After showing that this work can be evaluated by a continuous measurements of the intracavity photon number we discuss both dispersive and absorptive measurement schemes and analyze their back-action effects on the efficiency of the engine. Both measurements are found to reduce the efficiency of the engine, but their back-action is both qualitatively and quantitatively different. For dispersive measurements the efficiency decreases as a result of the mixing of photonic and phononic excitations, while for absorptive measurements, its reduction results from photon losses due to the interaction with the quantum probe.

abstract: Superconducting systems have a long history of use in experiments that push the frontiers of mechanical sensing. This includes both applied and fundamental research, which at present day ranges from quantum computing research and efforts to explore Planck-scale physics to fundamental studies on the nature of motion and the quantum limits on our ability to measure it. In this paper, we first provide a short history of the role of superconducting circuitry and devices in mechanical sensing, focusing primarily on efforts in the last decade to push the study of quantum mechanics to include motion on the scale of human-made structures. This background sets the stage for the remainder of the paper, which focuses on the development of quantum electromechanical systems (QEMS) that incorporate superconducting quantum bits (qubits), superconducting transmission line resonators and flexural nanomechanical elements. In addition to providing the motivation and relevant background on the physical behavior of these systems, we discuss our recent efforts to develop a particular type of QEMS that is based upon the Cooper-pair box (CPB) and superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavities, a system which has the potential to serve as a testbed for studying the quantum properties of motion in engineered systems.

abstract: The application of geometry to physics has provided us with new insightful information about many physical theories such as classical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum geometry (quantum gravity). The geometry also plays an important role in foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information. In this work we discuss a geometric framework for mixed quantum states represented by density matrices, where the quantum phase space of density matrices is equipped with a symplectic structure, an almost complex structure, and a compatible Riemannian metric. This compatible triple allow us to investigate arbitrary quantum systems. We will also discuss some applications of the geometric framework.

abstract: A proposal for a phase gate and a M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate in the dressed state basis is presented. In order to perform the multi-qubit interaction, a strong magnetic field gradient is required to couple the phonon-bus to the qubit states. The gate is performed using resonant microwave driving fields together with either a radio-frequency (RF) driving field, or additional detuned microwave driving fields. The gate is robust to ambient magnetic field fluctuations due to an applied resonant microwave driving field. Furthermore, the gate is robust to fluctuations in the microwave Rabi frequency and is decoupled from phonon dephasing due to a resonant RF or a detuned microwave driving field. This makes this new gate an attractive candidate for the implementation of high-fidelity microwave based multi-qubit gates. The proposal can also be realized in laser-based set-ups.

abstract: Recently, entanglement concentration was explicitly shown to be irreversible. However, it is still not clear what kind of states can be reversibly converted in the asymptotic setting by LOCC when neither the initial and the target states are maximally entangled. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled states in the asymptotic setting. Moreover, we show that conversion can be achieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition except for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free reversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose copies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of copies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In fact, we show such an example. In addition, we evaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the irreversibility of LOCC conversion.

abstract: We introduce local filters as a means to detect the entanglement of bound entangled states which do not yield to detection by witnesses based on positive (P) maps which are not completely positive (CP). We demonstrate how such non-detectable bound entangled states can be locally filtered into detectable bound entangled states. Specifically, we show that a bound entangled state in the orthogonal complement of the unextendible product bases (UPB), can be locally filtered into a another bound entangled state that is detectable by the Choi map. We reinterpret these filters as local measurements on locally extended Hilbert spaces. We give explicit constructions of a measurement-based implementation of these filters for $2 \otimes 2$ and $3 \otimes 3$ systems. This provides us with a physical mechanism to implement such local filters.

abstract: We present a derivation of the Markovian master equation using the time coarse graining method. Starting from a naive perturbative solution of the von Neumann equation, the reduced density matrix with the coarse grained time steps is obtained using the assumption of short correlation time of the bath field. Then applying the renormalization group method, it is shown that dependence of the specific initial time in the solution can be removed and the Markovian semi-group master equation in Lindblad form is attained in the weak coupling limit.

abstract: The full structuration of light in the transverse plane, including intensity, phase and polarization, holds the promise of unprecedented capabilities for applications in classical optics as well as in quantum optics and information sciences. Harnessing special topologies can lead to enhanced focusing, data multiplexing or advanced sensing and metrology. Here we experimentally demonstrate the storage of such spatio-polarization-patterned beams into an optical memory. A set of vectorial vortex modes is generated via liquid crystal cell with topological charge in the optic axis distribution, and preservation of the phase and polarization singularities is demonstrated after retrieval, at the single-photon level. The realized multiple-degree-of-freedom memory can find applications in classical data processing but also in quantum network scenarios where structured states have been shown to provide promising attributes, such as rotational invariance.

abstract: We investigate the nature of a gravitational two-state system (G2S) in the simplest setup in Newtonian gravity. In a quantum description of matter a single motionless massive particle can in principle be in a superposition state of two spatially-separated locations. This superposition state in gravity, or gravitational cat state, would lead to fluctuations in the Newtonian force exerted on a nearby test particle. The central quantity of importance for this inquiry is the energy density correlation. This corresponds to the noise kernel in stochastic gravity theory, evaluated in the weak field nonrelativistic limit. In this limit, quantum fluctuations of the stress energy tensor manifest as the fluctuations of the Newtonian force. We describe the properties of such a G2S system and present two ways of measuring the cat state for the Newtonian force, one by way of a classical probe, the other a quantum harmonic oscillator. Our findings include: (i) mass density fluctuations persist even in single particle systems, and they are of the same order of magnitude as the mean; (ii) a classical probe generically records a non-Markovian fluctuating force; (iii) a quantum probe interacting with the G2S system may undergo Rabi oscillations in a strong coupling regime. This simple prototypical gravitational quantum system could provide a robust testing ground to compare predictions from alternative quantum theories, since the results reported here are based on standard quantum mechanics and classical gravity.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that it is impossible to simulate quantum bipartite correlations with a deterministic universal Turing machine. Our approach is based on the Normalized Information Distance (NID) that allows the comparison of two pieces of data without detailed knowledge about their origin. Using NID, we derive an inequality for output of two local deterministic universal Turing machines with correlated inputs. This inequality is violated by correlations generated by a maximally entangled polarization state of two photons. The violation is shown using a freely available lossless compression program. The presented technique may allow to complement the common statistical interpretation of quantum physics by an algorithmic one.

abstract: Numerical methods for the 1-D Dirac equation based on operator splitting and on the quantum lattice Boltzmann (QLB) schemes are reviewed. It is shown that these discretizations fall within the class of quantum walks, i.e. discrete maps for complex fields, whose continuum limit delivers Dirac-like relativistic quantum wave equations. The correspondence between the quantum walk dynamics and these numerical schemes is given explicitly, allowing a connection between quantum computations, numerical analysis and lattice Boltzmann methods. The QLB method is then extended to the Dirac equation in curved spaces and it is demonstrated that the quantum walk structure is preserved. Finally, it is argued that the existence of this link between the discretized Dirac equation and quantum walks may be employed to simulate relativistic quantum dynamics on quantum computers.

abstract: We propose the use of the subwavelength localization via adiabatic passage technique for fluorescence microscopy with nanoscale resolution in the far field. This technique uses a {\Lambda}-type medium coherently coupled to two laser pulses: the pump, with a node in its spatial profile, and the Stokes. The population of the {\Lambda} system is adiabatically transferred from one ground state to the other except at the node position, yielding a narrow population peak. This coherent localization allows fluorescence imaging with nanometer lateral resolution. We derive an analytical expression to asses the resolution and perform a comparison with the coherent population trapping and the stimulated-emission-depletion techniques.

abstract: Multi-photon interferences in complex multimode structures - quantum walks - are of both funda- mental and technological interest. They rely on the ability to design the complex network where the walk occurs. Here, we demonstrate the control of quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in a complex linear system - a highly multimode fiber - by means of wavefront shaping techniques. Using the measured transmission matrix of the fiber, we demonstrate the ability to address arbitrary output modes of the two-photon speckle pattern, and simultaneous control of the quantum inter- ferences. This work provides a reconfigurable platform for multi-photon, multimode interference experiments and a route to high-dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: We investigate in detail a recently introduced "coherent averaging scheme" in terms of its usefulness for achieving Heisenberg limited sensitivity in the measurement of different parameters. In the scheme, $N$ quantum probes in a product state interact with a quantum bus. Instead of measuring the probes directly and then averaging as in classical averaging, one measures the quantum bus or the entire system and tries to estimate the parameters from these measurement results. Combining analytical results from perturbation theory and an exactly solvable dephasing model with numerical simulations, we draw a detailed picture of the scaling of the best achievable sensitivity with $N$, the dependence on the initial state, the interaction strength, the part of the system measured, and the parameter under investigation.

abstract: In response to a recent rebuttal of [1] presented in [2], we defend the claim that the Consistent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics does not solve the measurement problem. In order to do so, we argue that satisfactory solutions to the problem must not only not contain anthropomorphic terms (such as measurement or observer) at the fundamental level, but also that applications of the formalism to concrete situations (e.g., measurements) should not require any input not contained in the description of the situation at hand at the fundamental level. Our assertion is that the Consistent Histories formalism does not meet the second criterion. We also argue that the so-called second measurement problem, i.e., the inability to explain how an experimental result is related to a property possessed by the measured system before the measurement took place, is only a pseudo-problem. As a result, we reject the claim, defended in [2], that the capacity of the Consistent Histories formalism to solve it should count as an advantage over other interpretations.

abstract: In the pursuit of speculative new particles, forces, and dimensions with vanishingly small influence on normal matter, understanding the ultimate physical limits of experimental sensitivity is essential. Here, I show that quantum decoherence offers a window into otherwise inaccessible realms. There is a standard quantum limit for diffusion that restricts some entanglement-generating phenomena, like soft collisions with new particle species, from having appreciable classical influence on normal matter. Such phenomena are \emph{classically undetectable} but can be revealed by the anomalous decoherence they induce on non-classical superpositions with long-range coherence in phase space. This gives strong, novel motivation for the construction of matter interferometers and other experimental sources of large superpositions, which recently have seen rapid progress. Decoherence is always at least second order in the coupling strength, so such searches are best suited for soft, but not weak, interactions.

abstract: A special configuration of graph state stabilizers, which contains only Pauli $\sigma_X$ operators, is studied. The vertex sets $\xi$ associated with such configurations are defined as the X-chains of graph states. The X-chains of a general graph state can be determined efficiently. With the help of X-chains, one obtains the explicit representation of graph states in the X-basis via the so-called X-chain factorization diagram. We show that graph states with different X-chains can have different probability distributions of X-measurement outcomes, which allows to distinguish certain graph states with X-measurements. We provide an approach to find the Schmidt decomposition of graph states in the X-basis. The existence of X-chains in a subsystem facilitates error correction in the entanglement localization of graph states. In all these applications, the difficulty of the task decreases with increasing number of X-chains. Furthermore, we show that the overlap of two graph states can be efficiently determined via X-chains, while its computational complexity with other known methods increases exponentially.

abstract: In the de Broglie - Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics, the electron is stationary in the ground state of hydrogenic atoms, because the quantum force exactly cancels the Coulomb attraction of the electron to the nucleus. In this paper it is shown that classical electrodynamics similarly predicts the Coulomb force can be effectively canceled by part of the magnetic force that occurs between two particles each consisting of a point charge moving in a circulatory motion at the speed of light. Supposition of such motion is the basis of the {\em Zitterbewegung} interpretation of quantum theory. The magnetic force between two such particles for separation large compared to their circulatory motions contains a radial inverse square law part with magnitude equal to the Coulomb force, sinusoidally modulated by the phase difference between the circulatory motions. This raises a possibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to the magnetic force of classical electrodynamics.

We show that the modification to the entropic area law due to three-dimensional topological properties is richer than the two-dimensional case. In addition to the reduction of the entropy caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of contractible loop operators a new topological invariant appears that increases the entropy if the model consists of non-trivially braiding anyons. As a result the three-dimensional topological entanglement entropy provides only partial information about the two entropic topological invariants.

abstract: Ultracold atoms confined by engineered magnetic or optical potentials are ideal systems for studying phenomena otherwise difficult to realize or probe in the solid state because their atomic interaction strength, number of species, density, and geometry can be independently controlled. This review focuses on quantum transport phenomena in atomic gases that mirror and oftentimes either better elucidate or show fundamental differences with those observed in mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems. We discuss significant progress in performing transport experiments in atomic gases, contrast similarities and differences between transport in cold atoms and in condensed matter systems, and survey inspiring theoretical predictions that are difficult to verify in conventional setups. These results further demonstrate the versatility offered by atomic systems in the study of nonequilibrium phenomena and their promise for novel applications.

abstract: A two dimensional electron gas on a cylindrical surface with a screw dislocation is considered. More precisely, we investigate how both the geometry and the deformed potential due to a lattice distortion affect the Landau levels of such system. The case showing the deformed potential can be thought in the context of 3D common semiconductors where the electrons are confined on a cylindrical shell. We will show that important quantitative differences exist due to this lattice distortion. For instance, the effective cyclotron frequency is diminished by the deformed potential, which in turn enhances the Hall conductivity.

title: Studies of dynamical localization in a finite-dimensional model of the quantum kicked rotator

abstract: We review our recent works on the dynamical localization in the quantum kicked rotator (QKR) and the related properties of the classical kicked rotator (the standard map, SM). We introduce the Izrailev $N$-dimensional model of the QKR and analyze the localization properties of the Floquet eigenstates [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 87}, 062905 (2013)], and the statistical properties of the quasienergy spectra. We survey normal and anomalous diffusion in the SM, and the related accelerator modes [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 89}, 022905 (2014)]. We analyze the statistical properties [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 91},042904 (2015)] of the localization measure, and show that the reciprocal localization length has an almost Gaussian distribution which has a finite variance even in the limit of the infinitely dimensional model of the QKR, $N\rightarrow \infty$. This sheds new light on the relation between the QKR and the Anderson localization phenomenon in the one-dimensional tight-binding model. It explains the so far mysterious strong fluctuations in the scaling properties of the QKR. The reason is that the finite bandwidth approximation of the underlying Hamilton dynamical system in the Shepelyansky picture [{\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 56}, 677 (1986)] does not apply rigorously. These results call for a more refined theory of the localization length in the QKR and in similar Floquet systems, where we must predict not only the mean value of the inverse of the localization length but also its (Gaussian) distribution. We also numerically analyze the related behavior of finite time Lyapunov exponents in the SM and of the $2\times2$ transfer matrix formalism.

abstract: Constructing a universal operation scheme for Majorana qubits remains a central issue for the topological quantum computation. We study the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference in a Majorana qubit and show that this interference can be used to achieve controllable operations. The Majorana qubit consists of an rf SQUID with a topological nanowire Josephson junction which hosts Majorana bound states. In the SQUID, a magnetic flux pulse can drive the quantum evolution of the Majorana qubit. The qubit experiences two Landau-Zener transitions when the amplitude of the pulse is tuned around the superconducting flux quanta $2e/\hbar$. The Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference between the two transitions rotates the Majorana qubit, with the angle controlled by the time scale of the pulse. This rotation operation implements a high-speed single-qubit gate on the Majorana qubit, which is a necessary ingredient for the topological quantum computation.

abstract: For the first time, we have observed the annihilation of multiple eigenstates of the parent potential and redistribution of the energy in the deformed potential while preserving the SUSY of the system. This first experimental observation enables the localization of eigenspectra in lateral space (so-called time) and the localization of eigenstates in longitudinal space in the deformed potentials by experimentally applying the SUSY higher-order transformations on tilted and disordered parent potentials, respectively. The former shows a decrease in the slope of the profile of eigenspectrum (bands) due to the localization in lateral space, while the latter shows an increase in the slope due to localization in longitudinal space. This allows the formation of deterministic bandgaps and Bloch waves while retaining the SUSY. In this configuration, the phase transition emerges naturally in the SUSY deformed potentials, which are revealed as the quantum Zeno effect and a peculiar Anderson localization, respectively. The Anderson localization shows the features of effective amplification and quantum Anti-Zeno effect. The experimental results are in full agreement with the theory of SUSY deformed potentials of higher-order transformations. Besides enhancing the understanding of nature, our results can also provide an experimental platform to originate new classes of effective and synthetic materials, and are also significantly important for unifying the interaction dynamics of condensed matter and photonic systems, and the implementation of universal quantum computation.

abstract: Bell's theorem sets a boundary between the classical and quantum realms, by providing a strict proof of the existence of entangled quantum states with no classical counterpart. An experimental violation of Bell's inequality demands simultaneously high fidelities in the preparation, manipulation and measurement of multipartite quantum entangled states. For this reason the Bell signal has been tagged as a single-number benchmark for the performance of quantum computing devices. Here we demonstrate deterministic, on-demand generation of two-qubit entangled states of the electron and the nuclear spin of a single phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. By sequentially reading the electron and the nucleus, we show that these entangled states violate the Bell/CHSH inequality with a Bell signal of 2.50(10). An even higher value of 2.70(9) is obtained by mapping the parity of the two-qubit state onto the nuclear spin, which allows for high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurement (QND) of the parity. Furthermore, we complement the Bell inequality entanglement witness with full two-qubit state tomography exploiting QND measurement, which reveals that our prepared states match the target maximally entangled Bell states with $>$96\% fidelity. These experiments demonstrate complete control of the two-qubit Hilbert space of a phosphorus atom, and show that this system is able to maintain its simultaneously high initialization, manipulation and measurement fidelities past the single-qubit regime.

abstract: We demonstrate an efficient high-precision optical spectroscopy technique for single trapped ions with non-closed transitions. In a double-shelving technique, the absorption of a single photon is first amplified to several phonons of a normal motional mode shared with a co-trapped cooling ion of a different species, before being further amplified to thousands of fluorescence photons emitted by the cooling ion using the standard electron shelving technique. We employ this extension of the photon recoil spectroscopy technique to perform the first high precision absolute frequency measurement of the $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{2}$P$_{1/2}$ transition in $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$, resulting in a transition frequency of $f=346\, 000\, 234\, 867(96)$ kHz. Furthermore, we determine the isotope shift of this transition and the $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{2}$P$_{1/2}$ transition for $^{42}$Ca$^{+}$, $^{44}$Ca$^{+}$ and $^{48}$Ca$^{+}$ ions relative to $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ with an accuracy below 100 kHz. Improved field and mass shift constants of these transitions as well as changes in mean square nuclear charge radii are extracted from this high resolution data.

abstract: Classical physics fails where quantum physics prevails. This common understanding applies to quantum phenomena that are acknowledged to be beyond the reach of classical physics. Here, we make an attempt at weakening this solid belief that classical physics is unfit to explain the quantum world. The trial run is the quantization of the free radiation field that will be addressed by following a strategy that is free from operators or quantum-mechanical concepts

abstract: We construct minimax optimal non-asymptotic confidence sets for low rank matrix recovery algorithms such as the Matrix Lasso or Dantzig selector. These are employed to devise adaptive sequential sampling procedures that guarantee recovery of the true matrix in Frobenius norm after a data-driven stopping time $\hat n$ for the number of measurements that have to be taken. With high probability, this stopping time is minimax optimal. We detail applications to quantum tomography problems where measurements arise from Pauli observables. We also give a theoretical construction of a confidence set for the density matrix of a quantum state that has optimal diameter in nuclear norm. The non-asymptotic properties of our confidence sets are further investigated in a simulation study.
