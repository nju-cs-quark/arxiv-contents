**1.    Continuous time quantum walks performing quantum gates via higher energy states**

<blockquote>
<p>
It has recently been noticed that quantum gates can be performed faster and can utilize interaction between qubits more effectively if performed via continuous time quantum walks through states outside of the computational basis. We formulate general requirements for such walks and illustrate them with examples of single-, two- and three-qubit gates, including Hadamard, Control-NOT, and Toffoli gates. Continuous-time quantum walks on graphs involved in these gates are investigated.

**2.    Hamiltonian quantum computer in one dimension**

<p>
Quantum computation can be achieved by preparing an appropriate initial product state of qudits and then letting it evolve under a fixed Hamiltonian. The readout is made by measurement on individual qudits at some later time. This approach is called the Hamiltonian quantum computation and it includes, for example, the continuous-time quantum cellular automata and the universal quantum walk. We consider one spatial dimension and study the compromise between the locality $k$ and the local Hilbert space dimension $d$. For geometrically 2-local (i.e., $k=2$), it is known that $d=8$ is already sufficient for universal quantum computation but the Hamiltonian is not translationally invariant. As the locality $k$ increases, it is expected that the minimum required $d$ should decrease. We provide a construction of Hamiltonian quantum computer for $k=3$ with $d=5$. One implication is that simulating 1D chains of spin-2 particles is BQP-complete. Imposing translation invariance will increase the required $d$. For this we also construct another 3-local ($k=3$) Hamiltonian that is invariant under translation of a unit cell of two sites but that requires $d$ to be 8.
