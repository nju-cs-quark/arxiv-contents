abstract: Technological realities limit terrestrial quantum key distribution (QKD) to single-link distances of a few hundred kilometers. One promising avenue for global-scale quantum communication networks is to use low-Earth-orbit satellites. Here we report the first demonstration of QKD from a stationary transmitter to a receiver platform traveling at an angular speed equivalent to a 600 km altitude satellite, located on a moving truck. We overcome the challenges of actively correcting beam pointing, photon polarization and time-of-flight. Our system generates an asymptotic secure key at 40 bits/s.

abstract: We provide analytical expressions for classical and total trace-norm (Schatten 1-norm) geometric correlations in the case of two-qubit X states. As an application, we consider the open-system dynamical behavior of such correlations under phase and generalized amplitude damping evolutions. Then, we show that geometric classical correlations can characterize the emergence of the pointer basis of an apparatus subject to decoherence in either Markovian or non-Markovian regimes. In particular, as a non-Markovian effect, we obtain a time delay for the information to be retrieved from the apparatus by a classical observer. Moreover, we show that the set of initial X states exhibiting sudden transitions in the geometric classical correlation has nonzero measure.

abstract: This paper questions the generally accepted assumption that one can make a random choice that is independent of the rest of the universe. We give a general description of any setup that could be conceived to generate random numbers. Based on the fact that the initial state of such setup together with its environment cannot be known, we show that the independence of its generated output cannot be guaranteed. Some consequences of this theoretical limitation are discussed.

abstract: Entanglement between a single photon and a quantum memory forms the building blocks for quantum repeater and quantum network. Previous entanglement sources are typically with low retrieval efficiency, which limits future larger-scale applications. Here, we report a source of highly retrievable spinwave-photon entanglement. Polarization entanglement is created through interaction of a single photon with ensemble of atoms inside a low-finesse ring cavity. The cavity is engineered to be resonant for dual spinwave modes, which thus enables efficient retrieval of the spinwave qubit. An intrinsic retrieval efficiency up to 76(4)% has been observed. Such a highly retrievable atom-photon entanglement source will be very useful in future larger-scale quantum repeater and quantum network applications.

abstract: We provide upper bound on the maximal rate at which irreversible quantum dynamics can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. The generator of irreversible dynamics consists of a Hamiltonian and dissipative terms in Lindblad form. The relative entropy of entanglement is chosen as a measure of entanglement in an ancilla-free system. We provide an upper bound on the entangling rate which has a logarithmic dependence on a dimension of a smaller system in a bipartite cut. We also investigate the rate of change of quantum mutual information in an ancilla-assisted system and provide an upper bound independent of dimension of ancillas.

abstract: The set of Entanglement Saving (ES) quantum channels is introduced and characterized. These are completely positive, trace preserving transformations which when acting locally on a bipartite quantum system initially prepared into a maximally entangled configuration, preserve its entanglement even when applied an arbitrary number of times. In other words, a quantum channel $\psi$ is said to be ES if its powers $\psi^n$ are not entanglement-breaking for all integers $n$. We also characterize the properties of the Asymptotic Entanglement Saving (AES) maps. These form a proper subset of the ES channels that is constituted by those maps which, not only preserve entanglement for all finite $n$, but which also sustain an explicitly not null level of entanglement in the asymptotic limit~$n\rightarrow \infty$. Structure theorems are provided for ES and for AES maps which yield an almost complete characterization of the former and a full characterization of the latter.

abstract: In generalized resource theories, one aims to reformulate the problem of deciding whether a suitable transition (typically a transition that preserves the Gibbs state of the theory) between two given states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ exists or not, into the problem of checking whether a set of second-law--like inequalities hold or not. The aim of these preliminary notes is to show how the theory of statistical comparisons (in the sense of Blackwell, LeCam, and Torgersen) can be useful in such scenarios. In particular, we propose one construction, in which the second laws are formulated in terms of a suitable conditional min-entropy. Though a general, fully quantum result is also presented, stronger results are obtained for the case of qubits, and the case of $\sigma$ commuting with the Gibbs state.

abstract: We demonstrate that a tensor product structure and classical entanglement can be obtained by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical fields with two orthogonal modes. Using the classical entanglement, we discuss efficient simulation of several typical quantum states, including product state, Bell states, GHZ state, and W state. By performing quadrature demodulation scheme, we propose a sequence permutation mechanism to simulate certain quantum states and a generalized gate array model to simulate quantum algorithm, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The research on classical simulation of quantum states is important, for it not only enables potential beyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Randomized Benchmarking allows to efficiently and scalably characterize the average error of an unitary 2-design such as the Clifford group $\mathcal{C}$ on a physical candidate for quantum computation, as long as there are no non-computational leakage levels in the system. We investigate the effect of leakage errors on Randomized Benchmarking induced from an additional level per physical qubit and provide a modified protocol that allows to derive reliable estimates for the error per gate in their presence. We assess the variance of the sequence fidelity corresponding to the number of random sequences needed for valid fidelity estimation. Our protocol allows for gate dependent error channels without being restricted to perturbations. We show that our protocol is compatible with Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking and expand to benchmarking of arbitrary gates. This setting is relevant for superconducting transmon qubits, among other systems.

abstract: We demonstrate significant improvements of the spin coherence time of a dense ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond through optimized dynamical decoupling (DD). Cooling the sample down to $77$ K suppresses longitudinal spin relaxation $T_1$ effects and DD microwave pulses are used to increase the transverse coherence time $T_2$ from $\sim 0.7$ ms up to $\sim 30$ ms. We extend previous work of single-axis (CPMG) DD towards the preservation of arbitrary spin states. Following a theoretical and experimental characterization of pulse and detuning errors, we compare the performance of various DD protocols. We identify that the optimal control scheme for preserving an arbitrary spin state is a recursive protocol, the concatenated version of the XY8 pulse sequence. The improved spin coherence might have an immediate impact on improvements of the sensitivities of AC magnetometry. Moreover, the protocol can be used on denser diamond samples to increase coherence times up to NV-NV interaction time scales, a major step towards the creation of quantum collective NV spin states.

abstract: Modern cryptography is largely based on complexity assumptions, for example, the ubiquitous RSA is based on the supposed complexity of the prime factorization problem. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand how a quantum computer would eventually weaken these algorithms. In this paper, one follows Feynman's prescription for a computer to simulate the physics corresponding to the algorithm of factoring a large number $N$ into primes. Using Dirac-Jordan transformation theory one translates factorization into the language of quantum hermitical operators, acting on the vectors of the Hilbert space. This leads to obtaining the ensemble of factorization of $N$ in terms of the Euler function $\varphi(N)$, that is quantized. On the other hand, considering $N$ as a parameter of the computer, a Quantum Mechanical Prime Counting Function $\pi_{QM}(x)$, where $x$ factorizes $N$, is derived. This function converges to $\pi(x)$ when $N\gg x$. It has no counterpart in analytic number theory and its derivation relies on semiclassical quantization alone.

abstract: We present a new approach to incorporate self-assembled quantum dots into a Fabry-P\'{e}rot-like microcavity. Thereby a 3$\lambda$/4 GaAs layer containing quantum dots is epitaxially removed and attached by van der Waals bonding to one of the microcavity mirrors. We reach a finesse as high as 4,100 with this configuration limited by the reflectivity of the dielectric mirrors and not by scattering at the semiconductor - mirror interface, demonstrating that the epitaxial lift-off procedure is a promising procedure for cavity quantum electrodynamics in the solid state. As a first step in this direction, we demonstrate a clear cavity-quantum dot interaction in the weak coupling regime with a Purcell factor in the order of 3. Estimations of the coupling strength via the Purcell factor suggests that we are close to the strong coupling regime.

abstract: This is the second in a pair of articles that classify the configuration space and kinematic symmetry groups for $N$ identical particles in one-dimensional traps experiencing Galilean-invariant two-body interactions. These symmetries explain degeneracies in the few-body spectrum and demonstrate how tuning the trap shape and the particle interactions can manipulate these degeneracies. The additional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting limit and in the unitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are sufficient to algebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of the one-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the algebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or nearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\ independent of trap shape and details of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin are considered. This article analyzes the symmetries of $N$ particles in asymmetric, symmetric, and harmonic traps; the prequel article treats the one, two and three particle cases.

abstract: Characterization of qubit couplings in many-body quantum systems is essential for benchmarking quantum computation and simulation. We propose a tomographic measurement scheme to determine all the coupling terms in a general many-body Hamiltonian with arbitrary long-range interaction. Different from quantum process tomography, our scheme is fully scalable with the number of qubits as the required rounds of measurements increase only linearly with the number of coupling terms in the Hamiltonian. The scheme makes use of synchronized dynamical decoupling pulses to simplify the many-body dynamics so that the unknown parameters in the Hamiltonian can be retrieved one by one. We simulate the performance of the scheme under the influence of various pulse errors and show that it is robust to typical noise and experimental imperfections.

This method will be applied for a semi-infinite structure, which contains metal and dielectric regions with one interface. Moreover, by introducing the quantized SPP, we will investigate the SPP propagation in the attenuating and amplifying systems. We will also consider two modes of SPP, i.e., coherent and squeezed states, and finally compare the propagation of these modes in the amplifying media.

abstract: The detection and characterization of a non-classical-squeezed state of light, by using two different schemes, will be presented . In the first one, in an one-dimensional cavity with moving mirror (non-stationary Casimir effect) in the principal mode, we study the photon creation rate for two modes (squeezed and coherent state) of driving field. Since the cavity with moving mirror (similar to an optomechanical system) can be considered analogue to a Kerr-like medium, so that in the second scheme, the probability amplitude for multi-photons absorption in a nonlinear (Kerr) medium will be quantum mechanically calculated. It is shown that because of presence of nonlinear effects, the responses of these two systems to the squeezed versus coherent state are considerably distinguishable. The drastic difference between the results of these two states of light can be viewed as a proposal for detecting of non-classical states.

abstract: The outstanding progress in nanostructure fabrication and cooling technologies allows what was unthinkable a few decades ago: bringing single-mode mechanical vibrations to the quantum regime. The coupling between photon and phonon excitations is a natural source of nonclassical states of light and mechanical vibrations, and its study within the field of cavity optomechanics is developing lightning-fast. Photonic crystal cavities are highly integrable architectures that have demonstrated the strongest optomechanical coupling to date, and should therefore play a central role for such hybrid quantum state engineering. In this context, we propose a realistic heralding protocol for the on-chip preparation of remotely entangled mechanical states, relying on the state-of-the-art optomechanical parameters of a silicon-based nanobeam structure. Pulsed sideband excitation of a Stokes process, combined with single photon detection, allows writing a delocalised mechanical Bell state in the system, signatures of which can then be read out in the optical field. A measure of entanglement in this protocol is provided by the visibility of a characteristic quantum interference pattern in the emitted light.

We show that current setups can reproduce, in particular, the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes of such a paradigmatic light-matter interaction. Furthermore, associated with these extreme dipolar regimes, we study the controlled generation and detection of their entangled ground states by means of adiabatic methods. Ion traps have arguably performed the first quantum simulation of the Jaynes-Cummings model, a restricted regime of the quantum Rabi model where the rotating-wave approximation holds. We show that one can go beyond and experimentally investigate the quantum simulation of coupling regimes of the quantum Rabi model that are difficult to achieve with natural dipolar interactions.

As a benchmark case, we have studied the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate in the Schwinger model, using matrix product operators to approximate the thermal equilibrium states for finite system sizes with non-zero lattice spacings. We show how these techniques allow for reliable extrapolations in bond dimension, step width, system size and lattice spacing, and for a systematic estimation and control of all error sources involved in the calculation. The reached values of the lattice spacing are small enough to capture the most challenging region of high temperatures and the final results are consistent with the analytical prediction by Sachs and Wipf over a broad temperature range.

We formulate the problem in the density matrix theory, which enables one to gain new insights into scattering processes of twisted particles by exploiting the symmetries of the system. In particular, we analyze how the angular distribution and polarization of the scattered photons are affected by the parameters of the initial beam such as the opening angle and the projection of orbital angular momentum. We present analytical and numerical results for the angular distribution and the polarization of Compton scattered photons for initially twisted light and compare them with the standard case of plane-wave light.

abstract: Superfluidity and superconductivity have been studied widely since the last century in many different contexts ranging from nuclear matter to atomic quantum gases. The rigidity of these systems with respect to external perturbations results in frictionless motion for superfluids and resistance-free electric current in superconductors. This peculiar behaviour is lost when external perturbations overcome a critical threshold, i.e. above a critical magnetic field or a critical current for superconductors. In superfluids, such as liquid helium or ultracold gases, the corresponding quantities are critical rotation rate and critical velocity, respectively. Enhancing the critical values is of great fundamental and practical value. Here we demonstrate that superfluidity can be achieved for flow above the critical velocity through quantum interference induced resonances. This has far reaching consequences for the fundamental understanding of superfluidity and superconductivity and opens up new application possibilities in quantum metrology, e.g. in rotation sensing.

The robustness of this number extends well beyond the topological insulator phase towards attractive and repulsive interactions that are comparable to the kinetic energy scale of the model. We identify and characterize the relevant phases of the model.

Starting from weakly bound Feshbach molecules, we demonstrate hyperfine resolved two-photon transfer into the singlet ${\rm X}^1\Sigma^+ |v{=}0,J{=}0\rangle$ ground state, coherently bridging a binding energy difference of 0.65 eV via stimulated rapid adiabatic passage. The spin-polarized, nearly quantum degenerate molecular gas displays a lifetime longer than 2.5 s, highlighting NaK's stability against two-body chemical reactions. A homogeneous electric field is applied to induce a dipole moment of up to 0.8 Debye. With these advances, the exploration of many-body physics with strongly dipolar Fermi gases of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules is in experimental reach.

abstract: We discuss the treatment of the systematic frequency shifts due to microwave lensing and distributed cavity phase in "First accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2" 2014 Metrologia 51 174-182. We explain that the microwave lensing frequency shift is generally non-zero and finite in the limit of no applied microwave field. This systematic error was incorrectly treated and we find that it contributes a significant frequency offset. Accounting for this shift implies that the measured microwave amplitude dependence (e.g due to microwave leakage) is comparable to the total reported inaccuracy. We also discuss the importance of vertically aligning the fountain perpendicular to the axis of the cavity feeds, when the cavity has only two independent feeds. Finally, we note that background gas collisions have a different behavior for cold clock atoms than for clock atoms at room-temperature, and therefore room temperature measurements do not directly apply to laser-cooled clocks.

abstract: Recently, the quaternionic quantum walk was formulated by the first author as a generalization of discrete-time quantum walks. We treat the right eigenvalue problem of quaternionic matrices to analysis the spectra of its transition matrix. The way to obtain all the right eigenvalues of a quaternionic matrix is given. From the unitary condition on the transition matrix of the quaternionic quantum walk, we deduce some properties about it. Our main results, Theorem 5.3, determine all the right eigenvalues of a quaternionic quantum walk by use of those of the corresponding weighted matrix. In addition, we give some examples of quaternionic quantum walks and their right eigenvalues.

abstract: We discuss the theoretical treatment of the microwave lensing frequency shift of the NIST-F1 and F2 atomic fountain clocks by Ashby et al. [Phy. Rev. A. 91, 033624 (2015)]. The shifts calculated by NIST are much smaller than the previously evaluated microwave lensing frequency shifts of other clocks contributing to International Atomic Time. We identify several fundamental problems in the NIST treatment and demonstrate that each significantly affects their results. We also show a smooth transition of microwave lensing frequency shifts to the photon recoil shift for large wave packets.

title: Local zeta regularization and the scalar Casimir effect I. A general approach based on integral kernels

abstract: This is the first one of a series of papers about zeta regularization of the divergences appearing in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of several local and global observables in quantum field theory. More precisely we consider a quantized, neutral scalar field on a domain in any spatial dimension, with arbitrary boundary conditions and, possibly, in presence of an external classical potential. We analyze, in particular, the VEV of the stress-energy tensor, the corresponding boundary forces and the total energy, thus taking into account both local and global aspects of the Casimir effect. In comparison with the wide existing literature on these subjects, we try to develop a more systematic approach, allowing to treat specific configurations by mere application of a general machinery. The present Part I is mainly devoted to setting up this general framework; at the end of the paper, this is exemplified in a very simple case. In Parts II, III and IV we will consider more engaging applications, indicated in the Introduction of the present work.

abstract: We demonstrate stable, long-term trapping of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical lattice with MHz trap frequencies for use in a quantum gas microscope. Adiabatic release from the optical lattice in the object plane of a high-numerical-aperture imaging system allows a measurement of the population distribution among the lowest three bands in both radial directions with atom numbers as low as $7\times 10^2$. We measure exponential ground band heating rates as low as 0.014(1) s$^{-1}$ corresponding to a radial ground state $1/e$ lifetime of 71(5) s, fundamentally limited by scattering of lattice photons. For all lattice depths above 2 recoil, we find radial ground state lifetimes $\ge 1.6 \times 10^6$ recoil times.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00772
abstract: We study the problem of computing energy density in one-dimensional quantum systems. We show that the ground-state energy per site or per bond can be computed in time (i) independent of the system size and subexponential in the desired precision if the ground state satisfies area laws for the Renyi entanglement entropy (this is the first rigorous formulation of the folklore that area laws imply efficient matrix-product-state algorithms); (ii) independent of the system size and polynomial in the desired precision if the system is gapped. As a by-product, we prove that in the presence of area laws (or even an energy gap) the ground state can be approximated by a positive semidefinite matrix product operator of bond dimension independent of the system size and subpolynomial in the desired precision of local properties.
