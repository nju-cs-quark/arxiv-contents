**1.    Macroscopic and Microscopic Thermal Equilibrium**  
Sheldon Goldstein, David A. Huse, Joel L. Lebowitz, Roderich Tumulka

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the nature of and approach to thermal equilibrium in isolated quantum systems. An individual isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure or mixed state is regarded as being in thermal equilibrium if all macroscopic observables assume rather sharply the values obtained from thermodynamics. Of such a system (or state) we say that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE). A stronger requirement than MATE is that even microscopic observables (i.e., ones referring to a small subsystem) have a probability distribution in agreement with that obtained from the micro-canonical, or equivalently the canonical, ensemble for the whole system. Of such a system we say that it is in microscopic thermal equilibrium (MITE). The distinction between MITE and MATE is particularly relevant for systems with many-body localization (MBL) for which the energy eigenfuctions fail to be in MITE while necessarily most of them, but not all, are in MATE. However, if we consider superpositions of energy eigenfunctions (i.e., typical wave functions $\psi$) in an energy shell, then for generic macroscopic systems, including those with MBL, most $\psi$ are in both MATE and MITE. We explore here the properties of MATE and MITE and compare the two notions, thereby elaborating on ideas introduced in [Goldstein et al., Phys.Rev.Lett. 115: 100402 (2015)].

**2.    New theory of diffusive and coherent nature of optical wave via a quantum walk**  
Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno, Shigeki Matsutani, Hideo Mitsuhashi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.02393  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new theory on a relation between diffusive and coherent nature in one dimensional wave mechanics based on a quantum walk. It is known that the quantum walk in homogeneous matrices provides the coherent property of wave mechanics. Using the recent result of a localization phenomenon in a one-dimensional quantum walk (Konno, Quantum Inf. Proc. (2010) 9, 405-418), we numerically show that the randomized localized matrices suppress the coherence and give diffusive nature.
