**1.    Fast-forwarding of Hamiltonians and Exponentially Precise Measurements**  
Yosi Atia, Dorit Aharonov

<blockquote>
<p>
In the early days of quantum mechanics, it was believed that the time energy uncertainty principle (TEUP) bounds the efficiency of energy measurements, relating the duration ($\Delta t$) of the measurement, and its accuracy error ($\Delta E$) by $\Delta t\Delta E \ge$ 1/2. In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a counterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under certain conditions the principle holds. Can we classify when and to what extent the TEUP is violated? Our main theorem asserts that such violations are in one to one correspondence with the ability to "fast forward" the associated Hamiltonian, namely, to simulate its evolution for time $t$ using much less than $t$ quantum gates. This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms. Our theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the computational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration ($\Delta t$) is replaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement, and we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the totality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement. The inspiration for this result is a family of Hamiltonians we construct, based on Shor's algorithm, which exponentially violate the cTEUP (and the TEUP), thus allowing exponential fast forwarding. We further show that commuting local Hamiltonians and quadratic Hamiltonians of fermions (e.g., Anderson localization model), can be fast forwarded. The work raises the question of finding a physical criterion for fast forwarding, in particular, can many body localization systems be fast forwarded? We rule out a general fast-forwarding method for all physically realizable Hamiltonians (unless BQP=PSPACE). Connections to quantum metrology and to Susskind's complexification of a wormhole's length are discussed.

**2.    Quantum hyperentanglement and its applications in quantum information processing**  
Fu-Guo Deng, Bao-Cang Ren, Xi-Han Li

<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing with its high capacity character, defined as the entanglement in multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, such as polarization, spatial-mode, orbit-angular-momentum, time-bin and frequency DOFs of photons. Recently, hyperentanglement attracted much attention as all the multiple DOFs can be used to carry information in quantum information processing fully. In this review, we present an overview of the progress achieved so far in the field of hyperentanglement in photon systems and some of its important applications in quantum information processing, including hyperentanglement generation, complete hyperentangled-Bell-state analysis, hyperentanglement concentration, and hyperentanglement purification for high-capacity long-distance quantum communication. Also, a scheme for hyper-controlled-not gate is introduced for hyperparallel photonic quantum computation, which can perform two controlled-not gate operations on both the polarization and spatial-mode DOFs and depress the resources consumed and the photonic dissipation.

**3.    Symmetry-protected zero-mode laser with a tunable spatial profile**  
Li Ge  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.09717  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to utilize symmetry-protected zero modes of a photonic lattice to realize a single-mode, fixed-frequency, and spatially tunable laser. These properties are the consequence of the underlying non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, with which the energy spectrum satisfies $\varepsilon_m=-\varepsilon_n^*$. Unlike in the Hermitian case, the symmetric phase of particle-hole symmetry is no longer restricted to $\varepsilon=0$ but extends along the imaginary-$\varepsilon$ axis, which is set by the single-cavity frequency and symmetry-protected against position and coupling disorder of the photonic lattice. By selectively pumping different cavities in the photonic lattice, we control the spontaneous symmetry restoration process, which provides a convenient method to tune the spatial profile of the laser without changing its frequency.
