**1.    From non-ergodic eigenvectors to local resolvent statistics and back: a random matrix perspective**

We study the statistics of the local resolvent and non-ergodic properties of eigenvectors for a generalised Rosenzweig-Porter $N\times N$ random matrix model, undergoing two transitions separated by a delocalised non-ergodic phase. Interpreting the model as the combination of on-site random energies $\{a_i\}$ and a structurally disordered hopping, we found that each eigenstate is delocalised over $N^{2-\gamma}$ sites close in energy $|a_j-a_i|\leq N^{1-\gamma}$ in agreement with Kravtsov et al, arXiv:1508.01714. Our other main result, obtained combining a recurrence relation for the resolvent matrix with insights from Dyson's Brownian motion, is to show that the properties on the non-ergodic delocalised phase can be probed studying the statistics of the local resolvent in a non-standard scaling limit.

Several platforms are currently being explored for simulating physical systems whose complexity increases faster than polynomially with the number of particles or degrees of freedom in the system. Defects and vacancies in semiconductors or dielectric materials, magnetic impurities embedded in solid helium \cite{lemeshko13}, atoms in optical lattices, photons, trapped ions and superconducting q-bits are among the candidates for predicting the behaviour of spin glasses, spin-liquids, and classical magnetism among other phenomena with practical technological applications. Here we investigate the potential of polariton graphs as an efficient simulator for finding the global minimum of the $XY$ Hamiltonian. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke geometries we show that we can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing the U(1) symmetry breaking transitions. We realise various magnetic phases, such as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations on unit cells of various lattices: square, triangular, linear and a disordered graph. Our results provide a route to study unconventional superfluids, spin-liquids, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, classical magnetism among the many systems that are described by the $XY$ Hamiltonian.
