abstract: Neutrino oscillation is a well-known phenomenon observed in high energy physics. Here starting from a one-spatial dimensional discrete-time quantum walk we present a method to simulate neutrino oscillation. We present the set of walk parameters with which we can obtain the same oscillation probability profile obtained in both, long range and short range neutrino experiment. Our scheme to simulate three-generation neutrino oscillation from quantum walk evolution operators can be physically realized in any low energy experimental setup with access to control a single six-level system, a multiparticle three-qubits or a qubit-qutrit system.
