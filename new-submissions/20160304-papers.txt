abstract: The concept of quantum correlation matrix for observables leads to the application of the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) also for quantum system in Hilbert space. It is shown that, in the case of a 2x2 spin system where the observables are the Pauli matrices and a polarization vector is acting on the density matrix, meaningful results can be obtained by the PCA in terms of qubit properties. In particular, it is shown that by choosing, for example, the (x,z) spinors, the axes of the principal components (PC) coincide with the circular polarization basis on the Block Sphere.

abstract: The quantum PCP (QPCP) conjecture states that all problems in QMA, the quantum analogue of NP, admit quantum verifiers that only act on a constant number of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open. The above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in the language of multi-prover games is known. In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer QPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a pointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define the Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum verifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical part of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from the quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian problem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP games. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer QPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap is QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of CRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the first equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of quantum multi-prover games.

abstract: Multi-photon entangled states such as `N00N states' have attracted a lot of attention because of their possible application in high-precision phase measurements. So far, N00N states have been generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and by mixing quantum and classical light on a beam splitter. However, single-photon on demand sources promise to be more efficient and scalable than down-conversion sources which are probabilistic in nature. Here, we demonstrate super-resolving phase measurements based on two-photon N00N states generated by a quantum dot single-photon source utilizing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect on a beam splitter. The quantum dot was excited through a two-photon resonant excitation scheme. Using a $\pi$-pulse, this results in the deterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons from both, the biexciton and exciton radiative recombination processes. Launching either type of the photons into both inputs of an interferometer, phase super-resolution, i.e. an interference fringe spacing with doubled rate relative to the single photon rate has been observed for both transitions. Interference visibilities of $V_{N=2,\mathit{XX}}=0.54\pm0.01$ for the biexciton and $V_{N=2,\mathit{X}}=0.46\pm0.02$ for the exciton transition have been obtained, respectively.

abstract: We study a relativistic quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a uniform magnetic field and a Coulomb-type scalar potential. It is shown that the radial part of this problem possesses the $su(1,1)$ symmetry. We obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of this problem by using two algebraic methods: the Schr\"odinger factorization and the tilting transformation. Finally, we give the explicit form of the relativistic coherent states for this problem.

abstract: We analyze different families of discrete maps\ in the N-qubit systems in the context of the permutation invariance. We prove that the tomographic condition imposed on the self-dual (Wigner) map is incompatible with the requirement of the invariance under particle permutations, which makes it impossible to project the Wootters-like Wigner function into the space of symmetric measurements. We also provide several \textit{explicit} forms of the self-dual mappings: a) tomographic and b) permutation invariant \ and analyze the symmetric projection in the latter case.

abstract: Cooperative light-matter interactions play an important role in the aspects of correlated spontaneous emissions, quantum entanglement, and preparation of exotic quantum states. Superradiance and associated cooperative Lamb shift (CLS) are examples that demonstrate the collectivity in exchanging photons within an atomic ensemble. Other than that, subradiance is complementary to the collective effects, which spontaneously emits light in a rate lower than the natural one. Single-photon superradiance and subradiance are of great interests in that Hilbert space is restricted to only N of them, thus simplify the dynamical couplings with each other. Here we propose a set of subradiant states that can be prepared and detected in the one-dimensional optical lattices. We find that the decay rates are highly dependent on the spatial phases we manipulate to imprint on the atomic system, which gives unprecedented and systematic investigations of the subradiance. Our results also provide a novel scheme for quantum storage of photons in two-level atoms using the subradiant states, and offer opportunities for quantum information processing in optical lattices.

abstract: Recently, Maccone and Pati have given two stronger uncertainty relations based on the sum of variances and one of them is nontrivial when the quantum state is not an eigenstate of the sum of the observables. We derive a family of weighted uncertainty relations to provide an optimal lower bound for all situations and remove the restriction on the quantum state. Generalization to multi-observable cases is also given and an optimal lower bound for the weighted sum of the variances is obtained in general quantum situation.

abstract: We present several criteria for genuine multipartite entanglement from universal uncertainty relations based on majorization theory. Under non-negative Schur-concave functions, the vector-type uncertainty relation generates a family of infinitely many detectors to check genuine multipartite entanglement. We also introduce the concept of $k$-separable circles via geometric distance for probability vectors, which include at most $(k-1)$-separable states. The entanglement witness is also generalized to a universal entanglement witness which is suitable to detect the $k$-separable states more accurately.

abstract: Photonic lattices provide an excellent platform for simulating conventional topological systems, and they can also be explored for the study of novel topological phases. However, a direct measurement of bulk topological invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study topological features of generalized commensurate Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) photonic lattices and construct a topological phase diagram by calculating all bulk Chern numbers, and then explore the bulk-edge correspondence by analyzing the topological edge states and their winding numbers. In contrast to incommensurate AAH models, we find that diagonal and off-diagonal commensurate AAH models are not topologically equivalent. In particular, nontrivial topological phases with large Chern numbers and topological phase transitions are possible. By implementing Thouless pumping of light in photonic lattices, we propose a simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers.

abstract: Based on the formula of shortcuts to adiabaticity, we solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in various nonlinear quantum systems. For a given time-dependent adiabatic Hamiltonian, the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is obtained by solving the equation for the dynamical invariant. We show that the equation is equivalent to the Lax equation in nonlinear integrable systems. This identification allows us to obtain the counterdiabatic term exactly. Multi-soliton potentials obtained from the Korteweg-de Vries equation and a XY spin chain with the use of the Toda equations are studied in detail. The present method also offers a way to obtain isospectral Hamiltonians.

abstract: The design, fabrication, and detailed calibration of essential building blocks towards fully integrated linear-optics quantum computation are discussed. Photonic devices are made from silicon nitride rib waveguides, where measurements on ring resonators show small propagation losses. Directional couplers are designed to be insensitive to fabrication variations. Their offset and coupling lengths are measured, as well as the phase difference between the transmitted and reflected light. With careful calibrations, the insertion loss of the directional couplers is found to be small. Finally, an integrated controlled-NOT circuit is characterized by measuring the transmission through different combinations of inputs and outputs. The gate fidelity for the CNOT operation with this circuit is estimated to be 99.81% after post selection. This high fidelity is due to our robust design, good fabrication reproducibility, and extensive characterizations.

abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition is considered from the point of view of contractions of associative algebras. Various methods and ideas to deal with contractions of associative algebras are discussed that account for a large family of examples. As an instance of them, the commutative algebra of functions in phase space, corresponding to classical physical observables, is obtained as a contraction of the Moyal star-product which characterizes the quantum case. Contractions of associative algebras associated to Lie algebras are discussed, in particular the Weyl-Heisenberg and $SU(2)$ groups are considered.

abstract: We show how the use of entanglement can enhance the precision of the detection of the Unruh effect with an accelerated probe. We use the Unruh-DeWitt model of a two-level atom interacting relativistically with a quantum field and treat the atom as an open quantum system to derive the master equation governing its evolution. By means of quantum state discrimination, we detect the accelerated motion of the atom by examining its time evolving state. It turns out that the optimal strategy for the detection of the Unruh effect, to which the accelerated atom is sensitive, involves letting the atom-thermometer equilibrate with the thermal bath. However, introducing initial entanglement between the detector and an external degree of freedom leads to an enhancement of the sensitivity of the detector. Also, the maximum precision is attained within finite time, before equilibration takes place.

abstract: We study the motion of a particle in a particular magnetic field configuration both classically and quantum mechanically. For flux-free radially symmetric magnetic fields defined on circular regions, we establish that particle escape speeds depend, classically, on a gauge-fixed magnetic vector potential, and demonstrate some trajectories associated with this special type of magnetic field. Then we show that some of the geometric features of the classical trajectory (perpendicular exit from the field region, trapped and escape behavior) are reproduced quantum mechanically using a numerical method that extends the norm-preserving Crank-Nicolson method to problems involving magnetic fields. While there are similarities between the classical trajectory and the position expectation value of the quantum mechanical solution, there are also differences, and we demonstrate some of these.

abstract: We demonstrate the suppression of photon shot noise dephasing in a superconducting qubit by eliminating its dispersive coupling to the readout cavity. This is achieved in a tunable coupling qubit, where the qubit frequency and coupling rate can be controlled independently. We observe that the coherence time approaches twice the relaxation time and becomes less sensitive to thermal photon noise when the dispersive coupling rate is tuned from several MHz to 22 kHz. This work provides a promising building block in circuit quantum electrodynamics that can hold high coherence and be integrated into larger systems.

abstract: In spite of decades of effort, it has not yet been possible to create single-mode multiphoton states of light with high success probability and near unity fidelity. Complex quantum states of propagating optical photons would be an enabling resource for diverse protocols in quantum information science, including for interconnecting quantum nodes in quantum networks. Here, we propose several methods to generate heralded mutipartite entangled atomic and photonic states by using the strong and long-range dissipative couplings between atoms emerging in waveguide QED setups. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates high success probabilities and fidelities are possible exploiting waveguide QED properties.

abstract: We analyse a spin precession of slow neutrons in the Einstein-Cartan gravity with torsion, chameleon and magnetic field. For the derivation of the Heisenberg equation of motion of the neutron spin we use the effective low-energy potential, derived by Ivanov and Wellenzohn (Phys. Rev. D92, 125004 (2015)) for slow neutrons, coupled to gravitational, chameleon and torsion fields to order 1/m, where m is the neutron mass. In addition to this low-energy interactions we switch on the interaction of slow neutrons with a magnetic field. We show that to linear order approximation with respect to gravitational, chameleon and torsion fields the Dirac Hamilton operator for fermions (neutrons), moving in spacetimes created by rotating coordinate systems, contains the anti-Hermitian operators of torsion-fermion (neutron) interactions, caused by torsion scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. Such anti-Hermitian operators violate CP and T invariance. One may assume that in the rotating Universe and galaxies the obtained anti-Hermitian torsion-fermion interactions might be an origin of i) violation of CP and T invariance in the Universe and ii) of baryon asymmetry.

abstract: The hydrogen atom is a system amenable to an exact treatment within Schroedinger's formulation of quantum mechanics according to coordinates in four systems -- spherical polar, paraboloidal, ellipsoidal and spheroconical coordinates; the latter solution is reported for the first time. Applications of these solutions include angular momenta, a quantitative calculation of the absorption spectrum and accurate plots of surfaces of amplitude functions. The shape of an amplitude function, and even the quantum numbers in a particular set to specify such an individual function, depend on the coordinates in a particular chosen system, and are therefore artefacts of that particular coordinate representation within wave mechanics. All discussion of atomic or molecular properties based on such shapes or quantum numbers therefore lacks general significance

abstract: We analyze the temporal response of the fluorescence light that is emitted from a dense gas of cold atoms driven by a laser. When the average interatomic distance is smaller than the wavelength of the photons scattered by the atoms, the system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective dissipation. We solve the exact dynamics of small systems with different geometries and show how these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties such as the photon emission rate, the power spectrum and the second-order correlation function. By calculating these quantities beyond the weak driving limit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective behavior in these many-body systems. Furthermore, we clarify the role of disorder on the resonance fluorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental efforts that aim at the exploration of many-body effects in dipole-dipole interacting gases of atoms.

abstract: We study, using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, the ground state properties of a one dimensional Rabi-Hubbard model. The model consists of a lattice of Rabi systems coupled by a photon hopping term between near neighbor sites. The phase diagram consists of only two phases: a coherent phase and an incoherent one. The Mott phases which are present in the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model are not observed here due to the presence of non-negligible counter-rotating terms. We find that these two models become equivalent when the detuning is negative and large enough, or if the counter-rotating terms are small enough.

Our approach relies on an electronic quantum bus, consisting either of quantum Hall edge channels or surface acoustic waves, that can mediate long-range coupling between localized spins over distances of tens of micrometers. Since the entanglement is actively stabilized by dissipative dynamics, our scheme is inherently robust against noise and imperfections.
