abstract: We study the speed of convergence of a primitive quantum time evolution towards its fixed point in the distance of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences. For each of these distance measures the convergence is typically exponentially fast and the best exponent is given by a constant (similar to a logarithmic Sobolev constant) depending only on the generator of the time evolution. We establish relations between these constants and the logarithmic Sobolev constants as well as the spectral gap. An important consequence of these relations is the derivation of mixing time bounds for time evolutions directly from logarithmic Sobolev inequalities without relying on notions like lp-regularity. We also derive strong converse bounds for the classical capacity of a quantum time evolution.

abstract: Nanomechanical systems made from phononic crystals can act as highly coherent microwave-frequency circuits at cryogenic temperatures. However, generating sufficient coupling between these devices and microwave superconducting quantum circuits is challenging due to the vastly different length scales of acoustic and electrical excitations. Here we demonstrate a general recipe for calculating these interactions and show that large piezoelectric coupling rates between microwave superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions and nanoscale phononic resonances are possible, suggesting a route to phononic crystal circuits and systems that are nonlinear at the single-phonon level.

abstract: There has been recent progress in understanding chaotic features in many-body quantum systems. Motivated by the scrambling of information in black holes, it has been suggested that the time dependence of out-of-time-ordered (OTO) correlation functions such as $\langle O_2(t) O_1(0) O_2(t) O_1(0) \rangle $ is a faithful measure of quantum chaos. Experimentally, these correlators are challenging to access since they apparently require access to both forward and backward time evolution with the system Hamiltonian. Here, we propose a protocol to measure such OTO correlators using an ancilla which controls the direction of time. Specifically, by coupling the state of ancilla to the system Hamiltonian of interest, we can emulate the forward and backward time propagation, where the ancilla plays the role of a 'quantum clock'. Within this scheme, the continuous evolution of the entire system (the system of interest and the ancilla) is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian. Our protocol is immune to errors that could occur when the direction of time evolution is externally controlled by a classical switch.

abstract: Various theories that aim at unifying gravity with quantum mechanics suggest modifications of the Heisenberg algebra for position and momentum. From the perspective of quantum mechanics, such modifications lead to new uncertainty relations which are thought (but not proven) to imply the existence of a minimal observable length. Here we prove this statement in a framework of sufficient physical and structural assumptions. Moreover, we present a general method that allows to formulate optimal and state-independent variance-based uncertainty relations. In addition, instead of variances, we make use of entropies as a measure of uncertainty and provide uncertainty relations in terms of min- and Shannon entropies. We compute the corresponding entropic minimal lengths and find that the minimal length in terms of min-entropy is exactly one bit.

abstract: Recently, two-photon six-qubit hyperentanged states were produced in experiment and they can improve the channel capacity of quantum communication largely. Here we present the first scheme for the hyperentanglement purification of nonlocal two-photon systems in three degrees of freedom (DOFs), including the polarization, the first longitudinal momentum, and the second longitudinal momentum DOFs. Our hyper-EPP is constructed with two steps resorting to parity-check quantum nondemolition measurement on the three DOFs and SWAP gates, respectively. With these two steps, the bit-flip errors in the three DOFs can be corrected efficiently. Using SWAP gates is a universal method for hyper-EPP in the polarization DOF and multiple longitudinal momentum DOFs. The implementation of our hyper-EPP is assisted by nitrogen-vacancy centers in optical microcavities, which could be achieved with current techniques. It is useful for long-distance high-capacity quantum communication with two-photon six-qubit hyperentanglement.

abstract: We present a couple of protocols based on shortcut to adiabaticity techniques for rapid generation of robust entangled Bell states in a system of two two-state systems. Our protocols rely on the so-called transitionless quantum driving (TQD) algorithm and Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant (LRI) method. Both TQD and LRI methods result in high fidelity in population transfer.Our study shows that it is possible to prepare an entangled state in infinitely short time without losing robustness and efficiency.

abstract: Quantum networking links quantum processors through remote entanglement for distributed quantum information processing (QIP) and secure long-range communication. Trapped ions are a leading QIP platform, having demonstrated universal small-scale processors and roadmaps for large-scale implementation. Overall rates of ion-photon entanglement generation, essential for remote trapped ion entanglement, are limited by coupling efficiency into single mode fibres5 and scaling to many ions. Here we show a microfabricated trap with integrated diffractive mirrors that couples 4.1(6)% of the fluorescence from a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion into a single mode fibre, nearly triple the demonstrated bulk optics efficiency. The integrated optic collects 5.8(8)% of the {\pi} transition fluorescence, images the ion with sub-wavelength resolution, and couples 71(5)% of the collected light into the fibre. Our technology is suitable for entangling multiple ions in parallel and overcomes mode quality limitations of existing integrated optical interconnects. In addition, the efficiencies are sufficient for fault tolerant QIP.

abstract: The Lamb shift (self-energy) of an elliptic dielectric microcavity is studied. We show that the size of Lamb shift, which is a small energy shift due to the system-environment coupling in quantum regime, is dependent on the geometry of boundary condition. It shows a global transition depending on the eccentricity of the ellipsis. These transitions can be classified into three types of decay channels known as whispering gallery modes, stable bouncing ball modes, and unstable bouncing ball modes. These modes are manifested through the Poincar\'{e} surface of section with Husimi distribution function on classical phase space. It is found that the similarity (measured in Bhattacharyya distance) between the Husimi distributions below critical lines of two different modes increases as the difference of their self-energies decreases when the quality factors of the modes are in the same order of magnitude.

abstract: Hybrid quantum systems can often be described in terms of polaritons. These are quasiparticles formed of superpositions of their constituents, with relative weights depending on some control parameter in their interaction. In many cases, these constituents are coupled to reservoirs at different temperatures. This suggests a general approach to the realization of polaritonic heat engines where a thermodynamic cycle is realized by tuning this control parameter. Here we discuss what is arguably the simplest such engine, a single two-state atom coupled to a single photon. We show that this system can extract work from feeble thermal microwave fields. We also propose a quantum measurement scheme of the work and evaluate its back-action on the operation of the engine.

abstract: In this paper, we study the exact entanglement dynamics of two two-level atoms in a dissipative cavity. We use the Gardiner-Collett Hamiltonian to model the dissipative cavity, in which, we assume that the two atoms resonantly interact with the cavity field and the cavity field itself interacts with the surrounding medium. Then, with the help of the Fano's technique, we show that, this system can be regarded as two atoms interacting with a heat bath. In such a case, we find that, there exists a decoherence-free state that does not evolve in time. At this time, there exists a so-called super-radiant state which decays in time due to dissipation. At last, we use the quantum Zeno effect to preserve the entanglement which already has been stored in the system.

abstract: Quantum-dense metrology (QDM) constitutes a special case of quantum metrology in which two orthogonal phase space projections of a signal are simultaneously sensed beyond the shot noise limit. Previously it was shown that the additional sensing channel that is provided by QDM contains information that can be used to identify and to discard corrupted segments from the measurement data. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment in which this information is used for improving the sensitivity without discarding any measurement segments. Our measurement reached sub-shot-noise performance although initially strong classical noise polluted the data.

abstract: Memory effects play a fundamental role in the study of the dynamics of open quantum systems. There exist two conceptually distinct notions of memory discussed for quantum channels in the literature. In quantum information theory quantum channels with memory are characterised by the existence of correlations between successive applications of the channel on a sequence of quantum systems. In open quantum systems theory memory effects arise dynamically during the time evolution of quantum systems, and define non-Markovian dynamics. Here we relate and combine these two different concepts of memory. In particular, we study the interplay between correlations between multiple uses of quantum channels and non-Markovianity as non-divisibility of the $t$-parametrized family of channels defining the dynamical map.

abstract: We introduce two tangle-based four-party entanglement measures $t_1$ and $t_2$, and two negativity-based measures $n_1$ and $n_2$, which are derived from the monogamy relations. These measures are computed for three four-qubit maximally entangled and W states explicitly. We also compute these measures for the rank-$2$ mixture $\rho_4 = p \ket{\mbox{GHZ}_4} \bra{\mbox{GHZ}_4} + (1 - p) \ket{\mbox{W}_4} \bra{\mbox{W}_4}$ by finding the corresponding optimal decompositions. It turns out that $t_1 (\rho_4)$ is trivial and the corresponding optimal decomposition is equal to the spectral decomposition. Probably, this triviality is a sign of the fact that the corresponding monogamy inequality is not sufficiently tight. We fail to compute $t_2 (\rho_4)$ due to the difficulty for the calculation of the residual entanglement. The negativity-based measures $n_1 (\rho_4)$ and $n_2 (\rho_4)$ are explicitly computed and the corresponding optimal decompositions are also derived explicitly.

abstract: Concurrence, introduced by Hill and Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 5022 (1997)], provides an important measure of entanglement for a general pair of qubits that is faithful: strictly positive for entangled states and vanishing for all separable states. Such a measure captures the entire content of entanglement, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for separability. We present an extension of concurrence to multiparticle pure states in arbitrary dimensions by a new framework using the Lagrange's identity and wedge product representation of separability conditions, which coincides with the "I-concurrence" of Rungta et al. [Phys. Rev. A 64, 042315 (2001)] who proposed by extending Wootters's spin-flip operator to a so-called universal inverter superoperator. Our framework exposes an inherent geometry of entanglement, and may be useful for the further extensions to mixed and continuous variable states.

abstract: In this paper, the classical Schr\"odinger equation, which allows the study of classical dynamics in terms of wave functions, is analyzed theoretically and numerically. First, departing from classical (Newtonian) mechanics, and assuming an additional single-valued condition for the Hamilton's principal function, the classical Schr\"odinger equation is obtained. This additional assumption implies inherent non-classical features on the description of the dynamics obtained from the classical Schr\"odinger equation: the trajectories do not cross in the configuration space. Second, departing from Bohmian mechanics and invoking the quantum-to-classical transition, the classical Schr\"odinger equation is obtained in a natural way for the center of mass of a quantum system with a large number of identical particles. This quantum development imposes the condition of dealing with a narrow wave packet, which implicitly avoids the non-classical features mentioned above. We illustrate all the above points with numerical simulations of the classical and quantum Schr\"odinger equations for different systems.

We prove the existence of infinite eigenvalue crossings with the selection rules of the eigenvalue pairs taking part in a crossing. This is a semiclassical localization effect. The eigenvalues at the crossings accumulate at a critical energy for some of the Stokes lines.

abstract: We present a numerical path-integral iteration scheme for the low dimensional reduced density matrix of a time-dependent quantum dissipative system. Our approach simultaneously accounts for the combined action of a microscopically modelled pure-dephasing type coupling to a continuum of harmonic oscillators representing, e.g., phonons, and further environmental interactions inducing non-Hamiltonian dynamics in the inner system represented, e.g., by Lindblad type dissipation or relaxation. Our formulation of the path-integral method allows for a numerically exact treatment of the coupling to the oscillator modes and moreover is general enough to provide a natural way to include Markovian processes that are sufficiently described by rate equations. We apply this new formalism to a model of a single semiconductor quantum dot which includes the coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons for two cases: a) external laser excitation taking into account a phenomenological radiative decay of the excited dot state and b) a coupling of the quantum dot to a single mode of an optical cavity taking into account cavity photon losses.

abstract: Information-theoretic definitions for the noise associated with a quantum measurement and the corresponding disturbance to the state of the system have recently been introduced by Buscemi et al. (2014). These definitions are invariant under relabelling of measurement outcomes, and lend themselves readily to the formulation of state-independent uncertainty relations both for the joint-estimate of observables (noise-noise relations) and the noise-disturbance tradeoff. In this contribution we derive such relations for incompatible qubit observables, which we prove to be tight in the case of joint-estimates, and present progress towards fully characterising the noise-disturbance tradeoff. In doing so, we show that the set of obtainable noise-noise values for such observables is convex, whereas the conjectured form for the set of obtainable noise-disturbance values is not. Furthermore, projective measurements are not optimal with respect to the noise-disturbance or joint-measurement noise tradeoffs. Interestingly, it seems that three-outcome measurements are optimal in the former case, whereas four-outcomes are needed in the latter.

abstract: The Rabi model, a two-level atom coupled to a harmonic oscillator, can undergo a second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) [M. -J. Hwang et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 180404 (2015)]. Here we show that the Rabi QPT accompanies critical behavior in the higher energy excited states, i.e., the excited-state QPT (ESQPT). We derive analytic expressions for the semiclassical density of states, which shows a logarithmic divergence at a critical energy eigenvalue in the broken symmetry (superradiant) phase. Moreover, we find that the logarithmic singularities in the density of states leads to singularities in the relevant observables in the system such as photon number and atomic polarization. We corroborate our analytical semiclassical prediction of the ESQPT in the Rabi model with its numerically exact quantum mechanical solution.

abstract: We report an experimental realization of the quantum paradox of the separation of a single photon from one of its properties (the so-called "quantum Cheshire cat"). We use a modified Sagnac interferometer with displaced paths to produce appropriately pre- and postselected states of heralded single photons. Weak measurements of photon presence and circular polarization are performed in each arm of the interferometer by introducing weak absorbers and small polarization rotations and analyzing changes in the postselected signal. The absorber is found to have an appreciable effect only in one arm of the interferometer, while the polarization rotation significantly affects the signal only when performed in the other arm. We carry out both sequential and simultaneous weak measurements and find good agreement between measured and predicted weak values. In the language of Aharonov et al. and in the sense of the ensemble averages described by weak values, the experiment establishes the separation of a particle from one its properties during the passage through the interferometer.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, wave functions and density matrices represent our knowledge about a quantum system and give probabilities for the outcomes of measurements. If the combined dynamics and measurements on a system lead to a density matrix $\rho(t)$ with only diagonal elements in a given basis $\{|n\rangle\}$, it may be treated as a classical mixture, i.e., a system which randomly occupies the basis states $|n\rangle$ with probabilities $\rho_{nn}(t)$. Fully equivalent to so-called smoothing in classical probability theory, subsequent probing of the occupation of the states $|n\rangle$ improves our ability to retrodict what was the outcome of a projective state measurement at time $t$. Here, we show with experiments on a superconducting qubit that the smoothed probabilities do not, in the same way as the diagonal elements of $\rho$, permit a classical mixture interpretation of the state of the system at the past time $t$.

abstract: We describe relations between several relativistic spin observables and derive a Lorentz-invariant characteristic of a reduced spin density matrix. A relativistic position operator that satisfies all the properties of its non-relativistic analogue does not exist. Instead we propose two causality-preserving positive operator-valued measures (POVM) that are based on projections onto one-particle and antiparticle spaces, and on the normalized energy density. They predict identical expectation values for position. The variances differ by less than a quarter of the squared de Broglie wavelength and coincide in the non-relativistic limit. Since the resulting statistical moment operators are not canonical conjugates of momentum, the Heisenberg uncertainty relations need not hold. Indeed, the energy density POVM leads to a lower uncertainty. We reformulate the standard equations of the spin dynamics by explicitly considering the charge-independent acceleration, allowing a consistent treatment of backreaction and inclusion of a weak gravitational field.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the propagation of long-range surface plasmon-polaritons in a nobel metal stripe waveguide at an optical wavelength of 780 nm. To minimize propagation damping the lithographically structured waveguide is produced from a thin gold stripe embedded in a dielectric polymer. Our waveguide geometry supports a symmetric fundamental and anti-symmetric first order mode. For the fundamental mode we measure a propagation loss of $(6.12^{+0.66} _{-0.54})$ dB/mm, in good agreement with numerical simulations using a vectorial eigenmode solver. Our results are a promising starting point for coupling fluorescence of individual solid state quantum emitters to integrated plasmonic waveguide structures.

abstract: In this work, we have studied the possibility of setting up Bell's inequality violating experiment in the context of cosmology, based on the basic principles of quantum mechanics. First we start with the physical motivation of implementing the Bell's inequality violation in the context of cosmology. Then to set up the cosmological Bell violating test experiment we introduce a model independent theoretical framework using which we have studied the creation of new massive particles by implementing the WKB approximation method for the scalar fluctuations in presence of additional time dependent mass contribution. Next using the background scalar fluctuation in presence of new time dependent mass contribution, we explicitly compute the expression for the one point and two point correlation functions. Furthermore, using the results for one point function we introduce a new theoretical cosmological parameter which can be expressed in terms of the other known inflationary observables and can also be treated as a future theoretical probe to break the degeneracy amongst various models of inflation. Additionally, we also fix the scale of inflation in a model independent way without any prior knowledge of primordial gravitational waves. Next, we also comment on the technicalities of measurements from isospin breaking interactions and the future prospects of newly introduced massive particles in cosmological Bell violating test experiment. Further, we cite a precise example of this set up applicable in the context of string theory motivated axion monodromy model. Then we comment on the explicit role of decoherence effect and high spin on cosmological Bell violating test experiment. In fine, we provide a theoretical bound on the heavy particle mass parameter for scalar fields, graviton and other high spin fields from our proposed setup.
