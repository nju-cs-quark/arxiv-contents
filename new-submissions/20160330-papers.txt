abstract: We introduce the concept of assemblage moment matrices, i.e., a collection of matrices of expectation values, each associated with a conditional quantum state obtained in a steering experiment. We demonstrate how it can be used for quantum state and measurement characterization in a device-independent manner, i.e., without invoking any assumption about the measurement nor the preparation device. Specifically, we show how the method can be used to lower bound the steerability of an underlying quantum state directly from the observed correlation between measurement outcomes. Combining such device-independent quantifications with earlier results established by Piani and Watrous [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 060404 (2015)], our approach immediately provides a device-independent lower bound on the generalized robustness of entanglement, as well as the usefulness of the underlying quantum state for a type of subchannel discrimination problem. In addition, by proving a quantitative relationship between steering robustness and the recently introduced incompatibility robustness, our approach also allows for a device-independent quantification of the incompatibility between various measurements performed in a Bell-type experiment. Explicit examples where such bounds provide a kind of self-testing of the performed measurements are provided.

title: Stabiliser sets and physical ancillas for the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller Annealer

abstract: In a recent paper Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) described a means to translate a Hamiltonian of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with `all-to-all' interactions into a larger physical lattice with only on-site energies and local parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of quantum annealing. Here we provide a stabiliser-based formulation of this approach, which permits some generalisation to the parity constraints proposed by LHZ. One variant we obtain may simplify the physical realisation since the required ancillas are only spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems (i.e.~qubits, rather than qutrits) and moreover the interactions {are} very simple. We make a preliminary assessment of the impact of different design choices by simulating small (few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.

abstract: Recently, along with the development of quantum information, quantum entanglemant became a hot topic of people. Quantum entanglemant is one of the most amazing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is totally different from classical physics. However, system would interact with environment in the practical quantum information process. The entanglement would be broken. In this paper, we study the disentanglement evolution of three spin qubits in an XY spin-chain environment. The dynamical process of the disentanglement is investigated. We found the exact expression of the coherence factor. We discuss the coherence factor and the parameters, and then we illustrate that the disentanglement of central spins is best enhanced by the quantum critical behavior of the environmental spin chain. Furthermore, a scaling rule is obtained.

abstract: We present a general input-output formalism for the few-photon transport in multiple waveguide channels coupled to a local cavity. Using this formalism, we study the effect of Fano interference in two-photon quantum transport. We show that the physics of Fano interference can manifest as an asymmetric spectral line shape in the frequency dependence of the two-photon correlation function. The two-photon fluorescence spectrum, on the other hand, does not exhibit the physics of Fano interference.

abstract: Optomechanical systems typically use light to control the quantum state of a mechanical resonator. In this paper, we propose a scheme for controlling the quantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled beam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states enables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical resonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control, entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent amplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon interference via a classically controlled beam splitter. The visibility of the two-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in the mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically transduced weak-force sensor.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.08641
abstract: We propose a practical approach to manipulate the counter-rotating (CR) interactions in the quantum Rabi model by introducing a sinusoidal modulation to the transition frequency of the quantum two-level system in this model. By choosing appropriate modulation frequency and amplitude, enhancement and suppression of the CR interactions can be achieved in the Jaynes-Cummings regime (including both weak- and strong-coupling cases) as well as the ultrastrong-coupling regime. In particular, we calculate the output photon emission of the cavity vacuum state under enhanced CR terms. Our results show that continuous and steady photon emission from the cavity vacuum can be observed in the Jaynes-Cummings regime as a consequence of this enhancement. Our approach can be realized in superconducting quantum circuits.

abstract: We analyze foundational consequences of recently announced loophole free tests of violation of Bell's inequality. We consider two interpretations of these remarkable experiments. By the conventional one "Einstein was wrong and Bohr was right, there is spooky action at a distance, quantum realism is incompatible with locality." However, we show that it is still possible to treat quantum mechanics without appealing to nonlocality or denying realism. We hope that this note will attract attention of the experts in quantum foundations and convince them to come with their own comments on the final Bell's test.

abstract: A recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $n$ products by a group of $m$ users, in order to provide personalised recommendations to individual users. The information is modelled as an $m \times n$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good $k$-rank approximation, for a small constant $k$. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time $O(\text{poly}(k)\text{polylog}(mn))$. All classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides a real world application of quantum algorithms in machine learning.

title: Adiabaticity in a time-dependent trap: a universal limit for the loss by touching the continuum
authors: D. Sokolovski, M. Pons
comments:

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.08718
abstract: We consider a time dependent trap externally manipulated in such a way that one of its bound states is brought into an instant contact with the continuum threshold, and then down again. It is shown that, in the limit of slow evolution, the probability to remain in the bound state, $P^{stay}$ tends to a universal limit, and is determined only by the manner in which the adiabatic bound state approaches and leaves the threshold. The task of evaluating the $P^{stay}$ in the adiabatic limit can be reduced to studying the loss from a zero range well, and is performed numerically. Various types of trapping potentials are considered. Applications of the theory to cold atoms in traps, and to propagation of traversal modes in tapered wave guides are proposed.

abstract: Topological quantum error correction codes are currently among the most promising candidates for efficiently dealing with the decoherence effects inherently present in quantum devices. Numerically, their theoretical error threshold can be calculated by mapping the underlying quantum problem to a related classical statistical-mechanical spin system with quenched disorder. Here, we present results for the general fault-tolerant regime, where we consider both qubit and measurement errors. However, unlike in previous studies, here we vary the strength of the different error sources independently. Our results highlight peculiar differences between toric and color codes. This study complements previous results published in New J. Phys. 13, 083006 (2011).

abstract: A parity deformed Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) is introduced, which describes an interaction of a two-level atom with a $\lambda$-deformed quantized field. In the rotating wave approximation (RWA), all eigen-values and eigen-functions of this model are obtained exactly. Assuming that initially the field is prepared in the Wigner cat state (WCS) and the two-level atom is in the excited state, it has been shown that the atomic Rabi oscillations exhibit a quasi-periodic behavior in the collapse and revival patterns. The influence of the deformation parameter on the time evolution of non-classical features of the radiation field such as the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effect are also analyzed. Interestingly, the main finding here is that we can realize maximally entangled atom-field states. In this note it is shown that the high fidelity is possible in the weak coupling regime, while the deformation parameter becomes large values.

abstract: A one-parameter generalized Wigner-Heisenberg algebra( WHA) is reviewed in detail. It is shown that WHA verifies the deformed commutation rule $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}_{\lambda}] = i(1 + 2\lambda \hat{R})$ and also highlights the dynamical symmetries of the pseudo-harmonic oscillator( PHO). \textbf{The present article is devoted to the study of new cat-states} built from $\lambda$-deformed Schr\"{o}dinger coherent states, which according to the Barut-Girardello scheme are defined as the eigenstates of the generalized annihilation operator. Particular attention is devoted to the limiting case where the Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are obtained. Nonclassical features and quantum statistical properties of these states are studied by evaluation of Mandel's parameter and quadrature squeezing with respect to the $\lambda-$deformed canonical pairs $( \hat{x}, \hat{p}_{\lambda})$. It is shown that these states minimize the uncertainty relations of each pair of the $su(1,1)$ components.

abstract: We give a tight scheme for teleporting a quantum state between two parties whose reference frames are misaligned by an action of a finite symmetry group. Unlike previously proposed schemes, ours requires no additional tokens or data to be passed between the participants; the same amount of classical information is transferred as for ordinary quantum teleportation, and the Hilbert space of the entangled resource is of the same size. In the terminology of Peres and Scudo, our protocol relies on classical communication of \emph{unspeakable} information.

abstract: The decohering environment of a quantum bit is often described by the coupling to a large bath of spins. The quantum bit itself can be seen as a spin $S=1/2$ which is commonly called the central spin. The resulting central spin model describes an important mechanism of decoherence. We provide mathematically rigorous bounds for a persisting magnetization of the central spin in this model with and without magnetic field. In particular, we show that there is a well defined limit of infinite number of bath spins. Only if the fraction of very weakly coupled bath spins tends to 100\% no magnetization persists.

abstract: Dimensional regularization is a common method used to regulate the UV divergence of field theoretic quantities. When it is used in the context of Renyi entropy, however, it is important to consider whether such a procedure eliminates the statistical interpretation thereof as a measure of entanglement of states living on a Hilbert space. We therefore examine the dimensionally regularized Renyi entropy of a 4d unitary CFT and show that it admits no underlying Hilbert space in the state-counting sense. This gives a concrete proof that dimensionally regularized Renyi entropy cannot always be obtained as a limit of the Renyi entropy of some finite-dimensional quantum system.

The energy spectrum of emitted electrons is obtained, and its dependence on the parameters of the laser pulse in comparison with experimental data is investigated.

abstract: Universal multiport interferometers, which can be programmed to implement any linear transformation between multiple channels, are emerging as a powerful tool for both classical and quantum photonics. These interferometers are typically composed of a regular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, allowing for straightforward fabrication using integrated photonic architectures and ready scalability. The current, standard design for universal multiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 58, 1994). We demonstrate a new design for universal multiport interferometers based on an alternative arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters, which outperforms that by Reck et al. Our design occupies half the physical footprint of the Reck design and is significantly more robust to optical losses.

abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are optically active layered materials providing potential for fast optoelectronics and on-chip photonics. We demonstrate electrically driven single-photon emission from localised sites in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2). To achieve this, we fabricate a light emitting diode structure comprising single layer graphene, thin hexagonal boron nitride and TMD mono- and bi-layers. Photon correlation measurements are used to confirm the single-photon nature of the spectrally sharp emission. These results present the TMD family as a platform for hybrid, broadband, atomically precise quantum photonics devices.

abstract: We present the experimental implementation of double Bragg diffraction of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as proposed in [E. Giese, A. Roura, G. Tackmann, E. M. Rasel, and W. P. Schleich, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 053608 (2013)]. We excite Rabi oscillations between the three coupled momentum states $\left| 0 \hbar k \right\rangle$ and $\left| \pm 2 \hbar k \right\rangle$. By selecting appropriate interaction times we generate highly efficient beamsplitters and mirrors for Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition, we demonstrate higher-order double Bragg diffraction and display beamsplitters with up to $ \pm 6 \hbar k$ momentum transfer. We compare double Bragg diffraction to several other experimental realizations of beamsplitters. Finally, we show that double Bragg diffraction is well suited for matter wave interferometry by realizing a Ramsey-type interferometer in a quasi one-dimensional waveguide.

abstract: In this letter the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation is used to study the relativistic generalization of the $\kappa$-deformed Landau levels and the consequences of the deformation on the Hall conductivity. The isolated solutions for the first order differential equations, excluded from the Sturm-Liouville problem, are investigated. They do exist, but are independent of the deformation parameter. An expression for the $\kappa$-deformed relativistic Landau levels is obtained. It is observed that the deformation parameter breaks the Landau levels degeneracy. Considering the $\kappa$-deformed Landau levels in the nonrelativistic regime the Hall conductivity of a two-dimensional electron system is obtained. The expression obtained recovers the well-known result for the usual Hall conductivity in the limit $\varepsilon=\kappa^{-1}\to 0$. It is also observed that deformation generates new plateaus of conductivity in a such way that the plateaus widths of the deformed system are less than the undeformed one.
