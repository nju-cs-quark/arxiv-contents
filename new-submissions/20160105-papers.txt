abstract: In the Landau problem on the two-dimensional plane, magnetic translation of a quantum wave can be induced by an in-plane electric field. The geometric phase accompanying such magnetic translation around a closed path differs from the topological phase of Aharonov and Bohm in two aspects: The wave is in direct contact with the magnetic flux and the geometric phase has an opposite sign from the Aharonov-Bohm phase. We show that magnetic translation on the two-dimensional cylinder implemented by the Schr\"odinger time evolution truly leads to an identification of the Berry phase with the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The magnetic field at the cylinder's surface corresponds to a line of monopoles which can be simulated in cold atom experiments. We propose an extension of the Aharonov-Bohm experiment which can demonstrate the mutually counteracting effect between the local magnetic translation geometric phase and the topological phase of Aharonov-Bohm.

abstract: A quantum state represents neither properties of a physical system nor anyone's knowledge of its properties. The important question is not what quantum states represent but how they are used---as informational bridges. Knowing about some physical situations (its backing conditions), an agent may assign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical situations (its advice conditions). Quantum states are objective: only expectations based on correct state assignments are generally reliable. If a quantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations between its backing conditions and its advice conditions. This paper offers an account of quantum states and their function as informational bridges, in quantum teleportation and elsewhere.

abstract: In papers published in the 25 years following his famous 1964 proof John Bell refined and reformulated his views on locality and causality. Although his formulations of local causality were in terms of probability, he had little to say about that notion. But assumptions about probability are implicit in his arguments and conclusions. Probability does not conform to these assumptions when quantum mechanics is applied to account for the particular correlations Bell argues are locally inexplicable. This account involves no superluminal action and there is even a sense in which it is local, but it is in tension with the requirement that the direct causes and effects of events are nearby.

abstract: We investigate the steerability of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states under projective measurements by the steering party. In the simplest nontrivial scenario of two projective measurements, we solve this problem completely by virtue of the connection between the steering problem and the joint-measurement problem. A necessary and sufficient criterion is derived together with a simple geometrical interpretation. Our study shows that a Bell-diagonal state is steerable by two projective measurements iff it violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, in sharp contrast with the strict hierarchy expected between steering and Bell nonlocality. We also introduce a steering measure and clarify its connections with concurrence and the volume of the steering ellipsoid. In particular, we determine the maximal concurrence and ellipsoid volume of Bell-diagonal states that are not steerable by two projective measurements. Furthermore, we explore the steerability of Bell-diagonal states under three projective measurements. A simple sufficient criterion is derived, which can detect the steerability of many states that are not steerable by two projective measurements. Finally, we generalize some of our results to arbitrary two-qubit states. Our study offers valuable insight on steering of Bell-diagonal states as well as the connections between entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality.

abstract: Integrated quantum optics has drastically reduced the size of table-top optical experiments to the chip-scale, allowing for demonstrations of large-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation. However, despite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale. Increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time, and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by simplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise tolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum phenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode beamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the waveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes (per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We also cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within a multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a scalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.

abstract: In this paper, the Wigner function of two-mode qubit and qutrit like entangled coherent states (ECS's) is investigated. We use the displacement operator together with parity operation to construct the superposition of two coherent states. By transmitting this superposition from 50-50 beam splitter the two-mode qubit like ECS is generated. Moreover, we introduce a controllable method for producing qutrit like ECS using atom-field interaction in cavity QED and beam splitter. We will show that the distances of peaks of Wigner functions for two-mode ECS's are entanglement sensitive and can be a witness for entanglement. To confirm the results we use concurrence measure to compare bipartite entanglement of ECS's with the behavior of peaks of Wigner functions. Moreover, we investigate decoherence effects on Wigner function, arising from transmitting ECS's through noisy channels.

abstract: The laws of quantum physics place a limit on the speed of computation, in particular the evolution time of a system cannot be arbitrarily fast. Bounds on the speed of evolution for unitary dynamics have been long studied. A few bounds on the speed of evolution for noisy dynamics have also been obtained recently, these bounds, however, are in general not tight. In this article we present a new framework for quantum speed limit of noisy dynamics. With this framework we obtain the exact maximal angle that a noisy dynamics can achieve at any given time, this then provides tight bounds on the evolution time for noisy dynamics. The obtained bound reveals that noisy dynamics are generically different from unitary dynamics, in particular we show that the 'orthogonalization' time, which is the minimum time needed to evolve any state to its orthogonal states, is in general not applicable to noisy dynamics.

abstract: Quantum memories, capable of storing single photons or other quantum states of light, to be retrieved on-demand, offer a route to large-scale quantum information processing with light. A promising class of memories is based on far-off-resonant Raman absorption in ensembles of $\Lambda$-type atoms. However at room temperature these systems exhibit unwanted four-wave mixing, which is prohibitive for applications at the single-photon level. Here we show how this noise can be suppressed by placing the storage medium inside a moderate-finesse optical cavity, thereby removing the main roadblock hindering this approach to quantum memory.

abstract: Photonic sensors have many applications in a range of physical settings, from measuring mechanical pressure in manufacturing to detecting protein concentration in biomedical samples. A variety of sensing approaches exist, and plasmonic systems in particular have received much attention due to their ability to confine light below the diffraction limit, greatly enhancing sensitivity. Recently, quantum techniques have been identified that can outperform classical sensing methods and achieve sensitivity below the so-called shot-noise limit. Despite this significant potential, the use of quantum techniques in plasmonic systems for further improving sensing capabilities is not well understood. Here, we study the sensing performance of a plasmonic interferometer that simultaneously exploits the quantum nature of light and its electromagnetic field confinement. We show that, despite the presence of loss, specialised quantum resources can provide improved sensitivity and resolution beyond the shot-noise limit within a compact plasmonic device operating below the diffraction limit.

abstract: In this paper we consider a three-state variant of the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. We derive a new lower-bound on the key rate of this protocol in the asymptotic scenario and use mismatched measurement outcomes to improve the channel estimation. Our new key rate bound remains positive up to an error rate of $11\%$, exactly that achieved by the four-state BB84 protocol. This is also a substantial improvement in the tolerated noise over previous lower-bounds for this particular three-state protocol.

abstract: While a bit is the fundamental unit of binary classical information, a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. In quantum information processing (QIP), it is customary to call the qubits under study as system qubits, and the additional qubits as ancillary qubits. In this thesis, I describe various schemes to exploit the ancillary qubits to efficiently perform many QIP tasks and their experimental demonstrations in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems. Particularly, we have showed that, in the presence of sufficient ancillary qubits, it is possible to completely characterize a general quantum state as well as a general quantum dynamics in a single measurement. In addition, it is also possible to exploit ancillary qubits for realizing noninvasive quantum measurements required for several experiments related to quantum physics. I will also illustrate some interesting applications of ancillary qubits in spectroscopy. At last, I describe an experimental study of the efficiency of various dynamical decoupling sequences for suppressing decoherence of single as well as multiple quantum coherences on large spin-clusters. The experiments reveal the superior performance of the recently introduced RUDD sequences in suppressing decoherence.

abstract: We study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially entangled with other parties, but they locally interact with their own non-Markovian environment. First, we consider three GHZ-type initial states, all of which have GHZ symmetry provided that the parameters are chosen appropriately. However, this symmetry is broken due to the effect of environment. The corresponding $\pi$-tangles, one of the tripartite entanglement measure, are analytically computed at arbitrary time. The revival phenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement. We also consider two W-type initial states. The revival phenomenon also occurs in this case. On the analytical ground the robustness issue against the effect of environment is examined for both GHZ-type and W-type initial states.

abstract: We present Bell-type tests of nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity for single-mode fields employing a generalized quasiprobability function. Our nonclassicality tests are based on the observation that two orthogonal quadratures in phase space (position and momentum) behave as independent realistic variables for a coherent state. Taking four (three) points at the vertices of a rectangle (right triangle) in phase space, our tests detect every pure nonclassical Gaussian state and a range of mixed Gaussian states. These tests also set an upper bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, which thereby provide criteria for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity. We optimize the non-Gaussianity tests by employing a squeezing transformation in phase space that converts a rectangle (right triangle) to a parallelogram (triangle), which enlarges the set of non-Gaussian states detectable in our formulation. We address fundamental and practical limits of our generalized phase-space tests by looking into their relation with decoherence under a lossy Gaussian channel and their robustness against finite data and nonoptimal choice of phase-space points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our parallelogram test can identify useful resources for nonlocality testing in phase space.

abstract: Scalable photonic quantum technologies require on-demand single-photon sources with simultaneously high levels of purity, indistinguishability, and efficiency. These key features, however, have only been demonstrated separately in previous experiments. Here, by s-shell pulsed resonant excitation of a Purcell-enhanced quantum dot-micropillar system, we deterministically generate resonance fluorescence single photons which, at pi pulse excitation, have an extraction efficiency of 66%, single-photon purity of 99.1%, and photon indistinguishability of 98.5%. Such a single-photon source for the first time combines the features of high efficiency and near-perfect levels of purity and indistinguishabilty, and thus open the way to multi-photon experiments with semiconductor quantum dots.

abstract: We consider the macroscopic disordered system of free lattice fermions with the one-bodyHamiltonian, which is the d-dimensional Schrodinger operator with ergodic potential. Weassume that the expectation of the entries of the Fermi projection of the Hamiltonian decays exponentially (a typical behavior in the localization regime). We prove that for any dimension d the expectation of entanglement entropy of the cubic block of side length L divided by the surface area of the block has a finite limit as L tends to infinity and we identify the limit. We then prove that for d = 1 the entanglement entropy admits a well defined asymptotic form with probability 1. According to recent numerical results by Pastur L., Slavin V., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 (2014) 150404, the asymptotic form is not selfaveraging for d = 1, i.e., its fluctuations do not vanish for large L even for an i.i.d. potential. On the other hand, for d >1 and an i.i.d. potential with sufficiently regular probability distribution, we prove that the variance of the entanglement entropy per unit area has a power law decay for large L, i.e., that for d >1 the entanglement entropy per unit area is selfaveraging.

abstract: Ion traps are a promising platform for the implementation of various quantum technologies, particularly quantum simulation. Unfortunately, the entangling gates required for digital quantum simulations rely on the virtual excitation of the motional modes of the trap, making the necessary operations too slow with respect to the system coherence times. In this work, we propose a method of implementing a crucial multiqubit gate, through a scheme of fast two-qubit gates, able to perform in shorter time and with more precision than existing alternatives. Its implementation would enable digital quantum simulations to outperform classical computers without error correction.

abstract: With adiabatic techniques, it is possible to create quantum superposition states with high fidelity while exercising limited control over the parameters of a system. However, because these techniques are slow compared to other timescales in the system, they are usually not suitable for creating highly unstable states or performing time-critical processes. Both of these situations arise in quantum information processing, where entangled states may only be isolated from the environment for a short time and where quantum computers require high-fidelity operations to be performed quickly. Recently it has been shown that techniques like optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity may be used to prepare quantum states non-adiabatically with high fidelity. Here we present two examples of how these techniques can be used to create maximally entangled many-body NOON states in one-dimensional Tonks--Girardeau gases.

abstract: Many delayed-choice experiments based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle duality. Conventional wisdoms long hold that by inserting or removing the second beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum superposition of the wave and particle state as \psi=a_w\psi_wave+a_p\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative interpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all composite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and removing operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian H_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and H_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution of this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum eigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as \psi_mod=a(t)\psi_wave+b(t)\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of particle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the wave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and averaged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new light on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle duality and principle of complementarity.

abstract: We present analytical solutions to three qubits and a single-mode cavity coupling system beyond the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). The zero-th order approximation gives correct solutions when the qubits are far detuned from the cavity. The first order approximation, called generalized rotating-wave approximation (GRWA), produces an effective solvable Hamiltonian with the same form as the ordinary RWA one and exhibits substantial improvements of energy levels over the RWA even on resonance. Based on these analytical eigen-solutions, we study both the bipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). The dynamics of the concurrence and the GME using the GRWA are in consistent with the numerical ones. Interestingly, the well known sudden death of entanglement occurs in the bipartite entanglement dynamics but not in GME dynamics.

abstract: Endohedral molecular magnets, e.g. as realized in fullerenes containing $\rm DySc_{2}N$, are promising candidates for molecular electronics and quantum information processing. For their functionalization an ultrafast local magnetization control is essential. Using full ab-initio quantum chemistry calculations we predict the emergence of charge current loops in fullerenes with an associated orbital magnetic moment upon irradiation with weak light vortex pulses that transfer orbital angular momentum. The generated current is controllable by the frequency, the vortex topological charge, and the intensity of the light. Numerical and analytical results show that an ultraviolet vortex femtosecond pulse with an intensity $\sim10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$ generates non-invasively nA unidirectional surface current with an associated magnetic field of hundreds $\mu$T at the center of the fullerene.

abstract: We propose a method of construction of a normalized vibrational Hamiltonian of a highly excited molecular system with $n$ degrees of freedom in the case of a a $p:q$ resonance. We present also the counting of all the independent operators and the counting of all the parameters included in the Hamiltonian (Counting theorems 1 to 8). The method introduces, on a systematic way, all the operators, in particular the coupling operators, that can be built from the polynomials formed by products of powers of the generators of a Lie algebra: the algebra of the invariant polynomials built in classical mechanics from the the kernel $Ker \,ad_{\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ of the adjoint operator $ad_{\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ (see [6] or [4],[5]). Application to the non-linear triatomic molecule ClOH is then given, taking into account the Fermi resonance between the O-Cl stretching oscillators and the bending motion. The study of this molecular system in highly excited vibrational states (until almost the dissociation limit) has been realized in [2], with a fit of 725 levels of energy. On the 86 coefficients (among which 31 coupling coefficients) that we count, and completely compatible with [2], the smallest rms value leads to keep only 28 non-zero coefficients. In the appendix, we explain the vocabulary and the strategy employed in order to demonstrate the theorems of coupling operators included in the Hamiltonian.

We observe two-photon interference fringes involving both the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect and the interference of path-entangled two-photon states simultaneously in a single interferometric setup. The observed two-photon interference effect can provide a simultaneous observation of the interferometric properties of the single-photon and two-photon wavepackets

abstract: Matrix product states (MPS) illustrate the suitability of tensor networks for the description of interacting many-body systems: ground states of gapped $1$-D systems are approximable by MPS as shown by Hastings [J. Stat. Mech. Theor. Exp., P08024 (2007)]. In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks can accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively quantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence exists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable Ansatz states, and numerical studies show that certain tensor networks can indeed approximate the associated correlation functions. Here we provide a complete positive answer to this question in the case of MPS and $2D$ conformal field theory: we give quantitative estimates for the approximation error when approximating correlation functions by MPS. Our work is constructive and yields an explicit MPS, thus providing both suitable initial values as well as a rigorous justification of variational methods.

abstract: We construct a macroscopic thermodynamical theory that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics, based on quantum mechanics. More concretely, our macroscopic theory satisfies the following two features: (1) A macroscopic equilibrium state is expressed as a set of macroscopic variables $\vec{a}=(a_1,\cdots,a_L)$, which represents coarse-grained values of a set of physical quantities, and (2) An adiabatic transformation from an equilibrium state $\vec{a}$ to another state $\vec{a}'$ is possible if and only if $s_{\vec{a}}\le s_{\vec{a}'}$ holds. Here, $s_{\vec{a}}$ is a real-valued function corresponding to the thermodynamical entropy, which depends only on macroscopic variables $\vec{a}$. We show that such a macroscopic thermodynamical theory can be consistently constructed if the von-Neumann entropy of a generalized microcanonical state satisfies a generalized central limit theorem. We also show that even when the von-Neumann entropies do not satisfy the condition, a macroscopic thermodynamic-like theory with a similar structure exists, which could be at the foundations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Finally, we make a replica of $(U,V,N)$ expression of thermodynamics satisfying (1) and (2), using a toy model of free particles in a box.

abstract: In this work, we study the effects of coherent and incoherent transport of energy through two types of configurations of four interacting two-level systems. Both of the configurations are irreversibly attached to the respective reaction centers. For the first type, the dynamics is only coherent, while for the second one the coherent evolution is completely suppressed and the evolution of the system is only incoherent induced from interaction of the system with fluctuating environments. We calculate the efficiency of transport for both of the configurations in the presence of harmonic deformations. It is found that for a special type of deformations, the efficiency of incoherent transport becomes better than the coherent one.

abstract: Using the model of parametric interaction based on the spatio-spectral Schmidt modes and generalized parametric approximation, we analyze coherence and mode structure of ultra-intense twin beams generated in the regime with pump depletion. We show that the increase of spatial and spectral coherence with the increasing pump power observed for moderate powers is replaced by the decrease for the pump powers at which pump depletion occurs. This behavior of coherence is opposed to that exhibited by the number of spatio-spectral modes effectively constituting the twin beam. The conditions for maximal coherence are analyzed considering pump-beam parameters (spectral width, transverse radius). The existence of additional coherence maxima occurring at even higher pump powers is predicted and explained by the oscillatory evolution of the modes' populations.

abstract: Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that all accessible configurations of a system are equally likely. This requires dynamics that explore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum systems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an outstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum system consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a sequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the density matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase space dynamics in the classical limit; classically chaotic motion coincides with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high entropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work illustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental questions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

abstract: We optomechanically measure the vibrations of a nanomechanical system made of a graphene membrane suspended on a silicon nitride nanoresonator. When probing the thermal noise of the coupled nanomechanical device, we observe a significant deviation from the normal mode expansion. It originates from the heterogeneous character of mechanical dissipation over the spatial extension of coupled eigenmodes, which violates one of the fundamental prerequisite for employing this commonly used description of the nanoresonators' thermal noise. We subsequently measure the local mechanical susceptibility and demonstrate that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem still holds and permits a proper evaluation of the thermal noise of the nanomechanical system. Since it naturally becomes delicate to ensure a good spatial homogeneity at the nanoscale, this approach is fundamental to correctly describe the thermal noise of nanomechanical systems which ultimately impact their sensing capacity.

abstract: We explore the geometric interpretation of a diabatic, two-photon Raman process as a rotation on the Bloch sphere for a pseudo-spin-1/2 system. The spin state of a spin-1/2 quantum system can be described by a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and its evolution during a Raman pulse is a trajectory on the sphere determined by properties of the optical beams: the pulse area, the relative intensities and phases, and the relative frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate key features of this model with a $^{87}$Rb spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which allows us to examine spatially dependent signatures of the Raman beams. The two-photon detuning allows us to precisely control the spin density and imprinted relative phase profiles, as we show with a coreless vortex. With this comprehensive understanding and intuitive geometric interpretation, we use the Raman process to create and tailor as well as study and characterize exotic topological spin textures in spinor BECs.

abstract: Since the well-known PT symmetry has its fundamental significance and implication in physics, where PT denotes the combined operation of space-inversion P and time-reversal T, it is extremely important and intriguing to completely classify exotic PT-invariant topological metals and to physically realize them. Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification of topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As a physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D Brillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through its PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these exact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect tunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a spin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create out-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic cold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped band-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and non-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined PT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are characterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we demonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener oscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the time-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through Bragg spectroscopy. The present proposal for realizing topological NL states in cold atom systems may provide a unique experimental platform for exploring exotic PT-invariant topological physics.

abstract: Penning ionization reactions in merged beams with precisely controlled collision energies have been shown to accurately probe quantum mechanical effects in reactive collisions. A complete microscopic understanding of the reaction is, however, faced with two major challenges---the highly excited character of the reaction's entrance channel and the limited precision of even the best state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, we suggest photoassociation spectroscopy as a tool to identify the character of orbiting resonances in the entrance channel and probe the ionization width as a function of inter-particle separation. We introduce the basic concept and discuss the general conditions under which this type of spectroscopy will be successful.

abstract: In a thermal ensemble of atoms driven by coherent fields, how does evolution of quantum superposition compete with classical dynamics of optical pumping and atomic diffusion? Is it optical pumping that first prepares a thermal ensemble, with coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way round: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping? Using a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these questions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed three-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong coherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe transmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a scenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is dictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of half-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that, in fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly longer time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control turn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature for identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model predictions confirm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich and complex dynamics associated with atoms in thermal ensemble, which are otherwise absent in state-prepared, cold atomic ensembles.

abstract: After a brief historical review of ergodicity and mixing in dynamics, particularly in quantum dynamics, we introduce definitions of quantum ergodicity and mixing using the structure of the system's energy levels and spacings. Our definitions are consistent with usual understanding of ergodicity and mixing. Two parameters concerning the degeneracy in energy levels and spacings are introduced; their relations to quantum ergodicity and mixing are demonstrated with right triangular billiards. With this billiard system, we find that a system is ergodic in its quantum dynamics may not be ergodic in its classical dynamics. At the end, we argue that, besides ergodicity and mixing, there may exist a third class of quantum dynamics which is characterized by a maximized entropy.

abstract: Vibrational spectra can be computed without storing full-dimensional vectors by using low-rank sum-of-products (SOP) basis functions. We introduce symmetry constraints in the SOP basis functions to make it possible to separately calculate states in different symmetry subgroups. This is done using a power method to compute eigenvalues and an alternating least squares method to optimize basis functions. Owing to the fact that the power method favours the convergence of the lowest states, one must be careful not to exclude basis functions of some symmetries. Exploiting symmetry facilitates making assignments and improves the accuracy. The method is applied to the acetonitrile molecule.

abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics of a generic model of light-matter interaction in the context of high impedance waveguides, focusing on the behavior of the emitted photonic states, in the framework of the spin-boson model Quantum quenches as well as scattering of an incident coherent pulse are studied using two complementary methods. First, we develop an approximate ansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state wavefunction; formally, this approach combines ideas from adiabatic renormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory. Second, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity pulse by using NRG calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear response property throughout the ultra-strong coupling regime. We find that in a sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical artifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously unnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that generates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG is used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as the inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are established and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the transport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These formulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in the spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for comparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide QED. Finally, the scattering results using the coherent state wavefunction approach are compared favorably to the NRG results for very weak incident intensity. We end our study by presenting results at higher power where the response of the system is nonlinear.

abstract: Quantum measurement principle is employed to detect water quality and presence of nano-colloids. The setup uses spatially low coherent light source, for which the outcome of measurement is dependent on the presence of a reflecting surface and a linear polarizer. The introduction of a reflecting surface induces enhanced side scattering. The enhancement has specific patterns for pure water, ions and nanoparticles and can be employed to detect refractive index of liquids at high sensitivity. The differential enhancement can be used as an optical magnetometer that sensitively senses magnetic moments of colloidal magnetic nanoparticles at concentration untenable by other measurement techniques.

abstract: In electronic structure calculations, various material properties can be obtained by means of computing the total energy of a system as well as derivatives of the total energy w.r.t. atomic positions. The derivatives, also known as Hellman-Feynman forces, require, because of practical computational reasons, the discretized charge density and wave functions having continuous second derivatives in the whole solution domain. We describe an application of isogeometric analysis (IGA), a spline modification of finite element method (FEM), to achieve the required continuity. The novelty of our approach is in employing the technique of B\'ezier extraction to add the IGA capabilities to our FEM based code for ab-initio calculations of electronic states of non-periodic systems within the density-functional framework, built upon the open source finite element package SfePy. We compare FEM and IGA in benchmark problems and several numerical results are presented.

abstract: Circulators are non-reciprocal circuit elements integral to technologies including radar systems, microwave communication transceivers, and the readout of quantum information devices. Their non-reciprocity arises from the interference of microwaves over the centimetre-scale of the signal wavelength in the presence of bulky magnetic media that break time-reversal symmetry. Here we realize a completely passive on-chip microwave circulator with size one-thousandth the wavelength by exploiting the chiral, slow-light response of a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. For an integrated GaAs device with 330 um diameter and 1 GHz centre frequency, a non-reciprocity of 25 dB is observed over a 50 MHz bandwidth. Furthermore, the direction of circulation can be selected dynamically by varying the magnetic field, an aspect that may enable reconfigurable passive routing of microwave signals on-chip.
