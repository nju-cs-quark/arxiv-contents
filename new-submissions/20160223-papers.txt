abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamics of an $n$-dimensional Lindblad control system can be separated into its inter- and intra-orbit dynamics when there is fast controllability. This can be viewed as a control system on the simplex of density operator spectra, where the flag representing the eigenspaces is viewed as a control variable. The local controllability properties of this control system can be analyzed when the control-set of flags is limited to a finite subset. In particular, there is a natural finite subset of $n!$ flags that are effective for low-purity orbits.

abstract: We improve a scheme of static quantum circuits \cite{shor} for performing universal quantum computation, by replacing non-local interactions of XY Heisenberg spin chains with local interactions. The idea is borrowed from quantum electrodynamics where the photon mediates long-range interaction between charged particles. In our scheme, an additional XY chain mediates an interaction between the chains (qubits) which leads to a two-qubit entangling gate, making universal quantum computation with no external control, possible on these circuits. In this way quantum circuits become completely analogous to classical circuits.

abstract: Based on the second-order quantum interference between frequency entangled photons that are generated by parametric down conversion, a quantum strategic algorithm for synchronizing two spatially separated clocks has been recently presented. In the reference frame of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, photon correlations are used to define simultaneous events. Once the HOM interferometer is balanced by use of an adjustable optical delay in one arm, arrival times of simultaneously generated photons are recorded by each clock. The clock offset is determined by correlation measurement of the recorded arrival times. Utilizing this algorithm, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment for synchronizing two clocks separated by 4km fiber link. A minimum timing stability of 0.4 ps at averaging time of 16000 s is achieved with an absolute time accuracy of 59.4 ps. The timing stability is verified to be limited by the correlation measurement device and ideally can be better than 10 fs. Such results shine a light to the application of quantum clock synchronization in the real high-accuracy timing system.

abstract: We propose a scheme of the exact fast-forwarding of standard quantum dynamics for a charged particle. The present idea allows the acceleration of both the amplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fast-forward time range and is distinct from that of Masuda-Nakamura (e.g., Proc. R. Soc. A {\bf 466}, 1135 (2010)) which enabled acceleration of only the amplitude of the wave function on the way. We shall apply the proposed method to the quantum tunneling phenomena and obtain the electro-magnetic field to ensure the rapid penetration of wave functions through a tunneling barrier. Typical examples described here are: 1) an exponential wave packet passing through the delta-function barrier; 2) the opened Moshinsky shutter with a delta-function barrier just behind the shutter. We elucidate the tunneling current in the vicinity of the barrier and find the remarkable enhancement of the tunneling rate (: tunneling power) due to the fast-forwarding. In the case of a very high barrier, in particular, we present the asymptotic analysis and exhibit a suitable driving force to recover a recognizable tunneling current. The analysis is also carried out on the exact acceleration of macroscopic quantum tunneling with use of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which accommodates a tunneling barrier.

abstract: From a quantum point of view, it is mandatory to include the measurement process when predicting the time-evolution of a quantum system. In this paper, a model to treat the measurement of the (TeraHertz) THz electrical current in quantum devices is presented. The explicit interaction of a quantum system with an external measuring apparatus is analyzed through the unambiguous notion of the Bohmian conditional wave function, the wave function of a subsystem. It it shown that such THz quantum measurement process can be modeled as a weak measurement: The systems suffers a small perturbation due to the apparatus, but the current is measured with a great uncertainty. This uncertainty implies that a new source of noise appears at THz frequencies. Numerical (quantum Monte Carlo) experiments are performed confirming the weak character of this measurement. This work also indicates that at low frequencies this noise is negligible and it can be ignored. From a classical point of view, the origin of this noise due to the measurement at THz frequencies can be attributed to the plasmonic effect of those electrons at the contacts (by interpreting the contacts themselves as part of the measuring apparatus).

abstract: We calculate transition amplitudes and cross sections for excitation of hydrogen-like atoms by the twisted photon states, or photon states with angular momentum projection on the direction of propagation exceeding $\hbar$. If the target atom is located at distances of the order of atomic size near the phase singularity in the vortex center, the transitions rates into the states with orbital angular momentum $l_f>1$ become comparable with the rates for electric dipole transitions. It is shown that when the transition rates are normalized to the local photon flux, the resulting cross sections for $l_f>1$ are singular near the optical vortex center. Relation to the "quantum core" concept introduced by Berry and Dennis is discussed.

This spin-orbit state is created by passing neutrons through the center of a quadrupole magnetic field, which provides a coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. A Ramsey fringe type measurement is suggested as a means of verifying the spin-orbit correlations.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, two particles are said to be entangled if the composite wavefunction is non-separable. Separating the two particles and measuring their coincidences as was done in the Aspect experiment leads to a modulated correlation between the polarization states of the two particles. In this article we demonstrate a similar experiment to look at a system whose two degrees of freedom (DoF)- polarization and mode - are entangled, ie the system can be modelled as a non-separable function in the Hilbert space. We propose an interferometric method to perform projective measurements that leads to correlations as seen for entangled quantum particles.

abstract: Adiabatic techniques are known to allow for engineering quantum states with high fidelity. This requirement is currently of large interest, as applications in quantum information require the preparation and manipulation of quantum states with minimal errors. Here we review recent progress on developing techniques for the preparation of spatial states through adiabatic passage, particularly focusing on three state systems. These techniques can be applied to matter waves in external potentials, such as cold atoms or electrons, and to classical waves in waveguides, such as light or sound.

abstract: We study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) per particle of an open (parti- cles can enter and leave the system) and dissipative (far from thermodynamical equilibrium) steady state system of two qubits in a noise which is decoherence. We show the behavior of QFI per particle of the system due to changes of re- set and decoherence parameters r and {\gamma} respectively. The parameter r is the strength of the reset mechanism, {\gamma} is the strength of decoherence and in our case it is dephasing channel. The parameters {\gamma} and r are real numbers. We observe that the reset parameter must be bigger than decoherence parameter. We have found that by choosing coupling parameter g as 5{\gamma} the QFI per particle is 1.00226 which is greater than shot noise limit at {\gamma} = 0.5 and r = 14 . Also the concurrence and negativity of the such state have been calculated and they are found as 0.0992486 and 0.0496243 respectively. We have shown that when the concurrence and negativity of some specific states different than zero, which means the state is entangled, the QFI of the system is greater than 1. The QFI per particle, concurrence and negativity shows that the chosen case is weakly entangled. We discovered that the optimal direction depends on the parameters r and {\gamma} and a change in the direction effects the behavior of the QFI of the system.

abstract: We discuss the role that intuitive theories of physics play in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. We compare and contrast na\"ive physics with quantum mechanics and argue that quantum mechanics is not just hard to understand but that it is difficult to believe, often appearing magical in nature. Quantum mechanics is often discussed in the context of "quantum weirdness" and quantum entanglement is known as "spooky action at a distance." This spookiness is more than just because quantum mechanics doesn't match everyday experience; it ruffles the feathers of our na\"ive physics cognitive module. In Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, we preserve a form of deterministic thinking that can alleviate some of the perceived weirdness inherent in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, at the cost of having the universe split into parallel worlds at every quantum measurement. By examining the role cognitive modules play in interpreting quantum mechanics, we conclude that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics involves a cognitive bias not seen in the Copenhagen interpretation.

abstract: Selective control of qubits in a quantum register for the purposes of quantum information processing represents a critical challenge for dense spin ensembles in solid state systems. Here we present a protocol that achieves a complete set of selective single and two-qubit gates on nuclear spins in such an ensemble in diamond facilitated by a nearby NV center. The protocol suppresses internuclear interactions as well as unwanted coupling between the NV center and other spins of the ensemble to achieve quantum gate fidelities well exceeding 99% . Notably, our method can be applied to weakly coupled, distant, spins and therefore represents a scalable procedure that exploits the exceptional properties of nuclear spins in diamond as robust quantum memories.

abstract: In a recent article Hensen et al. [Nature 526, 682 (2015)] report on a sophisticated Bell experiment, simultaneously closing, for the first time, loopholes for local hidden-variable theories (HVTs). The authors claim that 'local realism' has been refuted, under certain natural assumptions. The aim of the present Comment is twofold. First, it is urged that the class of local HVTs that is eliminated by the reported experiment should be specified in greater detail than is done by the authors. Second, it is argued that the class of local HVTs that still survives is wide and natural. For instance, hidden variables describing a 'background' field can exploit the freedom-of-choice loophole, which cannot be closed for this type of hidden variables. The dynamics of such background-based theories can be illustrated by existing systems, e.g. from fluid mechanics.

abstract: We study the transmission of light through a one-dimensional waveguide that confines strongly coupled classical or quantum degenerate fermionic atomic ensembles. The emergence of light-induced correlation effects between the atoms is analyzed by using stochastic Monte-Carlo simulations and transfer matrix methods of transport theory. The conditions of the correlated collective response are identified in terms of the atom density, thermal broadening, and photon losses. We also calculate the "cooperative Lamb shift" for the waveguide transmission resonance, and discuss line shifts that are specific to effectively one-dimensional waveguide systems.

abstract: Ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to study strongly correlated phases of matter in and out of equilibrium. Much of the experimental progress in this field crucially relies on the control of the contact interaction between two atoms. Control of strong long-range interactions between distant ground state atoms has remained a long standing goal, opening the path towards the study of fundamentally new quantum many-body systems including frustrated or topological magnets and supersolids. Optical dressing of ground state atoms by near-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile method to engineer such interactions. However, up to now the great potential of this approach for interaction control in a many-body setting has eluded experimental confirmation. Here we report the realisation of coherent Rydberg-dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single atom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy of the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable agreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems. Finally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible routes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times. Our work marks the first step towards the use of laser-controlled Rydberg interactions for the study of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices.

abstract: The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) stems from the diagonal second derivative coupling term in the adiabatic representation, and it can have an arbitrary large magnitude when a gap between neighbouring Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces (PESs) is closing. Nevertheless, DBOC is typically neglected in mixed quantum-classical methods of simulating nonadiabatic dynamics (e.g., fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH) method). A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method, FSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models containing conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC inclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D but on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively assesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state problems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of one- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC can enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2) PESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is detrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even diverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this case, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between diagonal and off-diagonal terms in derivative nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping approaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.

abstract: This paper is concerned with quantum harmonic oscillators consisting of a quantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer. We employ discounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted time averages of second-order moments of the system variables. A coherent quantum filtering (CQF) problem is formulated as the minimization of the discounted mean square of an estimation error, with which the dynamic variables of the observer approximate those of the plant. The cost functional also involves a quadratic penalty on the plant-observer coupling matrix in order to mitigate the back-action of the observer on the covariance dynamics of the plant. For the discounted mean square optimal CQF problem with penalized back-action, we establish first-order necessary conditions of optimality in the form of algebraic matrix equations. By using the Hamiltonian structure of the Heisenberg dynamics and related Lie-algebraic techniques, we represent this set of equations in a more explicit form in the case of equally dimensioned plant and observer.

abstract: In this letter we investigate measures of chaos and entanglement scrambling in rational conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions. First, we derive a formula for the late time value of the out-of-time-order correlators for these class of theories. Our universal result can be expressed as a particular combination of the modular S-matrix elements known as anyon monodromy scalar. Next, in the explicit setup of a $SU(N)_k$ WZW model, we compare the late time behaviour of the out-of-time correlators and the purity. Interestingly, in the large-c limit, the purity grows logarithmically but the out-of-time-order correlators remain constant. Therefore, we find that some systems may display entanglement scrambling in the absence of chaos.

abstract: We show that short-range correlations have a dramatic impact on the steady-state phase diagram of quantum driven-dissipative systems. This effect, never observed in equilibrium, follows from the fact that ordering in the steady state is of dynamical origin, whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium it arises from the properties of the (free-)energy. To this scope, by combining the cluster methods extensively used in equilibrium phase transitions to quantum trajectories and tensor-network techniques, we extend them to non-equilibrium phase transitions in dissipative many-body systems. We analyse in detail a model of spins-1/2 on a lattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of them coupled to an independent environment which induces incoherent spin flips. In the steady-state phase diagram derived from our cluster approach, the location of the phase boundaries and even its topology radically change, as compared to the single-site mean field where correlations are absent. Furthermore a stability analysis of the cluster mean-field indicates a susceptibility towards a possible incommensurate ordering, not present if short-range correlations are ignored.

abstract: We introduce a method which enables to directly compare the impact of elastic strain on the optical properties of distinct quantum dots (QDs). Specifically, the QDs are integrated in a cross-section of a semiconductor core wire which is surrounded by an amorphous straining shell. Detailed numerical simulations show that, thanks to the mechanical isotropy of the shell, the strain field in a core section is homogeneous. Furthermore, we use the core material as an in situ strain gauge, yielding reliable values for the emitter energy tuning slope. This calibration technique is applied to self-assembled InAs QDs submitted to incremental tensile strain along their growth axis. In contrast to recent studies conducted on similar QDs stressed perpendicularly to their growth axis, optical spectroscopy reveals 5-10 times larger tuning slopes, with a moderate dispersion. These results highlight the importance of the stress direction to optimise QD response to applied strain, with implications both in static and dynamic regimes. As such, they are in particular relevant for the development of wavelength-tunable single photon sources or hybrid QD opto-mechanical systems.
