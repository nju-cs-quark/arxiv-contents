abstract: A first order fundamental form of the Schrodinger equation was proposed in [1] and the step potential problem was analyzed. In this article we study the problem of a spin up particle incident on a finite potential barrier. We derive the transmission and reflection coefficients and show that in this case as well, the sum of the coefficients of spin up and down electrons yields the quantum mechanical results. Furthermore, we consider the symmetric potential well and show that the quantum mechanical expression for the quantized energy levels of a particle is obtained with periodic boundary conditions.

abstract: Conditions to generate high-purity entangled vacuum-evacuated coherent states ($|0>|\alpha>^0 - |-\alpha>^0 |0>$ were studied for two cascade-placed beam splitters, with one squeezed state input and two coherent state inputs whenever a single photon is detected. Controlling the amplitudes and the phases of the beams allows for various amplitudes of the vacuum-evacuated coherent states ($|\alpha>^ 0 = |\alpha> -e^{-|\alpha|^2} |0> $) up to $\alpha = 2.160$ to be manipulated with high-purity.

abstract: We present a versatile inequality of uncertainty relations which are useful when one approximates an observable and/or estimates a physical parameter based on the measurement of another observable. It is shown that the optimal choice for proxy functions used for the approximation is given by Aharonov's weak value, which also determines the classical Fisher information in parameter estimation, turning our inequality into the genuine Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality. Since the standard form of the uncertainty relation arises as a special case of our inequality, and since the parameter estimation is available as well, our inequality can treat both the position-momentum and the time-energy relations in one framework albeit handled differently.

abstract: Catalytic coherence transformations allow the otherwise impossible state transformations using only incoherent operations with the aid of an auxiliary system with finite coherence which is not being consumed in anyway. Here we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic and stochastic catalytic coherence transformations between pair of pure quantum states. In particular, we show that the simultaneous decrease of a family of R\'enyi entropies of the diagonal parts of the states under consideration are necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic catalytic coherence transformations. Similarly, for stochastic catalytic coherence transformations we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving higher optimal probability of conversion. We, thus, completely characterize the coherence transformations amongst pure quantum states under incoherent operations. We give numerous examples to elaborate our results. We also explore the possibility of the same system acting as a catalyst for itself and find that indeed {\it self catalysis} is possible. Further, for the cases where no catalytic coherence transformation is possible we provide entanglement assisted coherence transformations and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for such transformations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.08092
abstract: It has been argued that it is incompatible to maintain unitary time-evolution for time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians when the metric operator is explicitly time-dependent. We demonstrate here that the time-dependent Dyson equation and the time-dependent quasi-Hermiticity relation can be solved consistently in such a scenario for a time-dependent Dyson map and time-dependent metric operator, respectively. These solutions are obtained at the cost of rendering the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to be a non-observable operator as it ceases to be quasi-Hermitian when the metric becomes time-dependent.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.08104
abstract: The work is organized in two main topics. At first we will outline the relation between spin squeezing, quantum metrology and entanglement detection, with a particular focus on the last. We will derive spin squeezing criteria for the detection of entanglement and its depth that outperform past approaches, especially for unpolarized states, recently produced in experiments and object of increasing interest in the community. Furthermore, we will extend the original definition of spin squeezed states by providing a new parameter that is thought to embrace different classes of states in a unified framework. Afterwards we consider a test of quantum principles in macroscopic objects originally designed by Leggett and Garg. In this case the scenario consists of a single party that is probed at different time instants and the quantum effect detected is the violation of Macrorealism (MR), due to strong correlations in time, rather than in space, between non-compatible observables. We will look at the problems of inconclusiveness of the LG tests arising from possible explanations of the results in terms of ``clumsy'' measurements, what has been termed ``clumsiness loophole''. We propose first a scheme to test and possibly falsify (MR) in macroscopic ensembles of cold atoms based on alternating Quantum Non-Demolition measurements and coherent, magnetically-driven collective spin rotations. Then we also propose a way to address the clumsiness loophole by introducing and computing an invasivity quantifier to add to the original LG expression. We provide numerical evidence that such a clumsiness-free test is feasible under state-of-the-art realistic experimental parameters and imperfections.

abstract: Developments in photonic chips have spurred photon based classical and quantum information processing, attributing to the high stability and scalability of integrated photonic devices [1, 2]. Optical nonlinearity [3] is indispensable in these complex photonic circuits, because it allows for classical and quantum light sources, all-optical switch, modulation, and non-reciprocity in ambient environments. It is commonly known that nonlinear interactions are often greatly enhanced in the microcavities [4]. However, the manifestations of coherent photon-photon interaction in a cavity, analogous to the electromagnetically induced transparency [5], have never been reported on an integrated platform. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the coherent photon-photon interaction induced by second order optical nonlinearity (\chi^{(2)} ) on an aluminum nitride photonic chip. The non-reciprocal nonlinear optic induced transparency is demonstrated as a result of the coherent interference between photons with different colors: ones in the visible wavelength band and ones in the telecom wavelength band. Furthermore, a wide-band frequency conversion with an almost unit internal (0.14 external) efficiency and a bandwidth up to 0.76\,\mathrm{GHz} is demonstrated.

abstract: A method is discussed to analyze the dynamics of a dissipative quantum system. The method hinges upon the definition of an alternative (time-dependent) product among the observables of the system. In the long time limit this yields a contracted algebra. This contraction irreversibly affects some of the quantum features of the dissipative system.

abstract: A unifying principle explaining the numerical bounds of quantum correlations remains elusive despite the efforts devoted to identify it. Here we show that these bounds are indeed not exclusive to quantum theory: for any abstract correlation scenario with compatible measurements, a suited classical wave theory produces probability distributions indistinguishable from those of quantum theory, and therefore share the same bounds. We demonstrate this finding by implementing classical microwaves propagating along meter-size transmission-line circuits and reproduce the probabilities of three emblematic quantum experiments. Our results show that what distinguishes quantum theory is not the set of numerical bounds, but the fact that it is produced without the resources used by classical systems. The implications of this observation are discussed.

abstract: Boson Sampling represents a promising witness of the supremacy of quantum systems as a resource for the solution of computational problems. The classical hardness of Boson Sampling has been related to the so called Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture and has been extended to some generalizations such as scattershot Boson Sampling, approximate and lossy sampling under some reasonable constraints. However, it is still unclear how demanding these bounds are for a quantum experimental sampler. Starting from a state of the art analysis and focusing on the foreseeable practical conditions needed to reach quantum supremacy, we look at different techniques and present a more general and effective solution. We apply our approach to both the experimental suggestions presented to date and we eventually find in both cases a new threshold that is less error sensitive and experimentally more feasible.

abstract: Harvesting of sunlight underpins Life on Earth as well as driving novel energy device design. Though several experiments suggest that excitation energy transport and charge separation within a photosynthetic membrane may benefit from the quantum nature of their dynamics, the effects of spatial coherences in the incident light have been largely ignored. Here we show that spatial correlations in the incident light likely play an important role in trapping light and adding robustness, as well as providing a driving mechanism for an organism's adaptation toward more ordered structures. Our theory is grounded by empirical inputs, while its output is validated against testable predictions. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal correlations between photons, a fundamental property of the quantum world, should play a key role in our understanding of early Life and in improving the design of artificial photosynthetic systems.

abstract: Ultrafast laser pulses have been used to manipulate complex quantum materials and to induce dynamical phase transitions. One of the most striking examples is the transient enhancement of superconductivity in several classes of materials upon irradiating them with high intensity pulses of terahertz light. Motivated by these experiments we analyze the Cooper pairing instabilities in non-equilibrium electron-phonon systems. We demonstrate that the light induced non-equilibrium state of phonons results in the following phenomena: an increase in the time averaged superconducting coupling constant, its periodic modulation, and an increase in the electron scattering. While the first two enhance Cooper pairing, the third one suppresses it. We analyze the competition between these effects and show that in a broad range of parameters the dynamic enhancement of pair formation dominates over the increase in the scattering rate. This opens the possibility of transient light induced superconductivity at temperatures that are considerably higher than the equilibrium transition temperatures. Our results pave new pathways for engineering high-temperature light-induced superconducting states.

abstract: A pure quantum state is called $k$-uniform if all its reductions to $k$-qudit are maximally mixed. We investigate the general constructions of $k$-uniform pure quantum states of $n$ subsystems with $d$ levels. We provide one construction via symmetric matrices and the second one through classical error-correcting codes. There are three main results arising from our constructions. Firstly, we show that for any given even $n\ge 2$, there always exists an $n/2$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state of level $p$ for sufficiently large prime $p$. Secondly, both constructions show that their exist $k$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum states such that $k$ is proportional to $n$, i.e., $k=\Omega(n)$ although the construction from symmetric matrices outperforms the one by error-correcting codes. Thirdly, our symmetric matrix construction provides a positive answer to the open question in \cite{DA} on whether there exists $3$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum state for all $n\ge 8$. In fact, we can further prove that, for every $k$, there exists a constant $M_k$ such that there exists a $k$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state for all $n\ge M_k$. In addition, by using concatenation of algebraic geometry codes, we give an explicit construction of $k$-uniform quantum state when $k$ tends to infinity.

abstract: Quantum tensor network states and more particularly projected entangled-pair states provide a natural framework for representing ground states of gapped, topologically ordered systems. The defining feature of these representations is that topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying tensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a systematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates entanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of fusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a C*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central idempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected entangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such as topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be extracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are acting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson loops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the possibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group fixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of discrete gauge theories and string-net models.

abstract: Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide intriguing new platforms to explore novel quantum physics beyond natural conditions of solids. Recent experiments demonstrated the one-dimensional (1D) SO coupling for boson and fermion gases. However, realization of 2D SO interaction, a much more important task, remains very challenging. Here we propose and experimentally realize, for the first time, 2D SO coupling and topological band with $^{87}$Rb degenerate gas through a minimal optical Raman lattice scheme, without relying on phase locking or fine tuning of optical potentials. A controllable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO effects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the atomic cloud distribution and spin texture in the momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including the highly-sought-after topological superfluid phases.
