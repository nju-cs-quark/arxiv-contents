abstract: The Schr\"odinger theory of electrons in an external electromagnetic field can be described from the perspective of the individual electron via the `Quantal Newtonian' laws (or differential virial theorems). These laws are in terms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantal expectations of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the wave function. The laws reveal the following physics: (a) In addition to the external field, each electron experiences an internal field whose components are representative of a specific property of the system such as the correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion, the electron density, kinetic effects, and an internal magnetic field component. (The response of the electron is described by the current density field.); (b) The scalar potential energy of an electron is the work done in a conservative field which is the sum of the internal and Lorentz fields. It is thus inherently related to the properties of the system. Its constituent property-related components are hence known. It is a known functional of the wave function; (c) As such the Hamiltonian is a functional of the wave function, thereby revealing the intrinsic self-consistent nature of the Schr\"odinger equation. This then provides a path for the determination of the exact wave function. (d) With the Schr\"odinger equation written in self-consistent form, the Hamiltonian now admits via the Lorentz field a new term that explicitly involves the external magnetic field. The new understandings are explicated for the stationary state case by application to a quantum dot in a magnetostatic field in both a ground and excited state. For the time-dependent case, the same states of the quantum dot in both a magnetostatic and a time-dependent electric field are considered.

abstract: We investigate the thermal entanglement characteristics of three dipole-coupled two-level atoms arranged in two different configurations - in a line with nearest neighbour coupling and in a closed loop with each atom interacting with both its neighbours. It is observed that in loop configuration, any one of the three atoms is indeed entangled with the other two atoms in the system, which are not mutually entangled, and further that this feature is specific to only the loop configuration, which is markedly absent in the line configuration. A detailed study of the quantum correlations demonstrated how these can be tuned by varying the temperature and the dipole dipole coupling strength, in both the configurations.

abstract: Superconducting flux qubits are a promising candidate for realizing quantum information processing and quantum simulations. Such devices behave like artificial atoms, with the advantage that one can easily tune the "atoms" internal properties. Here, by harnessing this flexibility, we propose a technique to minimize the inhomogeneous broadening of a large ensemble of flux qubits by tuning only the external flux. In addition, as an example of many-body physics in such an ensemble, we show how to observe superradiance, and its quadratic scaling with ensemble size, using a tailored microwave control pulse that takes advantage of the inhomogeneous broadening itself to excite only a sub-ensemble of the qubits. Our scheme opens up an approach to using superconducting circuits to explore the properties of quantum many-body systems.

abstract: A number of recent works employ bilinear Hamiltonian interactions between Linear Quantum Stochastic Systems (LQSSs). Contrary to naturally occurring Hamiltonian interactions between physical systems, such interactions must be engineered. In this work, we propose a simple model for the implementation of an arbitrary bilinear interaction between two given LQSSs via a feedback interconnection.

abstract: Protocols for testing or exploiting quantum correlations-such as entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering- generally assume a common reference frame between two parties. Establishing such a frame is resource-intensive, and can be technically demanding for distant parties. While Bell nonlocality can be demonstrated with high probability for a large class of two-qubit entangled states when the parties have one or no shared reference direction, the degree of observed nonlocality is measurement-orientation dependent and can be arbitrarily small. In contrast, we theoretically prove that steering can be demonstrated with 100% probability, for a larger class of states, in a rotationally-invariant manner, and experimentally demonstrate rotationally-invariant steering in a variety of cases. We also show, by comparing with the steering inequality of Cavalcanti et al. [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 32, A74 (2015)], that the steering inequality we derive is the optimal rotationally invariant one for the case of two settings per side and two-qubit states having maximally mixed reduced (local) states.

abstract: Random numbers are used in a broad spectrum of scientific researches and industrial applications ranging from physics foundation tests to information encryption. In particular, nonlocality tests provide a strong evidence to our current understanding of the nature --- quantum mechanics. All the random number generators used for the existing tests are constructed locally, which are essentially based on quantum mechanics principles. Using quantum random numbers to test quantum mechanics may introduce a loophole to these foundation tests, which is called randomness loophole or freedom-of-choice loophole. Here, we report an experimental realization of random number generation based on the arrival time of photons from a number of cosmic sources. The measurement outcomes (raw data) pass the standard NIST statistical test suite. Furthermore, we design a scheme to use these RNGs in Bell's inequality tests, which shall address the randomness loophole.

abstract: In quantum information processing, one often considers inserting a barrier into a box containing a particle to generate one bit of Shannon entropy. We formulate this problem as a one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a time-dependent $\delta$-function potential. It is a natural generalization of the particle in a box, a canonical example of quantum mechanics, and we present analytic and numerical investigations on this problem. After deriving an exact Volterra-type integral equation, composed of an infinite sum of modes, we show that approximate formulas with the lowest-frequency modes correctly capture the qualitative behavior of the wave function. If we take into account hundreds of modes, our numerical calculation shows that the quantum adiabatic theorem actually gives a very good approximation even if the barrier height diverges within finite time, as long as it is sufficiently longer than the characteristic time scale of the particle. In particular, if the barrier is slowly inserted at an asymmetric position, the particle is localized by the insertion itself, in accordance with a prediction of the adiabatic theorem. On the other hand, when the barrier is inserted quickly, the wave function becomes rugged after the insertion because of the energy transfer to the particle. Regardless of the position of the barrier, the fast insertion leaves the particle unlocalized so that we can obtain meaningful information by a which-side measurement. Our numerical procedure provides a precise way to calculate the wave function throughout the process, from which one can estimate the amount of this information for an arbitrary insertion protocol.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of a four-electron four-quantum-dot system based on molecular orbital methods, which hosts a pair of singlet-triplet spin qubits. We explicitly take into account of the admixture of electron wave functions in all dots, and have found that this mixing of wave functions has consequences on the energy spectrum, exchange interaction and the gate crosstalk of the system. Specifically, we have found that when the two singlet-triplet qubits are close enough, some of the states are no longer dominated by the computational basis states and the exchange interaction can not be understood as the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states. Using the Hund-Mulliken calculation of the Hubbard parameters, we characterize the effective exchange interaction of the system and have found good agreement with results found by taking energy differences where applicable. We also investigate the gate crosstalk in the system due to the quantum mechanical mixing of electron states and have found that while this effect is typically very weak, it should not be ignored if the spacing between the qubits are similar to or less than the distance between the double dots that constitute the qubit.

abstract: A major obstacle to attain the fundamental precision limit of the phase estimation in an interferometry is the identification and implementation of the optimal measurement. Here we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by the use of three conventional measurements among interferometers with Bayesian estimation techniques. Conditions that hold for the precision limit to be attained with these measurements are obtained by explicitly calculating the Fisher information. Remarkably, these conditions are naturally satisfied in most interferometric experiments. We apply our results to an experiment of atomic spectroscopy and examine robustness of phase sensitivity for the two-axis counter-twisted state suffering from detection noise.

abstract: Using the tool of concatenated stabilizer coding, we prove that the complexity class QMA remains unchanged even if every witness qubit is disturbed by constant noise. This result may not only be relevant for physical implementations of verifying protocols but also attacking the relationship between the complexity classes QMA, QCMA and BQP, which can be reformulated in this unified framework of a verifying protocol receiving a disturbed witness. While QCMA and BQP are described by fully dephasing and depolarizing channels on the witness qubits, respectively, our result proves QMA to be robust against 27% dephasing and 18% depolarizing noise.

abstract: The strong subadditivity inequality of von Neumann entropy relates the entropy of subsystems of a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ to that of the composite system. Here, we define $\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\rho_{ABC})$ as the extent to which $\rho_{ABC}$ fails to satisfy the strong subadditivity inequality $S(\rho_{B})+S(\rho_{C}) \le S(\rho_{AB})+S(\rho_{AC})$ with equality and investigate its properties. In particular, by introducing auxiliary subsystem $E$, we consider any purification $\ket{\psi_{ABCE}}$ of $\rho_{ABC}$ and formulate $\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\rho_{ABC})$ as the extent to which the bipartite quantum correlations of $\rho_{AB}$ and $\rho_{AC}$, measured by entanglement of formation and quantum discord, change under the transformation $B\rightarrow BE$ and $C\rightarrow CE$. Invariance of quantum correlations of $\rho_{AB}$ and $\rho_{AC}$ under such transformation is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for vanishing $\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\rho_{ABC})$. Our approach allows one to characterize, intuitively, the structure of states for which the strong subadditivity is saturated. Moreover, along with providing a conservation law for quantum correlations of states for which the strong subadditivity inequality is satisfied with equality, we find that such states coincides with those that the Koashi-Winter monogamy relation is saturated.

Our protocols consider a pair of ultrastrong coupled qubit-cavity systems, each coupled to an ancilla qubit, and combine classical pulses plus the selection rules imposed by the parity symmetry. We study the robustness of the entangling protocols under dissipative effects. This proposal may have applications within state-of-art circuit quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: History dependent discrete time quantum walks (QWs) are often studied for their lattice traversal properties. A particular model, which we call the $\textit{site-history quantum walk}$ (SHQW), uses the state of a memory qubit at each site to record visits and to control the dynamics of the walk. We generalize this model to the $\textit{neighborhood-history quantum walk}$ (NHQW), in which the walk dynamics and the state of the memory qubits in a $\textit{neighborhood}$ of the particle's position are interdependent. To demonstrate it, we construct an NHQW on a one-dimensional lattice, with a simple neighborhood. Several dynamically interesting history dependent QWs, including the SHQW, can be realized as single-particle sectors of quantum lattice gas automata (QLGA). In contrast, the NHQW constructed in this paper is realized as a single-particle sector of the more general quantum cellular automaton (QCA). The complexity of the NHQW dynamics presents a promising avenue toward richer walk strategies.

abstract: Sequences of compatible quantum measurements can be contextual and any simulation with a classical model accounting for the quantum observations, needs to use some internal memory. In Ref. [New J. Phys. 13, 113011 (2011)], it was shown that simulating the sequences of compatible observables from the Peres-Mermin scenario requires at least three different memory states in order to be not in contradiction with the deterministic predictions of quantum theory. We extend this analysis to the probabilistic quantum predictions and ask how much memory is required to simulate the quantum correlations generated by any quantum state. We find, that even in this comprehensive approach only three internal states are required for the perfect simulation of the quantum correlations in the Peres-Mermin scenario.

The perturbation theory series is summed with the help of Borel transformation and conformal mapping of the Borel variable. Convergence of approximate energy eigenvalues and their agreement with corresponding existing results are observed for external fields up to n^3 H ~ 5. The possibility of restoring the asymptotic behaviour of energy levels using perturbation theory coefficients is also discussed.

abstract: We build a holographic model for the pairing fluctuation pseudogap phase in fermionic high temperature superconductivity/superfluidity based on the BCS-BEC crossover scenario. The pseudogap originates from incoherent Cooper pairing and has been observed in recent cold atom experiments. The strength of Cooper pairing and hence the BCS-BEC crossover is controlled by an effective 4-Fermi interaction and we argue that the double-trace deformation for charged scalar operator is a close analog in large N field theories. We employ the double-trace deformed Abelian Higgs model of holographic superconductors and propose that the incoherent fluctuations of the charged scalar in the bulk is the holographic dual of the fluctuating Cooper pairs. Using a Madelung transformation and the velocity-potential formalism, we develop a quantum fluid dynamics as an effective theory for these bulk fluctuations. The new fluid dynamics takes care of the boundary conditions required by AdS/CFT and encodes the vacuum polarization effect in curved spacetime. The pseudogap in conductivity can be related to the plasma oscillation of this bulk fluid.

abstract: The techniques of distance verification known for general linear codes are re-applied to quantum stabilizer codes. Then distance verification is addressed for classical and quantum LDPC codes. New complexity bounds for distance verification with provable performance are derived using the average weight spectra of the ensembles of LDPC codes. These bounds are expressed in terms of the erasure-correcting capacity of the corresponding ensemble. We also present a new irreducible-cluster technique that can be applied to any LDPC code and takes advantage of parity-checks' sparsity for both classical and quantum LDPC codes. This technique reduces complexity exponents of all existing deterministic techniques designed for generic stabilizer codes with small relative distances, which also include all known families of quantum LDPC codes.

abstract: We study a thermally isolated quantum many-body system with an external control represented by a time-dependent parameter. By formulating a thermal pure state path integral, we derive an effective action for trajectories in a thermodynamic state space, where the entropy appears with its conjugate variable. In particular, when operations are quasi-static, the symmetry for the uniform translation of the conjugate variable emerges in the path integral. This leads to the entropy as a Noether invariant.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1611.07333
abstract: We discuss the method for the measurement of the gravity acceleration g by means of Bloch oscillations of an accelerated BEC in an optical lattice. This method has a theoretical critical point due to the fact that the period of the Bloch oscillations depends, in principle, on the initial shape of the BEC wavepacket. Here, by making use of the nearest-neighbor model for the numerical analysis of the BEC wavefunction, we show that in real experiments the period of the Bloch oscillations does not really depend on the shape of the initial wavepacket and that the relative uncertainty, due to the fact that the initial shape of the wavepacket may be asymmetrical, is smaller than the one due to experimental errors. Furthermore, we also show that the relation between the oscillation period and the scattering length of the BEC's atoms is linear; this fact suggest us a new experimental procedure for the measurement of the scattering length of atoms.

Here we present a design of a laser consisting of multiple Cooper-pair transistors coupled to a microwave resonator. Over a broad range of experimentally realizable parameters, this laser creates photon-number squeezed microwave radiation, characterized by a Fano factor $F \ll 1$, at a very high resonator photon number. We investigate the impact of gate-charge disorder in a Cooper-pair transistor and show that the system can create squeezed strong microwave fields even in the presence of maximum disorder.
