abstract: Optimal control theory has been employed to populate separately two dark states of the acetylene polyad $N_s=1$, $N_r=5$ by indirect coupling via the ground state. Relevant level energies and transition dipole moments are extracted from the experimental literature. The optimal pulses are rather simple. The evolution of the populations is shown for the duration of the control process and also for the field free-evolution that follows the control. One of the dark states appears to be a potential target for realistic experimental investigation because the average population of the Rabi oscillation remains high and decoherence is expected to be weak.

abstract: We study the fidelity of single qubit quantum gates performed with two-frequency laser fields that have a Gaussian or super Gaussian spatial mode. Numerical simulations are used to account for imperfections arising from atomic motion in an optical trap, spatially varying Stark shifts of the trapping and control beams, and transverse and axial misalignment of the control beams. Numerical results that account for the three dimensional distribution of control light show that a super Gaussian mode with intensity $I\sim e^{-2(r/w_0)^n}$ provides reduced sensitivity to atomic motion and beam misalignment. Choosing a super Gaussian with $n=6$ the decay time of finite temperature Rabi oscillations can be increased by a factor of 60 compared to an $n=2$ Gaussian beam, while reducing crosstalk to neighboring qubit sites.

abstract: Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that combines encoding with energy penalties and decoding to suppress and correct errors that degrade the performance of quantum annealers in solving optimization problems. While QAC has been experimentally demonstrated to successfully error-correct a range of optimization problems, a clear understanding of its operating mechanism has been lacking. Here we bridge this gap using tools from quantum statistical mechanics. We study analytically tractable models using a mean-field analysis, specifically the $p$-body ferromagnetic infinite-range transverse-field Ising model as well as the quantum Hopfield model, in the zero temperature limit. We demonstrate that for $p=2$, where the quantum phase transition is of second order, QAC pushes the phase transition to infinite transverse field strength. For $p\ge3$, where the quantum phase transition is of first order, QAC softens the closing of the gap for small energy penalty values and prevents its closure for sufficiently large energy penalty values. Thus QAC provides protection from excitations that occur near the quantum critical point.

abstract: We address precision of optical interferometers fed by Gaussian states and involving passive and/or active elements, such as beam splitters, photodetectors and optical parametric amplifiers. We first address the ultimate bounds to precision by discussing the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information. We then consider photodetection at the output and calculate the sensitivity of the interferometers taking into account the non unit quantum efficiency of the detectors. Our results show that in the ideal case of photon number detectors with unit quantum efficiency the best configuration is the symmetric one, namely, passive (active) interferometer with passive (active) detection stage: in this case one may achieve Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity by suitably optimizing over Gaussian states at the input. On the other hand, in the realistic case of detectors with non unit quantum efficiency, the performances of passive scheme are unavoidably degraded, whereas detectors involving optical parametric amplifiers allow to fully compensate the presence of loss in the detection stage, thus restoring the Heisenberg scaling.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of a localized spin-$\frac{1}{2} $ Particle interacting with an absorbing environment is investigated. The quantum Langevin-Schr\"odinger equation for spin-$\frac{1}{2} $ is obtained. The susceptibility function of the environment is calculated in terms of the coupling function of the spin and the environment. it is shown that the susceptibility function satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations. Spontaneous emission and the shift frequency of the spin is obtained in terms of the imaginary part of the susceptibility function in frequency domain. Some transition probabilities between the spin states are calculated when the absorbing environment is in the thermal state.

abstract: We show that the stability theorem of the depolarizing channel holds for the output quantum $p$-R\'enyi entropy for $p \ge 2$ or $p=1$, which is an extension of the well known case $p=2$. As an application, we present a protocol in which Bob determines whether Alice prepares a pure quantum state close to a product state. In the protocol, Alice transmits to Bob multiple copies of a pure state through a depolarizing channel, and Bob estimates its output quantum $p$-R\'enyi entropy. By using our stability theorem, we show that Bob can determine whether her preparation is appropriate.

abstract: There are very few systems of interacting particles (with continuous variables) for which the entanglement of the concomitant eigenfunctions can be computed in an exact, analytical way. Here we present analytical calculations of the amount of entanglement exhibited by $s$-states of \emph{spherium}. This is a system of two particles (electrons) interacting via a Coulomb potential and confined to a $(d-1)$-sphere (that is, to the surface of a $d$-dimensional ball). We investigate the dependence of entanglement on the radius $R$ of the system, on the spatial dimensionality $d$, and on energy. We find that entanglement increases monotonically with $R$, decreases with $d$, and also tends to increase with the energy of the eigenstates. These trends are discussed and compared with those observed in other two-electron atomic-like models where entanglement has been investigated.

abstract: Span program is a linear-algebraic model of computation which can be used to design quantum algorithms. For any Boolean function there exists a span program that leads to a quantum algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity. In general, finding such span programs is not an easy task. In this work, given a query access to the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we provide two new span-program-based quantum algorithms: an algorithm for testing if the graph is bipartite that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries; an algorithm for testing if the graph is connected that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.07845
abstract: We test variational quantum dynamics with the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) against exact solutions for the dynamics of two attractive bosons following trap release. MCTDHB produces unphysical and qualitatively incorrect results of breathing dynamics where ballistic expansion should occur, although an analysis of participating mode functions indicates that the numerical result should be converged. Further analysis reveals that the calculations are indeed unconverged due to an unphysical coupling of the center-of-mass and relative motion at diverging length scales. Our results indicate that convergence of the MCTDHB expansion cannot be practically achieved in the presence of incongruent length scales for center-of-mass and relative motion, as is typically the case for untrapped attractive bosons.

abstract: We investigate quantumness of spin-1 states, defined as the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the convex hull of spin coherent states. We derive its analytic expression in the case of pure states as a function of the smallest eigenvalue of the Bloch matrix and give explicitly the closest classical state for an arbitrary pure state. Numerical evidence is provided that the exact formula for pure states provides an upper bound on the quantumness of mixed states. Due to the connection between quantumness and entanglement we obtain new insights into the geometry of symmetric entangled states.

abstract: It is shown that adiabatic cycles excite a quantum particle, which is confined in a one-dimensional region and is initially in an eigenstate. During the cycle, a $\delta$-wall is applied and varied its strength and position. After the completion of the cycle, the state of the particle arrives another eigenstate. It is also shown that an arbitrary pair of eigenstates can be connected through a combination of adiabatic cycles. A detailed argument is provided for the case that the particle is confined by an infinite square well. This is an example of exotic quantum holonomy in Hamiltonian systems.

abstract: Highly integrated single photon sources are key components in future quantum-optical circuits. Whereas the probabilistic generation of single photons can routinely be done by now, their triggered generation is a much greater challenge. Here, we describe the triggered generation of single photons in a hybrid plasmonic device. It consists of a lambda-type quantum emitter coupled to a multimode optical nanoantenna. For moderate interaction strengths between the subsystems, the description of the quantum optical evolution can be simplified by an adiabatic elimination of the electromagnetic fields of the nanoantenna modes. This leads to an insightful analysis of the emitter's dynamics, entails the opportunity to understand the physics of the device, and to identify parameter regimes for a desired operation. Even though the approach presented in this work is general, we consider a simple exemplary design of a plasmonic nanoantenna, made of two silver nanorods, suitable for triggered generation of single photons.

abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) hypothesis identifies the relevant time scales in out-of-equilibrium dynamics of critical systems employing concepts valid at equilibrium: It predicts the scaling of the defect formation immediately after quenches across classical and quantum phase transitions as a function of the quench speed. Here we study the crossover between the scaling dictated by a slow quench, which is ruled by the critical properties of the quantum phase transition, and the excitations due to a faster quench, where the dynamics is often well described by the classical model. We estimate the value of the quench rate that separates the two regimes and support our argument using numerical simulations of the out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics. For the specific case of a $\phi^4$ model we demonstrate that the two regimes exhibit two different power-law scalings, which are in agreement with the KZ theory when applied to the quantum and to the classical case. This result contributes to extending the prediction power of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism and to provide insight into recent experimental observations in systems of cold atoms and ions.

abstract: This paper presents a new Relativistic Symmetrical Interpretation (RSI) of the Dirac equation in (1+1)D which postulates: quantum mechanics is intrinsically time-symmetric, with no arrow of time; the fundamental objects of quantum mechanics are transitions; a transition is fully described by a complex transition amplitude density with specified initial and final boundary conditions; and transition amplitude densities never collapse. This RSI is compared to the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) for the analysis of Einstein's bubble experiment with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. This RSI can predict the future and retrodict the past, has no zitterbewegung, resolves some inconsistencies of the CI, and eliminates some of the conceptual problems of the CI.

abstract: Propagation of light through dielectrics lies at the heart of optics. However, this ubiquitous process is commonly described using phenomenological dielectric function $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$, i.e. without addressing the quantum graininess of the dielectric matter. Here, we present a theoretical study where we consider a one-dimensional ensemble of atoms in a subwavelength waveguide (nanoguide) as fundamental building blocks of a model dielectric. By exploring the roles of the atom-waveguide coupling efficiency, density, disorder, and dephasing, we establish connections among various features of polaritonic light-matter states such as localization, super and subradiance, and strong coupling. In particular, we show that coherent multiple scattering of light among atoms that are coupled via a single propagating mode can gives rise to Rabi splitting. These results provide important insight into the underlying physics of strong coupling reported by recent room-temperature experiments with microcavities and surface plasmons.

abstract: In this paper we consider the phenomenon of superpositions in quantum mechanics and suggest a way to deal with the idea in a logical setting from a syntactical point of view, that is, as subsumed in the language of the formalism, and not semantically. We restrict the discussion to the propositional level only. Then, after presenting the motivations and a possible world semantics, the formalism is outlined and we also consider within this schema the claim that superpositions may involve contradictions, as in the case of the Schr\"odinger's cat, which (it is usually said) is both alive and dead. We argue that this claim is a misreading of the quantum case. Finally, we sketch a new form of quantum logic that involves three kinds of negations and present the relationships among them. The paper is a first approach to the subject, introducing some main guidelines to be developed by a `syntactical' logical approach to quantum superpositions.

abstract: In the last few years, several criteria to identify Eistein-Podolski-Rosen steering have been proposed and experimentally implemented. On the operational side, however, the evaluation of the steerability degree of a given state has shown to be a difficult task and only a few results are known. In this work, we propose a measure of steering that is based on the maximal violation of well established steering inequalities. Applying this approach to two-qubit states, we managed to derive simple closed formulas for steering in the two- and three-measurement scenarios. Among the options investigated, a measure has been found that correctly satisfies the entanglement-steering-nonlocality hierarchy and reproduces results reported so far.

abstract: We study the spin currents induced by topological screw dislocation and cosmic dispiration. By using the extended Drude model, we find that the spin dependent forces are modified by the nontrivial geometry. For the topological screw dislocation, only the direction of spin current is bended by deforming the spin polarization vector. In contrast, the force induced by cosmic dispiration could affect both the direction and magnitude of the spin current. As a consequence, the spin-Hall conductivity doesn't receive corrections from screw dislocation.

abstract: We extend the generalize conservation law of light propagating in a one-dimensional $\cal PT$-symmetric system, i.e., $|T-1|=\sqrt{R_LR_R}$ for the transmittance $T$ and the reflectance $R_{L,R}$ from the left and right, to a multimode waveguide with either $\cal PT$ or $\cal RT$ symmetry, in which higher dimensional investigations are necessary. These conservation laws exist not only in a matrix form for the transmission and reflection matrices; they also exist in a scalar form for real-valued quantities by defining generalized transmittance and reflectance. We then discuss, for the first time, how a multimode $\cal PT$-symmetric waveguide can be used to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking of the scattering matrix, which typically requires tuning the non-hermiticity of the system (i.e. the strength of gain and loss). Here the advantage of using a multimode waveguide is the elimination of tuning any system parameters: the transverse mode order $m$ plays the role of the symmetry breaking parameter, and one observes the symmetry breaking by simply performing scattering experiment in each waveguide channel at a single frequency and fixed strength of gain and loss.

abstract: We describe the Quantum Test of the Equivalence principle and Space Time (QTEST), a concept for an atom interferometry mission on the International Space Station (ISS). The primary science objective of the mission is a test of Einstein's equivalence principle with two rubidium isotope gases at a precision of better than 10$^{-15}$. Distinct from the classical tests is the use of quantum wave packets and their expected large spatial separation in the QTEST experiment. This dual species atom interferometer experiment will also be sensitive to time-dependent equivalence principle violations that would be signatures for ultralight dark-matter particles. In addition, QTEST will be able to perform photon recoil measurements to better than 10$^{-11}$ precision. This improves upon terrestrial experiments by a factor of 100, enabling an accurate test of the standard model of particle physics and contributing to mass measurement, in the proposed new international system of units (SI), with significantly improved precision. The predicted high measurement precision of QTEST comes from the microgravity environment on ISS, offering extended free fall times in a well-controlled environment. Suppression of systematic errors by use of symmetric interferometer configurations and rejection of common-mode errors drives the QTEST design. It uses Bragg interferometry with a single laser beam at the "magic" wavelength, where the two isotopes have the same polarizability, for mitigating sensitivities to vibrations and laser noise, imaging detection for correcting cloud initial conditions and maintaining contrast, modulation of the atomic hyperfine states for reduced sensitivity to magnetic field gradients, two source regions for simultaneous time reversal measurements and redundancy, and modulation of the gravity vector using a rotating platform to reduce otherwise difficult systematics to below 10$^{-16}$.

abstract: We propose a new framework combining weak measurement and second-order correlated technique. The theoretical analysis shows that WVA experiment can also be implemented by a second-order correlated system. We then build two-dimensional second-order correlated function patterns for achieving higher amplification factor and discuss the signal-to-noise ratio influence. Several advantages can be obtained by our proposal. For instance, detectors with high resolution are not necessary. Moreover, detectors with low saturation intensity are available in WVA setup. Finally, type-one technical noise can be effectively suppressed.

abstract: We show that the bipartite logarithmic entanglement negativity (EN) of quantum spin models obeys an area law at all nonzero temperatures. We develop numerical linked cluster (NLC) expansions for the `area-law' logarithmic entanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters. For one-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC results are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse-field Ising models. In all cases, we find a sudden onset (or sudden death) of negativity at a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset (or sudden death). The onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical finite-temperature phase transitions, supporting the argument for absence of any role of quantum mechanics at such transitions. On approach to a quantum critical point at $T=0$, negativity shows critical scaling in size and temperature.
