**1.    Signatures of attractive and repulsive interactions on quantum correlations in the Hubbard Model**  
Andrea Beggi, Luca Razzoli, Paolo Bordone  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.07513  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics and the entanglement between two interacting identical bosons performing a quantum walk on a 1D lattice. The system is described by the Hubbard model, and the interaction among the particles can be either attractive or repulsive. We show that there are clear signatures - both in the evolution and in the correlations - that allow a distinction between the two cases, and we demonstrate that these features result to be intimately connected with the bandstructure and the eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian.

**2.    Creating cat states in one-dimensional quantum walks using delocalized initial states**  
Wei-Wei Zhang, Sandeep K. Goyal, Fei Gao, Barry C. Sanders, Christoph Simon  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.07539  
<blockquote>
<p>
Cat states are coherent quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct states, and are useful for understanding the boundary between the classical and the quantum world. Due to their macroscopic nature, cat states are difficult to prepare in physical systems. We propose a method to realize the cat states in one-dimensional quantum walks using delocalized initial states of the walker. We show that the linear dispersion relation of the effective quantum walk Hamiltonian, which governs the dynamics of the delocalized states, is responsible for the formation of the cat states. We analyze the robustness of these states against the environmental interactions. We present methods to control and manipulate the cat states in the photonic implementation of quantum walks.

**3.    Generation of a coherent electronic spin cluster in diamond**  
Helena S. Knowles, Dhiren M. Kara, Mete Atat√ºre  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.07552  
<blockquote>
<p>
An obstacle for spin-based quantum sensors is magnetic noise due to proximal spins. However, such a spin cluster surrounding the sensor can become an asset, if it can be controlled. Here, we polarize and readout a cluster of three nitrogen (N) electron spins coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin in diamond. We further achieve sub-nm localization of the cluster spins. Finally, we demonstrate coherent spin exchange between the species by simultaneous dressing of the NV and the N states. These results establish the feasibility of environment-assisted sensing and quantum simulations with diamond spins.

**4.    Fault-tolerant and finite-error localization for point emitters within the diffraction limit**  
Tang Zong Sheng, Kadir Durak, Alexander Ling  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.07297  
<blockquote>
<p>
We implement an estimator for determining the separation between two incoherent point sources. This estimator relies on image inversion interferometry and when used with the appropriate data analytics, it yields an estimate of the separation with finite-error, even when the sources come arbitrarily close together. The experimental results show that the technique has a good tolerance to noise and misalignment, making it an interesting consideration for high resolution instruments.
