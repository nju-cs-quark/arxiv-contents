abstract: We show that the position operator for a class of $f$-deformed oscillators has a fractal spectrum, homeomorphic to the Cantor set, via a unitary transformation to Harper's model. The class corresponds to a choice of ergodic operators for the deformation function. Hofstadter's butterfly is plotted by direct diagonalization of a position operator with an originally vanishing diagonal. This is equivalent to a one-dimensional hamiltonian without potential.

abstract: Conversion of entangled states under (Stochastic) Local Operations and Classical Communication admits the phenomenon of catalysis. Here we explore the possibility of the initial state to perform as a catalyst , which we call a self-catalytic process. We show explicit examples of self-catalysis. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the phenomenon to take place are discussed. We numerically estimate how frequent it is and we show that increasing the number of copies used as catalyst usually increases the probability of conversion, but do not make the process deterministic. By the end we conjecture that under LOCC and SLOCC, the probability of finding a self-catalytic reaction increases monotonically with the dimensions.

abstract: We study the dynamical Casimir effect in an electromagnetic cavity containing a Kerr medium. Using justified approximations, a closed analytical expression for the time evolution and number operators were obtained. We found that the generation of photons from quantum vacuum is strongly affected by the presence of the Kerr medium, sharing physical features with the case of two two-level atoms in a cavity with oscillating walls. Our analytical results are in good agreement with exact numerical calculations for times shorter than the revival time.

abstract: A negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been recognized as a good solid-state qubit. A system consisting of the electronic spin of the NV center and hyperfine-coupled nitrogen and additionally nearby carbon nuclear spins can form a quantum register of several qubits for quantum information processing or as a node in a quantum repeater. Several beautiful and impressive experiments on the hybrid electron and nuclear spin register have been reported, but fidelities achieved so far are not yet at or below the thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Using quantum optimal control theory based on Krotov method, we show here that fast and high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates in the universal quantum gate set for FTQC, taking into account the effects of the leakage state, nearby noise qubits and distant bath spins, can be achieved with errors less than those required by the threshold theorem of FTQC.

abstract: Since 1984, various optical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and examined. In all of them, the rate of secret key generation decays exponentially with distance. A natural and fundamental question is then whether there are yet-to-be discovered optical QKD protocols (without quantum repeaters) that could circumvent this rate-distance tradeoff. This paper provides a major step towards answering this question. We show that the secret-key-agreement capacity of a lossy and noisy optical channel assisted by unlimited two-way public classical communication is limited by an upper bound that is solely a function of the channel loss, regardless of how much optical power the protocol may use. Our result has major implications for understanding the secret-key-agreement capacity of optical channels---a long-standing open problem in optical quantum information theory---and strongly suggests a real need for quantum repeaters to perform QKD at high rates over long distances.

abstract: The present paper treats the period T_N of the Hadamard walk on a cycle C_N with N vertices. Dukes (2014) considered the periodicity of more general quantum walks on C_N and showed T_2 =2, T_4=8, T_8=24 for the Hadamard walk case. We prove that the Hadamard walk does not have any period except for his case, i.e., N=2, 4, 8. Our method is based on a path counting and cyclotomic polynomials which is different from his approach based on the property of eigenvalues for unitary matrix that determines the evolution of the walk.

abstract: In this paper we show that electron-positron pairs can be pumped inexhaustibly with a constant production rate from the one dimensional potential well with oscillating depth or width. Bound states embedded in the the Dirac sea can be pulled out and pushed to the positive continuum, and become scattering states. Pauli block, which dominant the saturation of pair creation in the static super-critical potential well, can be broken by the ejection of electrons. We find that the width oscillating mode is more efficient that the depth oscillating mode. In the adiabatic limit, pair number as a function of upper boundary of the oscillating, will reveal the diving of the bound states.

As a consequence, we show that any such semigroup satisfies the quantum detailed balance condition with respect to an invariant state if and only if all semigroups generated by each $\mathcal{L}_\omega$ so do with respect to the same invariant state.

abstract: We introduce a density matrix decomposition of a multipartite quantum system of a finite dimension into two density matrices: a separable one and an essentially entangled one, which contains no product states components. This convex decomposition can be achieved in practice with the help of an algorithm based on linear programming, which in the general case scales polynomially with the dimension of the system. We prove that the rank of the essentially entangled component is always lower than that of the initial density matrix and we give an upper bound for this rank. We illustrate the algorithm at an example of a composed system of total dimension 12 undergoing loss of coherence due to classical noise and we trace the time evolution of its essentially entangled component. We suggest a geometric description of entanglement dynamics and show how it explains the well-known phenomena of sudden death and revival of multipartite entanglement. Interestingly, while we observe a weight loss of the essentially entangled component with time, its average entanglement content is not affected by the coherence loss.

abstract: The idea of detecting the entanglement of a given bipartite state by searching for symmetric extensions of this state was first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialeri. The complete family of separability tests it generates, often referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already proved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the efficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we essentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of separable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are, depending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the $k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding one for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased as follows: on $\mathbf{C}^d\otimes\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\sqrt{k})/d$, while random states obtained as partial traces over an environment $\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the $k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$. Both statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed, $k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even though any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed by $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent) value.

The difficulty raised by incompatible sets of observables is overcome within an epistemic enrichment of classical logic that provides the means for distinguishing between the value of a variable and its observation while retaining the classical connectives.

abstract: We establish a connection between non-Markovian memory effects and thermodynamical quantities such as work. We show how memory effects can be interpreted as revivals of work that can be extracted from a quantum system. We prove that non-Markovianity may allow an increase in the extractable work even when the entropy of the system is increasing. Our results have important implications both in quantum thermodynamics and in quantum information theory. In the former context they pave the way to the understanding of concepts like work in a non-Markovian open system scenario. In the latter context they lead to interesting consequences for quantum state merging protocols in presence of noise.

abstract: Weak measurements are supposed to be essential for the so called direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction [Nature (London) 474, 188 (2011)]. Here we show that direct measurement of the wavefunction can be obtained by using measurements of arbitrary strength. In particular, in the case of strong (i.e. projective) measurements, we compared the precision and the accuracy of the two methods, by showing that strong measurements outperform weak measurements in both. We also give the exact expression of the reconstructed wavefunction obtained by the weak measurement approach, allowing to define the range of applicability of such method.

abstract: With improved gate calibrations reducing unitary errors, we achieve a benchmarked single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.95% with superconducting qubits in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We present a method for distinguishing between unitary and non-unitary errors in quantum gates by interleaving repetitions of a target gate within a randomized benchmarking sequence. The benchmarking fidelity decays quadratically with the number of interleaved gates for unitary errors but linearly for non-unitary, allowing us to separate systematic coherent errors from decoherent effects. With this protocol we show that the fidelity of the gates is not limited by unitary errors, but by another drive-activated source of decoherence such as amplitude fluctuations.

abstract: We show how general graph states, an important resource state for multipartite quantum protocols, can be distributed over large distances using intermediate repeater stations. To this aim we describe a one way quantum repeater scheme using encoding in the language of graph states. For a general Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code we do a refined error analysis that allows to correct qubit errors and erasures caused by imperfect preparation, gates, transmission, detection, etc.. We analyze the cost and repeater rate for this general scheme. The concept is exemplified by the 7-qubit Steane code and the quantum Golay code.

abstract: Control of hyperfine interactions is a fundamental requirement for quantum computing architecture schemes based on shallow donors in silicon. However, at present, there is lacking an atomistic approach including critical effects of central-cell corrections and non-static screening of the donor potential capable of describing the hyperfine interaction in the presence of both strain and electric fields in realistically sized devices. We establish and apply a theoretical framework, based on atomistic tight-binding theory, to quantitatively determine the strain and electric field dependent hyperfine couplings of donors. Our method is scalable to millions of atoms, and yet captures the strain effects with an accuracy level of DFT method. Excellent agreement with the available experimental data sets allow reliable investigation of the design space of multi-qubit architectures, based on both strain-only as well as hybrid (strain+field) control of qubits. The benefits of strain are uncovered by demonstrating that a hybrid control of qubits based on (001) compressive strain and in-plane (100 or 010) fields results in higher gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations, for all of the four donor species considered (P, As, Sb, and Bi). The comparison between different donor species in strained environments further highlights the trends of hyperfine shifts, providing predictions where no experimental data exists. Whilst faster gate operations are realisable with in-plane fields for P, As, and Sb donors, only for the Bi donor, our calculations predict faster gate response in the presence of both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, truly benefiting from the proposed planar field control mechanism of the hyperfine interactions.

abstract: The connection between maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in a prime-power dimensional Hilbert space and finite phase-space geometries is well known. In this article we classify MUBs according to their degree of covariance with respect to the natural symmetries of a finite phase-space, which are the group of its affine symplectic transformations. We prove that there exists maximal sets of MUBs that are covariant with respect to the full group only in odd prime-power dimensional spaces, and in this case their equivalence class is actually unique. Despite this limitation, we show that in even-prime power dimension covariance can still be achieved by restricting to proper subgroups of the symplectic group, that constitute the finite analogues of the oscillator group. For these subgroups, we explicitly construct the unitary operators yielding the covariance.

abstract: We take a closer look at the fundamental Casimir-Polder interaction between quantum particles and dispersive dielectric surfaces with surface polariton or plasmon resonances. Linear response theory shows that in the near field, van der Waals, regime the free energy shift of a particle contains a thermal component that depends exclusively on the population/excitation of the evanescent surface polariton/plasmon modes. Our work makes evident the link between particle surface interaction and near field thermal emission and demonstrates how this can be used to engineer Casimir-Polder forces. We also examine how the exotic effects of surface waves are washed out as the distance from the surface increases. In the case of molecules or excited state atoms, far field approximations result in a classical dipole-dipole interaction which depends on the surface reflectivity and the mean number of photons at the frequency of the atomic/molecular transition. Finally we present numerical results for the CP interaction between Cs atoms and various dielectric surfaces with a single polariton resonance and discuss the implications of temperature and retardation effects for specific spectroscopic experiments.

abstract: We study the quantum Hall effect in a monolayer graphene by using an approach based on thermodynamical properties. This can be done by considering a system of Dirac particles in an electromagnetic field and taking into account of the edges effect as a pseudo-potential varying continuously along the $x$ direction. At low temperature and in the weak electric field limit, we explicitly determine the thermodynamical potential. With this, we derive the particle numbers in terms of the quantized flux and therefore the Hall conductivity immediately follows.

abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices allow looking in the quantum realm with an undeniable control, which enabled numerous interdisciplinary discoveries. However, studies of systems trapped in prescribed potentials created by classical laser beams start meeting their boundaries. Here we make a step further, introducing the quantumness of light. We show that novel emergent phases appear not only due to the coupled light-matter dynamics, but even solely due to quantum correlations between them. We suggest mechanisms for imprinting quantum patterns on many-body nonlocal interactions of atoms. Even using single-mode cavities, the patterns are spatially multimode. This induces various types of orders because symmetries are broken and inherited from light. We show that competition between light-field and matter-field coherences leads to novel phases (e.g. delocalized dimers), beyond density-induced orders such as multimode generalizations of density waves and supersolid-like states. Some phases can be protected by an energy gap, thus having topological character.
