abstract: A discussion is given on the interpretation and physical importance of the Minkowski momentum in macroscopic electrodynamics (essential for the Abraham-Minkowski problem). We focus on the following two facets: (1) Adopting a simple dielectric model where the refractive index $n$ is constant, we demonstrate by means of a mapping procedure how the electromagnetic field in a medium can be mapped into a corresponding field in vacuum. This mapping was presented many years ago [I. Brevik and B. Lautrup, Mat. Fys. Medd. Dan. Vid. Selsk {\bf 38}(1), 1 (1970)], but is apparently not well known. A characteristic property of this procedure is that it shows how natural the Minkowski energy-momentum tensor fits into the canonical formalism. Especially the spacelike character of the electromagnetic total four-momentum for a radiation field (implying negative electromagnetic energy in some inertial frames), so strikingly demonstrated in the Cherenkov effect, is worth attention. (2) Our second objective is to give a critical analysis of some recent experiments on electromagnetic momentum. Care must here be taken in the interpretations: it is easy to be misled and conclude that an experiment is important for the energy-momentum problem, while what is demonstrated experimentally is merely the action of the Abraham-Minkowski force acting in surface layers or inhomogeneous regions. The Abraham-Minkowski force is common for the two energy-momentum tensors and carries no information about field momentum. As a final item, we propose an experiment that might show the existence of the Abraham force at high frequencies. This would eventually be a welcome optical analogue to the classic low-frequency 1975 Lahoz-Walker experiment.

abstract: An exact canonical master equation of the Lindblad form has been derived for a central spin interacting uniformly with a sea of completely unpolarized spins. The Kraus operators are also derived and it has been shown that the dynamical map is unital and hence, doubly-stochastic. Then, the complete positivity of the dynamics has been shown. The non-Markovianity of the dynamics has been studied in terms of divisibility breaking of the dynamical map and increase of trace distance fidelity between quantum states. Moreover, it has been observed that the irreversible entropy production rate is always negative (for a fixed initial state) whenever the dynamics exhibits non-Markovian behavior. In continuation with the study of witnessing non-Markovianity, it has been shown that the positive rate of change of the purity of the central qubit is also a useful indicator of the non-Markovian information back flow. Given the experimental feasibility of measuring the purity of a quantum state, a possibility of experimental demonstration of non-Markovianity and the negative irreversible entropy production rate has been addressed. This gives the present work considerable practical importance for detecting non-Markovianity and the negative irreversible entropy production rate.

abstract: We investigate the decoherence dynamics of continuous variable entanglement as the system-environment coupling strength varies from the weak-coupling to the strong-coupling regimes. Due to the existence of localized modes in the strong-coupling regime, the system cannot approach equilibrium with its environment, which induces a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition. We analytically solve the entanglement decoherence dynamics for an arbitrary spectral density. The nonequilibrium quantum phase transition is demonstrated as the system-environment coupling strength varies for all the Ohmic-type spectral densities. The 3-D entanglement quantum phase diagram is obtained.

abstract: Color centers in silicon carbide have increasingly attracted attention in recent years owing to their excellent properties such as single photon emission, good photostability, and long spin coherence time even at room temperature. As compared to diamond which is widely used for holding Nitrogen-vacancy centers, SiC has the advantage in terms of large-scale, high-quality and low cost growth, as well as advanced fabrication technique in optoelectronics, leading to the prospects for large scale quantum engineering. In this paper, we report experimental demonstration of the generation of nanoscale $V_{Si}$ single defect array through ion implantation without the need of annealing. $V_{Si}$ defects are generated in pre-determined locations with resolution of tens of nanometers. This can help in integrating $V_{Si}$ defects with the photonic structures which, in turn, can improve the emission and collection efficiency of $V_{Si}$ defects when it is used in spin photonic quantum network. On the other hand, the defects are shallow and they are generated $\sim 40nm$ below the surface which can serve as critical resources in quantum sensing application.

abstract: We study the critical behavior and the ground-state entanglement of a large class of $\mathrm{su}(1|1)$ supersymmetric spin chains with a general (not necessarily monotonic) dispersion relation. We show that this class includes several relevant models, with both short- and long-range interactions of a simple form. We determine the low temperature behavior of the free energy per spin, and deduce that the models considered have a critical phase in the universality class of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), whose central charge coincides with the number of connected components of the Fermi sea. We also study the R\'enyi entanglement entropy of the ground state, deriving its asymptotic behavior as the block size tends to infinity. In particular, we show that this entropy exhibits the logarithmic growth characteristic of $(1+1)$-dimensional CFTs and one-dimensional (fermionic) critical lattice models, with a central charge consistent with the low-temperature behavior of the free energy. Our results confirm the widely believed conjecture that the critical behavior of fermionic lattice models is completely determined by the topology of their Fermi surface.

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an attractive means for securing communications in optical fibre networks. However, deployment of the technology has been hampered by the frequent need for dedicated dark fibres to segregate the very weak quantum signals from conventional traffic. Up until now the coexistence of QKD with data has been limited to bandwidths that are orders of magnitude below those commonly employed in fibre optic communication networks. Using an optimised wavelength divisional multiplexing scheme, we transport QKD and the prevalent 100 Gb/s data format in the forward direction over the same fibre for the first time. We show a full quantum encryption system operating with a bandwidth of 200 Gb/s over a 100 km fibre. Exploring the ultimate limits of the technology by experimental measurements of the Raman noise, we demonstrate it is feasible to combine QKD with 10 Tb/s of data over a 50 km link. These results suggest it will be possible to integrate QKD and other quantum photonic technologies into high bandwidth data communication infrastructures, thereby allowing their widespread deployment.

abstract: We investigate synchronization effects in quantum self-sustained oscillators theoretically using the micromaser as a model system. We use the probability distribution for the relative phase as a tool for quantifying the emergence of preferred phases when two micromasers are coupled together. Using perturbation theory, we show that the behavior of the phase distribution is strongly dependent on exactly how the oscillators are coupled. In the quantum regime where photon occupation numbers are low we find that although synchronization effects are rather weak, they are nevertheless significantly stronger than expected from a semiclassical description of the phase dynamics. We also compare the behavior of the phase distribution with the mutual information of the two oscillators and show that they can behave in rather different ways.

abstract: Inspired by the idea of mimicking the measurement on a quantum system through a decoherence process to target specific eigenstates based on Born's law instead of the hierarchy of eigenvalues, we transform a Lindblad equation for the reduced density operator into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to obtain a computationally feasible simulation of the decoherent dynamics in the open quantum system. The method shows an exponential convergence and its computational costs scale linear for sparse matrix representations of the involved Hermitian operators. Symmetries of the problem can be incorporated either in the initial state of the dynamics or explicitly using the symmetry operators in the evolution equation. As an application of the method we discuss \textit{eigenstate towing}, which relies on the perturbation theory to follow the progression of an arbitrary subset of eigenstates along a sum of perturbation operators with the intention to explore for instance the effect of interactions on these eigenstates.

abstract: We study single- and multi-quantum transitions of the nuclear spins of ionized arsenic donors in silicon and find quadrupolar effects on the coherence times, which we link to fluctuating electrical field gradients present after the application of light and bias voltage pulses. To determine the coherence times of superpositions of all orders in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space, we use a phase-cycling technique and find that, when electrical effects were allowed to decay, these times scale as expected for a field-like decoherence mechanism such as the interaction with surrounding $^{29}$Si nuclear spins.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of continuous-time two-particle quantum walks on a one-dimensional noisy lattice. Depending on the initial condition, we show how the interplay between particle in- distinguishability and interaction determines distinct propagation regimes. A realistic model for the environment is considered by introducing non-Gaussian noise as time-dependent fluctuations of the tunneling amplitudes between adjacent sites. We observe that the combined effect of parti- cle interaction and fast noise (weak coupling with the environment) provides a faster propagation compared to the noiseless case. This effect can be understood in terms of the band-structure of the Hubbard-model, and a detailed analysis as a function of both noise and system parameters is presented.

abstract: We experimentally study a system of quantum kicked rotors - an ensemble of diatomic molecules exposed to a periodic sequence of ultrashort laser pulses. In the regime, where the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic, we investigate the quantum phenomenon of dynamical localization by means of state-resolved coherent Raman spectroscopy. We examine the dependence of the exponentially localized angular momentum distribution and of the total rotational energy on the time period between the pulses and their amplitude. The former parameter is shown to provide control over the localization center, whereas the latter one controls the localization length. Similar control of the center and width of a nonlocalized rotational distribution is demonstrated in the limit of classical diffusion, established by adding noise to the periodic pulse sequence.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.04214
abstract: In the setting of encryption schemes, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures that no adversary can meaningfully manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext. In this work, we give a new definition of non-malleability for encryption of quantum data, improving on the previous definition of Ambainis Bouda and Winter. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities, considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. We prove that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy, in stark contrast to the classical setting where the two properties are independent. In the case of non-unitary schemes, we also provide a separation example which demonstrates a weakness in the definition of Ambainis et al. In the case of unitary schemes, we establish that the two definitions are equivalent, by showing that our definition is equivalent to the notion of a unitary two-design. We also give new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum authentication. We show that the strong notion of "total authentication" recently proposed by Garg, Yuen and Zhandry can be satisfied with two-designs. This is a significant improvement over their construction, which required eight-designs. We also show that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication as defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail.

abstract: In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a new way of controlling the group velocity of an optical pulse by using a combination of spectral hole burning, slow light effect and linear Stark effect in a rare-earth-ion-doped crystal. The group velocity can be changed continuously by a factor of 20 without significant pulse distortion or absorption of the pulse energy. With a similar technique, an optical pulse can also be compressed in time. Theoretical simulations were developed to simulate the group velocity control and the pulse compression processes. The group velocity as well as the pulse reshaping are solely controlled by external voltages which makes it promising in quantum information and quantum communication processes. It is also proposed that the group velocity can be changed even more in an Er doped crystal while at the same time having a transmission band matching the telecommunication wavelength.

abstract: We show that several qubits can be integrated in a single magnetic ion, using its internal electronic spin states with energies tuned by a suitably chosen molecular environment. This approach is illustrated with a nearly-isotropic Gd(III) ion entrapped in a polyoxometalate molecule. Experiments with microwave technologies, either three dimensional cavities or quantum superconducting circuits, show that this magnetic molecule possesses the number of spin states and the set of coherently addressable transitions connecting these states that are needed to perform a universal three-qubit processor or, equivalently, a d=8-level 'qudit'. Our findings open prospects for developing more sophisticated magnetic molecules which can result in more powerful and noise resilient quantum computation schemes.

abstract: We analyze chiral topological edge modes in a non-Hermitian variant of the 2D Dirac equation. Such modes appear at interfaces between media with different "masses" and/or signs of the "non-Hermitian charge". The appearance and regions of existence of the edge modes are intimately related to exceptional points, i.e., degeneracies in the bulk spectra of the media. We find that the topological edge modes can be divided into three classes ("Hermitian-like", "non-Hermitian", and "mixed"), and these are described by two winding numbers corresponding to a pair of half-integer charges carried by exceptional points of the bulk Hamiltonian. We also show that the non-Hermitian topological edge modes can be realized in a honeycomb-like lattice of ring resonators with non-Hermitian couplings.

abstract: $\textbf{Background:}$ The deuteron shows the essential features of short-range correlations found in all nuclei. Experimental observables related to short-range correlations are connected with the high-momentum components of one- and two-body momentum distributions. An intuitive understanding of short-range correlations is provided by the suppression of the two-body density in coordinate space at small distances. $\textbf{Purpose:}$ The Wigner function provides a quasi-probability distribution in phase-space that allows to investigate short-range correlations as a function of distance and relative momentum in a unified picture. $\textbf{Method:}$ The Wigner function for the deuteron is calculated for bare and SRG evolved AV8' and N3LO interactions and investigated as a function of distance, relative momentum and angular orientation. Partial momentum and coordinate space distributions are obtained by integrating over parts of phase space. $\textbf{Results:}$ The Wigner function shows a pronounced low-momentum peak that is not affected by short-range correlations and a high-momentum shoulder at small distances that reflects short-range correlations. Oscillations of the Wigner function are related to interference of low- and high-momentum components. $\textbf{Conclusions:}$ Short-range correlations are a truly quantum-mechanical phenomenon caused by interference of low- and high-momentum components in the wave function.
