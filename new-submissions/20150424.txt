abstract: Magic state distillation is a crucial component in the leading approaches to implementing universal fault tolerant quantum computation, with existing protocols for both qubit and higher dimensional systems. Early work focused on determining the region of distillable states for qubit protocols, yet comparatively little is known about which states can be distilled and with what distillable region for d>2. Here we focus on d=3 and present new four-qutrit distillation schemes that improve upon the known distillable region, and achieve distillation tight to the boundary of undistillable states for some classes of state. As a consequence of recent results, this implies that there is a family of quantum states that enable universality if and only if they exhibit contextuality with respect to stabilizer measurements. We also identify a new routine whose fixed point is a magic state with maximal sum-negativity i.e., it is maximally non-stabilizer in a specific sense.

abstract: We derive an extension to the quantum regression theorem which facilitates the calculation of two-time correlation functions and emission spectra for systems undergoing non-Markovian evolution. The derivation exploits projection operator techniques, with which we obtain explicit equations of motion for the correlation functions, making only a second order expansion in the system-environment coupling strength, and invoking the Born approximation at a fixed initial time. The results are used to investigate a driven semiconductor quantum dot coupled to an acoustic phonon bath, where we find the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics has observable signatures in the form of phonon sidebands in the resonance fluorescence emission spectrum.

abstract: We utilize a discrete (sequential) measurement protocol to investigate quantum process tomography of a single two-level quantum system, with an unknown initial state, undergoing Rabi oscillations. The ignorance of the dynamical parameters is encoded into a continuous-variable classical system which is coupled to the two-level quantum system via a generalized Hamiltonian. This combined estimate of the quantum state and dynamical parameters is updated using the information obtained from sequential measurements on the quantum system and, after a sufficient waiting period, faithful state monitoring and parameter determination is obtained. Numerical evidence is used to demonstrate the convergence of the state estimate to the true state of the hybrid system.

abstract: The readout fidelity of superconducting transmon and Xmon qubits is partially limited by the qubit energy relaxation through the resonator into the transmission line, which is also known as the Purcell effect. One way to suppress this energy relaxation is to employ a filter which impedes microwave propagation at the qubit frequency. We present semiclassical and quantum analyses for the bandpass Purcell filter realized by E.\ Jeffrey \textit{et al}.\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ 112, 190504 (2014)]. For typical experimental parameters, the bandpass filter suppresses the qubit relaxation rate by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining the same measurement rate. We also show that in the presence of a microwave drive the qubit relaxation rate further decreases with increasing drive strength.

abstract: Duan and Winter studied the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations, and formulated this problem as a semidefinite program depending only on the Kraus operator space of the channel. For the class of classical-quantum channels, they showed that the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations, minimized over all classical-quantum channels with a confusability graph $G$, is exactly $\log \vartheta(G)$, where $\vartheta(G)$ is the celebrated Lov\'{a}sz theta function. In this paper, we show that the same result holds in the one-shot setting for a class of circulant graphs defined by equal-sized cyclotomic cosets, which include the cycle graphs of odd length, the Paley graphs of prime vertices, and the cubit residue graphs of prime vertices. Examples of other graphs are also discussed. This endows the Lov\'{a}sz $\theta$ function with a more straightforward operational meaning.

abstract: The momentum signatures in nonperturbative multiphoton pair production for general elliptic polarization electric fields are investigated by employing the real-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. For a linearly polarized electric field we find that the positions of the nodes in momenta spectra of created pairs depend only on the electric field frequency. The polarization of external fields could not only change the node structures or even make the nodes disappear but also change the thresholds of pair production. The momentum signatures associated to the node positions in which the even-number-photon pair creation process is forbid could be used to distinguish the orbital angular momentum of created pairs on the momenta spectra. These distinguishable momentum signatures could be relevant for providing the output information of created particles and also the input information of ultrashort laser pulses.

abstract: We study multifractal properties in the spectrum of effective time-independent Hamiltonians obtained using a perturbative method for a class of delta-kicked systems. The evolution operator in the time-dependent problem is factorized into an initial kick, an evolution dictated by a time-independent Hamiltonian, and a final kick. We have used the double kicked $SU(2)$ system and the kicked Harper model to study butterfly spectrum in the corresponding effective Hamiltonians. We have obtained a generic class of $SU(2)$ Hamiltonians showing self-similar spectrum. The statistics of the generalized fractal dimension is studied for a quantitative characterization of the spectra.

abstract: We develop a numerical procedure to efficiently model the nonequilibrium steady state of one-dimensional arrays of open quantum systems, based on a matrix-product operator ansatz for the density matrix. The procedure searches for the null eigenvalue of the Liouvillian superoperator by sweeping along the system while carrying out a partial diagonalization of the single-site stationary problem. It bears full analogy to the density-matrix renormalization group approach to the ground state of isolated systems, and its numerical complexity scales as a power law with the bond dimension. The method brings considerable advantage when compared to the integration of the time-dependent problem via Trotter decomposition, as it can address arbitrarily long-ranged couplings. Additionally, it ensures numerical stability in the case of weakly dissipative systems thanks to a slow tuning of the dissipation rates along the sweeps. We have tested the method on a driven-dissipative spin chain, under various assumptions for the Hamiltonian, drive, and dissipation parameters, and compared the results to those obtained both by Trotter dynamics and Monte-Carlo wave function. Accurate convergence to the nonequilibrium steady state was always reached without any sign of numerical instability. Our method improves significantly over a variational approach that was very recently introduced [J. Cui, J. Ignacio Cirac, M. C. Banuls, arXiv:1501.06786 (2015)], both in terms of numerical stability and computational complexity.

abstract: There exist two formulations for quantum heat engine. One is semi-classical scenario, and the other is full quantum scenario. The former is formulated as a unitary evolution for the internal system, and is adopted by the community of statistical mechanics. In the latter, the whole process is formulated as unitary. It was adopted by the community of quantum information. However, their formulation does not consider measurement process. In particular, the former formulation does not work when the amount of extracted work is observed. In this paper, we formulate the quantum heat engine as the measurement process because the amount of extracted work should be observed in a practical situation. Then, we clarify the contradiction of the former formulation by using a novel trade-off relation. Next, based on our formulation, we derive the optimal efficiency of quantum heat engines with the finite-size heat baths, without assuming the existence of quasi-static processes. That is, we asymptotically expand the optimal efficiency up to the third order when we extract work from the pair of hot and cold baths. The first term is shown to be Carnot efficiency. We also investigate the effect by finiteness of the resources by classifying it into two types.

abstract: Transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems, ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices. It has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment. We report the first experimental demonstration of such environment-assisted quantum transport, using an engineered network of laser-written waveguides, with relative energies and inter-waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired Hamiltonian. Controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination, yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case. We show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target Hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence.

abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equations for the evolution of the magnetization, in presence of an external torque, can be cast in the form of the Lorenz equations and, thus, can describe chaotic fluctuations. To study quantum effects, we describe the magnetization by matrices, that take values in a Lie algebra. The finite dimensionality of the representation encodes the quantum fluctuations, while the non-linear nature of the equations can describe chaotic fluctuations. We identify a criterion, for the appearance of such non-linear terms. This depends on whether an invariant, symmetric tensor of the algebra can vanish or not. This proposal is studied in detail for the fundamental representation of $\mathfrak{u}(2)=\mathfrak{u}(1)\times\mathfrak{su}(2)$. We find a knotted structure for the attractor, a bimodal distribution for the largest Lyapunov exponent and that the dynamics takes place within the Cartan subalgebra, that does not contain only the identity matrix, thereby can describe the quantum fluctuations.

abstract: Basing on the analogy between the coherent states of light and separable states of $N$ bosons, we demonstrate that the violation Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for any-order correlation function signals the entanglement among the constituent particles. Rather than restricting to the correlations between the positions of particles, we consider the broadest set of measurements allowed by quantum mechanics. Our result is general -- it applies to any quantum system of bosons, even when the number of particles is not fixed, provided that there is no coherence between different number states. We also demonstrate that the compact expression for the separable state of bosons can be used to relate some known metrological quantities to the particle entanglement in a very simple way.

abstract: We investigate the strong coupling regime of a self-assembled quantum dot in a tunable microcavity with dark-field laser spectroscopy. The high quality of the spectra allows the lineshapes to be analyzed revealing subtle quantum interferences. Agreement with a model calculation is achieved only by including exciton dephasing which reduces the cooperativity from a bare value of 9.0 to the time-averaged value 5.5. In the pursuit of high cooperativity, besides a high-Q and low mode-volume cavity, we demonstrate that equal efforts need to be taken towards lifetime-limited emitter linewidths.

abstract: Among the (in)famous differences between classical and quantum mechanics, quantum counterfactuals seem to be the most intriguing. At the same time, they seem to underlie many quantum oddities. In this article, we propose a simple explanation for counterfactuals, on two levels. Quantum Oblivion (QO) is a fundamental type of quantum interaction that we prove to be the origin of quantum counterfactuals. It also turns out to underlie several well-known quantum effects. This phenomenon is discussed in the first part of the article, yielding some novel predictions. In the second part, a hypothesis is offered regarding the unique spacetime evolution underlying QO, termed Quantum Hesitation (QH). The hypothesis invokes advanced actions and interfering weak values, as derived first by the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF). Here too, weak values are argued to underlie the familiar "strong" quantum values. With these, an event that appears to have never occurred can exert causal effects and then succumb to QO by another time-evolution involving negative weak values that eliminate them. We conclude with briefly discussing the implications of these ideas on the nature of time.

abstract: Temporal modes (TMs) of photonic quantum states provide promising bases for quantum information science (QIS), because they intrinsically span a high-dimensional Hilbert space and lend themselves to integration into existing single-mode fiber communication networks. We show that the three main requirements to construct a valid framework for QIS - the controlled generation of resource states, the targeted and highly efficient manipulation of TMs and their efficient detection, can be fulfilled with current technology. We suggest implementations of diverse QIS applications based on those three building blocks.

abstract: Recently the first physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of Santha-Vazirani sources using a finite number of no-signaling devices and with a constant rate of noise has been proposed, however there still remained the open question whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness amplification using only two no-signaling devices and in a situation where the violation of a Bell inequality implies only an upper bound for some outcome probability for some setting combination? Here, we solve this problem and present the first device-independent protocol for the task of randomness amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of only two non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not fully deterministic into a totally random source while tolerating a constant noise rate and prove the security of the protocol against general no-signaling adversaries. The minimum requirement for a device-independent Bell inequality based protocol for obtaining randomness against no-signaling attacks is that every no-signaling box that obtains the observed Bell violation has the conditional probability $P(\textbf{x}| \textbf{u})$ of at least a single input-output pair $(\textbf{u}, \textbf{x})$ bounded from above. We show how one can construct protocols for randomness amplification in this minimalistic scenario.

abstract: We analyze the entanglement between two matter modes in a hybrid quantum system consists of a microcavity, a quantum well, and a mechanical oscillator. Although the exciton mode in the quantum well and the mechanical oscillator are initially uncoupled, their interaction through the microcavity field results in an indirect exciton-mechanical mode coupling. We show that this coupling is a Fano-Agarwal-type coupling induced by the decay of the exciton and the mechanical modes caused by the leakage of photons through the microcavity to the environment. Using experimental parameters and for slowly varying microcavity field, we show that the generated coupling leads to an exciton-mechanical mode entanglement. The maximum entanglement is achieved at the avoided level crossing frequency, where the hybridization of the two modes is maximum. The entanglement is also very robust to the phonon thermal bath temperature.

abstract: We theoretically study spin and charge currents through finite-size two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor/uniform ferromagnet/s-wave superconductor (SFS) junctions with intrinsic spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs) using a quasiclassical approach. Considering experimentally realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the combination of spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and lack of inversion symmetry can result in spontaneously accumulated spin currents at the edges of finite-size two-dimensional magnetic SF hybrids. Due to the spontaneous edge spin accumulation, the corners of the F wire host the maximum spin current density. We further reveal that this type edge phenomena are robust and independent of either the actual type of ISOIs or exchange field orientation. Moreover, we study spin current-phase relations in these diffusive spin-orbit coupled SFS junctions. Our results unveil net spin currents, not accompanied by charge supercurrent, that spontaneously accumulate at the sample edges through a modulating superconducting phase difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental implementations to observe these edge phenomena.

abstract: We study theoretically the far-from-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of spin spiral states in the three dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model. The investigated problem serves as an archetype for understanding quantum dynamics of isolated many-body systems in the vicinity of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. We present a field-theoretical formalism that systematically improves on mean-field for describing the real-time quantum dynamics of generic spin-1/2 systems. This is achieved by mapping spins to Majorana fermions followed by a 1/N expansion of the resulting two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action. Our analysis reveals rich fluctuation-induced relaxation dynamics in the unitary evolution of spin spiral states. In particular, we find the sudden appearance of long-lived prethermalized plateaus with diverging lifetimes as the spiral winding is tuned toward the thermodynamically stable ferro- or antiferromagnetic phases. The emerging prethermalized states are characterized by different bosonic modes being thermally populated at different effective temperatures, and by a hierarchical relaxation process reminiscent of glassy systems. Spin-spin correlators found by solving the non-equilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation provide further insight into the dynamic formation of correlations, the fate of unstable collective modes, and the emergence of fluctuation-dissipation relations. Our predictions can be verified experimentally using recent realizations of spin spiral states [S. Hild, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 147205 (2014)].

abstract: The nontrivial evolution of Wannier functions (WF) for the occupied bands is a good starting point to understand topological insulator. By modifying the definition of WFs from the eigenstates of the projected position operator to those of the projected modular position operator, we are able to extend the usage of WFs to Weyl metal where the WFs in the old definition fails because of the lack of band gap at the Fermi energy. This extension helps us to universally understand topological insulator and topological semi-metal in a same framework. Another advantage of using the modular position operators in the definition is that the higher dimensional WFs for the occupied bands can be easily obtained. We show one of their applications by schematically explaining why the winding numbers $\nu_{3D}=\nu_{2D}$ for the 3D topological insulators of DIII class presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 016801(2015).
