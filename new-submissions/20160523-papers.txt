abstract: By coupling with a qubit, the ground-state degeneracy and boundary modes in condensed matter systems can be manifested unambiguously by evaluation of qubit decoherence. We first demonstrate the universality of this way by two-band theory. Consequently several exemplifications are presented, focused on the topological condensed matter systems in one, two and three dimension. Our key findings is that qubit decoherence show rapid decaying when the energy band is touching at Fermi surface or there exist the Dirac points or Weyl nodes. While it is nonsensitive to the energy crossing in bulk energy. This feature shows that qubit decoherence can manifest faithfully the variant of topology in energy band.

abstract: We theoretically study the propagation of light through a cold atomic medium, where the effects of motion, laser intensity, atomic density, and polarization can all modify the properties of the scattered light. We present two different microscopic models: the "coherent dipole model" and the "random walk model", both suitable for modeling recent experimental work done in large atomic arrays in the low light intensity regime. We use them to compute relevant observables such as the linewidth, peak intensity and line center of the emitted light. We further develop generalized models that explicitly take into account atomic motion. Those are relevant for hotter atoms and beyond the low intensity regime. We show that atomic motion can lead to drastic dephasing and to a reduction of collective effects, together with a distortion of the lineshape. Our results are applicable to model a full gamut of quantum systems that rely on atom-light interactions including atomic clocks, quantum simulators and nanophotonic systems.

abstract: A scheme is proposed for the fast generation of three-dimensional entanglement between two atoms trapped in two cavities connected by a fiber via invariant-based shortcut to adiabatic passage. With the help of quantum Zeno dynamics, the technique of invariant-based shortcut to adiabatic passage is applied for the generation of two-atom three-dimensional entanglement. The numerical simulation results show that, within a short time, the scheme has a high fidelity and is robust against the decoherence caused by the atomic spontaneous emission, photon leakage, and the variations in the parameters selected. Moreover, the scheme may be possible to be implemented with the current experimental technology.

abstract: We investigate the possibility to achieve high-fidelity universal two-qubit gates by supplementing optimal tuning of individual qubits with dynamical decoupling (DD) of local 1/f noise. We consider simultaneous local pulse sequences applied during the gate operation and compare the efficiencies of periodic, Carr-Purcell and Uhrig DD with hard $\pi$-pulses along two directions ($\pi_{z/y}$ pulses). We present analytical perturbative results (Magnus expansion) in the quasi-static noise approximation combined with numerical simulations for realistic 1/f noise spectra. The gate efficiency is studied as a function of the gate duration, of the number $n$ of pulses, and of the high-frequency roll-off. We find that the gate error is non-monotonic in $n$, decreasing as $n^{-\alpha}$ in the asymptotic limit, $\alpha \geq 2$ depending on the DD sequence. In this limit $\pi_z$-Urhig is the most efficient scheme for quasi-static 1/f noise, but it is highly sensitive to the soft UV-cutoff. For small number of pulses, $\pi_z$ control yields anti-Zeno behavior, whereas $\pi_y$ pulses minimize the error for a finite $n$. For the current noise figures in superconducting qubits, two-qubit gate errors $\sim 10^{-6}$, meeting the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation, can be achieved. The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence is the most efficient procedure, stable for $1/f$ noise with UV-cutoff up to gigahertz.

abstract: In this paper we consider the modelling and simulation of open quantum systems from a device engineering perspective. We derive master equations at different levels of approximation for a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) ring coupled to an ohmic bath and demonstrate that the different levels of approximation produce qualitatively different dynamics. We discuss the issues raised when seeking to obtain Lindbladian dissipation and show, in this case, that the external flux (which may be considered to be a control variable in some applications) is not confined to the Hamiltonian, as often assumed in quantum control, but also appears in the Lindblad terms.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.06278
abstract: We introduce the notion of a $k$-mode weakly stationary quantum process $\varrho$ based on the canonical Schr\"odinger pairs of position and momentum observables in copies of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$, indexed by an additive abelian group $D$ of countable cardinality. Such observables admit an autocovariance map $\widetilde{K}$ from $D$ into the space of real $2k \times 2k$ matrices. The map $\widetilde{K}$ on the discrete group $D$ admits a spectral representation as the Fourier transform of a $2k \times 2k$ complex Hermitain matrix-valued totally finite measure $\Phi$ on the compact character group $\widehat{D}$, called the Kolmogorov-Wiener-Masani (KWM) spectrum of the process $\varrho$. Necessary and sufficient conditions on a $2k \times 2k$ complex Hermitian matrix-valued measure $\Phi$ on $\widehat{D}$ to be the KWM spectrum of a process $\varrho$ are obtained. This enables the construction of examples. Our theorem reveals the dramatic influence of the uncertainty relations among the position and momentum observables on the KWM spectrum of the process $\varrho$. In particular, KWM spectrum cannot admit a gap of positive Haar measure in $\widehat{D}$. The relationship between the number of photons in a particular mode at any site of the process and its KWM spectrum needs further investigation.

abstract: Photons do not interact directly with each other, but conditional control of one beam by another can be achieved with non-linear optical media at high field intensities. It is exceedingly difficult to reach such intensities at the single photon level but proposals have been made to obtain effective interactions by scattering photons from single transitions. We report here effective interactions between photons created using a quantum dot weakly coupled to a cavity. We show that a passive single-photon non-linearity can modify the counting statistics of a Poissonian beam, sorting the photons in number. This is used to create strong correlations between detection events and sort polarisation correlated photons from an uncorrelated stream using a single spin. These results pave the way for optical switches operated by single quanta of light.

abstract: We study work extraction from the Dicke model achieved using simple unitary cyclic transformations keeping into account both a non optimal unitary protocol, and the energetic cost of creating the initial state. By analyzing the role of entanglement, we find that highly entangled states can be inefficient for energy storage when considering the energetic cost of creating the state. Such surprising result holds notwithstanding the fact that the criticality of the model at hand can sensibly improve the extraction of work. While showing the advantages of using a many-body system for work extraction, our results demonstrate that entanglement is not necessarily advantageous for energy storage purposes, when non optimal processes are considered. Our work shows the importance of better understanding the complex interconnections between non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems and correlations among their subparts.

abstract: The dynamical formulation of time-independent scattering theory that is developed in [Ann. Phys. (NY) 341, 77-85 (2014)] offers simple formulas for the reflection and transmission amplitudes of finite-range potentials in terms of the solution of an initial-value differential equation. We prove a theorem that simplifies the application of this result and use it to give a complete characterization of the invisible configurations of the truncated $\mathfrak{z}\,e^{-2ik_0 x}$ potential to a closed interval, $[0,L]$, with $k_0$ being a positive integer multiple of $\pi/L$. This reveals a large class of exact unidirectionally and bidirectionally invisible configurations of this potential. The former arise for particular values of $\mathfrak{z}$ that are given by certain zeros of Bessel functions. The latter occur when the wavenumber $k$ is an integer multiple of $\pi/L$ but not of $k_0$. We discuss the optical realizations of these configurations and explore spectral singularities of this potential.

abstract: We investigate bright solitons in the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in the framework of an extended variational approach. We apply the latter to the stationary ground state of the system as well as to coherent collisions between two or more solitons. Using coupled Gaussian trial wave functions, we demonstrate that the variational approach is a powerful method to calculate the soliton dynamics. This method has the advantage that it is computationally faster compared to numerically exact grid calculations. In addition, it goes far beyond the capability of analytical ground state solutions, because the variational approach provides the ability to treat excited solitons as well as dynamical interactions between different wave packets. To demonstrate the power of the variational approach, we calculate the stationary ground state of the soliton and compare it with the analytical solution showing the convergence to the exact solution. Furthermore, we extend our calculations to nonstationary solitons by investigating the breathing oscillations of excited solitons and the coherent collision of several wave packets. Comparisons of the variational approach with numerically exact simulations on grids reveal excellent agreement in the high-energy regime.

abstract: We provide an alternative approach to relativistic dynamics based on the Feshbach projection technique. Instead of directly studying the Dirac equation, we derive a two-component equation for the upper spinor. This approach allows one to investigate the underlying physics in a different perspective. For particles with small mass such as the neutrino, the leading order equation has a Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, implying there is no leakage between the upper and lower spinors. In the weak relativistic regime, the leading order corresponds to a non-Hermitian correction to the Pauli equation, which takes into account the non-zero possibility of finding the lower-spinor state and offers a more precise description.

abstract: The reduced density matrices (RDMs) of many-body quantum states form a convex set. The boundary of low dimensional projections of this convex set may exhibit nontrivial geometry such as ruled surfaces. In this paper, we study the physical origins of these ruled surfaces for bosonic systems. The emergence of ruled surfaces was recently proposed as signatures of symmetry-breaking phase. We show that, apart from being signatures of symmetry-breaking, ruled surfaces can also be the consequence of gapless quantum systems by demonstrating an explicit example in terms of a two-mode Ising model. Our analysis was largely simplified by the quantum de Finetti's theorem---in the limit of large system size, these RDMs are the convex set of all the symmetric separable states. To distinguish ruled surfaces originated from gapless systems from those caused by symmetry-breaking, we propose to use the finite size scaling method for the corresponding geometry. This method is then applied to the two-mode XY model, successfully identifying a ruled surface as the consequence of gapless systems.

abstract: Tunneling times in atomic ionization is studied theoretically by a virtual detector approach. A virtual detector is a hypothetical device that allows to monitor the wave-function's density with spatial and temporal resolution during the ionization process. With this theoretical approach, it becomes possible to define unique moments when the electron enters and leaves with highest probability the classically forbidden region from first principles and a tunneling time can be specified unambiguously. It is shown that neither the moment when the electron enters the tunneling barrier nor when it leaves the tunneling barrier coincide with the moment when the external electric field reaches its maximum. Under the tunneling barrier as well as at the exit the electron has a nonzero velocity in electric field direction. This nonzero exit velocity has to be incorporated when the free motion of the electron is modeled by classical equations of motion.

abstract: Quantum correlations forms a subset of the set of nonsignaling boxes. This allows us to characterize quantum correlations as a convex combination of the extremal boxes of the nonsignaling polytope which are Popescu-Rohrlich boxes (maximally nonlocal boxes) and local deterministic boxes. There exists multiple decomposition of quantum correlations in the context of the nonsignaling polytope. I find that the existence of Popescu-Rohrlich box decomposition for local boxes associates two notions of discord which capture nonclassicality of quantum correlations originating from Bell nonlocality and EPR-steering. I introduce, Bell and Mermin discord, and show that any bipartite nonsignaling box admits a three-way decomposition. This decomposition allows us to isolate the origin of nonclassicality into three disjoint sources: a Popescu-Rohrlich box, a maximally EPR-steerable box, and a classical correlation. Interestingly, I show that all non-null quantum discord states which are neither classical-quantum states nor quantum-classical states can give rise to nonclassical correlations which have non-null Bell and/or Mermin discord for suitable incompatible measurements. I introduce two notions of genuine discord, which are the generalizations of Bell and Mermin discord to the multipartite scenario, to characterize the presence of genuine nonclassicality in quantum correlations.

abstract: Berry's geometric phase naturally appears when a quantum system is driven by an external field whose parameters are slowly and cyclically changed. A variation in the coupling between the system and the external field can also give rise to a geometric phase, even when the field is in the vacuum state or any other Fock state. Here we demonstrate the appearance of a vacuum-induced Berry phase in an artificial atom, a superconducting transmon, interacting with a single mode of a microwave cavity. As we vary the phase of the interaction, the artificial atom acquires a geometric phase determined by the path traced out in the combined Hilbert space of the atom and the quantum field. Our ability to control this phase opens new possibilities for the geometric manipulation of atom-cavity systems also in the context of quantum information processing.

abstract: We detect a certain pattern of behavior of separability probabilities $p(r_A,r_B)$ for two-qubit systems endowed with Hilbert-Schmidt, and more generally, random induced measures, where $r_A$ and $r_B$ are the Bloch radii ($0 \leq r_A,r_B \leq 1$) of the qubit reduced states ($A,B$). We observe a relative repulsion of radii effect, that is $p(r_A,r_A) < p(r_A,1-r_A)$, except for rather narrow "crossover" intervals $[\tilde{r}_A,\frac{1}{2}]$. Among the seven specific cases we study are, firstly, the "toy" seven-dimensional $X$-states model and, then, the fifteen-dimensional two-qubit states obtained by tracing over the pure states in $4 \times K$-dimensions, for $K=3, 4, 5$, with $K=4$ corresponding to Hilbert-Schmidt (flat/Euclidean) measure. We also examine the real (two-rebit) $K=4$, the $X$-states $K=5$, and Bures (minimal monotone)--for which no nontrivial crossover behavior is observed--instances. In the two $X$-states cases, we derive analytical results, for $K=3, 4$, we propose formulas that well-fit our numerical results, and for the other scenarios, rely presently upon large numerical analyses. The separability probability crossover regions found expand in length (lower $\tilde{r}_A$) as $K$ increases. This report continues our efforts (arXiv:1506.08739) to extend the recent work of Milz and Strunz (J. Phys. A}: 48 [2015] 035306) from a univariate ($r_A$) framework---in which they found separability probabilities to hold constant with $r_A$---to a bivariate ($r_A,r_B$) one. We also analyze the two-qutrit and qubit-qutrit counterparts reported in arXiv:1512.07210 in this context.

abstract: A magneto-optical trap (MOT) of atoms or molecules is studied when two lasers of different detunings and polarization are used. Especially for $J\rightarrow J,J-1$ transitions, a scheme using more than one frequency per transition and different polarization is required to create a significant force. Calculations have been performed with the simplest forms of the $J\rightarrow J-1$ case (i.e. $J''=1 \rightarrow J'=0$) and $J\rightarrow J$ case (i.e. $J''=1/2 \rightarrow J'=1/2$). A one dimensional (1D) model is presented and a complete 3D simulation using rate equations confirm the results. Even in the absence of Zeeman effect in the excited state, where no force is expected in the single laser field configuration, we show that efficient cooling and trapping forces are restored in our configuration. We study this mechanism for the C$_2^-$ molecular anion as a typical example of the interplay between the two simple transitions $J \rightarrow J,J-1$.

abstract: We study the reachable sets of open n-qubit quantum systems, the coherent parts of which are under full unitary control, with time-modulable Markovian noise acting on a single qubit as an additional degree of incoherent control. In particular, adding bang-bang control of amplitude damping noise (non-unital) allows the dynamic system to act transitively on the entire set of density operators. This means one can transform any initial quantum state into any desired target state. Adding switchable bit-flip noise (unital), on the other hand, suffices to explore all states majorised by the initial state. We have extended our open-loop optimal control package DYNAMO to also handle incoherent control so that these unprecedented reachable sets can systematically be exploited in experiments. We propose implementation by a GMon, a superconducting device with fast tunable coupling to an open transmission line, and illustrate how open-loop control with noise switching can accomplish all state transfers without the need for measurement-based closed-loop feedback schemes with a resettable ancilla.

abstract: We present a scheme for cavity-assisted generation of hybrid entanglement between a moving mirror and the vibrational degree of freedom of a single trapped ion. We consider an optomechanical cavity with a moving mirror and a trapped ion located inside a second cavity. Due to the radiation pressure, it is possible to entangle the cavity field with the moving mirror, and by tuning the other cavity field with the internal degrees of freedom of the ion, it is possible to generate an entangled state of the cavity ion-field systems. The fields leaking from each cavity may be combined in a beam-splitter, and following the detection of the outgoing photons by conveniently placed photodetectors, it is possible to generate entangled states of the moving mirror and the single trapped ion subsystems. Such entangled states are hybrid states, in the sense that they are constituted by Fock states (ion) and coherent states (mirror).

abstract: The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model has been proposed as a possible solution to the quantum measurement problem by modifying the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In this work, we apply the CSL model to two cosmological models of the early Universe: the matter bounce scenario and slow roll inflation. In particular, we focus on the generation of the classical primordial inhomogeneities and anisotropies that arise from the dynamical evolution, provided by the CSL mechanism, of the quantum state associated to the quantum fields. In each case, we obtained a prediction for the shape and the parameters characterizing the primordial spectra (scalar and tensor), i.e. the amplitude, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We found that there exist CSL parameter values, allowed by other non-cosmological experiments, for which our predictions for the angular power spectrum of the CMB temperature anisotropy are consistent with the best fit canonical model to the latest data released by the Planck Collaboration.

abstract: When a semiconductor absorbs light, the resulting electron-hole superposition amounts to a uncontrolled quantum ripple that eventually degenerates into diffusion. If the conformation of these excitonic superpositions could be engineered, though, they would constitute a new means of transporting information and energy. We show that properly designed laser pulses can be used to create such structured excitons. They can be formed with a prescribed speed, direction and spectral make-up that allows them to be selectively passed, rejected or even dissociated using superlattices. Their coherence also provides a handle for manipulation using active, external controls. Energy and information can be conveniently processed and subsequently removed at a distant site by reversing the original procedure to produce a stimulated emission. The ability to create, manage and remove structured excitons comprises the foundation for opto-excitonic circuits with application to a wide range of quantum information, energy and light-flow technologies. The paradigm is demonstrated using both tight-binding and Time-Domain Density Functional Theory simulations.

abstract: We revisit the fidelity as a measure for the stability and the complexity of the quantum motion of single and many-body systems. Within the context of cold atoms, we present on overview of applications of two fidelities which we call static and dynamical fidelity, respectively. The static fidelity applies to quantum problems which can be diagonalized since it is defined via the eigenfunctions. In particular, we show that the static fidelity is a highly effective practical detector of avoided crossings characterizing the complexity of the systems and their evolutions. The dynamical fidelity is defined via the time-dependent wave functions. Focussing on the quantum kicked rotor system, we highlight a few practical applications of fidelity measurements in order to better understand the large variety of dynamical regimes of this paradigm of a low-dimensional system with mixed regular-chaotic phase space.

abstract: Long lasting coherence in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes has been observed even at physiological temperatures. Experiments have demonstrated quantum coherent behaviour in the long-time operation of the D-Wave quantum computer as well. Quantum coherence is the common feature between the two phenomena. An explanations for eight orders of magnitude discrepancy between the single flux qubit coherence time and the long-time quantum behaviour of an array of thousand flux qubits in the quantum computer was suggested within a theory where the flux qubits are coupled to an environment of particles called gravonons of high density of states The coherent evolution is in high dimensional spacetime and can be understood as a solution of Schroedinger's time-dependent equation. Explanations for the quantum beats observed in 2D Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex in the green sulfur bacteria are presently sought in constructing transport theories based on quantum master equations where 'good' molecular vibrations ('coloured noise') in the chlorophyll and the surrounding protein scaffold knock the exciton oscillations back into coherence. These 'good' vibrations are claimed to have developed in three billion years of natural selection. These theories, however, face the discomforting experimental observation that "attempts to scramble vibrational modes or to shift resonances with isotopic substitution miserably failed to affect the beating signals". As a possible way out of this dilemma we adopted the formalism of the quantum computation to the quantum beats in the FMO protein complex.

abstract: We report complex PT-symmetric multi-soliton solutions to the Korteweg de-Vries equation that asymptotically contain one-soliton solutions, with each of them possessing the same amount of finite real energy. We demonstrate how these solutions originate from degenerate energy solutions of the Schroedinger equation. Technically this is achieved by the application of Darboux-Crum transformations involving Jordan states with suitable regularizing shifts. Alternatively they may be constructed from a limiting process within the context Hirota's direct method or on a nonlinear superposition obtained from multiple Baecklund transformations. The proposed procedure is completely generic and also applicable to other types of nonlinear integrable systems.
