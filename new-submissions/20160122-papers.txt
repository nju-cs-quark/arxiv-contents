abstract: All natural things process and transform information. They receive environmental information as input, and transform it into appropriate output responses. Much of science is dedicated to building models of such systems -- algorithmic abstractions of their input-output behavior that allow us to simulate how such systems can behave in the future, conditioned on what has transpired in the past. Here, we show that classical models cannot avoid inefficiency -- storing past information that is unnecessary for correct future simulation. We construct quantum models that mitigate this waste, whenever it is physically possible to do so. This suggests that the complexity of general input-output processes depends fundamentally on what sort of information theory we use to describe them.

abstract: Information theory establishes the fundamental limits on data transmission, storage, and processing. Quantum information theory unites information theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates. Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and intriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive functions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum information theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a deeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical multi-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum channel capacities.

abstract: We study an effect of quenching of antihydrogen quantum states near material surface in the gravitational field of the Earth by local charges randomly distributed along the mirror surface. The quenching mechanism reduces the quantum reflection probability because of additional atom-charge interaction and nonadiabatic transitions to excited gravitational states. Our approach is suitable for accounting for quenching caused by any kind of additional interaction with the characteristic range much smaller than the typical gravitational state wave-length.

abstract: Quantum superpositions of distinct coherent states in a single-mode harmonic oscillator, known as "cat states", have been an elegant demonstration of Schrodinger's famous cat paradox. Here, we realize a two-mode cat state of electromagnetic fields in two microwave cavities bridged by a superconducting artificial atom, which can also be viewed as an entangled pair of single-cavity cat states. We present full quantum state tomography of this complex cat state over a Hilbert space exceeding 100 dimensions via quantum non-demolition measurements of the joint photon number parity. The ability to manipulate such multi-cavity quantum states paves the way for logical operations between redundantly encoded qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.

abstract: Single photon detection is a requisite technique in quantum-optics experiments in both the optical and the microwave domains. However, the energy of microwave quanta are four to five orders of magnitude less than their optical counterpart, making the efficient detection of single microwave photons extremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate the detection of a single microwave photon propagating through a waveguide. The detector is implemented with an "impedance-matched" artificial $\Lambda$ system comprising the dressed states of a driven superconducting qubit coupled to a microwave resonator. We attain a single-photon detection efficiency of $0.66 \pm 0.06$ with a reset time of $\sim 400$~ns. This detector can be exploited for various applications in quantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum information processing.

abstract: Divisibility of dynamical maps turns out to be a fundamental notion in characterising Markovianity of quantum evolution, although the decision problem for divisibility itself is computationally intractable. In this work, we propose the operational characterisation of divisibility of dynamical maps by exploiting distinguishability of quantum channels. We prove that distinguishability for any pair of quantum channels does not increase under divisible maps, and then, in terms of channel distinguishability with entanglement between system and $k$-dimensional ancillas, provide the operational characterization for the full hierarchy of the so-called $k$-divisiblity $(k=1,2,\ldots)$. Finally, from the fact that min-entropy corresponds to the information-theoretic measure of distinguishability, the entropic characterisation to divisible maps is also provided.

By addressing systems with temperature inhomogeneities and laser interactions, we show that non-monotonous energetic landscapes can be produced where barriers and minima appear. Our treatment provides a self-consistent quantum theoretical framework for investigating the properties of a class of non-equilibrium atom-surface interactions.

abstract: Adiabatic dynamics plays an essential role in quantum technologies. By driving a quantum system slowly, the quantum evolution can be engineered with suppressed excitation. Yet, environmentally-induced decoherence limits the implementation of adiabatic protocols. Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) have the potential to revolutionize quantum technologies by speeding up the time evolution while mimicking adiabatic dynamics. These nonadiabatic protocols can be engineered by means an auxiliary control field is used to tailor excitations. Here we present the first experimental realization of counterdiabatic driving in a continuous variable system, implementing a shortcut to the adiabatic transport of a trapped ion, in which nonadiabatic transitions are suppressed during all stages of the process. The resulting dynamics is equivalent to a "fast-motion video" of the adiabatic trajectory. We experimentally demonstrate the enhanced robustness of the protocol with respect to alternative approaches based on classical local controls including Fourier optimization schemes. Our results demonstrate that STA protocols provide a robust speedup on demand, paving the way to their application in a wide variety of quantum technologies.

abstract: Bosonic channels are important in practice as they form a simple model for free-space or fiber-optic communication. Here we consider a single-sender two-receiver pure-loss bosonic broadcast channel and determine the unconstrained capacity region for the distillation of bipartite entanglement and secret key between the sender and each receiver, whenever they are allowed arbitrary public classical communication. We show how the state merging protocol leads to achievable rates in this setting, giving an inner bound on the capacity region. We also evaluate an outer bound on the region by using the relative entropy of entanglement and a `reduction by teleportation' technique. The outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby establishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels. Our result could provide a useful benchmark for implementing a broadcasting of entanglement and secret key through such channels. An important open question relevant to practice is to determine the capacity region in both this setting and the single-sender single-receiver case when there is an energy constraint on the transmitter.

abstract: A general framework of quantum state ampli?cation using the language of quantum state transformation is given systematically for the ?rst time. The concept of ampli?cation of quantum states is de?ned speci?cally and the ampli?cation of a set of quantum states is formulated generally as the transformation of quantum states. Three di?erent kinds of important quantum ampli?cations, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum ampli?cation, probabilistic noiseless quantum ampli?cation, and deterministic noiseless quantum ampli?cation are identi?ed and discussed. For deterministic quan- tum ampli?cation, the linearity of ampli?cation is proven to be incompatible with the noiseless ampli?cation while it is not true for probabilistic quantum ampli?cation. However, deterministic noiseless quantum ampli?cation is shown physically attainable if the linearity of ampli?cation is given up. The connection between the gain of ampli?cation and the successful probability is discussed for probabilistic quantum ampli?cation. Assuming that successful probability is the same for all quantum states to be ampli?ed, we obtain a generally valid relation between the gain of amplication and the successful probability. Particular interest is given to phase-preserving quantum amplication of Gaussian states which has been shown of theoretical interest and of practical importance in quantum information and quantum communication recently. Our results of quantum state ampli?cation not only enrich the research of quantum ampli?cation but also can be helpful for further practical applications.

abstract: Networks constitute efficient tools for assessing universal features of complex systems. In physical contexts, classical as well as quantum, networks are used to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as phase transitions, intricate aspects of many-body quantum systems or even characteristic features of a future quantum internet. Random quantum networks and their associated directed graphs are employed for capturing statistically dominant features of complex quantum systems. Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable of evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of large random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of the details of the network topology. These findings suggest that also other highly complex networks, such as a future quantum internet, may exhibit similar universal properties.

abstract: A change in the sign of the frequency of a wave between two inertial reference frames corresponds to a reversal of the phase velocity. Yet from the point of view of the relation $E=\hbar\omega$, a positive quantum of energy apparently becomes a negative energy one. This is physically distinct from a change in the sign of the wave-vector, and has been associated with various effects such as Cherenkov radiation, quantum friction, and the Hawking effect. In this work we provide a more detailed understanding of these negative frequency modes based on a simple microscopic model of a dielectric medium as a lattice of scatterers. We calculate the classical and quantum mechanical radiation damping of an oscillator moving through such a lattice and find that the modes where the frequency has changed sign contribute negatively. In terms of the lattice of scatterers we find that this negative radiation damping arises due to phase of the periodic force experienced by the oscillator due to the relative motion of the lattice.

abstract: We examine the fluctuation theorems which traditionally have been studied for classical systems and enquire if they can be extended to the quantum domain, especially at low temperatures. The example chosen is that of a problem which has proven to be of great interest in the context of Landau diamagnetism viz. the quantized motion of an electron in a magnetic field and in a dissipative environment. It is established from first principles that the quantum work operator W has a Gaussian distribution even though the system under consideration has a four dimensional phase space. The parameter $\alpha$ in the fluctuation theorem $p(W )/p(-W) = exp(\alpha W)$ depends on the system dynamics and has characteristic quantum features, especially at low temperatures. Certain unique low temperature signatures are also discussed.

abstract: Over the past decade donor spin qubits in isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si have been intensely studied due to their exceptionally long coherence times. More recently bismuth donor electron spins have become popular because Bi has a large nuclear spin which gives rise to clock transitions (first-order insensitive to magnetic field noise). At every clock transition there are two nearly degenerate transitions between four distinct states which can be used as a pair of qubits. Here it is experimentally demonstrated that these transitions are excited by microwaves of opposite helicity such that they can be selectively driven by varying microwave polarization. This work uses a combination of a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) microresonator and a dielectric resonator to flexibly generate arbitrary elliptical polarizations while retaining the high sensitivity of the CPW.

abstract: Interference is central to quantum physics and occurs when indistinguishable paths exist, like in a double-slit experiment. Replacing the two slits with two single atoms introduces optical non-linearities for which nontrivial interference phenomena are predicted. Their observation, however, has been hampered by difficulties in preparing the required atomic distribution, controlling the optical phases and detecting the faint light. Here we overcome all of these experimental challenges by combining an optical lattice for atom localisation, an imaging system with single-site resolution, and an optical resonator for light steering. We observe resonator-induced saturation of resonance fluorescence for constructive interference of the scattered light and nonzero emission with huge photon bunching for destructive interference. The latter is explained by atomic saturation and photon pair generation. Our experimental setting is scalable and allows one to realize the Tavis-Cummings model for any number of atoms and photons, explore fundamental aspects of light-matter interaction, and implement new quantum information processing protocols.

abstract: We discuss a method to adapt the codeword stabilized (CWS) quantum code framework to the problem of finding asymmetric quantum codes. We focus on the corresponding Pauli error models for amplitude damping noise and phase damping noise. In particular, we look at codes for Pauli error models that correct one or two amplitude damping errors. Applying local Clifford operations on graph states, we are able to exhaustively search for all possible codes up to length $9$. With a similar method, we also look at codes for the Pauli error model that detect a single amplitude error and detect multiple phase damping errors. Many new codes with good parameters are found, including nonadditive codes and degenerate codes.

abstract: In this note we prove a simple theorem in quantum information theory, which implies that bulk operators in the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence can be reconstructed as CFT operators in a spatial subregion $A$, provided that they lie in its entanglement wedge. This is an improvement on existing reconstruction methods, which have at most succeeded in the smaller causal wedge. The proof is a combination of the recent work of Jafferis, Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh on the quantum relative entropy of a CFT subregion with earlier ideas interpreting the correspondence as a quantum error correcting code.

abstract: We present a phenomenological model to consider the effect of shape symmetry breaking on the optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots. We compare between quantum dots with two-fold rotational and two reflections ($C_{2v}$) symmetry and quantum dots in which this symmetry is reduced by perturbation to one reflection only ($C_{s}$). We show that this symmetry reduction drastically affects the optical activity of the dark exciton. In symmetric quantum dots, one of the dark exciton eigenstate is totally dark and the other, due to heavy- and light-hole mixing, has a small dipole moment polarized along the symmetry axis (growth direction) of the quantum dot. In non-symmetric quantum dots, the two dark excitons' eigenstates are mixed with the bright excitons' eigenstates which have cross-linearly polarized perpendicular to the growth direction dipole moments. As a result of this mixing one of the dark exciton eigenstate is dark while the other one does have dipole moment which is linearly polarized normal to the growth direction, like the lower energy bright exciton eigenstate. Our model agrees well with recently obtained experimental data.

abstract: We experimentally investigate magnon-polaritons, arising in ferrimagnetic resonance experiments in a microwave cavity with a tuneable quality factor. To his end, we simultaneously measure the electrically detected spin pumping signal and microwave reflection (the ferrimagnetic resonance signal) of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) / platinum (Pt) bilayer in the microwave cavity. The coupling strength of the fundamental magnetic resonance mode and the cavity is determined from the microwave reflection data. All features of the magnetic resonance spectra predicted by first principle calculations and an input-output formalism agree with our experimental observations. By changing the decay rate of the cavity at constant magnon-photon coupling rate, we experimentally tune in and out of the strong coupling regime and successfully model the corresponding change of the spin pumping signal. Furthermore, we observe the coupling and spin pumping of several spin wave modes and provide a quantitative analysis of their coupling rates to the cavity.

abstract: We perform extensive benchmark comparisons of surface hopping dynamics with numerically exact calculations for the spin-boson model over a wide range of energetic and coupling parameters as well as temperature. We find that deviations from golden-rule scaling in the Marcus regime are generally small and depend sensitively on the energetic bias between electronic states. Fewest switched surface hopping (FSSH) is found to be surprisingly accurate over a large swath of parameter space. The inclusion of decoherence corrections via the augmented FSSH (A-FSSH) algorithm improves the accuracy of dynamical behavior compared to exact simulations, but the effects are generally not dramatic, at least for the case of an environment modeled with the commonly used Debye spectral density.

In the effective tight-binding models that can be simulated, we demonstrate that this technique allows for a local and time-dependent control over all system parameters, and additionally allows for single-site resolved detection of atomic populations. We demonstrate full control over site-to-site off-diagonal tunneling elements (amplitude and phase) and diagonal site-energies, through the observation of continuous-time quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and negative tunneling. These capabilities open up new prospects in the experimental study of disordered and topological systems.

abstract: Topological phases of matter are a potential platform for the storage and processing of quantum information with intrinsic error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and with the length scales of the system, such as the distance between quasiparticles. However, it is less well-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian quasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or Berry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid, with faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show that such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of topologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements that detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this source of error.
