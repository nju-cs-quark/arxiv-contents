**1.    On the quantum spin glass transition on the Bethe lattice**

<p>
We investigate the ground-state properties of a disorderd Ising model with uniform transverse field on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a glassy phase that is induced by reducing the intensity of the transverse field. We use a combination of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms and exact diagonalization to compute R\'enyi entropies, quantum Fisher information, correlation functions and order parameter. We locate the transition by means of the peak of the R\'enyi entropy and we find agreement with the transition point estimated from the emergence of finite values of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and from the peak of the correlation length. We interpret the results by means of a mean-field theory in which quantum fluctuations are treated as massive particles hopping on the interaction graph. We see that the particles are delocalized at the transition, a fact that points towards the existence of possibly another transition deep in the glassy phase where these particles localize, therefore leading to a many-body localized phase.
