**1.    Quantum walk on a cylinder**

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the 2D alternate quantum walk on a cylinder. We concentrate on the study of the motion along the open dimension, in the spirit of looking at the closed coordinate as a small or "hidden" extra dimension. If one starts from localized initial conditions on the lattice, the dynamics of the quantum walk that is obtained after tracing out the small dimension shows the contribution of several components, which can be understood from the study of the dispersion relations for this problem. In fact, these components originate from the contribution of the possible values of the quasi-momentum in the closed dimension. In the continuous space-time limit, the different components manifest as a set of Dirac equations, with each quasi-momentum providing the value of the corresponding mass. We briefly discuss the possible link of these ideas to the simulation of high energy physical theories that include extra dimensions.

**2.    Periodically Driving a Many-Body Localized Quantum System**  
Pranjal Bordia, Henrik Lüschen, Ulrich Schneider, Michael Knap, Immanuel Bloch

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally study a periodically driven many-body localized system realized by interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-disordered optical lattice. By preparing the system in a far-from-equilibrium state and monitoring the remains of an imprinted density pattern, we identify a localized phase at high drive frequencies and an ergodic phase at low ones. These two distinct phases are separated by a dynamical phase transition which depends on both the drive frequency and the drive strength. Our observations are quantitatively supported by numerical simulations and are directly connected to the change in the statistical properties of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian.
