**1.    Symmetry Protected Topological Phases and Majorana Mode in One-dimensional Quantum Walk with Boundary**  
Ho Tat Lam, Yue Yu, Kwok Yip Szeto

<blockquote>
<p>
The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by the coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states in one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin parameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with quasi-energy $E=0,\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different boundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary conditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be computed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes are provided.

**2.    Generic Quantum Walks with Memory**

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks with memory are a type of modified quantum walk that records the walker's latest path. In this work, we show that a quantum walk with memory on a digraph can be transformed as a quantum walk without memory on the line digraph of the original one. With this correspondence, we construct a model which includes all possible standard quantum walks with memory on regular graphs. This construction would help us to study quantum walks with memory and also help in corresponding experiments. Based on this model, by taking the straight line as example, we study the general properties of quantum walks with memory, such as variance, occupancy rate and localization. Interestingly, we find that a quantum walk with memory can produce the same probability distribution as that of a standard quantum walk whose initial spin state is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|0\rangle_p(|1\rangle_c+i|-1\rangle_c)$.
