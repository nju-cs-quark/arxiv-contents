abstract: A linear map $L$ from ${\mathbb C}^{n \times n}$ into ${\mathbb C}^{n \times n}$ is called a quantum channel if it is completely positive and trace preserving. The set ${\cal L}_n$ of all such quantum channels is known to be a compact convex set. While the extreme points of ${\cal L}_n$ can be characterized, not much is known about the structure of its higher dimensional faces. Using the so called Choi matrix $Z(L)$ associated with the quantum channel $L$, we compute the maximum dimension of a proper face of ${\cal L}_n$, and in addition the possible dimensions of faces generated by $L$ when $rank \ Z(L)=2 $.

abstract: In this work we analyse the structure of the thermodynamic arrow of time, defined by transformations that leave the thermal equilibrium state unchanged, in classical (incoherent) and quantum (coherent) regimes. We note that in the infinite temperature limit the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource. Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a two-dimensional system, the lattice structure is preserved at finite temperatures. This leads to a question about the role coherence plays in providing structure to the thermodynamic arrow of time. In developing our results we find necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the existence of a single-qubit CPTP map with a given fixed point.

abstract: Kerr nonlinear cavities displaying optical thresholding have been proposed for the realization of ultra-low power photonic logic gates. In the ultra-low photon number regime, corresponding to energy levels in the attojoule scale, quantum input-output models become important to study the effect of unavoidable quantum fluctuations on the performance of such logic gates. However, being a quantum anharmonic oscillator, a Kerr-cavity has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space spanned by the Fock states of the oscillator. This poses a challenge to simulate and analyze photonic logic gates and circuits composed of multiple Kerr nonlinearities. For simulation, the Hilbert of the oscillator is typically truncated to the span of only a finite number of Fock states. This paper develops a quasi-principal components approach to identify important subspaces of a Kerr-cavity Hilbert space and exploits it to construct an approximate reduced model of the Kerr-cavity on a smaller Hilbert space. Using this approach, we find a reduced dimension model with a Hilbert space dimension of 15 that can closely match the mean transmitted and reflected output fields of a conventional truncated Fock state model of dimension 75, when driven by an input coherent field that switches between two levels. For the same input, the reduced model also closely matches the mean outputs of Kerr-cavity-based AND and NOT gates and a NAND latch obtained from simulation of the full 75 dimension model.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality holds for any macrorealistic system that is being measured noninvasively. A violation of the inequality can signal that a system does not conform to our primal intuition about the physical world. Alternatively, a violation can simply indicate that "clumsy" experimental technique led to invasive measurements. Here, we consider a recent Leggett-Garg test designed to try to rule out the mundane second possibility. We tailor this Leggett-Garg test to the IBM 5Q Quantum Experience system and find compelling evidence that qubit $Q_2$ of the system cannot be described by noninvasive macrorealism.

abstract: The average fidelity of the teleportation of a coherent state is calculated for general Gaussian bipartite systems shared by the partners of the protocol, Alice and Bob. It is considered that the shared Gaussian bipartite modes suffer independent attenuations before the processing of Alice and Bob. Moreover the classical communication between the partners can be controlled by a gain not necessarily unitary. Comparing with the classical fidelity threshold of measure-and-prepare methods, we establish several genuinely quantum teleportation conditions which depend on the gain and the local attenuations. Considering that the gain can be tuned to maximize the bipartite state set able to genuinely quantum teleportation, a condition for teleportation robust to local attenuations is found. This condition is demonstrated to be essentially equivalent to the condition of robust Gaussian bipartite entanglement, obtained in previous articles, showing that the attenuation robustness is an entanglement property relevant for characterization and application of bipartite systems. For the derivation of the robust teleportation conditions, the Gaussian operations onto the bipartite system are thoroughly studied, so that the transformations that maintain the fidelity invariant are found. Some scenarios for different Gaussian bipartite states are presented and discussed.

For multipartite pure states, we present a necessary and sufficient criterion in terms of their coefficient matrices. This condition can be used to classify some SLOCC equivalent quantum states with coefficient matrices having the same rank. For multipartite mixed state, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition by means of the realignment of matrix. Some detailed examples are given to identify the SLOCC equivalence of multipartite quantum states.

abstract: The triumph of heat engines is their ability to convert the disordered energy of thermal sources into useful mechanical motion. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to generalizing thermodynamic notions to the quantum regime, partly motivated by the promise of surpassing classical heat engines. Here, we instead adopt a bottom-up approach: we propose a realistic autonomous heat engine that can serve as a testbed for quantum effects in the context of thermodynamics. Our model draws inspiration from actual piston engines and is built from closed-system Hamiltonians and weak bath coupling terms. We analytically derive the performance of the engine in the classical regime via a set of nonlinear Langevin equations. In the quantum case, we perform numerical simulations of the master equation and find that free dispersion and measurement backaction noise generally lower the engine's performance.

abstract: We examine how to signify and quantify the mesoscopic quantum coherence of approximate two-mode NOON states and spin-squeezed two-mode Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We identify two criteria that verify a nonzero quantum coherence between states with quantum number different by $n$. These criteria negate certain mixtures of quantum states, thereby signifying a generalised $n$-scopic Schrodinger cat-type paradox. The first criterion is the correlation $\langle\hat{a}^{\dagger n}\hat{b}^{n}\rangle\neq0$ (here $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$ are the boson operators for each mode). The correlation manifests as interference fringes in $n$-particle detection probabilities and is also measurable via quadrature phase amplitude and spin squeezing measurements. Measurement of $\langle\hat{a}^{\dagger n}\hat{b}^{n}\rangle$ enables a quantification of the overall $n$-th order quantum coherence, thus providing an avenue for high efficiency verification of a high-fidelity photonic NOON states. The second criterion is based on a quantification of the measurable spin-squeezing parameter $\xi_{N}$. We apply the criteria to theoretical models of NOON states in lossy interferometers and double-well trapped BECs. By analysing existing BEC experiments, we demonstrate generalised atomic "kitten" states and atomic quantum coherence with $n\gtrapprox10$ atoms.

abstract: Previous experimental tests of quantum contextuality based on the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem have demonstrated that not all observables among a given set can be assigned noncontextual eigenvalue predictions, but have never identified which specific observables must fail such assignment. Using neutron interferometry, we remedy this shortcoming by showing that BKS contextuality can be confined to particular observables in the form of anomalous weak values, which can be directly witnessed through weak measurements. We construct a confined contextuality witness from weak values, which we measure experimentally to obtain a $5\sigma$ average violation of the noncontextual bound, with one contributing term violating an independent bound by more than $99\sigma$. This experimentally measured confined contextuality confirms the quantum pigeonhole effect, wherein eigenvalue assignments to contextual observables apparently violate the classical pigeonhole principle.

abstract: Entanglement swapping generates remote quantum correlations between particles that have not interacted and is the cornerstone of long-distance quantum communication, quantum networks, and fundamental tests of quantum science. In the context of spatial modes of light, remote high-dimensional entanglement provides an avenue to increase the bandwidth of quantum communications and provides more stringent limits for tests of quantum foundations. Here we simultaneously swap the entanglement of multiple orbital angular momentum states of light. The system is based on a new quantum protocol using a degenerate filter that cannot distinguish between different anti-symmetric states, and thus entanglement swapping occurs for several thousand pairs of spatial light modes simultaneously. We also identify a previously unrealised mechanism that allows high-dimensional entanglement swapping with only four photons, removing the need for scaling photon numbers with dimensions.

abstract: We consider the problem of reproducing the correlations obtained by arbitrary local projective measurements on the two-qubit Werner state $\rho = v |\psi_- > <\psi_- | + (1- v ) \frac{1}{4}$ via a local hidden variable (LHV) model. We show analytically that these correlations are local for $ v = 682/1000$. In turn, this implies a new bound on the Grothendieck constant $K_G(3) \leq 1000/682 \simeq 1.4663$, as the two problems are closely related. We also present a LHV model for reproducing the statistics of arbitrary POVMs on the Werner state for $v = 341/750 \simeq 0.4547$. The techniques we develop can be adapted to construct LHV models for other entangled states, as well as bounding other Grothendieck constants.

abstract: In many quantum information applications, a minimum detection efficiency must be exceeded to ensure success. Protocols depending on the violation of a Bell inequality, for instance, may be subject to the so-called detection loophole: imperfect detectors may yield spurious violations, which consequently cannot be used to ensure, say, quantum cryptographic security. Hence, we investigate the possibility of giving lower bounds on detector efficiency even if an adversary has full control over both the source and the detectors. To this end, we present a technique to systematically derive Bell inequalities free from the detection loophole using only the observed measurements statistics. The violation of these inequalities certifies that the detectors used exceed a certain minimal efficiency.

abstract: We study how well we can retrodict results of measurements made on a quantum system if we can make measurements on its final state. We know what measurements were made, but not their results. An initial examination shows that we can gain anywhere from no information to perfect information about the results of previous measurements, depending on the measurements and the initial state of the system. The case of two two-outcome measurements, the second of which is a projective measurement, is examined in some detail. We then look at a model of a qubit interferometer in which measurements are made in order to determine the path the qubit followed. The measurement made on the final state of the qubit depends on the information about previous measurement results that we are trying to determine. One can attempt to find the result of just one of the measurements, all of them, or find a measurement sequence that was not realized. We study all three possibilities.

abstract: Standard projective measurements represent a subset of all possible measurements in quantum physics. In fact, non-projective measurements are relevant for many applications, e.g. for estimation problems or transformations among entangled states. In this work we study what quantum measurements can be simulated by using only projective measurements and classical randomness. We first prove that every measurement on a given quantum system can be realised by a projective-simulable measurement on a system enlarged by an ancilla of the same dimension. Then, given a general measurement in dimension two or three, we show that deciding whether it is projective-simulable can be solved by means of semi-definite programming. We also establish conditions for the simulation of measurements using projective ones valid for any dimension. As an application of our formalism, we improve the range of visibilities for which two-qubit Werner states do not violate any Bell inequality for all measurements. From an implementation point of view, our results provide bounds on the amount of noise a general measurement tolerates before losing any advantage over projective ones.

Therefore, in quantum mechanics as long as paraxial approximation is valid it behaves like a wave.

In this paper we present a novel protocol for local quantum measurement discrimination with multi-qubit entanglement systems. It is shown that, in the case of Bob did not know Alice's result of measurement, if both two observers (Alice and Bob) agreed in advance that Alice should measure her qubits before an appointed time t, the local discrimination of two different kinds of measurement can be completed via numerous eight-qubit GHZ entangled states and selective projective measurement.

abstract: Elitzur and Vaidman have proposed a measurement scheme that, based on the quantum superposition principle, allows one to detect the presence of an object --- in a dramatic scenario, a bomb --- without interacting with it. It was pointed out by Ghirardi that this interaction-free measurement scheme can be put in direct relation with falsification tests of the macro-realistic worldview. Here we have implemented the "bomb test" with a single atom trapped in a spin-dependent optical lattice to show explicitly a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality --- a quantitative criterion fulfilled by macro-realistic physical theories. To perform interaction-free measurements, we have implemented a novel measurement method that correlates spin and position of the atom. This method, which quantum mechanically entangles spin and position, finds general application for spin measurements, thereby avoiding the shortcomings inherent in the widely used push-out technique. Allowing decoherence to dominate the evolution of our system causes a transition from quantum to classical behavior in fulfillment of the Leggett-Garg inequality.

abstract: A dilutely filled $N$-site optical lattice near zero temperature within a high-$Q$ multimode cavity can be mapped to a spin ensemble with tailorable interactions at all length scales. The effective full site to site interaction matrix can be dynamically controlled by the application of up to $N(N+1)/2$ laser beams of suitable geometry, frequency and power, which allows for the implementation of quantum annealing dynamics relying on the all-to-all effective spin coupling controllable in real time. Via an adiabatic sweep starting from a superfluid initial state one can find the lowest energy stationary state of this system. As the cavity modes are lossy, errors can be amended and the ground state can still be reached even from a finite temperature state via ground state cavity cooling. The physical properties of the final atomic state can be directly and almost non-destructively read off from the cavity output fields. As example we simulate a quantum Hopfield associative memory scheme.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.06269
abstract: In view of the importance of quantum non-locality in cryptography, quantum computation and communication complexity, it is crucial to decide whether a given correlation exhibits non-locality or not. In the light of a theorem by Pitowski, it is generally believed that this problem is computationally intractable. In this paper, we first prove that the Euclidean distance of given correlations from the local polytope can be computed in polynomial time with arbitrary fixed error, granted the access to a certain oracle. Namely, given a fixed error, we derive two upper bounds on the running time. The first bound is linear in the number of measurements. The second bound scales as the number of measurements to the sixth power. The former is dominant only for a very high number of measurements and is never saturated in the performed numerical tests. We then introduce a simple algorithm for simulating the oracle. In all the considered numerical tests, the simulation of the oracle contributes with a multiplicative factor to the overall running time and, thus, does not affect the sixth-power law of the oracle-assisted algorithm.

abstract: Quantum phenomena have the potential to speed up the solution of hard optimization problems. For example quantum annealing, based on the quantum tunneling effect, has recently been shown to scale exponentially better with system size as compared with classical simulated annealing. However, current realizations of quantum annealers with superconducting qubits face two major challenges. First, the connectivity between the qubits is limited, excluding many optimization problems from a direct implementation. Second, decoherence degrades the success probability of the optimization. We address both of these shortcomings and propose an architecture in which the qubits are robustly encoded in continuous variable degrees of freedom. Remarkably, by leveraging the phenomenon of flux quantization, all-to-all connectivity is obtained without overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of this architecture by simulating the optimal solution of a small instance of the NP-hard and fully connected number partitioning problem in the presence of dissipation.

It is found that this overlap is always smaller than unity and may even vanish in spite of the fact that both wavefunctions provide the same energy and density per particle. Consequences are discussed.

abstract: We show that an Ansatz based on independent composite bosons [Phys. Rep. 463, 215-320 (2008)] accurately describes the condensate fraction of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates in cold Fermi gases. The entanglement between the fermionic constituents of a single Feshbach molecule then governs the many-particle statistics of the condensate, from the limit of strong interaction to close to unitarity. This result strengthens the role of entanglement as the indispensable driver of composite-boson-behavior. The condensate fraction of fermion pairs at zero temperature that we compute matches excellently previous results obtained by means of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo methods and the Bogoliubov depletion approximation. This paves the way towards the exploration of the BEC-BCS crossover physics in mixtures of cold Fermi gases as well as the implementation of Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interference experiments proposed within coboson theory.

Recently, exceptional sensitivity has been achieved using the strongly enhanced evanescent fields provided by optical microcavities and nano-sized plasmonic resonators. However, at high field intensities photodamage to the biological specimen becomes increasingly problematic. Here, we introduce an optical nanofibre based evanescent biosensor that operates at the fundamental precision limit introduced by quantisation of light. This allows a four order-of-magnitude reduction in optical intensity whilst maintaining state-of-the-art sensitivity. It enable quantum noise limited tracking of single biomolecules as small as 3.5 nm, and surface-molecule interactions to be monitored over extended periods. By achieving quantum noise limited precision, our approach provides a pathway towards quantum-enhanced single-molecule biosensors.

title: Gauge freedom in observables and Landsbergs nonadiabatic geometric phase: pumping spectroscopy of interacting open quantum systems

abstract: We set up a general density-operator approach to geometric steady-state pumping through slowly driven open quantum systems. This adiabatic-response (AR) approach fits naturally into the framework of Landsbergs nonadiabatic geometric phase. Notably, this phase is accumulated by an observable and is not related to the adiabatic Berry-Simon type phase for mixed-state evolution (Sarandy-Lidar phase), which we show to be quenched. The obtained Landsberg curvature formula applies to pumping of both system and nonsystem observables and to a broad class of strongly interacting open systems coupled to multiple reservoirs, enabling a general geometric pumping-pectroscopy. Our approach makes the geometric effects physically intuitive by tying gauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transport of the observable. We show that a manifestly gauge-covariant formalism is obtained only when allowing for observables that can have both explicit time-dependence and a nonzero reservoir-average (i.e., operators that are not normal ordered with respect to the reservoirs). Although we focus on Born-Markov master equations and use driven quantum dots as an illustration, generalization to more general open-system evolutions involving memory and strong-coupling effects seems possible. A large part of the paper explicitly relates our approach to the Sinitsyn-Nemenmann full-counting statistics (FCS) approach considering only its application to the first moments of pumped observables. Covering all key aspects (gauge freedom, geometric pumping connection, curvature, gap condition) we argue that, although less general, the Landsberg-AR approach is both technically simpler and physically more transparent.

abstract: We present a transportable optical clock (TOC) with $^{87}$Sr. Its complete characterization against a stationary lattice clock resulted in a systematic uncertainty of ${7.4 \times 10^{-17}}$ which is currently limited by the statistics of the determination of the residual lattice light shift. The measurements confirm that the systematic uncertainty is reduceable to below the design goal of $1 \times 10^{-17}$. The instability of our TOC is $1.3 \times 10^{-15}/\sqrt{(\tau/s)}$. Both, the systematic uncertainty and the instability are to our best knowledge currently the best achieved with any type of transportable clock. For autonomous operation the TOC is installed in an air-conditioned car-trailer. It is suitable for chronometric leveling with sub-meter resolution as well as intercontinental cross-linking of optical clocks, which is essential for a redefiniton of the SI second. In addition, the TOC will be used for high precision experiments for fundamental science that are commonly tied to precise frequency measurements and it is a first step to space borne optical clocks

abstract: We consider the dynamics of a large number N of nonrelativistic bosons in the mean field limit for a class of interaction potentials that includes Coulomb interaction. In order to describe the fluctuations around the mean field Hartree state, we introduce an auxiliary Hamiltonian on the N-particle space that is very similar to the one obtained from Bogoliubov theory. We show convergence of the auxiliary time evolution to the fully interacting dynamics in the norm of the N-particle space. This result allows us to prove several other results: convergence of reduced density matrices in trace norm with optimal rate, convergence in energy trace norm, and convergence to a time evolution obtained from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian on Fock space with expected optimal rate. We thus extend and quantify several previous results, e.g., by providing the physically important convergence rates, including time-dependent external fields and singular interactions, and allowing for general initial states, e.g., those that are expected to be ground states of interacting systems.

abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a quasi-one-dimensional lattices in two possible dimerization configurations. Both configurations are characterized by the same lattice topology and the same spectra containing a flat band at zero energy. We find that, one of the dimerized configuration has similar symmetry to an one-dimensional chain proposed by Su-Schrieffer-Heeger for studying solitons in conjugated polymers. Whereas, the other dimerized configuration only shows non-trivial topological properties in the presence of chiral-symmetry breaking adiabatic pumping.

abstract: It has recently been shown that periodically driven noninteracting systems may exhibit anomalous chiral edge modes, despite hosting bands with trivial topology. We obtain many-body versions of such drives, corresponding to class A, which exhibit anomalous charge transport at the edge and which reduce to their noninteracting counterparts for systems of single particles. We extend these drives to more general systems of bosons, fermions and spins, and characterise their anomalous action at the edge of an open system by an effective edge unitary. These are found to be robust to all local perturbations and may be classified by a pair of coprime integers.
