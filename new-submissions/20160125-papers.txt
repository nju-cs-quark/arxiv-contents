abstract: The traditional second law of thermodynamics says that the average amount of work required to change one state into another while in contact with a heat reservoir, must be at least as large as the change in free energy of the system. Here, we consider a fine-grained notion of the free energy, and show that in terms of it, the second law can be written as an equality. We also obtain a generalisation of the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem which holds for arbitrary initial states, not just the case of an initial thermal state. We derive a generalisation of Gibbs-stochasticity, a condition originally found in the approach to thermodynamics inspired by quantum information theory. This generalisation directly incorporates the case of fluctuating work and serves as a parent equation which can be used to derive the second law equality and the generalisation of the Jarzynski equation. We further show that each of these three generalisations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three fully quantum identities. This allows for more general and fully quantum fluctuation relations from the information theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: Quantum correlations between two systems can be impaired by the presence of an environment, as it can make systems decohere. We wish to evaluate how much coherence has been irreversibly lost. To do so, we study two qubits which leak correlations into an arbitrarily large environment and we find that our ability to steer one of them to the most coherent set of states possible by acting on the other is given by the sub-fidelity of two conditional states of the environment. Sub-fidelity is a quantity that was already known, but that until now lacked an operational interpretation. Furthermore, we conjecture the existence of a family of measures, of which fidelity and sub-fidelity are the first two, which measure the irreversibility of decoherence as we gain access to more and more degrees of freedom of the enviroment.

abstract: Although some non-trivial photon number resolving detectors exist, it may still be convenient to discriminate photon number states with the method of multiplexed detection. Multiplexing can be performed with paths in real space, with paths in time, and in principle with any degree of freedom that has a sufficient number of eigenstates and that can be coupled to the photon number. Previous works have addressed the probabilities involved in these measurements with Monte Carlo simulations, or by restricting the number of detectors to powers of 2, or without including quantum efficiency or noise. In this work we find an analytical expression of the detection probabilities for any number of input photons and any number of on/off photon detectors with a quantum efficiency $0\%\leq\eta\leq100\%$ and a false count probability $\varepsilon\geq0$. This allows us to retrodict the number of photons that we had at the input in the least unbiased way possible. We conclude our work with some examples.

abstract: We consider the problem of estimating multiple phases using a multi-mode interferometer. In this setting we show that while global strategies with multi-mode entanglement can lead to high precision gains, the same precision enhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements. The crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number variance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement between the modes. This has important practical implications because local strategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes using multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to local estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources, and comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing two different schemes: the first uses a set of interferometers, which can be used as a model for a network of quantum sensors, and the second looks at measuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned primarily with quantum imaging.

abstract: Pulse propagation is studied in an EIT medium with the control field having a periodically varying phase (chirp). Based both on numerical calculations and on an approximate approach neglecting absorption and nonadiabatic effects, it is shown that transparency occurs for probe pulses having a sufficiently narrow envelope and an appropriately suited chirp. For other chirped pulses the evolution of their spectra along a sample is studied. Using a projection method one can divide a pulse into a part for which the medium is transparent and a rest for which it is opaque.

abstract: The sensitivity of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) depends strongly on nuclear spin polarisation and, motivated by this observation, dynamical nuclear spin polarisation has recently been applied to enhance MRI protocols (Kurhanewicz, J., et al., Neoplasia 13, 81 (2011)). Nuclear spins associated with the 13 C carbon isotope (nuclear spin I = 1/2) in diamond possess uniquely long spin lattice relaxation times (Reynhardt, E.C. and G.L. High, Prog. in Nuc. Mag. Res. Sp. 38, 37 (2011)) If they are present in diamond nanocrystals, especially when strongly polarised, they form a promising contrast agent for MRI. Current schemes for achieving nuclear polarisation, however, require cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate an efficient scheme that realises optically induced 13 C nuclear spin hyperpolarisation in diamond at room temperature and low ambient magnetic field. Optical pumping of a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre creates a continuously renewable electron spin polarisation which can be transferred to surrounding 13 C nuclear spins. Importantly for future applications we also realise polarisation protocols that are robust againstan unknown misalignment between magnetic field and crystal axis.

abstract: Logic-qubit entanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing, especially in future large-scale quantum networks. In the paper, we put forward an efficient entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for nonlocal mixed logic entangled states with the bit-flip error in the logic qubits of the logic Bell state, resorting to the photon-atom interaction in low-quality (Q) cavity and atomic state measurement. Different from existing EPPs, this protocol can also purify the logic phase-flip error, and the bit-flip error and the phase-flip error in physic qubit. During the protocol, we only require to measure the atom states, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems in future large-scale quantum networks.

abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of two qubits interacting through a polariton bus with an ultrastrong coupled qubit-cavity system. By tuning the energy gap of the qubits maintaining the polariton within the vacuum, we demonstrate an improvement of two-qubit gate operation time and excitations transfer as the ultrastrong coupling strength is increased. Our proposal might pave the way for multipurpose parity protected quantum information tasks, and for the enhancement of excitations transfer in disordered systems.

abstract: Accurately controlling a quantum system is a fundamental requirement in many areas of modern science ranging from quantum information processing to high-precision measurements. The ultimate goal in quantum control is to prepare a desired state as fast as possible with sufficient high-fidelity allowed by available resources and the experimental constraints. Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a robust way for high-fidelity state transfer with the requirement of sufficiently long operation time for the adiabatic evolution. We here theoretically propose and then experimentally demonstrate a transitionless superadiabatic protocol to speed up the STIRAP. Through simply modifying the shapes of the Raman pulses, a fast and high-fidelity Stimulated Raman superadiabatic passage is experimentally realized, which is robust against control parameter variations. The all-optical, robust, and fast protocol demonstrated here provides an efficient and practical way to control the quantum systems.

abstract: In the last years the possibility of creating and manipulating quantum states of light has paved the way to the development of new technologies exploiting peculiar properties of quantum states, as quantum information, quantum metrology & sensing, quantum imaging ... In particular Quantum Imaging addresses the possibility of overcoming limits of classical optics by using quantum resources as entanglement or sub-poissonian statistics. Albeit quantum imaging is a more recent field than other quantum technologies, e.g. quantum information, it is now substantially mature for application. Several different protocols have been proposed, some of them only theoretically, others with an experimental implementation and a few of them pointing to a clear application. Here we present a few of the most mature protocols ranging from ghost imaging to sub shot noise imaging and sub Rayleigh imaging.

abstract: Quantum weak measurement, measuring some observable quantities within the selected sub-ensemble of the entire quantum ensemble, can produce many interesting results such as the superluminal phenomena. An outcome of such a measurement is the weak value which has been applied to amplify some weak signals of quantum interactions in lots of previous references. Here, we apply the weak measurement to the system of relativistic cold atoms. According to Einstein equivalence principle, the internal energy of an atom will contribute its rest-mass and consequently the external momentum of center-of-mass. This implies a weak "spin"-orbit coupling of atom in the free space. After a duration of this coupling, a weak value can be obtained by post-selecting an internal state of atoms. We show that, such a weak value can significantly change the atoms diffraction in the future times and consequently could help us to experimentally measure the weak effects of special relativity.

abstract: Conventionally, unknown quantum states are characterized using quantum-state tomography based on strong or weak measurements carried out on an ensemble of identically prepared systems. By contrast, the use of protective measurements offers the possibility of determining quantum states from a series of weak, long measurements performed on a single system. Because the fidelity of a protectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state disturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the initial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we show how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a protective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the quantum-state measurement. Our approach is based on a careful tuning of the time dependence of the measurement interaction and is shown to be dramatically more effective in reducing the state disturbance than the previously considered strategy of weakening the measurement strength and increasing the measurement time. We describe a method for designing the measurement interaction such that the state disturbance exhibits polynomial decay to arbitrary order in the inverse measurement time $1/T$. We also show how one can achieve even faster, subexponential decay, and we find that it represents the smallest possible state disturbance in a protective measurement. In this way, our results show how to optimally measure the state of a single quantum system using protective measurements.

abstract: In a delayed-choice quantum eraser, interference fringes are obtained by erasing which-way information after the interfering particle has already been irreversibly detected. Following an introductory review of delayed-choice experiments and quantum erasure, we describe the experimental realization of an optical delayed-choice quantum eraser, suitable for advanced undergraduates, based on polarization-entangled pairs of single photons. In our experiment, the delay of the erasure is implemented using two different setups. The first setup employs an arrangement of mirrors to increase the optical path length of the photons carrying which-way information. In the second setup, we use fiber-optic cables to elongate the path of these photons after their passage through the polarization analyzer but prior to their arrival at the detector. We compare our results to data obtained in the absence of a delay and find excellent agreement. This shows that the timing of the erasure is irrelevant, as also predicted by quantum mechanics. The experiment can serve as a valuable pedagogical tool for conveying the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

We show that, strikingly, a partially reflecting mirror can produce a larger number of particles in comparison with a perfectly reflecting one. In the limit of a perfect mirror, our formulas recover those found in the literature for the Robin boundary condition.

abstract: We present a simple experimental scheme, based on standard atom optics techniques, to design highly versatile model systems for the study of single particle quantum transport phenomena. The scheme is based on a discrete set of free-particle momentum states that are coupled via momentum-changing two-photon Bragg transitions, driven by pairs of interfering laser beams. In the effective lattice models that are accessible, this scheme allows for single-site detection, as well as site-resolved and dynamical control over all system parameters. We discuss two possible implementations, based on state-preserving Bragg transitions and on state-changing Raman transitions, which respectively allow for the study of nearly arbitrary single particle Abelian U(1) and non-Abelian U(2) lattice models.

The candidate events, if they exist, will originate from the transition of a $2p$ orbit electron to the ground state which is already occupied by two electrons. The present limit on the probability for PEP violation for electron is 4.7 $\times10^{-29}$ set by the VIP experiment. With upgraded detectors for high precision X-ray spectroscopy, the VIP-2 experiment will improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.

We show that unlike classical solutions and upon choosing appropriate initial conditions, the expectation value of the scale factor never tends to the singular point which exhibits the singularity-free behavior of the solutions in the quantum domain.

abstract: It has been recently proposed that quantum black holes can be described as N-graviton Bose-Einstein condensates. In this picture the quantum properties of BHs "... can be understood in terms of the single number N". However, so far, the dynamical origin of the occupational number N has not been specified. This description is alternative to the usual one, where black holes are believed to be well described geometrically even at the quantum level. In this paper we pursue the former point of view and develop a non-geometrical dynamical model of quantum black holes (BHs). In our model the occupational number N is proportional to the principal quantum number n of a Planckian harmonic oscillator. The so-called "classicalization" corresponds to the large-n limit, where the Schwarzschild horizon is recovered.

abstract: Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems. Quantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation to probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high predictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data science. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general nonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights into the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part of this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more efficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit low-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional probabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize a useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that sparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce a method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g., personality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part of the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe that the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete with state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore, we make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical orderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection between data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication complexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations) and physics (quantum models).

abstract: What is the maximum rate at which we can send information over a channel? We define the capacity of a channel as the answer to this question. For an important family of channels the capacity is given by a simple optimization problem as proven in Shannon's noisy coding theorem. Furthermore, for these channels, we have the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm that allows to efficiently solve the optimization problem and compute the capacity. In groundbreaking work, Verdu and Han proved a coding theorem for general channels. However, despite considerable effort, there is no equivalent to the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for computing the generalized capacity. Here, we show that such an algorithm can not exist.

abstract: In this letter, we calculate the probability for resonantly induced transitions in quantum states due to time dependent gravitational perturbations. Contrary to common wisdom, the probability of inducing transitions is not infinitesimally small. We consider a system of ultra cold neutrons (UCN), which are organized according to the energy levels of the Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of the earth's gravitational field. Transitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force of frequency $\omega$. The driving force is created by oscillating a macroscopic mass in the neighbourhood of the system of neutrons. The neutrons decay in 880 seconds while the probability of transitions increase as $t^2$. Hence the optimal strategy is to drive the system for 2 lifetimes. The transition amplitude then is of the order of $1.06\times 10^{-5}$ hence with a million ultra cold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.
