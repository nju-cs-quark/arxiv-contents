abstract: Attempts at cloning a quantum system result in the introduction of imperfections in the state of the copies. This is a consequence of the no-cloning theorem, which is a fundamental law of quantum physics and the backbone of security for quantum communications. Although such perfect copies are prohibited, a quantum state may be copied with maximal accuracy via various optimal cloning schemes. Optimal quantum cloning, which lies at the border of the physical limit imposed by the no-signalling theorem and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, has been experimentally realized for low dimensional photonic states. However, an increase in the dimensionality of quantum systems is greatly beneficial to quantum computation and communication protocols. Nonetheless, no experimental demonstration of optimal cloning machines has hitherto been shown for high-dimensional quantum systems. Here, we perform optimal cloning of high-dimensional photonic states by means of the symmetrization method. We show the universality of our technique by conducting cloning of numerous arbitrary input states, and fully characterize our cloning machine by performing quantum state tomography on \emph{cloned} photons. In addition, a cloning attack on a Bennett and Brassard (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol is experimentally demonstrated in order to reveal the robustness of high-dimensional states in quantum cryptography.

abstract: We propose four information-theoretic axioms for the foundations of statistical mechanics in general physical theories. The axioms---Causality, Purity Preservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---identify a class of theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the marginal of a pure entangled state and where every unsharp measurement can be modelled as a sharp measurement on a composite system. This class includes quantum theory and a number of alternative theories, such as quantum theory with real amplitudes, as well as a suitable extension of classical probability theory where classical systems can be combined with other non-classical systems. Theories satisfying our axioms support well-behaved notions of majorization, entropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for an information-theoretic derivation of Landauer's principle.

abstract: Resource theories provide a framework for thermodynamics beyond the thermodynamic limit. For systems with definite energy,the key resource is purity. In this paper we formulate three alternative resource theories of purity in the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs). Each resource theory corresponds to a different choice of free operations, including i)random reversible operations, ii)noisy operations, generated by reversible interactions with ancillas in the microcanonical state, and iii)unital operations, which preserve the microcanonical state.We determine the requirements the underlying GPT must satisfy in order to support well-behaved resource theories with the above sets as free operations. Then, we focus on a special class of physical theories, called sharp theories with purification, which are appealing for an information-theoretic foundation of thermodynamics. For every sharp theory with purification we show that the convertibility of states implies the validity of a majorisation condition. Moreover, we characterise exactly when majorisation is sufficient for convertibility via random reversible operations. Under this condition, we prove that i) random reversible, noisy, and unital operations obey inclusion relations like in quantum theory, ii) despite being different, the three sets of operations are equivalent in terms of convertibility, iii) there exists a one-to-one correspondence between measures of purity and Schur-convex functions, and iv) purity resources are dual to entanglement resources.

abstract: Despite its enormous empirical success, the formalism of quantum theory still raises fundamental questions: why is nature described in terms of complex Hilbert spaces, and what modifications of it could we reasonably expect to find in some regimes of physics? Results in quantum gravity and general ideas of what a fundamental theory should look like suggest that thermodynamics plays a major role in the foundations of physics. In this paper, we address the question of which parts of quantum theory are already determined by compatibility with thermodynamics, and which aspects may still admit modification. We employ two postulates that any probabilistic theory with reasonable thermodynamic behavior should arguably satisfy. In the framework of generalized probabilistic theories, we show that these postulates already imply important aspects of quantum theory, like self-duality and analogues of projective measurements, subspaces and eigenvalues. However, they may still admit a class of theories beyond quantum mechanics. Using a thought experiment by von Neumann, we show that these theories admit a consistent thermodynamic notion of entropy, and prove that the second law holds for projective measurements and mixing procedures. Furthermore, we generalize the concept of state majorization, crucial to recent work in fine-grained quantum thermodynamics, to this class of theories, study additional entropy-like quantities based on measurement probabilities and convex decomposition probabilities, and uncover a relation between one of these quantities and Sorkin's notion of higher-order interference.

abstract: Quantum Lov\'asz number, as a natural generalization of the celebrated Lov\'asz number in graph theory, is the best known efficiently computable upper bound of the entanglement-assisted zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel. However, it remains an intriguing open problem whether this number always coincides with the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity. Here we show that there is a strict gap between these two quantities for a class of explicitly constructed qutrit-to-qutrit channels. Our key approach is to show that for this class of channels both the one-shot zero-error communication capacity and the one-shot zero-error simulation cost in the presence of quantum no-signalling correlations (QNSC), a more broader class of resources than entanglement, are exactly four, while the quantum Lov\'asz number is strictly larger than that. Interestingly, for this class of channels, the quantum fractional packing number is strictly larger than the QNSC-assisted or quantum feedback-assisted zero-error classical capacity. Note that these quantities are all equal for classical channels.

abstract: The dynamics of finite dimension open quantum systems is studied with the help of the simplest possible form of projection operators, namely the ones which project only onto one dimensional subspaces. The simplicity of the action of the projection operators always leads to an analytical solution of the dynamical master equation, even in the non-Markovian case, in any perturbative order. The analytical solution correctly reproduces the short-time dynamics, and can be used to recursively recover the dynamics for an arbitrary time interval with arbitrary precision. The necessary number of relevant degrees of freedom to completely characterise an open quantum system is $(n-1)(n+2)/2,$ where $n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the open system. The method is illustrated by two examples, the relaxation of a qubit in a thermal bath and the dynamics of two interacting qubits in a common environment.

abstract: We consider the slow light propagation in an atomic medium with a tripod level scheme. We show that the coexistence of two types of dark-state polaritons leads to the propagation dynamics, which is qualitatively different from that in a $\Lambda $-medium, and allows therefore for very efficient conversion of signal photons into spin excitations. This efficiency is shown to be very close to 1 even for very long signal light pulses, which could not be entirely compressed into a Lambda-medium at a comparable strength of the control field.

abstract: Topological order is now being established as a central criterion for characterizing and classifying ground states of condensed matter systems and complements categorizations based on symmetries. Fractional quantum Hall systems and quantum spin liquids are receiving substantial interest because of their intriguing quantum correlations, their exotic excitations and prospects for protecting stored quantum information against errors. Here we show that the Hamiltonian of the central model of this class of systems, the Toric Code, can be directly implemented as an analog quantum simulator in lattices of superconducting circuits. The four-body interactions, which lie at its heart, are in our concept realized via Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) that are driven by a suitably oscillating flux bias. All physical qubits and coupling SQUIDs can be individually controlled with high precision. Topologically ordered states can be prepared via an adiabatic ramp of the stabilizer interactions. Strings of qubit operators, including the stabilizers and correlations along non-contractible loops, can be read out via a capacitive coupling to read-out resonators. Moreover, the available single qubit operations allow to create and propagate elementary excitations of the Toric Code and to verify their fractional statistics. The architecture we propose allows to implement a large variety of many-body interactions and thus provides a versatile analog quantum simulator for topological order and lattice gauge theories.

abstract: Unitary error bases have a great number of applications across quantum information and quantum computation, and are fundamentally linked to quantum teleportation, dense coding and quantum error correction. Werner's combinatorial construction builds a unitary error basis from a family of Hadamard matrices and a Latin square. In this dissertation, I give a new categorical axiomatisation of Latin squares, and use this to give a fully graphical presentation and proof of the correctness of Werner's construction. The categorical approach makes clear that some of the Latin square axioms are unnecessary for the construction to go through, and I propose a generalised construction scheme with the potential to create new classes of unitary error bases.

abstract: Blind quantum computation protocols allow a user to delegate a computation to a remote quantum computer in such a way that the privacy of their computation is preserved, even from the device implementing the computation. To date, such protocols are only known for settings involving at least two quantum devices: either a user with some quantum capabilities and a remote quantum server, or two or more entangled but non-communicating servers. In this work, we exploit ambiguity in the flow of information in measurement-based quantum computation to construct a protocol for hiding a computation delegated to a remote quantum computer by an entirely classical user. This ambiguity arises due to the fact that, for a fixed graph, there exist multiple choices of the input and output vertex sets that result in deterministic measurement patterns consistent with the same fixed total ordering of vertices. This allows a classical user, computing only measurement angles, to drive a measurement-based computation performed on a remote device while hiding critical aspects of the computation.

abstract: Pretty good state transfer in networks of qubits occurs when a continuous-time quantum walk allows the transmission of a qubit state from one node of the network to another, with fidelity arbitrarily close to 1. We prove that in a Heisenberg chain with n qubits there is pretty good state transfer between the nodes at the j-th and (n-j+1)-th positions if n is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 or a power of 2. Moreover, this condition is also necessary for j=1. We obtain this result by applying a theorem due to Kronecker about Diophantine approximations, together with techniques from algebraic graph theory.

abstract: We study how temperature affects the lifetime of a quantized, persistent current state in a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). When the temperature is increased, we find a decrease in the persistent current lifetime. Comparing our measured decay rates to simple models of thermal activation and quantum tunneling, we do not find agreement. The measured critical velocity is also found to depend strongly on temperature, approaching the zero temperature mean-field solution as the temperature is decreased. This indicates that an appropriate definition of critical velocity must incorporate the role of thermal fluctuations, something not explicitly contained in traditional theories.

abstract: The aim of the paper is to investigate resonances in quantum graphs with a general self-adjoint coupling in the vertices and their trajectories with respect to varying edge lengths. We derive formulae determining the Taylor expansion of the resonance pole position up to the second order which represent, in particular, a counterpart to the Fermi rule derived recently by Lee and Zworski for graphs with the standard coupling. Furthermore, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the resonances in the high-energy regime in the situation where the leads are attached through $\delta$ or $\delta_\mathrm{s}'$ conditions, and we prove that in the case of $\delta_\mathrm{s}'$ coupling the resonances approach to the real axis with the increasing real parts as $\mathcal{O}\big((\mathrm{Re\,}k)^{-2}\big)$.

abstract: We study the set of infinite volume ground states of Kitaev's quantum double model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ for an arbitrary finite abelian group $G$. It is known that these models have a unique frustration-free ground state. Here we drop the requirement of frustration freeness, and classify the full set of ground states. We show that the ground state space decomposes into $|G|^2$ different charged sectors, corresponding to the different types of abelian anyons (also known as superselection sectors). In particular, all pure ground states are equivalent to one of the "single excitation" states studied by one of us in previous work. Our proof proceeds by showing that each ground state can be obtained as the weak$^*$ limit of finite volume ground states of the quantum double model with suitable boundary terms. The boundary terms allow for states which represent a pair of excitations, with one excitation in the bulk and one pinned to the boundary, to be included in the ground state space.

abstract: A recent proposal to connect the loop quantization with the spin foam model for cosmology via the path integral is hereby adapted to the case of mechanical systems within the framework of the so called polymer quantum mechanics. The mechanical models we consider are deparametrized and thus the group averaging technique is used to deal with the corresponding constraints. The transition amplitudes are written in a vertex expansion form used in the spin foam models, where here a vertex is actually a jump in position. Polymer Propagators previously obtained by spectral methods for a nonrelativistic polymer particle, both free and in a box, are regained with this method. Remarkably, the approach is also shown to yield the polymer propagator of the relativistic particle. This reduces to the standard form in the continuum limit for which the length scale parameter of the polymer quantization is taken to be small. Some possible future developments are commented upon.

abstract: We present a general scheme to map correlated nonequilibrium quantum impurity problems onto an auxiliary open quantum system of small size. The infinite fermionic reservoirs of the original system are thereby replaced by a small number $N_B$ of noninteracting auxiliary bath sites whose dynamics is described by a Lindblad equation. Due to the presence of the intermediate bath sites, the overall dynamics acting on the impurity site is non-Markovian. With the help of an optimization scheme for the auxiliary Lindblad parameters, an accurate mapping is achieved, which becomes exponentially exact upon increasing $N_B$. The basic idea for this scheme was presented previously in the context of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory. In successive works on improved manybody solution strategies for the auxiliary Lindblad equation, such as Lanczos exact diagonalization or matrix product states, we applied the approach to study the nonequilibrium Kondo regime. In the present paper, we address in detail the mapping procedure itself, rather than the many-body solution. In particular, we investigate the effects of the geometry of the auxiliary system on the accuracy of the mapping for given $N_B$. Specifically, we present a detailed convergence study for five different geometries which, besides being of practical utility, reveals important insights into the underlying mechanisms of the mapping. For setups with onsite or nearest-neighbor Lindblad parameters we find that a representation adopting two separate bath chains is by far more accurate with respect to other choices based on a single chain or a commonly used star geometry. A significant improvement is obtained by allowing for long-ranged and complex Lindblad parameters. These results can be of great value when studying Lindblad-type approaches to correlated systems.

abstract: State-selective enantiomeric excess is realized using microwave-driven coherent population transfer. The method selectively promotes either R- or S- molecules to a higher rotational state by phase-controlled microwave pulses that drive electric-dipole allowed rotational transitions. We demonstrate the method using a racemic mixture of 1,2-propanediol. This method of chiral enrichment can be applied to nearly any chiral molecule that can be vaporized and cooled to the point where rotationally resolved spectroscopy is possible, including molecules that rapidly racemize. The rapid chiral switching demonstrated here allows for new applications in high-precision spectroscopic searches for parity violation in chiral molecules.

abstract: In a tight-binding lattice model with $n$ orbitals (single-particle states) per site, Wannier functions are $n$-component vector functions of position that fall off rapidly away from some location, and such that a set of them in some sense span all states in a given energy band or set of bands; compactly-supported Wannier functions are such functions that vanish outside a bounded region. They arise not only in band theory, but also in connection with tensor-network states for non-interacting fermion systems, and for flat-band Hamiltonians with strictly short-range hopping matrix elements. In earlier work, it was proved that for general complex band structures (vector bundles) or general complex Hamiltonians---that is, class A in the ten-fold classification of Hamiltonians and band structures---a set of compactly-supported Wannier functions can span the vector bundle only if the bundle is topologically trivial, in any dimension $d$ of space, even when use of an overcomplete set of such functions is permitted. This implied that, for a free-fermion tensor network state with a non-trivial bundle in class A, any strictly short-range parent Hamiltonian must be gapless. Here, this result is extended to all ten symmetry classes of band structures without additional crystallographic symmetries, with the result that in general the non-trivial bundles that can arise from compactly-supported Wannier-type functions are those that may possess, in each of $d$ directions, the non-trivial winding that can occur in the same symmetry class in one dimension, but nothing else. The results are obtained from a very natural usage of algebraic $K$-theory, based on a ring of polynomials in $e^{\pm ik_x}$, $e^{\pm ik_y}$, . . . , which occur as entries in the Fourier-transformed Wannier functions.

This procedure is illustrated by explicit calculation of the star product up to the second order in the Planck constant. Our main tools are an operator analog of the twisted convolution and the Zassenhaus formula for the products of exponentials of noncommuting operators.

abstract: Exploring the impact of dimensionality on the quantum dynamics of interacting bosons in traps including particle correlations is an interesting but challenging task. Due to the different participating length scales the modelling of the short-range interactions in three dimensions plays a special role. We review different approaches for the latter and elaborate that for multi-configurational computational strategies finite range potentials are adequate resulting in the need of large grids to resolve the relevant length scales. This results in computational challenges which include also the exponential scaling of complexity with the number of atoms. We show that the recently developed ab-initio Multi-Layer Multi-Configurational Time- Dependent Hartee method for Bosons (ML-MCTDHB) [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 134103 (2013)] can face both numerical challenges and present an efficient numerical implementation of ML-MCTDHB in three spatial dimensions, particularly suited to describe the quantum dynamics for elongated traps. The beneficial scaling of our approach is demonstrated by studying the tunnelling dynamics of bosonic ensembles in a double well. Comparing three-dimensional with quasi-one dimensional simulations, we find dimensionality-induced effects in the density. Furthermore, we study the crossover from weak transversal confinement, where a mean-field description of the system is sufficient, towards tight transversal confinement, where particle correlations and beyond mean-field effects are pronounced.

abstract: Levitated nanodiamonds containing nitrogen vacancy centres in high vacuum are a potential test bed for numerous phenomena in fundamental physics. However, experiments so far have been limited to low vacuum due to heating arising from optical absorption of the trapping laser. We show that milling pure diamond creates nanodiamonds that do not heat up as the optical intensity is raised above 700 GW/m$^2$ below 5 mbar of pressure. This advance now means that the level of attainable vacuum for nanodiamonds in optical dipole traps is no longer temperature limited.
