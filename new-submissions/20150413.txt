abstract: We find that a uniformly accelerated particle detector coupled to the vacuum can cool down as its acceleration increases, due to relativistic effects. We show that in (1+1)-dimensions, a detector coupled to the scalar field vacuum for finite timescales (but long enough to satisfy the KMS condition) has a KMS temperature that decreases with acceleration, in certain regimes. This contrasts with the heating that one would expect from the Unruh effect.

abstract: Nano-structuring impurity-doped crystals affects the phonon density of states and thereby modifies the atomic dynamics induced by interaction with phonons. We propose the use of nano-structured materials in the form of powders or phononic bandgap crystals to enable, or improve, persistent spectral hole-burning and optical coherence for inhomogeneously broadened absorption lines in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. This is crucial for applications such as ultra-precise radio-frequency spectrum analyzers and certain approaches to optical quantum memories. We specifically discuss how phonon engineering can enable spectral hole burning in erbium-doped materials operating in the telecommunication band, and present simulations for density of states of nano-sized powders and phononic crystals for the case of Y$_2$SiO$_5$, a widely-used material in current quantum memory research.

abstract: We introduce an arrival time operator which is self-adjoint and, unlike previously proposed arrival time operators, has a close link to simple measurement models. Its spectrum leads to an arrival time distribution which is a variant of the Kijowski distribution (a re-ordering of the current) in the large momentum regime but is proportional to the kinetic energy density in the small momentum regime, in agreement with measurement models. A brief derivation of the latter distribution is given. We make some simple observations about the physical reasons for self-adjointness, or its absence, in arrival time operators and also compare our operator with the dwell time operator.

abstract: The `Schr\"odinger's cat' thought experiment highlights the counterintuitive facet of quantum theory that entanglement can exist between microscopic and macroscopic systems, producing a superposition of distinguishable states like the fictitious cat that is both alive and dead. The hallmark of entanglement is the detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the violation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this violation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and artificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable states, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations is typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate this reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an oscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can continuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its dependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement between an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a `Bell-cat' state. We use a circuit QED architecture, high-fidelity measurements, and real-time feedback control to violate Bell's inequality without post-selection or corrections for measurement inefficiencies. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of decoherence by continuously varying the size of created Bell-cat states and characterize the entangled system by joint Wigner tomography. These techniques provide a toolset for quantum information processing with entangled qubits and resonators. While recent results have demonstrated a high level of control of such systems, this experiment demonstrates that information can be extracted efficiently and with high fidelity, a crucial requirement for quantum computing with resonators.

abstract: A non-Hermitian system is expected to describe an open system which exchanges energy and particles with external reservoirs. Correspondingly, such an exchange can be adiabatic in the context of quantum mechanics. We investigate a non-Hermitian quantum heat engine (QHE) by a concrete simple two-level system, which is an S = 1/2 spin in a complex external magnetic field. The non- Hermitian PT -symmetric Hamiltonian, as a self-contained one, describes both working medium and reservoirs. A heat-engine cycle is composed of completely quantum adiabatic processes. The heat efficiency is obtained to be the same as that of Hermitian quantum Carnot cycle. The power output of this scheme can be arbitrary high, because the corresponding quantum adiabatic passages do not require a long time scale. A classical analogue of this scheme is also presented.

abstract: We propose an interferometric method for statistically discriminating between nonorthogonal states in high dimensional Hilbert spaces for use in quantum information processing. The method is illustrated for the case of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) states. These states belong to pairs of bases that are mutually unbiased on a sequence of two-dimensional subspaces of the full Hilbert space, but the vectors within the same basis are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. Over multiple trials, this method allows distinguishing OAM eigenstates from superpositions of multiple such eigenstates. Variations of the same method are then shown to be capable of preparing and detecting arbitrary linear combinations of states in Hilbert space. One further variation allows the construction of chains of states obeying recurrence relations on the Hilbert space itself, opening a new range of possibilities for more abstract information-coding algorithms to be carried out experimentally in a simple manner. Among other applications, we show that this approach provides a simplified means of switching between pairs of high-dimensional mutually unbiased OAM bases.

abstract: Several recent experiments have established by measuring the Mandel Q parameter that the number of Rydberg excitations in ultracold gases exhibits sub-Poissonian statistics. This effect is attributed to the Rydberg blockade that occurs due to the strong interatomic interactions between highly-excited atoms. Because of this blockade effect, the system can end up in a state in which all particles are either excited or blocked: a jamming limit. We analyze appropriately constructed random-graph models that capture the blockade effect, and derive formulae for the mean and variance of the number of Rydberg excitations in jamming limits. This yields an explicit relationship between the Mandel Q parameter and the blockade effect, and comparison to measurement data shows strong agreement between theory and experiment.

abstract: Crull (2014) claims that by invoking decoherence it is possible (i) to obviate many ``fine grained'' issues often conflated under the common designation of measurement problem, and (ii) to make substantial progresses in the fields of quantum gravity and quantum cosmology, without any early incorporation of a particular interpretation in the quantum formalism. We point out that Crull is mistaken about decoherence and tacitly assumes some kind of interpretation of the quantum formalism.

abstract: In order to cope with the fact that there exists no single maximally entangled state (up to local unitaries) in the multipartite setting, we introduced in [J. I. de Vicente, C. Spee and B. Kraus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 110502 (2013)] the maximally entangled set of n-partite quantum states. This set consists of the states that are most useful under conversion of pure states via Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). We will review our results here on the maximally entangled set of three- and generic four-qubit states. Moreover, we will discuss the preparation of arbitrary (pure or mixed) bipartite states via deterministic LOCC transformations. Furthermore, we will consider the deterministic preparation of arbitrary three-qubit (four-qubit) states via LOCC using as a resource a six-qubit (23-qubit) state respectively.

abstract: We investigate sudden change (SC) behaviors of the distance-based measures of geometric quantum discords (GQDs) for two non-interacting qubits subject to the two-sided and the one-sided thermal reservoirs. We found that the GQDs defined by different distances exhibit different SCs, and thus the SCs are the combined result of the chosen discord measure and the property of a state. We also found that the thermal reservoir may generate states having different orderings related to different GQDs. These inherent differences of the GQDs reveal that they are incompatible in characterizing quantum correlations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

abstract: Since the inception of quantum mechanics, its validity as a complete description of reality has been challenged due to predictions that defy classical intuition. For many years it was unclear whether predictions like entanglement and projective measurement represented real phenomena or artifacts of an incomplete model. Bell inequalities (BI) provided the first quantitative test to distinguish between quantum entanglement and a yet undiscovered classical hidden variable theory. The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) provides a similar test for projective measurement, and more recently has been adapted to include variable strength measurements to study the process of measurement itself. Here we probe the intersection of both entanglement and measurement through the lens of the hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality (BLGI). By correlating data from ancilla-based weak measurements and direct projective measurements, we for the first time quantify the effect of measurement strength on entanglement collapse. Violation of the BLGI, which we achieve only at the weakest measurement strengths, offers compelling evidence of the completeness of quantum mechanics while avoiding several loopholes common to previous experimental tests. This uniquely quantum result significantly constrains the nature of any possible classical theory of reality. Additionally, we demonstrate that with sufficient scale and fidelity, a universal quantum processor can be used to study richer fundamental physics.

abstract: The setting of M\"ossbauer nuclei embedded in thin-film cavities has facilitated an aspiring platform for x-ray quantum optics as shown in several recently experiments. Here, we generalize the theoretical model of this platform developed in [Phys. Rev. A 88, 043828 (2013)]. The theory description is extended to cover multiple nuclear ensembles and multiple modes in the cavity. While the extensions separately do not lead not to qualitatively new features, their combination gives rise to cooperative effects between the different nuclear ensembles and distinct spectral signatures in the observables. A related experiment [Nature 482, 199 (2012)] is successfully modeled, the scalings derived with semi-classical methods are reproduced, and a microscopic understanding of the setting is obtained by our quantum mechanical description.

abstract: In this paper we introduce quantum Latin squares, combinatorial quantum objects which generalize classical Latin squares, and investigate their applications in quantum computer science. Our main results are on applications to unitary error bases (UEBs), basic structures in quantum information which lie at the heart of procedures such as teleportation, dense coding and error correction. We present a new method for constructing a UEB from a quantum Latin square equipped with extra data. Developing construction techniques for UEBs has been a major activity in quantum computation, with three primary methods proposed: shift-and-multiply, Hadamard, and algebraic. We show that our new approach simultaneously generalizes the shift-and-multiply and Hadamard methods. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a UEB using our technique which we prove cannot be obtained from any of these existing methods.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We study two models describing the interaction of a two-level system with two quantum field modes. The first one is equivalent to a dissipative two-state system with just two boson fields in the absence of tunneling. The second describes two orthogonal fields interacting with the corresponding orthogonal dipoles of a two-level system. We show that both models present a partial two-mode $SU(2)$ symmetry and that they can be solved in the exceptional case of resonant fields. We study their ground state configurations, that is, we find the quantum precursors of the corresponding semi-classical phase transitions, as well as their whole spectra to infer their integrability. We show that the first model in the exceptional case is isomorphic with the quantum Rabi model and allows just two ground state configurations, vacuum and non-vacuum. The second model allows four ground state configurations, one vacuum, two non-vacuum single mode and one non-vacuum dual mode, and give analytic and numerical pointers that may suggest its integrability. We also show that in the single excitation subspace these models can serve as a fast $SU(2)$ beam splitter even in the ultra-strong coupling regime.

abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum information processing and long-distance quantum communication. The field has recently seen a lot of progress, and the present focus issue offers a glimpse of these developments, showing both experimental and theoretical results from many of the leading groups around the world. On the experimental side, it shows work on cold gases, warm vapors, rare-earth ion doped crystals and single atoms. On the theoretical side there are in-depth studies of existing memory protocols, proposals for new protocols including approaches based on quantum error correction, and proposals for new applications of quantum storage. Looking forward, we anticipate many more exciting results in this area.

abstract: We show the presence of universal features in the entanglement entropy of regularized boundary states for (1+1)-d conformal field theories on a circle when the reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing over right/left-moving modes. We derive a general formula for the left-right entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge and the modular S matrix of the theory. When the state is chosen to be an Ishibashi state, this measure of entanglement is shown to reproduce the spatial entanglement entropy in a (2+1)-d TQFT. We explicitly evaluate the left-right entanglement entropies for the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model and the su(2)_k WZW model as examples.

abstract: We concisely review the recent evolution in the study of parafermions -- exotic emergent excitations that generalize Majorana fermions and similarly underpin a host of novel phenomena. First we illustrate the intimate connection between Z_3-symmetric "spin" chains and one-dimensional parafermion lattice models, highlighting how the latter host a topological phase featuring protected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory realization of parafermion zero modes -- focusing on quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional topological insulators -- and describe striking experimental fingerprints that they provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum Hall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware for a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer.

abstract: Entanglement is an essential property of quantum many-body systems. However, its local detection is challenging and was so far limited to spin degrees of freedom in ion chains. Here we measure entanglement between the spins of atoms located on two lattice sites in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain which features both local spin- and particle-number fluctuations. Starting with an initially localized spin impurity, we observe an outwards propagating entanglement wave and show quantitatively how entanglement in the spin sector rapidly decreases with increasing particle-number fluctuations in the chain.

In order to demonstrate quantum light-matter interaction, we establish coupling of quantum dots to our tunable NFBC and achieve an emission enhancement by a factor of 2.7.
