abstract: It is shown that in order for the solutions of the Lindblad equation never to give a decreasing von Neumann entropy, it is necessary and sufficient that the operators appearing in this equation should be unitary linear combinations of their adjoints. In this case, these operators may be replaced with Hermitian operators, without changing the evolution of density matrices.

abstract: Rotating wave approximation (RWA) plays a key rule in quantum optics to solve some Schr\"{o}dinger equation approximately. For example, it is well known that RWA has been used to calculate the transition probability. However, so far no one shows the validity of RWA. Recently Larson [J. Larson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 033601 (2012)] gave the first example showing that the application of RWA in the Jaynes-Cummings model may lead to false conclusions. In this paper, we analytically and numerically show that the application of RWA leads to false conclusions about the transition probability for the near or exact resonance.

title: Circuit design implementing longitudinal coupling: a scalable scheme for superconducting qubits
authors: Susanne Richer, David DiVincenzo

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06138
abstract: We present a circuit construction for a new fixed-frequency superconducting qubit and show how it can be scaled up to a grid with strictly local interactions. The circuit QED realization we propose implements $\sigma_z$-type coupling between a superconducting qubit and any number of $LC$ resonators. The resulting \textit{longitudinal coupling} is inherently different from the usual $\sigma_x$-type \textit{transverse coupling}, which is the one that has been most commonly used for superconducting qubits. In a grid of fixed-frequency qubits and resonators with a particular pattern of always-on interactions, coupling is strictly confined to nearest and next-nearest neighbor resonators; there is never any direct qubit-qubit coupling. We note that just four distinct resonator frequencies, and only a single unique qubit frequency, suffice for the scalability of this scheme. A controlled phase gate between two neighboring qubits can be realized with microwave drives on the qubits, without affecting the other qubits. This fact is a supreme advantage for the scalability of this scheme.

title: Composite pulses for high-fidelity population inversion in optically dense, inhomogeneously broadened atomic ensembles

comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. A
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06155
abstract: We derive composite pulse sequences that achieve high-fidelity excitation of two-state systems in an optically dense, inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. The composite pulses are resistant to distortions due to the back-action of the medium they propagate in and are able to create high-fidelity inversion to optical depths $\alpha z>10$. They function well with smooth pulse shapes used for coherent control of optical atomic transitions in quantum computation and communication. They are an intermediary solution between single $\pi$-pulse excitation schemes and adiabatic passage schemes, being far more error tolerant than the former but still considerably faster than the latter.

title: Quantum Thermodynamics, Entropy of the Universe, Free Energy, and the Second Law
authors: George L. Barnes, Michael E. Kellman

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06176
abstract: We take the view that the standard von Neumann definition, in which the entropy $S^{vN}$ of a pure state is zero, is in evident conflict with the statement of the second law that the entropy of the universe $S_{univ}$ increases in spontaneous processes, $ \Delta S_{univ} > 0$. Here we seek an alternative entropy of the universe $S_{univ}$ that is in accord with the second law, in a spirit not dissimilar to von Neumann himself in lesser-known work. We perform simulations of time dependent dynamics for a previously developed \cite{polyadbath} model quantum system becoming entangled with a quantum environment. We test the new definition of the entropy of the system-environment "universe" against the standard thermodynamic relation $ \Delta F_{sys} = - T \Delta S_{univ} $, calculating system properties using the reduced density matrix and standard von Neumann entropy. Good agreement is obtained, showing the compatibility of an entropy for a pure state of a universe with the statement of the second law and the concept of free energy. Interesting deviation from microcanonical behavior within the zero order energy shell is observed in a context of effectively microcanonical behavior within the much larger total basis of the time dependent universe.

abstract: We theoretically introduce and experimentally demonstrate the realization of a nonclassicality test that allows for arbitrarily low detection efficiency without invoking any extra assumptions as independence of the devices. Our test and its implementation is set in a prepare-and-measure scenario with an upper limit on the communication capacity of the channel through which the systems are communicated. The essence for our novel test is the use of two preparation and two measurement devices, which are randomly paired in each round. Our work opens up the possibility of experimental realizations of device independent protocols with current off-the-shelf technology.

NV$^-$ centers were created by irradiating a Type 1b single-crystal diamond along the [100] axis with 200 keV electrons from a transmission electron microscope with varying doses to achieve spots of different NV$^-$ center concentrations. Values of ($1/T_1$) were measured for each spot as a function of $B$.

abstract: Thermodynamics is a phenomenological theory of heat and work. Here we analyze to what extent quantum thermodynamic relations are immune to the underlying mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. As a main result, we show that the Jarzynski equality holds true for all non-hermitian quantum systems with real spectrum. This equality expresses the second law of thermodynamics for isothermal processes arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In the quasistatic limit however, the second law is reflected in the Carnot bound and it is fulfilled even if some eigenenergies are complex provided they appear in conjugate pairs. Furthermore, we propose a setup to test our predictions. The quantum system in question consists of strongly interacting excitons and photons in a semiconductor microcavity.

abstract: A quantum walk places a traverser into a superposition of both graph location and traversal "spin." The walk is defined by an initial condition, an evolution determined by a unitary coin/shift-operator, and a measurement based on the sampling of the probability distribution generated from the quantum wavefunction. Simple quantum walks are studied analytically, but for large graph structures with complex topologies, numerical solutions are typically required. For the quantum theorist, the Gremlin graph traversal machine and language can be used for the numerical analysis of quantum walks on such structures. Additionally, for the graph theorist, the adoption of quantum walk principles can transform what are currently side-effect laden traversals into pure, stateless functional flows. This is true even when the constraints of quantum mechanics are not fully respected (e.g. reversible and unitary evolution). In sum, Gremlin allows both types of theorist to leverage each other's constructs for the advancement of their respective disciplines.

abstract: Bit commitment and coin flipping occupy a unique place in the device-independent landscape, as the only device-independent protocols thus far suggested for these tasks are reliant on tripartite GHZ correlations. Indeed, we know of no other bipartite tasks, which admit a device-independent formulation, but which are not known to be implementable using only bipartite nonlocality. Another interesting feature of these protocols is that the pseudo-telepathic nature of GHZ correlations -- in contrast to the generally statistical character of nonlocal correlations, such as those arising in the violation of the CHSH inequality -- is essential to their formulation and analysis. In this work, we present a device-independent bit commitment protocol based on CHSH testing, which achieves the same security as the optimal GHZ-based protocol. The protocol is analyzed in the most general settings, where the devices are used repeatedly and may have long-term quantum memory. We also recast the protocol in a post-quantum setting where both honest and dishonest parties are restricted only by the impossibility of signaling, and find that overall the supra-quantum structure allows for greater security.

abstract: Photocells based on a simple optical transition suffer a fundamental efficiency threshold imposed by the principle of detailed balance, reflecting the fact that good absorbers must necessarily also be fast emitters. This limitation can be overcome by `parking' the energy of an absorbed photon in a `dark state' which neither absorbs nor emits light. Here we argue that suitable dark-states occur naturally as a consequence of the dipole-dipole interaction between two proximal optical dipoles for a wide range of realistic molecular dimers. We develop an intuitive model of a photocell comprising two light-absorbing molecules coupled to an idealised reaction centre, showing asymmetric dimers are capable of providing a significant enhancement of light-to-current conversion under ambient conditions. We conclude by presenting a host of candidate molecules meeting the requirements for realising such a system.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06336
abstract: We quantitatively analyze superradiance (collective emission) in a three-dimensional array of qubits without imposing any restrictions on the size of the sample. We show that even when the spacing between the qubits become arbitrarily large, superradiance produces an error rate on each qubit that scales with the total number of qubits. This is because the sum of the norms of the effective Hamiltonians that decoheres each qubit scales with the total number of qubits and is, therefore, unbounded. In three spatial dimensions, the sum of the norms scales as $N^{2/3}$ where $N$ is the total number of qubits in the computer. Because the sum of the Hamiltonian norms are unbounded, the introduced errors are outside the applicability of the threshold theorem.

abstract: This work establishes connection between channel simulation and coded source compression. First, we consider classical source coding with quantum side-information where the quantum side-information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory by Winter, a quantum to classical channel simulation. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal rate region. We then study coded source compression in the fully quantum regime. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. Our work hence resolves coded source compression in the quantum regime.

abstract: Stochastic chains represent a wide and key variety of phenomena in many branches of science within the context of Information Theory and Thermodynamics. They are typically approached by a sequence of independent events or by a memoryless Markov process. Here, we demonstrate that when memory is introduced, the statistics of the system depends on the mechanism by which objects or symbols are assembled, even in the slow dynamics limit wherein friction can be neglected. To analyse these systems, we introduce a sequence-dependent partition function, investigate its properties and compare it to the standard normalization defined by the statistical physics of ensembles. Then, we study the behaviour of the entropy and the internal energy in this intrinsic, directional chains finding that they vary around their thermally-induced equilibrium analogues due to memory effects. We anticipate that our results are necessary to interpret configurational order and information transfer in many molecular systems within Materials Science, Biophysics, Communication and Engineering.

abstract: All quantum optomechanics experiments to date operate at cryogenic temperatures, imposing severe technical challenges and fundamental constraints. Here we present a novel design of on-chip mechanical resonators which exhibit fundamental modes with frequencies $f$ and mechanical quality factors $Q_\mathrm{m}$ sufficient to enter the optomechanical quantum regime at room temperature. We overcome previous limitations by designing ultra-thin, high-stress silicon nitride membranes, with tensile stress in the resonators' clamps close to the ultimate yield strength of the material. By patterning a photonic crystal on the SiN membranes, we observe reflectivities greater than 99%. These on-chip resonators have remarkably low mechanical dissipation, with $Q_\mathrm{m}$$\sim$$10^8$, which makes them a unique platform for experiments towards the observation of massive quantum behavior at room temperature.

abstract: Symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) phases of matter have no topological order, and are protected by symmetries of the Hamiltonian. They are the product-state analogue of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. SPt and SPT phases can be adiabatically connected to each other when interaction terms that break the symmetries protecting the SPT order are added in the Hamiltonian. It is also known that spin-1 SPT phases in quantum spin chains can emerge as effective intermediate phases of spin-2 Hamiltonians. In this paper we show that a similar scenario is also valid for SPt phases. More precisely, we show that for a given spin-2 quantum chain, effective intermediate spin-1 SPt phases emerge in some regions of the phase diagram, these also being adiabatically connected to non-trivial intermediate SPT phases. We characterize the phase diagram of our model by studying quantities such as the entanglement entropy, symmetry-related order parameters, and 1-site fidelities. Our numerical analysis uses Matrix Product States (MPS) and the infinite Time-Evolving Block Decimation (iTEBD) method to approximate ground states of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we provide a field theory description of the quantum phase transitions between the SPt phases. Together with the numerical results, such a description shows that the transitions can be described by Conformal Field Theories (CFT) with central charge $c=1$. Our results are in agreement, and further generalize, those in [Y. Fuji, F. Pollmann, M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 177204 (2015)].
