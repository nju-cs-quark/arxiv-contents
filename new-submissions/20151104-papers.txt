abstract: Bath engineering, which utilizes coupling to lossy modes in a quantum system to generate non-trivial steady states, is a tantalizing alternative to gate- and measurement-based quantum science. Here, we demonstrate dissipative stabilization of entanglement between two superconducting transmon qubits in a symmetry-selective manner. We utilize the engineered symmetries of the dissipative environment to stabilize a target Bell state; we further demonstrate suppression of the Bell state of opposite symmetry due to parity selection rules. This implementation is resource-efficient, achieves a steady-state fidelity $\mathcal{F} = 0.70$, and is scalable to multiple qubits.

abstract: Achieving effectively adiabatic dynamics in finite time is a ubiquitous goal in virtually all areas of modern physics. So-called shortcuts to adiabaticity refer to a set of methods and techniques that allow to produce in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. In the present work we generalize one of these methods -- the fast-forward technique -- to driven Dirac dynamics. As a main result we find that shortcuts to adiababticity for the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac equation are facilitated by a combination of both, scalar and pseudoscalar potentials. Our findings are illustrated for two analytically solvable examples, namely charged particles driven in spatially homogeneous and linear vector fields.

abstract: Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum computation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary transformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum circuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources can `derandomize' circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles quantum mechanically, (analogously to a quantum random number generator). Furthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose statistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution over all unitaries up to order $t$, while foregoing adaptive feed-forward entirely. Such ensembles -- known as $t$-designs -- often cannot be distinguished from the `truly' random ensemble, and so they find use in many applications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness.

abstract: Fibonacci anyons are non-Abelian particles for which braiding is universal for quantum computation. Reichardt has shown how to systematically generate nontrivial braids for three Fibonacci anyons which yield unitary operations with off-diagonal matrix elements that can be made arbitrarily small in a particular natural basis through a simple and efficient iterative procedure. This procedure does not require brute force search, the Solovay-Kitaev method, or any other numerical technique, but the phases of the resulting diagonal matrix elements cannot be directly controlled. We show that despite this lack of control the resulting braids can be used to systematically construct entangling gates for two qubits encoded by Fibonacci anyons.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00727
abstract: Rigorously establishing that the error in an experimental quantum operation is beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently requires considering the worst-case error, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the average gate infidelities routinely reported in experiments. We show that an improved bound on the worst-case error can be obtained by also considering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of $\approx 2.45$ for unital qubit channels. We prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most on the order of the average gate infidelity and so is negligible relative to any coherent contribution. We also show that the ``average'' error rate when measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the system exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent noise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for the diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known).

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00729
abstract: A local and deterministic model of quantum correlations is always possible, as shown explicitly by Brans in 1988: one simply needs the physical systems being measured to have a suitable statistical correlation with the physical systems performing the measurement, via some common cause. Hence, to derive no-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement independence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption --- less than 1/15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state of two qubits --- with ramifications for the security of quantum communication protocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations whatsoever --- even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling --- have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that `quantum nonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not equate to `experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that no more than 2 log d bits of prior correlation are required for a local deterministic model of the correlations between any two d-dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: The goal of adiabatic ground-state preparation is to start a simple quantum system in its ground state and adiabatically evolve the Hamiltonian to a complex one, maintaining the ground state throughout the evolution. In ion-trap-based quantum simulations, coherence times are too short to allow for adiabatic evolution for large chains, so the system evolves diabatically, creating excitations to higher energy states. Because the probability for diabatic excitation depends exponentially on the excitation energy and because the thermal distribution also depends exponentially on the excitation energy, we investigate whether the diabatic excitation can create a thermal distribution; as this could serve as an alternative for creating thermal states of complex quantum systems without requiring contact with a heat bath. In this work, we explore this relationship and determine situations where diabatic excitation can approximately create such a thermal state.

abstract: Realizing systems that support robust, controlled interactions between individual photons is an exciting frontier of nonlinear optics. To this end, one approach that has emerged recently is to leverage atomic interactions to create strong and spatially non-local interactions between photons. In particular, effective interactions have been successfully created via interactions between atoms excited to Rydberg levels. Here, we investigate an alternative approach, in which atomic interactions arise via their common coupling to photonic crystal waveguides. This technique takes advantage of the ability to separately tailor the strength and range of interactions via the dispersion engineering of the structure itself, which can lead to qualitatively new types of phenomena. As an example, we discuss the formation of correlated transparency windows, in which photonic states of a certain number and shape selectively propagate through the system. Through this technique, we show in particular that one can create molecular-like potentials that lead to molecular bound states of photon pairs.

abstract: We propose a general and non-destructive probing scheme to detect and characterize the superfluid excitation spectrum of cold atoms in optical lattices. The protocol relies on a local collisional interaction between an embedded impurity and the surrounding atomic ensemble. By tuning a few controllable external parameters the impurity-lattice interaction can be engineered and information regarding the dispersion relation of the superfluid phonons can be reliably extracted. We describe the general theory and provide an example to show its validity.

abstract: We investigate two-photon quantum interference in an opaque scattering medium that intrinsically supports $10^6$ transmission channels. By adaptive spatial phase-modulation of the incident wavefronts, the photons are directed at targeted speckle spots or output channels. From $10^3$ experimentally available coupled channels, we select two channels and enhance their transmission, to realize the equivalent of a fully programmable $2\times2$ beam splitter. By sending pairs of single photons from a parametric down-conversion source through the opaque scattering medium, we observe two-photon quantum interference. The programmed beam splitter need not fulfill energy conservation over the two selected output channels and hence could be non-unitary. Consequently, we have the freedom to tune the quantum interference from bunching (Hong-Ou-Mandel-like) to antibunching. Our results establish opaque scattering media as a platform for high-dimensional quantum interference that is notably relevant for boson sampling and physical-key-based authentication.

abstract: Generating entangled photons from a monolithic chip is a major milestone towards real-life applications of optical quantum information processing including quantum key distribution and quantum computing. Ultrabroadband entangled photons are of particular interest to various applications such as quantum metrology and multi-party entanglement distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the direct generation of broadband wavelength multiplexed polarization entangled photons from a semiconductor chip for the first time. Without the use of any on-chip compensation, interferometry, entangled photons with a signal-idler separation as large as 95 nm in the telecom band were observed. The highest concurrence of 0.98$\pm$0.01 achieved in this work is also the highest, to the best of our knowledge, comparing to all previously demonstrated semiconductor waveguide sources. This work paves the way for fully integrated, ultrabroadband sources of polarization entangled photons.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation has received increasing attention due to its robustness against control errors. However, all the previous schemes have to use at least two sequentially implemented gates to realize a general one-qubit gate. In this paper, we put forward a novelty scheme by which one can directly realize an arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gate with a single-shot implementation, avoiding the extra work of combining two gates into one. Based on a three-level model driven by laser pulses, we show that any single-qubit holonomic gate can be realized by varying the detuning, amplitude, and phase of lasers. Our scheme is compatible with previously proposed non-adiabatic holonomic two-qubit gates, combining with which the arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gates can play universal non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We also investigate the effects of some unavoidable realistic errors on our scheme.

abstract: Superradiance, i.e., spontaneous emission of coherent radiation by an ensemble of identical two-level atoms in collective states introduced by Dicke in 1954, is one of the enigmatic problems of quantum optics. The startling gist is that even though the atoms have no dipole moment they radiate with increased intensity in particular directions. Following the advances in our understanding of superradiant emission by atoms in entangled $W$ states we examine the quantum statistical properties of superradiance. Such investigations require the system to have at least two excitations as one needs to explore the photon-photon correlations of the radiation emitted by such states. We present specifically results for the spatially resolved photon-photon correlations of systems prepared in doubly excited $W$ states and give conditions when the atomic system emits nonclassial light. Equally, we derive the conditions for the occurrence of bunching and even of superbunching, a rare phenomenon otherwise known only from nonclassical states of light like the squeezed vacuum. We finally investigate the photon-photon cross correlations of the spontaneously scattered light and highlight the nonclassicalty of such correlations.

abstract: The existence of incompatible measurement setups is one of the distinctive features of quantum theory. Here we extend the notion of incompatibility from measurements that test preparations to measurements that test dynamical processes. Such measurements, known as testers, consist of the preparation of an input state, the application of the tested process, and a measurement on the output. Mathematically, testers are described by a suitable generalization of the notion of positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Unlike in the case of POVMs, however, testers that commute are not necessarily compatible, and testers that are compatible do not necessarily commute. Given a set of testers, we define the robustness of incompatibility as the minimum amount of mixing needed to make the testers compatible. We show that (i) the robustness is lower bounded by the distinguishability of the input states prepared by the different testers, and (ii) maximum robustness is attained when the input states are orthogonal. An extensive analysis of incompatibility is provided for factorized qubit testers with two outcomes. All our results can be extended to measurements that test quantum processes consisting of multiple time steps.

abstract: Interactions between many-body atomic systems and light in cavities induce new atomic dynamics, which we show can be tailored by projective light measurement backaction, leading to collective effects such as density-density interactions, perfectly-correlated atomic tunneling, superexchange, and effective pair creation and annihilation. These can be long- and short-range, with tunable strengths, based on the optical setup. We show this provides a framework to enhance quantum simulations of novel physical phenomena, including reservoir models and dynamical gauge fields, beyond current methods.

Apart from the well known standard dephasing mechanism which is temperature dependent an alternative mechanism is presented, the spin-swap dephasing which does not need initial bath activation and is temperature independent. We show that for dipolar interaction the separation of time scales between system and bath can not produce pure dephasing, the process being accompained by dissipation. Activated and non activated dephasing processes are demonstrated in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center.

abstract: We identify and study a new security loophole in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) implementations, related to the imperfect linearity of the homodyne detector. By exploiting this loophole, we propose an active side-channel attack on the Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol combining an intercept-resend attack with an induced saturation of the homodyne detection on the receiver side (Bob). We show that an attacker can bias the excess noise estimation by displacing the quadratures of the coherent states received by Bob. We propose a saturation model that matches experimental measurements on the homodyne detection and use this model to study the impact of the saturation attack on parameter estimation in CV-QKD.We demonstrate that this attack can bias the excess noise estimation beyond the null key threshold for any system parameter, thus leading to a full security break. If we consider an additional criteria imposing that the channel transmission estimation should not be affected by the attack, then the saturation attack can only be launched if the attenuation on the quantum channel is sufficient, corresponding to attenuations larger than approximately 6 dB. We moreover discuss the possible counter-measures against the saturation attack and propose a new counter- measure based on Gaussian post-selection that can be implemented by classical post-processing and may allow to distill secret key when the raw measurement data is partly saturated.

abstract: The gravitational field of a laser pulse of finite lifetime, is investigated in the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small, they may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the gravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the norm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise for circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent of the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are confined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these shells are associated with the emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby test particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled from the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption. Examples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that massless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are co-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test particles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger than for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational effect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed out. The spacetime curvature close to the pulse is compared to that induced by gravitational waves from astronomical sources.

In this work we analytically calculate this new quantity, the volume of violation, for the spin-singlet state with respect to the settings of the first Bell's inequality. The full characterization of these settings corresponds to three directions in space, or three arbitrary points on the unit sphere. It is shown that the triples of directions that lead to violations in local causality correspond to $1/3$ of all possible orientation triples.

abstract: In our quantum mechanics courses, measurement is usually taught in passing, as an ad-hoc procedure involving the ugly collapse of the wave function. No wonder we search for more satisfying alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation. But this overlooks the fact that the approach fits very well with modern measurement theory with its notions of the conditioned state and quantum trajectory. In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen interpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers like Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these earlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more satisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the collapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device. Along the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that spread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states are the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories. We then describe how the conditioned state of a quantum system depends crucially on how the system is monitored illustrating this with the example of a decaying atom monitored with a time of arrival photon detector, leading to Bohr's quantum jumps. On the other hand, other kinds of detection lead to much smoother behaviour, providing yet another example of complementarity. Finally we explain how classical behaviour emerges, including classical mechanics but also thermodynamics.

In this proceeding, we present the a full calculation of the temperature dependent chiral condensate of this model in the continuum limit using Matrix Product States (MPS). MPS methods, in general tensor networks, constitute a very promising technique for the non-perturbative study of Hamiltonian quantum systems. In the last few years, they have shown their suitability as ansatzes for ground states and low-lying excita- tions of lattice gauge theories. We show the feasibility of the approach also for finite temperature, both in the massless and in the massive case.

For this, we study the global time-averaged transport efficiency of excitations on complex quantum networks. Further, we observe the transition to optimal transport by starting from a network with complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs and systematically reducing the number of loops. These effects are explained on the basis of the spectral properties of the network's Hamiltonian. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical Monte-Carlo simulations for complex quantum networks with a scale-free size distribution of sequential subgraphs and a small-world-type transition to optimal transport.

Gerritsma et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 080402 (2012)] as a source of entanglement between a Bose-Einstein condensate and an ion. Compared to the previous study, the present work aims at performing a detailed and accurate many-body analysis of such combined atomic quantum system by means of the ab-initio multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons, which allows to take into account all correlations in the system. The analysis elucidates the importance of quantum correlations in the bosonic ensemble and reveals that entanglement generation between an ion and a condensate is indeed possible, as previously predicted. Moreover, we provide an intuitive picture of the impact of the correlations on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by employing a natural orbital analysis which we show to be indeed experimentally verifiable.

abstract: The micro-world is governed by the laws of Quantum Theory. Although we cannot directly experience Quantum Mechanics in action, it imperceptibly enters our everyday life. It explains the structure of matter on the one hand and stands behind all modern technologies on the other. It also gives a completely different meaning to the classical concept of identical objects. Quantum identical particles are identical not only because they share the same mass, spin, charge, etc., but also because they cannot be identified by tracing their history. Indistinguishability results in a division of the world of elementary particles into fundamentally different families: fermions (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons) and bosons (e.g. photons, gluons, Higgs boson). Identical fermions subjected to the Fermi-Dirac statistics cannot occupy the same quantum state. Here we show yet another, so far undiscovered, consequence of quantum indistinguishability. We show that identical fermions confined by an external trapping potential arrange themselves in spectacular geometric structures although no mutual interaction is present. This is because the indistinguishability of fermions, formulated in the language of the Pauli exclusion principle, prevents any two fermions from being at the same location. These unexplored geometric structures, Pauli crystals, emerge repeatedly in single-shot pictures of the many-body system. Pauli crystals form a previously unknown form of particles' organization. Our results shed some light on the role of quantum statistics -- one of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics of many-body systems.

However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime impossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as any kind of quantum rate theory that can reproduce the TST in the proper classical limit, which is not guaranteed to be unique. Indeed, there have been various versions of QTST based on different formulations and approximations. Recently, contrary to this commonly accepted view, Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 138}, 084108 (2013)] made an argument that a true and unique QTST can be defined as the exact $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a certain quantum flux-side time correlation function and that it is equivalent to the rate expression from the ring polymer molecular dynamics TST. However, the starting expression for HA's QTST does not appear to have a clear physical basis. In addition, a careful analysis of the formulation underlying HA's arguments clarifies that a key step implicit in their conclusion amounts to an incorrect application of a quantum mechanical identity. As an alternative, we provide a new quantum rate expression by applying a recently developed formalism of real time dynamics of imaginary time path integrals [S. Jang, A. V. Sinitskiy, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 140}, 154103 (2014)] to a well-established rate expression based on quantum linear response theory. In turn, the new rate expression satisfies the property that the $t\rightarrow 0_+ $ limit of QTST should vanish due to quantum delocalization as well as noncommutativity of population and flux operators.
