abstract: Measurement of an observable on a quantum system involves a probabilistic collapse of the quantum state and a corresponding measurement outcome. L\"uders and von Neumann state update rules attempt to describe the above phenomenological observations. These rules are identical for a nondegenerate observable, but differ for a degenerate observable. While L\"uders rule preserves superpositions within a degenerate subspace under a measurement of the corresponding degenerate observable, the von Neumann rule does not. Recently Hegerfeldt and Mayato [Phys. Rev. A, 85, 032116 (2012)] had formulated a protocol to discriminate between the two types of measuring devices. Here we have reformulated this protocol for quantum registers comprising of system and ancilla qubits. We then experimentally investigated this protocol using nulear spin systems with the help of NMR techniques, and found that L\"uders rule is favoured.

abstract: The theory of majorization and its variants, including thermomajorization, have been found to play a central role in the formulation of many physical resource theories, ranging from entanglement theory to quantum thermodynamics. Here we formulate the framework of quantum relative Lorenz curves, and show how it is able to unify majorization, thermomajorization, and their noncommutative analogues. In doing so, we define the family of Hilbert $\alpha$-divergences and show how it relates with other divergences used in quantum information theory. We then apply these tools to the problem of deciding the existence of a suitable transformation from an initial pair of quantum states to a final one, focusing in particular on applications to the resource theory of athermality, a precursor of quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: We investigate $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum systems ultra-weakly coupled to an environment. We find that such open systems evolve under $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric, purely dephasing and unital dynamics. The dynamical map describing the evolution is then determined explicitly using a quantum canonical transformation. Furthermore, we provide an explanation of why $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric dephasing type interactions lead to \emph{critical slowing down of decoherence}. This effect is further exemplified with an experimentally relevant system -- a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric qubit easily realizable, \emph{e.g.}, in optical or microcavity experiments.

abstract: The mathematical basis for the Gaussian entanglement is discussed in detail, as well as its implications in the internal space-time structure of relativistic extended particles. It is shown that the Gaussian entanglement shares the same set of mathematical formulas with the harmonic oscillator in the Lorentz-covariant world. It is thus possible to transfer the concept of entanglement to the Lorentz-covariant picture of the bound state which requires both space and time separations between two constituent particles. These space and time variables become entangled as the bound state moves with a relativistic speed. It is shown also that our inability to measure the time-separation variable leads to an entanglement entropy together with a rise in the temperature of the bound state. As was noted by Paul A. M. Dirac in 1963, the system of two oscillators contains the symmetries of O(3,2) de Sitter group containing two O(3,1) Lorentz groups as its subgroups. Dirac noted also that the system contains the symmetry of the Sp(4) group which serves as the basic language for two-mode squeezed states. Since the Sp(4) symmetry contains both rotations and squeezes, one interesting case is the combination of rotation and squeeze resulting in a shear. While the current literature is mostly on the entanglement based on squeeze along the normal coordinates, the shear transformation is an interesting future possibility. The mathematical issues on this problem are clarified.

abstract: Detector-device-independent quantum key distribution (ddiQKD) held the promise of being robust to detector side-channels, a major security loophole in QKD implementations. In contrast to what has been claimed, however, we demonstrate that the security of ddiQKD is not based on post-selected entanglement, and we introduce various eavesdropping strategies that show that ddiQKD is in fact insecure against detector side-channel attacks as well as against other attacks that exploit device's imperfections of the receiver. Our attacks are valid even when the QKD apparatuses are built by the legitimate users of the system themselves, and thus free of malicious modifications, which is a key assumption in ddiQKD.

abstract: We devise a systematic method to determine the Fisher information required for resolving two incoherent point sources with a diffraction-limited linear imaging device. The resulting Cram\'er-Rao bound gives the lowest variance achievable for an unbiased estimator. When only intensity in the image plane is recorded, this bound diverges as the separation between the sources tends to zero, an effect which has been dubbed as Rayleigh's curse. However, this curse can be lifted using suitable coherent measurements. In particular, we determine a class of measurements that can be easily implemented as projections on the orthogonalised derivatives of the point spread function of the system.

abstract: Two-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect are relevant tools for quantum metrology and quantum information processing. In optical coherence tomography, HOM effect is exploited to achieve high-resolution measurements with the width of the HOM dip being the main parameter. On the other hand, applications like dense coding require high-visibility performances. Here we address high-order dispersion effects in two-photon interference and study, theoretically and experimentally, the dependence of the visibility and the width of the HOM dip on both the pump spectrum and the downconverted photon spectrum. In particular, a spatial light modulator is exploited to experimentally introduce and manipulate a custom phase function to simulate the high-order dispersion effects.

abstract: Entanglement of light and matter is an essential resource for effective quantum engineering. In particular, collective states of atomic ensembles are robust against decoherence while preserving the possibility of strong interaction with quantum states of light. Such light-atom systems are capable of generating and storing continuous-variable (CV) entanglement, which is critical for novel quantum communication, computation and imaging schemes. While previous approaches to CV quantum interfaces have relied on quadratures of light , here we present an approach based on spatial structure of light-atom entanglement. We create and characterize a 12-dimensional entangled state exhibiting quantum correlations between a photon and an atomic ensemble in position and momentum bases. This state allows us to demonstrate the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox with two different entities, with an unprecedented delay time of 6 $\mu$s between generation of entanglement and detection of the atomic state.

abstract: We investigate the first-order theory of closed subspaces of complex Hilbert spaces in the signature $(\lor,\perp,0)$, where `$\perp$' is orthogonality. Our main result is that already its purely implicational fragment is undecidable: there is no algorithm to decide whether an implication between equations in the language of orthomodular lattices is valid in all complex Hilbert spaces. This is a simple corollary of a recent result of Slofstra in combinatorial group theory, and follows upon reinterpreting that result in terms of the hypergraph approach to contextuality.

abstract: We present truly ultimate limits on covert quantum communication by exploiting quantum-mechanical properties of the Minkowski vacuum in the quantum field theory framework. Our main results are the following: We show how two parties equipped with Unruh-DeWitt detectors can covertly communicate at large distances without the need of hiding in a thermal background or relying on various technological tricks. We reinstate the information-theoretic security standards for reliability of asymptotic quantum communication and show that the rate of covert communication is strictly positive. Therefore, contrary to the previous conclusions, covert and reliable quantum communication is possible.

abstract: A strong limitation of linear optical quantum computing is the probabilistic operation of two-quantum bit gates based on the coalescence of indistinguishable photons. A route to deterministic operation is to exploit the single-photon nonlinearity of an atomic transition. Through engineering of the atom-photon interaction, phase shifters, photon filters and photon- photon gates have been demonstrated with natural atoms. Proofs of concept have been reported with semiconductor quantum dots, yet limited by inefficient atom-photon interfaces and dephasing. Here we report on a highly efficient single-photon filter based on a large optical non-linearity at the single photon level, in a near-optimal quantum-dot cavity interface. When probed with coherent light wavepackets, the device shows a record nonlinearity threshold around $0.3 \pm 0.1$ incident photons. We demonstrate that directly reflected pulses consist of 80% single-photon Fock state and that the two- and three-photon components are strongly suppressed compared to the single-photon one.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of generating pure heralded single photons through spontaneous parametric down-conversion comparing the counter-propagating geometry studied in [1] with more conventional co-propagating configurations which enhance the purity of the heralded photon state through the technique of group-velocity matching. We estimate the Schmidt number associated to the temporal modes as a function of the pump pulse duration for three particular configurations, showing how the different phase-matching conditions influences the degree of separability that can be achieved.

abstract: Negative entropy in connection with the Casimir effect at uniform temperature is a phenomenon rooted in the circumstance that one is describing a nonclosed system, or only part of a closed system. In this paper we show that the phenomenon is not necessarily restricted to electromagnetic theory, but can be derived from the quantum theory of interacting harmonic oscillators, most typically two oscillators interacting not directly but indirectly via a third one. There are two such models, actually analogous to the transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes in electrodynamics. These mechanical models in their simplest version were presented some years ago, by J. S. H{\o}ye et al., Physical Review E {\bf 67}, 056116 (2003). In the present paper we re-emphasize the physical significance of the mechanical picture, and extend the theory so as to include the case where there are several mediating oscillators, instead of only one. The TE oscillator exhibits negative entropy. Finally, we show explicitly how the interactions via the electromagnetic field contain the two oscillator models.

abstract: Of late there has been a surge of interest in localised phonon polariton resonators which allow for sub-diffraction confinement of light in the mid-infrared spectral region by coupling to optical phonons at the surface of polar dielectrics. Resonators are generally etched on deep substrates which support propagative surface phonon polariton resonances. Recent experimental work has shown that understanding the coupling between localised and propagative surface phonon polaritons in these systems is vital to correctly describe the system resonances. In this paper we comprehensively investigate resonators composed of arrays of cylindrical SiC resonators on SiC substrates. Our bottom-up approach, starting from the resonances of single, free standing cylinders and isolated substrates, and exploiting both numerical and analytical techniques, allows us to develop a consistent understanding of the parameter space of those resonators, putting on firmer ground this blossoming technology.

abstract: In arXiv:1407.8203, we introduced the idea of s-sourcery, a general formalism for building many-body quantum ground states using renormalization-group-inspired quantum circuits. Here we define a generalized notion of s-sourcery that applies to mixed states, and study its properties and applicability. We prove a number of theorems establishing the prevalence of mixed s-source fixed points. For our examples we focus on thermal states of local Hamiltonians. Thermal double states (also called thermofield double states) and the machinery of approximate conditional independence are used heavily in the constructions.

abstract: Diabolical points (degeneracies) can naturally occur in spectra of two-dimensional quantum systems and classical wave resonators due to simple symmetries. Geometric Berry phase is associated with these spectral degeneracies. Here, we demonstrate a diabolical point and the corresponding Berry phase in the spectrum of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles -- exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. It is well known that sufficiently strong optical pumping can drive exciton-polaritons to quantum degeneracy, whereby they form a macroscopically populated quantum coherent state similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. By pumping a microcavity with a spatially structured light, we create a two-dimensional quantum billiard for the exciton-polariton condensate and demonstrate a diabolical point in the spectrum of the billiard eigenstates. The fully reconfigurable geometry of the potential walls controlled by the optical pump enables a striking experimental visualisation of the Berry phase associated with the diabolical point. The Berry phase is observed and measured by direct imaging of the macroscopic exciton-polariton wavefunctions.

abstract: Context: Some stellar objects exhibit very narrow spectral lines in the visible range additional to their blackbody radiation. Natural lasing has been suggested as a mechanism to explain narrow lines in Wolf-Rayet stars. However, the spectral resolution of conventional astronomical spectrographs is still about two orders of magnitude too low to test this hypothesis. Aims: We want to resolve the linewidth of narrow spectral emissions in starlight. Methods: A combination of spectral filtering with single-photon-level temporal correlation measurements breaks the resolution limit of wavelength-dispersing spectrographs by moving the linewidth measurement into the time domain. Results: We demonstrate in a laboratory experiment that temporal intensity interferometry can determine a 20 MHz wide linewidth of Doppler-broadened laser light, and identify a coherent laser light contribution in a blackbody radiation background.

abstract: We study the statistics of the local resolvent and non-ergodic properties of eigenvectors for a generalised Rosenzweig-Porter $N\times N$ random matrix model, undergoing two transitions separated by a delocalised non-ergodic phase. Interpreting the model as the combination of on-site random energies $\{a_i\}$ and a structurally disordered hopping, we found that each eigenstate is delocalised over $N^{2-\gamma}$ sites close in energy $|a_j-a_i|\leq N^{1-\gamma}$ in agreement with Kravtsov et al, arXiv:1508.01714. Our other main result, obtained combining a recurrence relation for the resolvent matrix with insights from Dyson's Brownian motion, is to show that the properties on the non-ergodic delocalised phase can be probed studying the statistics of the local resolvent in a non-standard scaling limit.

abstract: Several platforms are currently being explored for simulating physical systems whose complexity increases faster than polynomially with the number of particles or degrees of freedom in the system. Defects and vacancies in semiconductors or dielectric materials, magnetic impurities embedded in solid helium \cite{lemeshko13}, atoms in optical lattices, photons, trapped ions and superconducting q-bits are among the candidates for predicting the behaviour of spin glasses, spin-liquids, and classical magnetism among other phenomena with practical technological applications. Here we investigate the potential of polariton graphs as an efficient simulator for finding the global minimum of the $XY$ Hamiltonian. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke geometries we show that we can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing the U(1) symmetry breaking transitions. We realise various magnetic phases, such as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations on unit cells of various lattices: square, triangular, linear and a disordered graph. Our results provide a route to study unconventional superfluids, spin-liquids, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, classical magnetism among the many systems that are described by the $XY$ Hamiltonian.
