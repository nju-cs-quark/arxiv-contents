abstract: A double-well loaded with bosonic atoms represents an ideal candidate to simulate some of the most interesting aspects in the phenomenology of thermalisation and equilibration. Here we report an exhaustive analysis of the dynamics and steady state properties of such a system locally in contact with different temperature reservoirs. We show that thermalisation only occurs 'accidentally'. We further examine the nonclassical features and energy fluxes implied by the dynamics of the double-well system, thus exploring its finite-time thermodynamics in relation to the settlement of nonclassical correlations between the wells.

abstract: The precise calculations of the Wigner's rotation matrix are important in various research fields. Due to the presence of large numbers, the direct calculations of the Wigner's formula suffer from loss of precision. We present a simple method to avoid this problem by expanding the d-matrix into a complex Fourier series and calculate the series coefficients by exactly diagonalizing the angular-momentum operator $J_{y}$ in the eigenbasis of $% J_{z}$. This method allows us to the d-matrix and its various derivatives for spins up to a few thousand. The precision of the d-matrix from our method is about $10^{-14}$ for spins up to $100$.

abstract: We characterize the asymptotic performance of a class of positive operator valued measurements (POVMs) where the only task is to make measurements on independent and identically distributed quantum states on finite-dimensional systems. The POVMs we utilize here can be efficiently described in terms of a reasonably small set of parameters. Their analysis furthers the development of a quantum method of types. They deliver provably optimal performance in asymmetric hypothesis testing and in the transmission of classical messages over quantum channels. We now relate them to the recently developed $\alpha-z$ divergences by giving an operational interpretation for one of the limiting cases where $\alpha\to1$ and $z\to0$ in terms of probabilities for certain measurement outcomes. We provide additional structural insights which connect the underlying representation theoretic objects to partial sums of the entries of unitary matrices. At last, we concentrate on the special case of qubits. We are able to give a complete description of the asymptotic detection probabilities for all POVM elements described here. We take the opportunity to define a family of functions on pairs of semi-definite matrices which obeys the quantum generalizations of R\'enyi's axioms except from the generalized mean value axiom. This family is described by limiting values of $\alpha-z$ divergences for the extremal values of the parameter.

abstract: We introduce geometric measures of entanglement for indistinguishable particles, which apply to mixed states, multipartite systems, and arbitrary dimensions. They are based on generalized (i.e., not necessarily finite) norms on the set of quantum states and lead to the first necessary and sufficient computational separability criterion in this general setting. The coherent approach developed in the paper allows us to compare, in particular, entanglement for fermionic and distinguishable particles: The entanglement measure for fermionic particles coincides with the corresponding entanglement measure for distinguishable particles up to a factor of $k!$ where $k$ is the number of particles involved. By this result the amount of entanglement emerging from fermi statistics alone is clearly separated from the overall amount of entanglement. Finally, our techniques are applied to entanglement related to Schmidt and Slater numbers.

abstract: We describe the implementation of weak quantum measurements in superconducting qubits, focusing specifically on transmon type devices in the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. To access this regime, the readout cavity is probed with on average a single microwave photon. Such low-level signals are detected using near quantum-noise-limited superconducting parametric amplifiers. Weak measurements yield partial information about the quantum state, and correspondingly do not completely project the qubit into an eigenstate. As such, we use the measurement record to either sequentially reconstruct the quantum state at a given time, yielding a quantum trajectory, or to close a direct quantum feedback loop, stabilizing Rabi oscillations indefinitely.

abstract: Verification and characterisation of quantum states are crucial for the implementation of quantum information processing, especially for many-body systems such as cluster states in optical lattices. In theory, it is simple to estimate the distance of a state with a target cluster state by measurement of a set of suitable stabilizer operators. However, experimental non-idealities can lead to complications, in particular cross-talk in single site addressing and measurement. By making a suitable choice of stabilizer operator sets we may be able to reduce, but not eliminate, these cross-talk errors. The degree of cross-talk mitigation depends on the geometry of the cluster state and subsets of cross-talk free stabilizers can be generated for certain shapes using a simple algorithm.

abstract: The trace of an arbitrary product of quantum operators with the density operator is rendered as a multiple phase space integral of the product of their Weyl symbols with the Wigner function. Interspersing the factors with various evolution operators, one obtains an evolving correlation. The kernel for the matching multiple integral that evolves within the Weyl representation is identified with the trace of a single compound unitary operator. Its evaluation within a semiclassical approximation then becomes a sum over the periodic trajectories of the corresponding classical compound canonical transformation. The search for periodic trajectories can be bypassed by an exactly equivalent initial value scheme, which involves a change of integration variable and a reduced compound unitary operator. Restriction of all the operators to observables with smooth non-oscillatory Weyl symbols reduces the evolving correlation to a single phase space integral. If each observable undergoes independent Heisenberg evolution, the overall correlation evolves classically. Otherwise, the kernel acquires a nonclassical phase factor, though it still depends on a purely classical compound trajectory: e.g. the fase for a double return of the quantum Loschmidt echo does not coincide with twice the phase for a single echo.

abstract: The minimum probability of error (MPE) measurement discriminates between a set of candidate quantum states with the minimum average error probability allowed by quantum mechanics. Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were derived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for states that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a transitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed geometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good measurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability of error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set involves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first contribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets, using group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that have multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound geometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not known. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of optimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show how to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to solving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the sizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common group representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes), this is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which is what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state sets. We show how to evaluate MPE measurements for CGU states for some examples relevant to quantum-limited classical optical communication.

abstract: Any nonsingular function of spin j matrices always reduces to a matrix polynomial of order 2j. The challenge is to find a convenient form for the coefficients of the matrix polynomial. The theory of biorthogonal systems is a useful framework to meet this challenge. Central factorial numbers play a key role in the theoretical development. Explicit polynomial coefficients for rotations expressed either as exponentials or as rational Cayley transforms are considered here. Structural features of the results are discussed and compared, and large j limits of the coefficients are examined.

abstract: Recently, it was found that a new set of simple techniques allow one to conveniently express ordinary integrals through differentiation. These techniques add to the general toolbox for integration and integral transforms such as the Fourier and Laplace transforms. The new methods also yield new perturbative expansions when the integrals cannot be solved analytically. Here, we add new results, for example, on expressing the Laplace transform and its inverse in terms of derivatives. The new methods can be used to express path integrals in terms of functional differentiation, and they also suggest new perturbative expansions in quantum field theory.

abstract: In this paper we study the time evolution of (Renyi) entanglement entropies for locally excited states in four dimensional free massless fermionic field theory. Locally excited states are defined by being acted by various local operators on the ground state. Their excesses are defined by subtracting (Renyi) entanglement entropy for the ground state from those for locally excited states. They finally approach some constant if the subsystem is given by half of the total space. They have spin dependence. They can be interpreted in terms of quasi-particles.

abstract: Topological insulators have attracted abundant attention for a variety of reasons -- notably, the possibility for lossless energy transport through edge states `protected' against disorder. Topological effects like the Quantum Hall state can be induced through a gauge field, which is however hard to create in practice, especially for charge-neutral particles. One way to induce an effective gauge potential is through a dynamic, time-periodic modulation of the lattice confining such particles. In this way, the Haldane Quantum Hall effect was recently observed in a cold atom system. Here, we show how this same effect can be induced for light confined to a lattice of identical optical resonators, using an on-site modulation of the resonant frequencies. We further demonstrate the existence of one-directional edge states immune to back-scattering losses, and discuss the possibilities for a practical implementation, which would enable slow-light devices of unprecedented quality.

abstract: We discuss a possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can be, at least in part, explained by applying a quantum field-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations, which in particular predicts a small deviation from the classical inverse-square law at short but macroscopic distances between the neutrino source and detector. An extensive statistical analysis of the reactor data is performed to examine this speculation.

abstract: We report the observation of quantum reflection from a narrow, attractive, potential using bright solitary matter-waves formed from a 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensate. We create narrow potentials using a tightly focused, red-detuned laser beam, and observe reflection of up to 25% of the atoms, along with the trapping of atoms at the position of the beam. We show that the observed reflected fraction is much larger than theoretical predictions for a narrow Gaussian potential well; a more detailed model of bright soliton propagation, accounting for the generic presence of small subsidiary intensity maxima in the red-detuned beam, suggests that these small intensity maxima are the cause of this enhanced reflection.
