abstract: We revisit the problem of the dynamics of quantum correlations in the exact Tavis-Cummings model. We show that many of the dynamical features of quantum discord attributed to dissipation are already present in the exact framework and are due to the well known non-linearities in the model and to the choice of initial conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis, supported by explicit analytical calculations, we find that the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord are far from being trivial or intuitive. In this context, we find states that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and distinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two quantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the same information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial conditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be used for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of manifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a counterintuitive sudden birth as the number of photons increase. We furthermore propose an experiment called quantum discord gates where discord is zero or non-zero depending on the number of photons.

abstract: We introduce a new method to calculate Franck-Condon factors in polyatomic molecules that is based on the tomographic probability approach to quantum mechanics. This approach is implemented to calculate transition probabilities in various systems under an instantaneous change of frequency and equilibrium position of nuclei in a molecule by an external force. The problem is considered for different types of the Dushinsky matrix and for any quantity of atoms in a molecule.

abstract: Superconducting systems such as those modeled by the Kitaev Hamiltonian are found to exhibit the Zitterbewegung (ZB) oscillations. Remarkably, the dispersion relation in one-dimensional Kitaev systems allows for wavepackets of arbitrary size undergoing non-decaying ZB without any distortion, with the typical ZB amplitude being one lattice site. To motivate possible experimental interest in this dynamical aspect of superconducting systems, we further show that certain on-resonance modulation of the Hamiltonian parameter can be exploited to convert ZB oscillations to net drifting of particle's wavepacket and hole's wavepacket along opposite directions, leading to long-distance particle-hole separation.

abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for building a quantum computer. However, individual qubit coherence times are not far past the scalability threshold for quantum error correction, meaning that millions of physical devices would be required to construct a useful quantum computer. Consequently, further increases in coherence time are very desirable. In this letter, we blueprint a simple circuit consisting of two transmon qubits and two additional lossy qubits or resonators, which is passively protected against all single qubit quantum error channels through a combination of continuous driving and engineered dissipation. Photon losses are rapidly corrected through two-photon drive fields implemented with driven SQUID couplings, and dephasing from random potential fluctuations is heavily suppressed by the drive fields used to implement the multi-qubit Hamiltonian. Comparing our theoretical model to published noise estimates from recent experiments on flux and transmon qubits, we find that logical state coherence could be improved by a factor of forty or more compared to the individual qubit $T_1$ and $T_2$ using this technique. We thus demonstrate that there is substantial headroom for improving the coherence of modern superconducting qubits with a fairly modest increase in device complexity.

abstract: Quantum cryptography is the art and science of exploiting quantum mechanical effects in order to perform cryptographic tasks. While the most well-known example of this discipline is quantum key distribution (QKD), there exist many other applications such as quantum money, randomness generation, secure two- and multi-party computation and delegated quantum computation. Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries---including the impossibility of quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond the realm of QKD.

abstract: The binary (one-bit-per-photon) encoding that most existing quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols employ puts a fundamental limit on their achievable key rates, especially under high channel loss conditions associated with long-distance fiber-optic or satellite-to-ground links. Inspired by the pulse-position-modulation (PPM) approach to photon-starved classical communications, we design and demonstrate the first PPM-QKD, whose security against collective attacks is established through continuous-variable entanglement measurements that also enable a novel decoy-state protocol performed conveniently in post processing. We achieve a throughput of 8.0 Mbit/s (2.5 Mbit/s for loss equivalent to 25 km of fiber) and secret-key capacity up to 4.0 bits per detected photon, thus demonstrating the significant enhancement afforded by high-dimensional encoding. These results point to a new avenue for realizing high-throughput satellite-based or long-haul fiber-optic quantum communications beyond their photon-reception-rate limits.

abstract: We propose a scheme for generating three-dimensional entanglement between two atoms trapped in two spatially separated cavities reapectively via shortcuts to adi- abatic passage based on the approach of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants in cavity quan- tum electronic dynamics. By combining Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants with quantum Zeno dynamics, we can generate three dimensional entanglement of the two atoms with high fidelity. The Numerical simulation results show that the scheme is ro- bust against the decoherences caused by the photon leakage and atomic spontaneous emission.

abstract: In nanomechanical QED systems, consisting of a charge qubit and a nonlinear nanomechanical resonator, we study the temporal behavior of Rabi oscillation in the nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model. Using microscopic master equation approach, we solve time evolution of the density operator describing this model. Also, the probability of excited state of charge qubit is calculated. These analytic calculations show how nonlinearity parameter and decay rates of two different excited states of the qubit-resonator system affect time-oscillating and decaying of Rabi oscillation.

abstract: A minimally nonlinear von Neumann equation, describing deterministic dynamics of a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus is shown to display a competition for survival of diagonal density matrix elements assigned to each detector, with a single winner randomly chosen according to Born's rule and the rest collapsing to zero. Since density matrix nonlinearity opens a pathway to create remote quantum correlations due to a common local cause, the scheme is non-signaling.

abstract: Recent results in quantum information theory characterize quantum coherence in the context of resource theories. Here we study the relation between quantum coherence and quantum discord, a kind of quantum correlation which appears even in non-entangled states. We prove that the creation of quantum discord with multipartite incoherent operations is bounded by the amount of quantum coherence consumed in its subsystems during the process. We show how the interplay between quantum coherence consumption and creation of quantum discord works in the preparation of multipartite quantum correlated states and in the model of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1).

abstract: We investigate the parametric evolution of the real discrete spectrum of several complex PT symmetric scattering potentials of the type $V(x)=-V_1 F_e(x) + i V_2 F_o(x), V_1>0, F_e(x)>0$ by varying $V_2$ slowly. Here $e,o$ stand for even and odd parity and $F_{e,o}(\pm \infty)=0$. Unlike the case of Scarf II potential, we find a general absence of the recently explored accidental (real to real) crossings of eigenvalues in these scattering potentials. On the other hand, we find a general presence of coalescing of real pairs of eigenvalues to the complex conjugate pairs at a finite number of exceptional points. We attribute such coalescings of eigenvalues to the presence of a finite barrier (on the either side of $x=0$ ) which has been linked to a recent study of stokes phenomenon in the complex PT-symmetric potentials.

abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open systems driven by classical fields is studied in the presence of thermal bosonic environments. The decoherence process is quantitatively described by the time-convolutionless master equation. The evolution speed of an open system is related not only to the strength of driving classical field but also to the environmental temperature. The energy-state population plays a key role in the thermal QSL. Comparing with the zero-temperature reservoir, we predict that the structural reservoir at low temperatures may contribute to the acceleration of quantum decoherence. The manifest oscillation of QSL time takes on under the circumstance of classical driving fields. We also investigate the scaling property of QSL time for multi-particle noninteracting entangled systems. It is demonstrated that entanglement of open systems can be considered as one resource for improving the potential capacity of thermal quantum speedup.

abstract: Random access codes are important for a wide range of applications in quantum information. However, their implementation with quantum theory can be made in two very different ways: (i) by distributing data with strong spatial correlations violating a Bell inequality, or (ii) using quantum communication channels to create stronger-than-classical sequential correlations between state preparation and measurement outcome. Here, we study this duality of the quantum realization. We present a family of Bell inequalities tailored to the task at hand and study their quantum violations. Remarkably, we show that the use of spatial and sequential quantum correlations imposes different limitations on the performance of quantum random access codes. We also show that there exist random access codes for which spatial quantum correlations offer no gain over classical strategies, whereas sequential quantum correlations can yield an advantage. We discuss the physics behind the observed discrepancy between spatial and sequential quantum correlations.

abstract: We introduce a combination of coherent states as variational test functions for the atomic and radiation sectors to describe a system of Na three- level atoms interacting with a one-mode quantised electromagnetic field, with and without the rotating wave approximation, which preserves the symmetry presented by the Hamiltonian. These provide us with the possibility of finding analytical solutions for the ground and first excited states. We study the properties of these solutions for the V-configuration in the double resonance condition, and calculate the expectation values of the number of photons, the atomic populations, the total number of excitations, and their corresponding fluctuations. We also calculate the photon number distribution and the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix to estimate the entanglement between matter and radiation. For the first time, we exhibit analytical expressions for all of these quantities, as well as an analytical description for the phase diagram in parameter space, which distinguishes the normal and collective regions, and which gives us all the quantum phase transitions of the ground state from one region to the other as we vary the interaction parameters (the matter-field coupling constants) of the model, in functional form.

abstract: Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in terms of wavefunctions (probability amplitudes) obeying the static and the time-dependent Schroedinger equations (SE). Despite the success of this representation of the quantum world a wave-particle duality concept is required to reconcile the theory with observations (experimental measurements). A first solution to this dichotomy was introduced in the de Broglie-Bohm theory according to which a pilot wave (solution of the SE) is guiding the evolution of particle trajectories. Here, I propose a geometrization of quantum mechanics that describes the time evolution of particles as geodesic lines in a curved space, whose curvature is induced by the quantum potential. This formulation allows therefore the incorporation of all quantum effects into the geometry of space-time, as it is the case for gravitation in the general relativity.

abstract: Standard quantum mechanics assumes that events are embedded in a global causal structure such that, for every pair of events, the causal order between them is always fixed. The process matrix framework keeps the local validity of standard quantum mechanics while relaxing the assumption on the global causal structure. This allows to describe situations in which the order of events is not fixed, i.e. there are processes where it is not possible to specify whether A causes B or B causes A. Such processes are called causally nonseparable. So far, the formalism has been developed only for finite-dimensional systems and a straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions leads to singularities. Here we develop such generalization, and derive the correlations arising from a causally nonseparable process - the quantum switch - in infinite dimensions. The correlations exhibit interference which is due to superposition of processes in which A is before B and B is before A.

abstract: Point-defects in wide bandgap semiconductors are promising candidates for future applications that necessitate quantum light sources. Recently, defect-based single photon sources have been observed in ZnO that are very bright and remain photoactive from 4.5 K to room temperature. Despite several investigations, the structure and electronic states of these emitters remain unknown. In this work, we establish a procedure to distinguish a Z dipole from an XY dipole when studying quantum emitters that are randomly oriented. Our cryogenic and room temperature polarization measurements collectively establish that these unidentified ZnO quantum emitters have a Z dipole. We show that the associated absorption and emission dipoles are parallel within experimental uncertainty for all 32 individuals studied. Additionally, we apply group theory and find that assuming the defect symmetry belongs to a point-group relevant to the ZnO wurtzite lattice, the ground and excited states are orbital singlets. These results are a significant step in identifying the structure and electronic states of defect-based single photon sources in ZnO.

abstract: In Deep Learning, a well-known approach for training a Deep Neural Network starts by training a generative Deep Belief Network model, typically using Contrastive Divergence (CD), then fine-tuning the weights using backpropagation or other discriminative techniques. However, the generative training can be time-consuming due to the slow mixing of Gibbs sampling. We investigated an alternative approach that estimates model expectations of Restricted Boltzmann Machines using samples from a D-Wave quantum annealing machine. We tested this method on a coarse-grained version of the MNIST data set. In our tests we found that the quantum sampling-based training approach achieves comparable or better accuracy with significantly fewer iterations of generative training than conventional CD-based training. Further investigation is needed to determine whether similar improvements can be achieved for other data sets, and to what extent these improvements can be attributed to quantum effects.

abstract: When a system is driven across a quantum critical point at a constant rate its evolution must become non-adiabatic as the relaxation time $\tau$ diverges at the critical point. According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the emerging post-transition excited state is characterized by a finite correlation length $\hat\xi$ set at the time $\hat t=\hat \tau$ when the critical slowing down makes it impossible for the system to relax to the equilibrium defined by changing parameters. This observation naturally suggests a dynamical scaling similar to renormalization familiar from the equilibrium critical phenomena. We provide evidence for such KZM-inspired spatiotemporal scaling by investigating an exact solution of the transverse field quantum Ising chain in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: We report a new version of fermion coupled coherent states (FCCS-II) method to simulate two-electron systems based on a self-symmetrized six-dimensional (6D) coherent states grid. Unlike the older fermion coupled coherent states (FCCS-I) method, FCCS-II does not need any new equations in comparison with the coupled coherent states method. FCCS-II uses a simpler and more efficient approach for symmetrizing the spatial wave function in the simulation of fermionic systems. This method, has significantly increased the speed of computations and give us capability to simulate the quantum systems with the larger CS grids. We apply FCCS-II to simulate the Helium atom and the Hydrogen molecule based on grids with a large numbers of coherent states. Moreover, we have derived all the important equations of the FCCS-I by an exact attitude.
