abstract: "Is entanglement monogamous?" asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal, IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum information theory. While the answer is certainly affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is far less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we clarify the most general form of a universal quantitative monogamy relation for a bipartite measure of entanglement. We then go on to show that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this most general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that entanglement measures cannot satisfy monogamy while at the same time faithfully capturing the entanglement of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.

abstract: The physical meaning of weak values and measurements can be completely understood within the framework of a conventional quantum mechanical approach. We should not expect the weak value of an observable $\hat A$ with post-selection $\langle F|$ within the eigenvalue range of $\hat A$ because it is not an expectation value of $\hat A$.

abstract: Usually, the three-tangle of a tripartite pure state of qubits can be directly measured with the simultaneous preparation of a not-less-than-four-fold copy of the state. We show that the exact genuine tripartite entanglement for ($2\otimes2\otimes n$)-dimensional pure quantum states can be measured in a similar manner, provided that only two simultaneous copies of the state are available. Lower bounds are also proposed for more convenient experimental operations. As an example, a comprehensive demonstration of the scheme is provided for the three-tangle of a three-qubit state.

abstract: The effects of photon bunching and antibunching correspond to the classical and quantum features of the electromagnetic field, respectively. No direct evidence suggests whether these effects can be potentially related to quantum entanglement. Here we design a cavity quantum electrodynamics model with two atoms trapped in to demonstrate the connections between the steady-state photon statistics and the two-atom entanglement . It is found that within the weak dissipations and to some good approximation, the local maximal two-atom entanglements perfectly correspond to not only the quantum feature of the electromagnetic field---the optimal photon antibunching, but also the classical feature---the optimal photon bunching. We also analyze the influence of strong dissipations and pure dephasing. An intuitive physical understanding is also given finally.

abstract: Complex cryptographic protocols are often constructed from simpler building-blocks. In order to advance quantum cryptography, it is important to study practical building-blocks that can be used to develop new protocols. An example is quantum retrieval games (QRGs), which have broad applicability and have already been used to construct quantum money schemes. In this work, we introduce a general construction of quantum retrieval games based on the hidden matching problem and show how they can be implemented in practice using available technology. More precisely, we provide a general method to construct (1-out-of-k) QRGs, proving that their cheating probabilities decrease exponentially in $k$. In particular, we define new QRGs based on coherent states of light, which can be implemented even in the presence of experimental imperfections. Our results constitute a new tool in the arsenal of the practical quantum cryptographer.

abstract: Quantum walks are considered to be quantum counterparts of random walks.They show us impressive probability distributions which are different from those of random walks.That fact has been precisely proved in terms of mathematics and some of the results were reported as limit theorems.When we analyze quantum walks, some conventional methods are used for the computations.Especially, the Fourier analysis has played a role to do that.It is, however, compatible with some types of quantum walks (e.g. quantum walks on the line with a spatially homogeneous dynamics) and can not well work on the derivation of limit theorems for all the quantum walks.In this paper we try to obtain a limit theorem for a quantum walk on the half line by the usage of the Fourier analysis.Substituting a quantum walk on the line for it, we will lead to a possibility that the Fourier analysis is useful to compute a limit distribution of the quantum walk on the half line.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to set out the problems of modeling quantum communication and signal processing where the communication between systems via a non-Markovian channel. This is a general feature of quantum transmission lines. Our ultimate objective is to extend the networks rules that have been developed for Markovian models. To this end we recall the Hamiltonian description of such non-Markov models of transmission lines and their quantization. These have occurred in the context of non-quilibrium thermodynamics, but our interest is in the transmission lines as carriers of information rather than heat baths. We show that there is an analytic scattering matrix associated with these models and that stability may be formulated in terms of the lossless bounded real property. Noting that the input and output fields do not separately satisfy a non-self- demolition principle, we discuss the rigorous limit in which such models appear Markov and so amenable to standard approaches of quantum filtering and control

abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is an analog quantum computing scheme with various applications in solving optimization problems. In the parity picture of quantum optimization, the problem is encoded in local fields that act on qubits which are connected via local 4-body terms. We present an implementation of a parity annealer with Transmon qubits with a specifically tailored Ising interaction from Josephson ring modulators.

abstract: We perform hole burning with a low drift stabilized laser within the zero phonon line of the 4f-5d transition in Ce$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ at 2K. The narrowest spectral holes appear for small applied magnetic fields and are $6\pm4$ MHz wide (FWHM). This puts an upper bound on the homogeneous linewidth of the transition to $3\pm2$ MHz, which is close to lifetime limited. The spin level relaxation time is measured to $72\pm21$ ms with a magnetic field of 10 mT. A slow permanent hole burning mechanism is observed. If the excitation frequency is not changed the fluorescence intensity is reduced by more than 50$\%$ after a couple of minutes of continuous excitation. The spectral hole created by the permanent hole burning has a width in the tens of MHz range, which indicates that a trapping mechanism occurs via the 5d-state.

abstract: By using a physically-relevant and theory independent definition of measurement-based equilibration, we show quantitatively that equilibration is easier for quantum systems than for classical systems, in the situation where the initial state of the system is completely known (pure state). This shows that quantum equilibration is a fundamental, nigh unavoidable, aspect of physical systems, while classical equilibration relies on experimental ignorance. When the state is not completely known, a mixed state, this framework also shows quantum equilibration requires weaker conditions.

abstract: We study the correction of errors intervening in two-qubit dissipating into their own environments. This is done by resorting to local feedback actions with the aim of preserving as much as possible the initial amount of entanglement. Optimal control is found by first gaining insights from the subsystem purity and then by numerical analysis on the concurrence. This is tantamount to a double optimization, on the actuation and on the measurement processes. Repeated feedback action is also investigated, thus paving the way for a continuous time formulation and solution of the problem.

abstract: We construct exactly solved commuting projector Hamiltonian lattice models for all known 2+1d fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs) with on-site unitary symmetry group $G_f = G \times \mathbb{Z}_2^f$, where $G$ is finite and $\mathbb{Z}_2^f$ is the fermion parity symmetry. In particular, our models transcend the class of group supercohomology models, which realize some, but not all, fermionic SPTs in 2+1d. A natural ingredient in our construction is a discrete form of the spin structure of the 2d spatial surface $M$ on which our model is defined, namely a `Kasteleyn' orientation of a certain graph associated with the lattice. As a special case, our construction yields commuting projector models for all $8$ members of the $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of 2d fermionic SPTs with $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$.

abstract: Entanglement is at the heart of quantum mechanics and an essential ingredient of spin correlations in superconductivity and the Kondo effect and quantum non-locality of non-interacting particles. Non-local entanglement is also key to quantum computation outperforming classical computers and has now begun to be applied to various atom and photon-based quantum information technologies. Despite many technical advances in manipulating electron spins in solids, entanglement control has only been realized for two coupled qubits in quantum dots (QDs), mainly by local SWAP operations. Here we use a triple QD with three addressable spin qubits to demonstrate phase control of locally entangled two or three electron spins and two non-locally entangled uncoupled spins. Singlet-triplet oscillation of two locally entangled spins in adjacent dots is induced by a built-in local Zeeman field, and phase-modulated using the exchange-coupled third spin as a control bit. Non-local entanglement is created by an adiabatic transition from the local singlet to a non-local singlet over two distant QDs with the center dot remaining uncoupled. We analyze the phase evolution of those entangled states depending on the adiabatic transition path to derive the three-spin-state spectrum, a prerequisite for single-qubit, SWAP gate and other entanglement operations. Our results empower quantum information technologies in solid-state systems by paving the way for manipulating local and non-local entanglement with multiple QDs.

abstract: We theoretically investigate many-body systems with long range interactions in ensembles of Rydberg atoms undergoing dynamics described by an Ising-type Hamiltonian. The interactions are found to strongly modify both the contrast and phase of the population signal monitored via the double-pulse Ramsey interferometry technique. We find analytical expressions and scaling laws of both contrast and phase decay for arbitrary large numbers of interacting atoms in ensembles of varying densities.
