**1.    Quantum walks and gravitational waves**  
Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00722  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) propagating on a regular $(1+2)$D spacetime lattice is introduced. The continuous limit of these DTQWs is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion interacting with an arbitrary relativistic gravitational field. This family is used to model the influence of arbitrary linear gravitational waves (GWs) on DTQWs. Pure shear GWs are studied in detail. On large spatial scales, pure shear GWs do not modify the polarizations of the fermion eigen-modes, but rescale all energies by a common factor. On smaller scales typically comparable to two or three lattice steps, both polarizations and energies are modified in a non-trivial way. This effect is particularly salient on interference patterns between the fermion eigen-modes.

**2.    Renormalization of the Unitary Evolution Equation for Coined Quantum Walks**  
Stefan Boettcher, Shanshan Li, Renato Portugal  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00756  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider discrete-time evolution equations in which the stochastic operator of a classical random walk is replaced by a unitary operator. Such a problem has gained much attention as a framework for coined quantum walks that are essential for attaining the Grover limit for quantum search algorithms in physically realizable, low-dimensional geometries. In particular, we analyze the exact real-space renormalization group (RG) procedure recently introduced to study the scaling of quantum walks on fractal networks. While this procedure, when implemented numerically, was able to provide some deep insights into the relation between classical and quantum walks, its analytic basis has remained obscure. Our discussion here is laying the groundwork for a rigorous implementation of the RG for this important class of transport and algorithmic problems. Specifically, we find that the RG fixed-point analysis of the classical walk, which typically focuses on the dominant Jacobian eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$, with $d_{w}^{RW}=\log_{2}\lambda_{1}$, needs to be extended to include the subdominant eigenvalue $\lambda_{2}$, such that the dimension of the quantum walk obtains $d_{w}^{QW}=\log_{2}\sqrt{\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}$.

**3.    Majorana fermions in the nonuniform Ising-Kitaev chain: exact solution**  
B.N. Narozhny  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00925  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum computer based on Majorana qubits would contain a large number of zero-energy Majorana bound states. This system can be modelled as a connected network of the Ising-Kitaev chains alternating the "trivial" and "topological" regions, with the zero-energy Majorana fermions localized at their interfaces. The low-energy sector of the theory describing such a network can be formulated in terms of leading-order couplings between the Majorana zero modes. I consider a minimal model exhibiting effective couplings between four Majorana zero modes - the nonuniform Ising-Kitaev chain, containing two "topological" regions separated by a "trivial" region. Solving the model exactly, I show that inversion symmetry leads to delocalization of the Majorana zero modes between two interface points. The low-energy sector of the theory can still be formulated in terms of localized Majorana fermions, but the couplings between them are counterintuitively independent of their separations. I also show that the delocalization may occur in the case of a "weak" barrier and the variant of the model, where one of the chain ends is coupled to one of the intermediate sites forming a T-junction.

**4.    Anderson localization of ultracold atoms: Where is the mobility edge?**  
Michael Pasek, Giuliano Orso, Dominique Delande  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.01065  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent experiments on non-interacting ultra-cold atoms in correlated disorder have yielded conflicting results regarding the so-called mobility edge, i.e. the energy threshold separating Anderson localized from diffusive states. At the same time, there are theoretical indications that the experimental data overestimate the position of this critical energy, sometimes by a large amount. The non-trivial effect of anisotropy in the spatial correlations of experimental speckle potentials have been put forward as a possible cause for such discrepancy. Using extensive numerical simulations we show that the effect of anisotropy alone is not sufficient to explain the experimental data. In particular, we find that, for not-too-strong anisotropy, realistic disorder configurations are essentially identical to the isotropic case, modulo a simple rescaling of the energies.
