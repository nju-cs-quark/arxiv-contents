abstract: We approximate the two-body spinless Salpeter equation with the one which is valid in heavy quarks limit. We consider the resulting semi-relativistic equation in a time-dependent formulation. We use the Lewis- Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method and series solution to obtain the solutions of the differential equation. We have also done some calculations in order to derive the time evolution operator for the considered problem.

title: The most elementary heat to work conversion: work extraction from a completely passive state by a single photon

abstract: The concepts of work and heat in the quantum domain, as well as their interconversion principles, are still an open debate. We have found theoretical evidence that a single photon packet is capable of extracting work from a single two-level system (TLS). More importantly, this effect is found for a photon as it is spontaneously emitted, therefore carrying only heat away from the emitter. This is the most elementary process in which heat is converted into work, requiring not more than two off-resonance atoms for that purpose. From a more practical point of view it is found that, surprisingly, work can be extracted from a TLS in a completely passive initial state. The process is cyclic in the sense that the TLS initial and final states are equal. The state of the TLS remains passive throughout the interaction time with the single-photon packet. The physical meaning of the work performed by the TLS is found to be a dynamical change in the color of the photon during the reemission process. All our predictions are, in principle, measurable within state-of-the-art experiments.

abstract: Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) in quantum communi- cation systems has been known to exhibit improved performance with the use of error-free entanglement bits (ebits). In practical situations, ebits inevitably su?er from errors, and as a result, the error-correcting capability of the code is diminished. Prior studies have proposed two di?erent schemes as a solu- tion. One uses only one QECC to correct errors on the receiver's side (i.e., Bob) and on the sender's side (i.e., Alice). The other uses di?erent QECCs on each side. In this paper, we present a method to correct errors on both sides by using single nonadditive Entanglement-assisted codeword stabilized quantum error correcting code(EACWS QECC). We use the property that the number of e?ective error patterns decreases as much as the number of ebits. This property results in a greater number of logical codewords using the same number of physical qubits.

abstract: The particle spin is an intrinsic, non-classical angular momentum. Sorting neutral particles according to their spin configuration has been shown in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, but in the case of electrons, an argument based on classical trajectories from Wolfgang Pauli concluded the unfeasibility of spin separation. Here, we demonstrate in theory that the electron spin can be separated by a spin-dependent diffraction in the Kapitza-Dirac effect using circularly polarized, strong X-ray laser beams. Our method simultaneously filters and polarizes the electron spin, in contrast to an implicit method by measuring the electron cyclotron frequency in a Penning trap. Compared to prior investigations, we demonstrate spin-dependent diffraction by explicitly altering the initial electron spin configuration and our scenario does not require grating elements. The effect presented here allows for the coherent and reversible preparation and separation of the electron spin on femto second time scale.

abstract: The evolution of high dimensional entanglement in atmospheric turbulence is investigated. We study the effects of turbulence on photonic states generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion, both theoretically and experimentally. One of the photons propagates through turbulence, while the other is left undisturbed. The atmospheric turbulence is simulated by a single phase screen based on the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence. The output after turbulence is projected into a three-dimensional (qutrit) basis composed of specific Laguerre-Gaussian modes. A full state tomography is performed to determine the density matrix for each output quantum state. These density matrices are used to determine the amount of entanglement, quantified in terms of the negativity, as a function of the scintillation strength. Theoretically, the entanglement is calculated using a single phase screen approximation. We obtain good agreement between theory and experiment.

abstract: The traditional standard theory of quantum mechanics is unable to solve the spin-statistics problem, i.e. to justify the utterly important \qo{Pauli Exclusion Principle} but by the adoption of the complex standard relativistic quantum field theory. In a recent paper (Ref. [1]) we presented a proof of the spin-statistics problem in the nonrelativistic approximation on the basis of the \qo{Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics}. In the present paper, by the same theory the proof of the Spin-Statistics Theorem is extended to the relativistic domain in the general scenario of curved spacetime. The relativistic approach allows to formulate a manifestly step-by-step Weyl gauge invariant theory and to emphasize some fundamental aspects of group theory in the demonstration. No relativistic quantum field operators are used and the particle exchange properties are drawn from the conservation of the intrinsic helicity of elementary particles. It is therefore this property, not considered in the Standard Quantum Mechanics, which determines the correct spin-statistics connection observed in Nature [1]. The present proof of the Spin-Statistics Theorem is simpler than the one presented in Ref. [1], because it is based on symmetry group considerations only, without having recourse to frames attached to the particles.

abstract: We investigate quantum state tomography (QST) for pure states and quantum process tomography (QPT) for unitary channels via $adaptive$ measurements. For a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, we first propose an adaptive protocol where only $2d-1$ measurement outcomes are used to accomplish the QST for $all$ pure states. This idea is then extended to study QPT for unitary channels, where an adaptive unitary process tomography (AUPT) protocol of $d^2+d-1$ measurement outcomes is constructed for any unitary channel. We experimentally implement the AUPT protocol in a 2-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. We examine the performance of the AUPT protocol when applied to Hadamard gate, $T$ gate ($\pi/8$ phase gate), and controlled-NOT gate, respectively, as these gates form the universal gate set for quantum information processing purpose. As a comparison, standard QPT is also implemented for each gate. Our experimental results show that the AUPT protocol that reconstructing unitary channels via adaptive measurements significantly reduce the number of experiments required by standard QPT without considerable loss of fidelity.

abstract: We propose an efficient method to construct shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) through designing a substitute Hamiltonian to try to avoid the defect that the speed-up protocols' Hamiltonian may involve the terms which are difficult to be realized in practice. We show that as long as the counterdiabitic coupling terms, even only some of them, have been nullified by the adding Hamiltonian, the corresponding shortcuts to adiabatic process could be constructed and the adiabatic process would be speeded up. As an application example, we apply this method to the popular Landau-Zener model for the realization of fast population inversion. The results show that in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, we can design different adding Hamiltonians to replace the traditional counterdiabitic driving Hamiltonian to speed up the process. This method provides lots of choices to design the adding terms of the Hamiltonian such that one can choose the realizable model in practice.

abstract: A scheme for arbitrary quantum state engineering (QSE) in three-state systems is proposed. First, starting from a set of complete orthogonal time-dependent basis with undetermined coefficients, a time-dependent Hamiltonian is derived via Counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an arbitrary target state at a predefined time. Then, on request of the assumed target states, two single-mode driving protocols and a multi-mode driving protocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the QSE scheme. The result of comparison between singlemode driving and multi-mode driving shows that multi-mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application prospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target from an arbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of microwave fields for the transition between the two ground states. Moreover, a polynomial ansatz as the simplest example is used to fix the pulses. The result shows that the pulses designed to implement the protocols are not hard to be realized in practice. At the end, QSE in higher-dimensional systems is also discussed in brief as generalization example of the QSE scheme.

abstract: We study non-equilibrium processes in an isolated quantum system ---the Dicke model--- focusing on the role played by the transition from integrability to chaos and the presence of excited-state quantum phase transitions. We show that both diagonal and entanglement entropies are abruptly increased by the onset of chaos. Also, this increase ends in both cases just after the system crosses the critical energy of the excited-state quantum phase transition. The link between entropy production, the development of chaos and the excited-state quantum phase transition is more clear for the entanglement entropy. On the contrary, the heat dissipated by the process is affected neither by the onset of chaos, nor by the excited-state quantum phase transition.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a ladder system involving a Rydberg level is known to yield giant optical nonlinearities for the probe field, even in the few-photon regime. This enhancement is due to the strong dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms and the resulting excitation blockade phenomenon. In order to study such highly correlated media, ad hoc models or low-excitation assumptions are generally used to tackle their dynamical response to optical fields. Here, we study the behaviour of a cavity Rydberg-EIT setup in the non-equilibrium quantum field formalism, and we obtain analytic expressions for elastic and inelastic components of the cavity transmission spectrum, valid up to higher excitation numbers than previously achieved. This allows us to identify and interpret a polaritonic resonance structure, to our knowledge unreported so far.

abstract: We experimentally study tunneling of Bose-condensed $^{87}$Rb atoms prepared in a quasi-bound state and observe a non-exponential decay caused by interatomic interactions. A combination of a magnetic quadrupole trap and a thin $1.3\mathrm{\mu m}$ barrier created using a blue-detuned sheet of light is used to tailor traps with controllable depth and tunneling rate. The escape dynamics strongly depend on the mean-field energy, which gives rise to three distinct regimes--- classical spilling over the barrier, quantum tunneling, and decay dominated by background losses. We show that the tunneling rate depends exponentially on the chemical potential. Our results show good agreement with numerical solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

abstract: We investigate sensing of magnetic fields using quantum spin chains at finite temperature and exploit quantum phase crossovers to improve metrological bounds on the estimation of the chain parameters. In particular, we analyze the $ XX $ spin chain and show that the magnetic sensitivity of this system is dictated by its adiabatic magnetic susceptibility, which scales extensively (linearly) in the number of spins $ N $. Next, we introduce an iterative feedforward protocol that actively exploits features of quantum phase crossovers to enable super-extensive scaling of the magnetic sensitivity. Moreover, we provide experimentally realistic observables to saturate the quantum metrological bounds. Finally, we also address magnetic sensing in the Heisenberg $ XY $ spin chain.

abstract: Recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has instigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including many-body dynamics of trapped ultracold atoms and ions, near-field radiative heat transfer, and quantum friction. Under most circumstances the complexity of such non-equilibrium systems requires a number of approximations to make theoretical descriptions tractable. In particular, it is often assumed that spatially separated components of a system thermalize with their immediate surroundings, although the global state of the system is out of equilibrium. This powerful assumption reduces the complexity of non-equilibrium systems to the local application of well-founded equilibrium concepts. While this technique appears to be consistent for the description of some phenomena, we show that it fails for quantum friction by underestimating by approximately $80 \%$ the magnitude of the drag force. Our results show that the correlations among components of driven, but steady-state, quantum systems invalidate the assumption of local thermal equilibrium, calling for a critical reexamination of this approach for describing the physics of non-equilibrium systems.

abstract: Characterizing many-body systems through the quantum correlations between their constituent particles is a major goal of quantum physics. Although entanglement is routinely observed in many systems, we report here the detection of stronger correlations - Bell correlations - between the spins of about 480 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive a Bell correlation witness from a many-particle Bell inequality involving only one- and two-body correlation functions. Our measurement on a spin-squeezed state exceeds the threshold for Bell correlations by 3.8 standard deviations. Our work shows that the strongest possible non-classical correlations are experimentally accessible in many-body systems, and that they can be revealed by collective measurements.

abstract: Recently Guerout et al. [Phys. Rev. E, v.93, 022108 (2016)] advocated that the lossless plasma model has to be redefined as the limit of the Drude model when the relaxation parameter goes to zero. It was claimed that the previously used plasma model cannot correctly describe the Casimir pressure between two plates made of both nonmagnetic and magnetic metals and has to be replaced with the redefined one. We show that the suggested redefinition does not satisfy necessary physical requirements imposed on the dielectric permittivity. We also present a plausible explanation to the fact that the lossless plasma model describes the Casimir pressure correctly even though it does not match the optical and electrical properties of metals.

abstract: Let K be a real quadratic field. For certain K with sufficiently small discriminant we produce explicit unit generators for specific ray class fields of K using a numerical method that arose in the study of complete sets of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$ (known in quantum information as symmetric informationally complete measurements or SICs). The construction in low dimensions suggests a general recipe for producing unit generators in infinite towers of ray class fields above arbitrary K and we summarise this in a conjecture. Such explicit generators are notoriously difficult to find, so this recipe may be of some interest. In a forthcoming paper we shall publish promising results of numerical comparisons between the logarithms of these canonical units and the values of L-functions associated to the extensions, following the programme laid out in the Stark Conjectures.

abstract: Topological entanglement entropy has been regarded as a smoking-gun signature of topological order in two dimensions, capturing the total quantum dimension of the topological particle content. An extrapolation method on cylinders has been used frequently to measure the topological entanglement entropy. Here, we show that a class of short-range entangled 2D states, when put on an infinite cylinder of circumference $L$, exhibits the entanglement R\'enyi entropy of any integer index $\alpha \ge 2$ that obeys $S_\alpha = a L - \gamma$ where $a, \gamma > 0 $. Under the extrapolation method, the subleading term $\gamma$ would be identified as the topological entanglement entropy, which is spurious. A nonzero $\gamma$ is always present if the 2D state reduces to a certain symmetry-protected topological 1D state, upon disentangling spins that are far from the entanglement cut. The internal symmetry that stabilizes $\gamma > 0$ is not necessarily a symmetry of the 2D state, but should be present after the disentangling reduction. If the symmetry is absent, $\gamma$ decays exponentially in $L$ with a characteristic length, termed as a replica correlation length, which can be arbitrarily large compared to the two-point correlation length of the 2D state. We propose a simple numerical procedure to measure the replica correlation length through replica correlation functions. We also calculate the replica correlation functions for representative wave functions of abelian discrete gauge theories and the double semion theory in 2D, to show that they decay abruptly to zero. This supports a conjecture that the replica correlation length being small implies that the subleading term from the extrapolation method determines the total quantum dimension.

abstract: Although time is one of the fundamental notions in physics, it does not have a unique description. In quantum theory time is a parameter ordering the succession of the probability amplitudes of a quantum system, while according to relativity theory each system experiences in general a different proper time, depending on the system's world line, due to time to time dilation. It is therefore of fundamental interest to test the notion of time in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects play a role, for example, when different amplitudes of a single quantum clock experience different magnitudes of time dilation. Here we propose a realization of such an experiment with a single electron in a Penning trap. The clock can be implemented in the electronic spin precession and its time dilation then depends on the radial (cyclotron) state of the electron. We show that coherent manipulation and detection of the electron can be achieved already with present day technology. A single electron in a Penning trap is a technologically ready platform where the notion of time can be probed in a hitherto untested regime, where it requires a relativistic as well as quantum description.

abstract: We analyse the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking in complex quantum systems by investigating the long-standing conjecture that the maximally symmetry-breaking quantum ground states are the most classical ones corresponding to a globally ordered phase. We make this argument quantitatively precise by comparing different local and global indicators of classicality and quantumness, respectively in symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving quantum ground states. We first discuss how naively comparing local, pairwise entanglement and discord apparently leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed, we show that in symmetry-preserving ground states the two-body entanglement captures only a modest portion of the total two-body quantum correlations, while, on the contrary, in maximally symmetry-breaking ground states it contributes the largest amount to the total two-body quantum correlations. We then put to test the conjecture by looking at the global, macroscopic correlation properties of quantum ground states. We prove that the ground states which realize the maximum breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetries, associated to a globally ordered phase, are the only ones that: I) are always locally convertible, i.e. can be obtained from all other ground states by only applying LOCC transformations (local operations and classical communication), while the reverse is never possible; II) minimize the monogamy inequality on the globally shared, macroscopic bipartite entanglement.
