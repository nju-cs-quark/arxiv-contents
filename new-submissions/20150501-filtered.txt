abstract: We propose to use efficient quantum error correcting codes with multilevel systems to protect encoded quantum information from erasure errors and efficient implementation to repetitively correct these errors. Our scheme makes use of quantum polynomial codes to encode quantum information and generalizes teleportation based error correction for multilevel systems to repetitively correct photon erasures and operation errors. We discuss the application of our scheme for one-way quantum repeaters and discuss their physical implementation using atom mediated multiqubit gates.

abstract: In quantum information theory, the reliable and effective detection of entanglement is of paramount importance. However, given an unknown state, assessing its entanglement is a challenging task. To attack this problem, we investigate the use of random local measurements, from which entanglement witnesses are then constructed via semidefinite programming methods. We propose a scheme of successively increasing the number of measurements until the presence of entanglement can be unambiguously concluded, and investigate its performance in various examples.
