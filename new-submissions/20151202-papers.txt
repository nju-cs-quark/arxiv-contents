abstract: We report the observation of efficient and low-noise frequency conversion between two microwave modes, mediated by the motion of a mechanical resonator subjected to radiation pressure. We achieve coherent conversion of more than $10^{12}~\mathrm{photons/s}$ with a $95\mathrm{\%}$ efficiency and a $14~\mathrm{kHz}$ bandwidth. With less than $10^{-1}~\mathrm{photons \cdot s^{-1}\cdot Hz^{-1}}$ of added noise, this optomechanical frequency converter is suitable for quantum state transduction. We show the ability to operate this converter as a tunable beam splitter, with direct applications for photon routing and communication through complex quantum networks.

abstract: We improve Knabe's spectral gap bound for frustration-free translation-invariant local Hamiltonians in 1D. The bound is based on a relationship between global and local gaps. The global gap is the spectral gap of a size-$m$ chain with periodic boundary conditions, while the local gap is that of a subchain of size $n<m$ with open boundary conditions. Knabe proved that if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some $n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the thermodynamic limit $m\rightarrow \infty$. Here we improve the threshold to $\frac{6}{n(n+1)}$, which is better (smaller) for all $n>3$ and which is asymptotically optimal. As a corollary we establish a surprising fact about 1D translation-invariant frustration-free systems that are gapless in the thermodynamic limit: for any such system the spectral gap of a size-$n$ chain with open boundary conditions is upper bounded as $O(n^{-2})$. This contrasts with gapless frustrated systems where the gap can be $\Theta(n^{-1})$. It also limits the extent to which the area law is violated in these frustration-free systems, since it implies that the half-chain entanglement entropy is $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ as a function of spectral gap $\epsilon$. We extend our results to frustration-free systems on a 2D square lattice.

abstract: We consider the task of characterizing optimal protocols for approximating incompatible observables via jointly measurable observables. This amounts to jointly minimizing the approximation errors (suitably quantified), subject to the compatibility constraint. As a case study we consider the approximation of two-valued qubit observables and scrutinise two recent approaches that are based on different choices of error measures, each giving rise to a form of measurement uncertainty relation. We find a disparity between the respective optimal approximators singled out by the two approaches, which underlines the operational shortcomings of one of the error measures.

abstract: A 5-qubit quantum controlled teleportation scheme incorporated with a 3-qubit quantum error-corrective circuit is proposed for satellite control and communication. This means that the coordinates of a satellite on the unit three-dimensional Bloch sphere representation can be sent to the ground based operator via quantum teleportation. Applying quantum rotation operators to the initial quantum state, to obtain desired changes, the corrected/desired quantum state can be sent back to the satellite to adjust its coordinates.

abstract: Bell's theorem states that quantum mechanics is not a locally causal theory. This state is often interpreted as nonlocality in quantum mechanics. Toner and Bacon [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{91}, 187904 (2003)] have shown that a shared random-variables theory augmented by one bit of classical communication exactly simulates the Bell correlation in a singlet state. In this paper, we show that in Toner and Bacon protocol, one of the parties (Bob) can deduce another party's (Alice) measurement outputs, if she only informs Bob of one of her own outputs. Afterwards, we suggest a nonlocal version of Toner and Bacon protocol wherein classical communications is replaced by nonlocal effects, so that Alice's measurements cause instantaneous effects on Bob's outputs. In the nonlocal version of Toner and Bacon's protocol, we get the same result again. We also demonstrate that the same approach is applicable to Svozil's protocol.

abstract: Based on the integral representation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk (HK), and in the limit of high temperatures, we formulate a hybrid expression for the correlation function of infrared spectroscopy. This is achieved by performing a partial linearization inside the integral over the difference of phase space variables that occurs after a twofold application of the HK propagator. A numerical case study for a coupled anharmonic oscillator shows that already for a total number of only two degrees of freedom, one of which is treated in the simplified manner, a substantial reduction of the numerical effort is achieved.

abstract: Maximal violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is usually said to be a feature of anticommuting observables. In this work we show that even random observables exhibit near-maximal violations of the CHSH-Bell inequality. To do this, we introduce so-called free observables which are freely independent in some quantum probability space. We also study the fine-grained uncertainty of a sequence of free or random observables, and use this to construct a steering inequality with large violation.

We state and prove a relevant version of this inequality for the hitherto unaddressed case of these matrices being nonnegative. Our treatment also provides an alternate proof for the strictly positive case.

abstract: We study the the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor $\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown that the QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process, while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoir squeezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeeze parameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect of temperature on the QFI.

abstract: Ensembles of electron spins in hybrid microwave systems are powerful and versatile components for future quantum technologies. Quantum memories with high storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states that can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories, but induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a cavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work we show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of long-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we observe long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that is a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a factor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate. This significant reduction lives up to the promise of hybrid devices to perform better than their individual subcomponents. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we realise the first step towards a solid-state microwave spin multiplexer by engineering multiple long-lived dark states. Our results show that we can fully access the "decoherence free" subspace in our experiment and selectively prepare protected states by spectral hole burning. This technique opens up the way for truly long-lived quantum memories, solid-state microwave frequency combs, optical to microwave quantum transducers and spin squeezed states. Our approach also paves the way for a new class of cavity QED experiments with dense spin ensembles, where dipole spin-spin interactions become important and many-body phenomena will be directly accessible on a chip.

abstract: We theoretically generate nonclassical states from coherent state heralded by Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM)-type SU(3) interference. Injecting a coherent state in signal mode and two single-photon sources in other two auxiliary modes of SU(3) interferometry, a broad class of useful nonclassical states are obtained in the output signal port after making two single-photon-counting measurements in the two output auxiliary modes. The nonclassical properties, in terms of anti-bunching effect and squeezing effect as well as the negativity of the Wigner function, are studied in detail by adjusting the interaction parameters. The results show that the input coherent state can be transformed into non-Gaussian states with higher nonclassicality after measurement induction. The maximum squeezing of our generated states can be arrived at about 1.9 dB.

abstract: Light-pulse atom interferometers rely on the wave nature of matter and its manipulation with coherent laser pulses. They are used for precise gravimetry and inertial sensing as well as for accurate measurements of fundamental constants. Reaching higher precision requires longer interferometer times which are naturally encountered in microgravity environments such as drop-tower facilities, sounding rockets and dedicated satellite missions aiming at fundamental quantum physics in space. In all those cases, it is necessary to consider arbitrary trajectories and varying orientations of the interferometer set-up in non-inertial frames of reference. Here we provide a versatile representation-free description of atom interferometry entirely based on operator algebra to address this general situation. We show how to analytically determine the phase shift as well as the visibility of interferometers with an arbitrary number of pulses including the effects of local gravitational accelerations, gravity gradients, the rotation of the lasers and non-inertial frames of reference. Our method conveniently unifies previous results and facilitates the investigation of novel interferometer geometries.

abstract: Constructing local hidden variable (LHV) models for entangled quantum states is challenging, as the model should reproduce quantum predictions for all possible local measurements. Here we present a simple method for building LHV models, applicable to general entangled states, which consists in verifying that the statistics resulting from a finite set of measurements is local, a much simpler problem. This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit, fully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods are developed for constructing local hidden state models. We illustrate the practical relevance of these methods with several examples, and discuss further applications.

As applications we present new families of states with LHS models, including Bell-diagonal states, noisy GHZ and noisy W states, and generate a list of over 400000 new entangled two-qubit states with LHS model for projective measurements and 1400 for POVM measurements.

abstract: So far the Bloch-Siegert shift of the Rabi model has only been calculated numerically or by means of perturbation theory valid in either the weak or strong driving regime only. Recently Yan, L\"u, and Zheng [Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 91}, 053834 (2015)] showed how to reduce the problem to solving a system of three nonlinear equations. Here, we pursue an alternative approach based on a perturbation expansion extrapolation technique. We are thus able to derive an explicit analytical approximation formula for the Bloch-Siegert shift of the Rabi model which is valid for all parameter regimes from weak to strong driving. Comparison with numerically exact results reveals an excellent agreement over the entire driving-strength range.

abstract: A harmonic oscillator model in four dimensions is presented for the helium atom to estimate the distance to the inner and outer electron from the nucleus, the angle between electrons and the energy levels. The method is algebraic and is not based on the choice of correct trial wave function. Three harmonic oscillators and thus three quantum numbers are sufficient to describe the two-electron system. We derive a simple formula for the energy in the general case and in the special case of the Wannier Ridge. For a set of quantum numbers the distance to the electrons and the angle between the electrons are uniquely determined as the intersection between three surfaces. We show that the excited states converge either towards ionization thresholds or towards extreme parallel or antiparallel states and provide an estimate of the ground state energy.

abstract: We consider the real-time evolution of a strongly coupled system of lattice fermions whose dynamics is driven entirely by dissipative Lindblad processes, with linear or quadratic quantum jump operators. The fermion 2-point functions obey a closed set of diff?erential equations, which can be solved with linear algebra methods. The staggered occupation order parameter of the t-V model decreases exponentially during the dissipative time evolution. The structure factor associated with the various Fourier modes shows the slowing down of low-momentum modes, which is due to particle number conservation. The processes with nearest-neighbor-dependent Lindblad operators have a decay rate that is proportional to the coordination number of the spatial lattice.

Using the framework of nonlocal games, we relate measures of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics to certain norms in the Banach and operator space categories. We survey recent results that exploit this connection to derive large violations of Bell inequalities, study the complexity of the classical and quantum values of games and their relation to Grothendieck inequalities, and quantify the nonlocality of different classes of entangled states.

abstract: In this paper we present a model that elucidates in a simple way the electronic excited states of $\pi$ conjugated -acene molecules such as tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene. We use a tight-binding and truncated Hubbard model written in the electron-hole basis to describe the low lying excitations with reasonable quantitative accuracy. We are able to produce semi-analytic wavefunctions for the electronic states of the system, which allows us to compute the density correlation functions for various states such as the ground state, the first two singly excited states, and the lowest lying doubly excited state. We show that in this lowest lying doubly excited state, a state which has been speculated as to being involved in the singlet fission process, the electrons and holes behave in a triplet like manner.

It is shown that the entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing and convex with respect to the coupling. We also show how the behavior of the entanglement entropy under renormalization group transformations is related to the beta function of the Gross-Neveu model, and compare these renormalization group results to our previous work on interacting scalar field theories.

abstract: Contextuality, the impossibility of assigning a single random variable to represent the outcomes of the same measurement procedure under different experimental conditions, is a central aspect of quantum mechanics. Thus defined, it appears in well-known cases in quantum mechanics, such as the double-slit experiment, the Bell-EPR experiment, and the Kochen-Specker theorem. Here we examine contextuality in such cases, and discuss how each of them bring different conceptual issues when applied to quantum cognition. We then focus on the shortcomings of using quantum probabilities to describe social systems, and explain how negative quasi-probability distributions may address such limitations.

abstract: Superoscillatory wave forms, i.e., waves that locally oscillate faster than their highest Fourier component, possess unusual properties that make them of great interest from quantum mechanics to signal processing. However, the more pronounced the desired superoscillatory behavior is to be, the more difficult it becomes to produce, or even only calculate, such highly fine-tuned wave forms in practice. Here, we investigate how this sensitivity to preparation errors scales for a method for constructing superoscillatory functions which is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the energetic expense. We thereby also arrive at very accurate approximations of functions which are so highly superoscillatory that they cannot be calculated numerically. We then investigate to what extent the scaling and sensitivity results for superoscillatory functions on the real line extend to the experimentally important case of superoscillatory functions that are periodic.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.00232
abstract: We study the decay law for a moving unstable particle. The usual time-dilatation formula states that the decay width for an unstable state moving with a momentum $p$ and mass $M$ is $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}=\Gamma M/\sqrt{p^{2}+M^{2}}$ with $\Gamma$ being the decay width in the rest frame. In agreement with previous studies, we show that in the context of QM as well as QFT this equation is \textit{not} correct provided that the quantum measurement is performed in a reference frame in which the unstable particle has momentum $p$ (note, a momentum eigenstate is \textit{not} a velocity eigenstate in QM). We then give, to our knowledge for the first time, an analytic expression of an improved formula and we show that the deviation from $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}$ has a maximum for $p/M=\sqrt{2/3},$ but is typically \textit{very} small. Then, the result can be easily generalized to a momentum wave packet. As a next step, we show that care is needed when one makes a boost of an unstable state with zero momentum/velocity: namely, the resulting state has zero overlap with the elements of the basis of unstable states (it is already decayed!). However, when considering a spread in velocity, one finds again that $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}$ is typically a very good approximation. In the end, it should be stressed that there is no whatsoever breaking of special relativity, but as usual in QM, one should specify which kind of measurement on which kind of state is performed.

By using an appropriate master equation for a bipartite quantum system in contact with two separate but entangled baths, the generating entanglement process in spatially separated quantum systems is thoroughly characterized. Our results provide evidence that this entanglement transfer by dissipation is feasible yielding to a steady-state amount of entanglement in the bipartite quantum system which can be optimized for a wide range of realistic physical systems that include state-of-the-art experiments with NV centers in diamond, superconducting qubits or even magnetic molecules embedded in a crystalline matrix.

abstract: We realize a single particle microscope by using deterministically extracted laser cooled $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions from a Paul trap as probe particles for transmission imaging. We demonstrate focusing of the ions with a resolution of 5.8$\;\pm\;$1.0$\,$nm and a minimum two-sample deviation of the beam position of 1.5$\,$nm in the focal plane. The deterministic source, even when used in combination with an imperfect detector, gives rise to much higher signal to noise ratios as compared with conventional Poissonian sources. Gating of the detector signal by the extraction event suppresses dark counts by 6 orders of magnitude. We implement a Bayes experimental design approach to microscopy in order to maximize the gain in spatial information. We demonstrate this method by determining the position of a 1$\,\mu$m circular hole structure to an accuracy of 2.7$\,$nm using only 579 probe particles.
