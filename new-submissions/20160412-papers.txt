abstract: In this paper, we consider the rational extensions of two different P T symmetric complex potentials namely the asymptotically vanishing Scarf II and asymptotically non-vanishing Rosen-Morse II [ RM-II] potentials and obtain bound state eigenfunc- tions in terms of newly found exceptional Xm Jacobi polynomials and also some new type of orthogonal polynomials respectively. By considering the asymptotic behaviour of the exceptional polynomials, we obtain the reflection and transmission amplitudes for them and discuss the various novel properties of the corresponding amplitudes.

abstract: The ability to manipulate the spectral-temporal waveform of optical pulses has enabled a wide range of applications from ultrafast spectroscopy to high-speed communications. Extending these concepts to quantum light has the potential to enable breakthroughs in optical quantum science and technology. However, filtering and amplifying often employed in classical pulse shaping techniques are incompatible with non-classical light. Controlling the pulsed mode structure of quantum light requires efficient means to achieve deterministic, unitary manipulation that preserves fragile quantum coherences. Here we demonstrate an electro-optic method for modifying the spectrum of non-classical light by employing a time lens. In particular we show highly-efficient wavelength-preserving six-fold compression of single-photon spectral intensity bandwidth, enabling over a two-fold increase of single-photon flux into a spectrally narrowband absorber. These results pave the way towards spectral-temporal photonic quantum information processing and facilitate interfacing of different physical platforms where quantum information can be stored or manipulated.

abstract: A single-step Eriksen transformation of~$1S_{1/2}$,~$2P_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{3/2}$ states of the relativistic hydrogen atom is performed exactly by expressing each transformed function (TF) as a linear combination of eigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian. The TFs are four-component spinors with vanishing two lower components, are calculated numerically and have the same symmetries as the initial states. For all nuclear charges~$Z \in [1\ldots 92]$ a contribution of the initial state to TFs exceeds 86\% of the total probability density. Next large contribution to TFs comes from delocalized states with negative energies close to~$-m_0c^2-E_b$, where~$E_b$ is the binding energy of initial state. Contribution of other states to TFs is less than~$0.1\%$ of the total probability density. Other components of TFs are nearly zero which confirms both validity of the Eriksen transformation and accuracy of the numerical calculations. The TFs of~$1S_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{1/2}$ states are close to~$1s$ and~$2p$ states of the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom, respectively, but the TF of~$2P_{3/2}$ state differs qualitatively from the~$2p$ state. Functions calculated with use of a linearized Eriksen transformation, being equivalent to the second order Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, are compared with corresponding functions obtained by Eriksen transformation. A very good agreement between both results is obtained.

abstract: We study an optomechanical system consisting of an optical cavity and movable mirror coupled through dispersive linear optomechanical coupling (LOC) and quadratic optomechanical coupling(QOC). We work in the resolved side band limit with a high quality factor mechanical oscillator in a strong coupling regime. We show that the presence of QOC in the conventional optomechanical system (with LOC alone) modifies the mechanical oscillator's frequency and generates its quadrature squeezing. We also show that either of the quadratures can be squeezed depending on the sign of the QOC. With detailed numerical calculations we show that in such systems, the 3 dB limit can be beaten.

abstract: In the B\"uttiker-Landauer perturbation approach to electron tunnelling, through a time-modulated rectilinear potential barrier, the Tien-Gordon identity was invoked, together with its infinite energy spectrum. Here, an exact treatment is presented which is based on the temporal wave-function matching procedure, that led to a finite energy spectrum. In seeking the condition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler formula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which discretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy harmonic equations. As a result, a finite system of inelastic scattering channels was created. When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was scattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering channels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating field, during the transit period across the dynamic barrier. The absorption and emission times of barrier traversal, T_+ and T_-, respectively, were derived for the low and high frequency regimes of the barrier oscillations. Calculations revealed that in the low (high) frequency situation T_+= T_- (T_+< T_-).

abstract: We study L\'evy flights {{with arbitrary index $0< \mu \leq 2$}} inside a potential well of infinite depth. Such problem appears in many physical systems ranging from stochastic interfaces to fracture dynamics and multifractality in disordered quantum systems. The major technical tool is a transformation of the eigenvalue problem for initial fractional Schr\"odinger equation into that for Fredholm integral equation with hypersingular kernel. The latter equation is then solved by means of expansion over the complete set of orthogonal functions in the domain $D$, reducing the problem to the spectrum of a matrix of infinite dimensions. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are then obtained numerically with some analytical results regarding the structure of the spectrum.

abstract: It is emphasized that the bunching parameter $\beta=P_B/P_D$ , i.e. the ratio between the probability to measure two bosons and two distinguishable particles at the same state, is a constant of motion and depends only on the overlap between the initial wavefunctions. This ratio is equal to $\beta=2/(1+I^2)$ , where $I$ is the overlap integral between the initial wavefunctions. That is, only when the initial wavefunctions are orthogonal this ratio is equal to 2, however, this bunching ratio can be reduced to 1, when the two wavefunctions are identical. This simple equation explains the experimental evidences of a beam splitter. A straightforward conclusion is that by measuring the local bunching parameter $\beta$ (at any point in space and time) it is possible to evaluate a global parameter$ I$ (the overlap between the initial wavefunctions). The bunching parameter is then generalized to arbitrary number of particles, and in an analogy to the two-particles scenario, the well-known bosonic enhancement appears only when all states are orthogonal.

We observe that there exists nonlocality in the absence of entanglement, with the behaviour of MIN similar to the quantum correlation measure using mutually unbiased bases. For the thermal state of two interacting spin-1/2 particles, we show the possibility of nonlocality without entanglement as long as the spins are not influenced by an external magnetic field.

abstract: Ramsey interferometry provides a natural way to determine the coherence time of most qubit systems. Recent experiments on quantum dots however, demonstrated that dynamical nuclear spin polarization can strongly influence the measurement process, making it difficult to extract the $T_2^*$ coherence time using optical Ramsey pulses. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method for spin coherence measurement that is based on first-order coherence of photons generated in spin-flip Raman scattering. We show that if a quantum emitter is driven by a weak monochromatic laser, Raman coherence is determined exclusively by spin coherence, allowing for a direct determination of spin $T_2^*$ time. When combined with coherence measurements on Rayleigh scattered photons, our technique enables us to identify coherent and incoherent contributions to resonance fluorescence, and to minimize the latter. We verify the validity of our technique by comparing our results to those determined from Ramsey interferometry for electron and heavy-hole spins.

abstract: We consider a finite one-dimensional Heisenberg XYZ spin chain under the influence of dissipative Lindblad environment obeying the Born-Markovian constrain in presence of an external magnetic field. We apply both closed and open boundary conditions at zero and finite temperature. We present an exact numerical solution for the Lindblad master equation of the system in the Liouville space. we find that, in the free spin chain (in absence of any environment), the entanglement at all ranges evolve in time in a non-uniform oscillatory form that changes significantly depending on the initial state, system size and the spatial anisotropy. The oscillatory behavior is suppressed once the system is coupled to the environment. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement, nearest neighbor and beyond, in the system under the influence of the environment at zero temperature is very sensitive to the x-y spatial anisotropy, which causes them to reach either a zero or a finite sustainable steady state value regardless of the initial state of the system. The anisotropy in the $z-$direction may enhance the entanglement depending on the interplay with the magnetic field applied in the same direction. As the temperature is raised, the steady state of the short range entanglements is found to be robust within very small non-zero temperature range, which depends critically on the spatial anisotropy of the system. The entanglement at each range depends differently on the spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the end to end entanglement transfer time and speed through the open boundary chain vary significantly based on the degree of anisotropy and the temperature of the environment.

abstract: We study the dynamical complexity of an open quantum driven double-well oscillator, mapping its dependence on effective Planck's constant $\hbar_{eff}\equiv\beta$ and coupling to the environment, $\Gamma$. We study this using stochastic Schrodinger equations, semiclassical equations, and the classical limit equation. We show that (i) the dynamical complexity initially increases with effective Hilbert space size (as $\beta$ decreases) such that the most quantum systems are the least dynamically complex. (ii) If the classical limit is chaotic, that is the most dynamically complex (iii) if the classical limit is regular, there is always a quantum system more dynamically complex than the classical system. There are several parameter regimes where the quantum system is chaotic even though the classical limit is not. While some of the quantum chaotic attractors are of the same family as the classical limiting attractors, we also find a quantum attractor with no classical counterpart. These phenomena occur in experimentally accessible regimes.

abstract: Nonlocality is one of the main characteristic features of quantum systems involving more than one spatially separated subsystems. It is manifested theoretically as well as experimentally through violation of some \emph{local realistic} inequality. But, generally it is difficult to deal with individual particle in real experiment. One has to rather address beam of particles which may cause dilution of nonlocal behavior. Moreover, classical behavior of all physical phenomena at macroscopic limit gives a general intuition that any \emph{physical} theory for describing microscopic phenomena should resemble classical physics at macroscopic regime. In the 2-2-2 scenario (two parties, each performing two measurements, each measurement with two outcomes), contemplating all the correlations that may be stronger than quantum mechanics in exhibiting nonlocal behavior, yet weak enough to prohibit instantaneous signaling, we characterize which of them exhibit \emph{classical} (\emph{local-realistic}) behaviour in the microscopic scale. Interestingly, we find that their exist correlations which indeed remain nonlocal at the macroscopic scale and hence fail to be considered as physical one. Our study thus provides a sufficient criterion to identify some of unphysical correlations.

We also demonstrate the application our bound for some concrete examples.

abstract: Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical zero-knowledge proof systems, and under reasonable hardness assumptions for quantum computations, these proof systems can be made secure against quantum attacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of this fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically, assuming the existence of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment scheme, we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient quantum computations. Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations, provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.

abstract: It is known that a necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) for the quantum relative entropy is the existence of a recovery map. Similarly to classical sufficient statistics, a quantum channel admitting a recovery map with respect to a set of states is called a sufficient channel. We show that equality in DPI for a sandwiched R\'enyi relative $\alpha$-entropy with $\alpha>1$ is also equivalent to this property. For the proof, we use an interpolating family of $L_p$-norms with respect to a state.

abstract: Motivated by symmetry, we construct a relational, or relative description of quantum states and observables. From the premise that the notion of an observable quantity includes the specification of a reference frame, and using a relativization map which makes the frame-dependence explicit, we show that the usual quantum description approximates the relative one precisely when the reference system admits an appropriate localizable quantity and a localized state. From this follows a new perspective on the nature and reality of quantum superpositions and optical coherence.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.02864
abstract: Stokes vectors and Discrete Wigner functions (DWF) provide two alternate ways of representing the polarization state of multiphoton systems. The Stokes vector associated with a n-photon polarization state is unique, and its Minkowski squared norm provides a direct way of quantifying entanglement through n-concurrence. However, the quanti?cation of entanglement from DWF is not straight forward. The DWF associated with a given quantum state is not unique but depends on the way in which basis vectors are assigned to various lines in the phase space. For a Hilbert space of dimension N, there exists N N+1 such possible assignments. While a given DWF corresponds to a unique Stokes vector, the converse is not true. In the present work, we show that, for each particular assignment called a quantum net, there exist a unique Hadamard matrix which relates the Stokes vector to the corresponding DWF. This method provides an elegant and direct method of constructing the DWFs from the Stokes vector for every possible choice of the quantum net. Using these results, we derive the relationship between the Stokes vector of a spin-?ipped state and the DWF. Finally, we also present a method to express the Minkowskian squared norm of the Stokes vector directly in terms of the DWF.

abstract: We study the optical properties of an ensemble of two-level atoms coupled to a 1D photonic crystal waveguide (PCW), which mediates long-range coherent dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms. We show that the long-range interactions can dramatically alter the linear and nonlinear optical behavior, as compared to a typical atomic ensemble. In particular, in the linear regime, we find that the transmission spectrum reveals multiple transmission dips, whose properties we show how to characterize. In the many-photon regime the system response can be highly non-linear, and under certain circumstances the ensemble can behave like a single two-level system, which is only capable of absorbing and emitting a single excitation at a time. Our results are of direct relevance to atom-PCW experiments that should soon be realizable.

Comparisons among all bounds for multi-measurements are shown in figures in our favor.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.02931
abstract: The work proposes an extension of the quantum circuit formalism where qubits (wires) are circular instead of linear. The left-to-right interpretation of a quantum circuit is replaced by a circular representation which allows to select the starting point and the direction in which gates are executed. The representation supports all the circuits obtained after computing cyclic permutations of an initial quantum gate list. Two circuits, where one has a gate list which is a cyclic permutation of the other, will implement different functions. The main question appears in the context of scalable quantum computing, where multiple subcircuits are used for the construction of a larger fault-tolerant one: can the same circular representation be used by multiple subcircuits? The circular circuits are sufficient for constructing computationally universal, fault-tolerant circuits formed entirely of qubit initialisation, CNOT gates and qubit measurements. The main result of modelling circular CNOT circuits is that a derived Boolean representation allows to define a set of equations for $X$ and $Z$ stabiliser transformations. Through a well defined set of steps it is possible to reduce the initial equations to a set of stabiliser transformations given a series of cuts through the circular circuit.

abstract: For any finite dimensional Hilbert space, we construct explicitly five orthonormal bases such that the corresponding measurements allow for efficient tomography of an arbitrary pure quantum state. This means that such measurements can be used to distinguish an arbitrary pure state from any other state, pure or mixed, and the pure state can be reconstructed from the outcome distribution in a feasible way. The set of measurements we construct is independent of the unknown state, and therefore our results provide a fixed scheme for pure state tomography, as opposed to the adaptive (state dependent) scheme proposed by Goyeneche et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 090401 (2015)]. We show that our scheme is robust with respect to noise in the sense that any measurement scheme which approximates these measurements well enough is equally suitable for pure state tomography. Finally, we present two convex programs which can be used to reconstruct the unknown pure state from the measurement outcome distributions.

abstract: In quantum theory the vacuum is defined as a state of minimum energy that is devoid of particles but still not completely empty. It is perhaps more surprising that its definition depends on the geometry of the system and on the trajectory of an observer through space-time. Along these lines we investigate the case of an atom flying at constant velocity near a planar surface. Using general concepts of statistical mechanics it is shown that the motion-modified interaction with the electromagnetic vacuum is formally equivalent to the interaction with a thermal field having an effective temperature determined by the atom's velocity and distance from the surface. This result suggests new ways to experimentally investigate the properties of the quantum vacuum in non-equilibrium systems and effects such as quantum friction.

Finally, we find that small error bounds can be reached with polynomially scaling resources, evaluated as the number of performed measurements.

abstract: A challenge for constructing large circuits of superconducting qubits is to balance addressability, coherence and coupling strength. High coherence can be attained by building circuits from fixed-frequency qubits, however, leading techniques cannot couple qubits that are far detuned. Here we introduce a method based on a tunable bus which allows for the coupling of two fixed-frequency qubits even at large detunings. By parametrically oscillating the bus at the qubit-qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange (XX+YY) interaction. We use this interaction to implement a 183ns two-qubit iSWAP gate between qubits separated in frequency by 854MHz with a measured average fidelity of 0.9823(4) from interleaved randomized benchmarking. This gate may be an enabling technology for surface code circuits and for analog quantum simulation.

abstract: We study the dynamics of an open quantum system interacting with a non-thermal bath. Here, "non-thermal" means that the bath modes do not need to have the same temperature, but they have an effective temperature distribution. We find that, when a quantum system is interacting with such a non-thermal bath far from thermal equilibrium, it is no longer proper to use any coarse-grained Markovian description for the system, even when their coupling strength is quite weak. Especially, when there is coherent transition with strong interference strength in the quantum system, the Markovian master equation would bring in a serious problem of negative probability. After we consider some proper non-Markovian corrections, the problem can be naturally resolved.

abstract: In recent years, a rigorous quantum mechanical model for the interaction between light and macroscopic dispersive, lossy dielectrics has emerged -macroscopic QED- allowing the application of the usual methods of quantum field theory. Here, we apply time dependent perturbation theory to a general class of problems involving time dependent lossy, dispersive dielectrics. The model is used to derive polariton excitation rates in three illustrative cases, including that of a travelling Gaussian perturbation to the susceptibility of an otherwise infinite homogeneous dielectric, motivated by recent experiments on analogue Hawking radiation. We find that the excitation rate is increased when the wave--vector and frequency of each polariton in the pair either satisfies (or nearly satisfies) the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves, or is close to a material resonance.

abstract: We show how bond order emerges due to light mediated synthetic interactions in ultracold atoms in optical lattices in an optical cavity. This is a consequence of the competition between both short- and long-range interactions designed by choosing the optical geometry. Light induces effective many-body interactions that modify the landscape of quantum phases supported by the typical Bose-Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization of small system sizes in one dimension, we present the many-body quantum phases the system can support via the interplay between the density and bond (or matter-wave coherence) interactions. We find numerical evidence to support that dimer phases due to bond order are analogous to valence bond solids.

abstract: Quantum gravity may have as much to tell us about the foundations and interpretation of quantum mechanics as it does about gravity. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Everett's Relative State Formulation are complementary descriptions which in a sense are dual to one another. My purpose here is to discuss this duality in the light of the of ER=EPR conjecture.

abstract: We study the logarithmic negativity and the moments of the partial transpose in the ground state of a two dimensional massless harmonic square lattice with nearest neighbour interactions for various configurations of adjacent domains. At leading order for large domains, the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the ratio between the generic moment of the partial transpose and the moment of the reduced density matrix at the same order satisfy an area law in terms of the length of the curve shared by the adjacent regions. We give numerical evidences that the coefficient of the area law term in these quantities is related to the coefficient of the area law term in the R\'enyi entropies. Whenever the curve shared by the adjacent domains contains vertices, a subleading logarithmic term occurs in these quantities and the numerical values of the corner function for some pairs of angles are obtained. In the special case of vertices corresponding to explementary angles, we provide numerical evidence that the corner function of the logarithmic negativity is given by the corner function of the R\'enyi entropy of order 1/2.

abstract: We experimentally and theoretically investigate injection locking of quantum dot (QD) microlasers in the regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We observe frequency locking and phase-locking where cavity enhanced spontaneous emission enables simultaneous stable oscillation at the master frequency and at the solitary frequency of the slave microlaser. Measurements of the second-order autocorrelation function prove this simultaneous presence of both master and slave-like emission, where the former has coherent character with $g^{(2)}(0)=1$ while the latter one has thermal character with $g^{(2)}(0)=2$. Semi-classical rate-equations explain this peculiar behavior by cavity enhanced spontaneous emission and a low number of photons in the laser mode.

abstract: We investigate the evolution of string order in a spin-1 chain following a quantum quench. After initializing the chain in the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state, we analyze in detail how string order evolves as a function of time at different length scales. The Hamiltonian after the quench is chosen either to preserve or to suddenly break the symmetry which ensures the presence of string order. Depending on which of these two situations arises, string order is either preserved or lost even at infinitesimal times in the thermodynamic limit. The fact that non-local order may be abruptly destroyed, what we call string-order melting, makes it qualitatively different from typical order parameters \`a la Landau. This situation is thoroughly characterized by means of numerical simulations based on matrix product states algorithms and analytical studies based on a short-time expansion for several simplified models.

abstract: We analyze the time-resolved energy transport and the entropy production in ac-driven quantum coherent electron systems coupled to multiple reservoirs at finite temperature. At slow driving we formulate the first and second laws of thermodynamics valid at each instant of time. We identify heat fluxes flowing though the different pieces of the device and emphasize the importance of the energy stored in the contact and central regions for the second law of thermodynamics to be instantaneously satisfied. In addition, we discuss conservative and dissipative contributions to the heat flux and to the entropy production as a function of time. We illustrate these ideas with a simple model corresponding to a driven level coupled to two reservoirs with different chemical potentials.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.02962
abstract: Landauer's formula is the standard theoretical tool to examine ballistic transport in nano- and meso-scale junctions, but it necessitates that any variation of the junction with time must be slow compared to characteristic times of the system, e.g., the relaxation time of local excitations. Transport through structurally dynamic junctions is, however, increasingly of interest for sensing, harnessing fluctuations, and real-time control. Here, we calculate the steady-state current when relaxation of electrons in the reservoirs is present and demonstrate that it gives rise to three regimes of behavior: weak relaxation gives a contact-limited current; strong relaxation localizes electrons, distorting their natural dynamics and reducing the current; and in an intermediate regime the Landauer view of the system only is recovered. We also demonstrate that a simple equation of motion emerges, which is suitable for efficiently simulating time-dependent transport.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.02976
abstract: The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of interaction quenched finite ultracold bosonic ensembles in periodically driven one-dimensional optical lattices is investigated. It is shown that periodic driving enforces the bosons in the outer wells of the finite lattice to exhibit out-of-phase dipole-like modes, while in the central well the atomic cloud experiences a local breathing mode. The dynamical behavior is investigated with varying driving frequency, revealing a resonant-like behavior of the intra-well dynamics. An interaction quench in the periodically driven lattice gives rise to admixtures of different excitations in the outer wells, an enhanced breathing in the center and an amplification of the tunneling dynamics. We observe then multiple resonances between the inter- and intra-well dynamics at different quench amplitudes, with the position of the resonances being tunable via the driving frequency. Our results pave the way for future investigations on the use of combined driving protocols in order to excite different inter- and intra-well modes and to subsequently control them.

abstract: We prove several trace inequalities that extend the Golden-Thompson and the Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality to arbitrarily many matrices. In particular, we strengthen Lieb's triple matrix inequality. As an example application of our four matrix extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality, we prove remainder terms for the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy and strong sub-additivity of the von Neumann entropy in terms of recoverability, improving on recent results in the literature. Our proofs rely on complex interpolation theory as well as asymptotic spectral pinching, providing a transparent approach to treat generic multivariate trace inequalities.

An algorithm of exact calculation for the Jacobian of a respective change of variables in the path integral is presented. Applications to the Yang--Mills theory and Standard Model, in view of infra-red (Gribov) peculiarities, are discussed.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.03060
abstract: We investigate the modeling capabilities of sets of coupled classical harmonic oscillators (CHO) in the form of a modeling game. The application of simple but restrictive rules of the game lead to conditions for an isomorphism between Lie-algebras and real Clifford algebras. We show that the correlations between two coupled classical oscillators find their natural description in the Dirac algebra and allow to model aspects of special relativity, inertial motion, electromagnetism and quantum phenomena including spin in one go. The algebraic properties of Hamiltonian motion of low-dimensional systems can generally be related to certain types of interactions and hence to the dimensionality of emergent space-times. We describe the intrinsic connection between phase space volumes of a 2-dimensional oscillator and the Dirac algebra. In this version of a phase space interpretation of quantum mechanics the (components of the) spinor wave-function in momentum space are abstract canonical coordinates, and the integrals over the squared wave function represents second moments in phase space. The wave function in ordinary space-time can be obtained via Fourier transformation. Within this modeling game, 3+1-dimensional space-time is interpreted as a structural property of electromagnetic interaction. A generalization selects a series of Clifford algebras of specific dimensions with similar properties, specifically also 10- and 26-dimensional real Clifford algebras.
