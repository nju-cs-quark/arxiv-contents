abstract: Quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.

title: Making Existential-Unforgeable Signatures Strongly Unforgeable in the Quantum Random-Oracle Model

abstract: Strongly unforgeable signature schemes provide a more stringent security guarantee than the standard existential unforgeability. It requires that not only forging a signature on a new message is hard, it is infeasible as well to produce a new signature on a message for which the adversary has seen valid signatures before. Strongly unforgeable signatures are useful both in practice and as a building block in many cryptographic constructions. This work investigates a generic transformation that compiles any existential-unforgeable scheme into a strongly unforgeable one, which was proposed by Teranishi et al. and was proven in the classical random-oracle model. Our main contribution is showing that the transformation also works against quantum adversaries in the quantum random-oracle model. We develop proof techniques such as adaptively programming a quantum random-oracle in a new setting, which could be of independent interest. Applying the transformation to an existential-unforgeable signature scheme due to Cash et al., which can be shown to be quantum-secure assuming certain lattice problems are hard for quantum computers, we get an efficient quantum-secure strongly unforgeable signature scheme in the quantum random-oracle model.

abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation is a model for quantum information processing utilizing local measurements on suitably entangled resource states for the implementation of quantum gates. A complete characterization for universal resource states is still missing. It has been shown that symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension can be exploited for the protection of certain quantum gates in measurement-based quantum computation. In this paper we show that the two-dimensional plaquette states on arbitrary lattices exhibit nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order in terms of symmetry fractionalization and that they are universal resource states for quantum computation. Our results of the nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order on arbitrary 2D lattices are based on an extension of the recent construction by Chen, Gu, Liu and Wen {[Phys. Rev. B \textbf{87}, 155114 (2013)]} on the square lattice.

abstract: Fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions uses the overlap between ground states of the system to gain some information about its quantum phases. Such an overlap is called fidelity. We illustrate how this approach works in the one dimensional quantum Ising model in the transverse field. Several closed-form analytical expressions for fidelity are discussed. An example of what insights fidelity provides into the dynamics of quantum phase transitions is carefully described. The role of fidelity in central spin systems is pointed out.

abstract: We study the interaction of an atom with a one-dimensional nano-grating within the framework of macroscopic QED, with special emphasis on possible anisotropic contributions. To this end, we first derive the scattering Green's tensor of the grating by means of a Rayleigh expansion and discuss its symmetry properties and asymptotes. We then determine the Casimir--Polder potential of an atom with the grating. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy can lead to a repulsive Casimir--Polder potential in the normal direction.

abstract: We propose and experimentally verify a cooling limit for a quantum channel going through an incoherent environment. The environment consists of a large number of independent non-interacting and non-interfering elementary quantum systems - qubits. The qubits travelling through the channel can only be randomly replaced by environmental qubits. We investigate a conditional cooling limit that exploits an additional probing output. The limit specifies when the single-qubit channel is quantum, i.e. it preserves entanglement. It is a fundamental condition for entanglement-based quantum technology.

abstract: We demonstrate a solid state spin-wave optical memory based on stopped light in a spectral hole. A long lived narrow spectral hole is created by optical pumping in the inhomogeneous absorption profile of a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. Optical pulses sent through the spectral hole experience a strong reduction of their group velocity and are spatially compressed in the crystal. A short Raman pulse transfers the optical excitation to the spin state before the light pulse exits the crystal, effectively stopping the light. After a controllable delay, a second Raman pulse is sent, which leads to the emission of the stored photons. We reach storage and retrieval efficiencies for bright pulses of up to $39\,\%$ in a $5 \,\mathrm{mm}$-long crystal. We also show that our device works at the single photon level by storing and retrieving $3\,\mathrm{\mu s}$-long weak coherent pulses with efficiencies up to $31\,\%$, demonstrating the most efficient spin-wave solid state optical memory at the single-photon level so far. We reach an unconditional noise level of $(9\pm1)\times 10^{-3}$ photons per pulse in a detection window of $4\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ leading to a signal-to-noise ratio of $33 \pm 4$ for an average input photon number of 1, making our device promising for long-lived storage of non-classical light.

abstract: The generation and storage of entangled photons play important roles in quantum information technique. Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) in atomic ensembles provides a promising method to generate entangled photons capable of storage. In the past experiments, a spin-wave-photon entangled state is produced via SRS in an atomic ensemble, with which a pair of entangled photons is obtained. Here, we report a scheme of simultaneously generating two spin-wave-photon entangled states in an atomic ensemble by collecting Stokes photons at two different directions. Based on the obtained two atom-photon entangled sources, we generate a three-photon GHZ polarization-entangled state and conditionally prepare a polarization-entangled photon pair, respectively.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a single-channel side-coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR). Analytic expressions for the number of photon pairs generated, as well as the biphoton wave function (joint spectral amplitude) describing the pairs, are derived and numerically computed for different pump pulse durations and numbers of ring resonators. In the limit of a long input pump pulse, we show a strong analogy between super-linear scaling of generation efficiency with respect to the number of rings in the structure and Dicke superradiance. More generally, we discuss in detail the factors that influence the shape of the biphoton wave function, as well as the conditions for observing super-SFWM.

Apart from the von Neumann entropy, it considers other measures one of which may be useful in obtaining information about an unknown pure state and another that may be useful in quantum games. It is shown that under certain conditions in a two-party quantum game, the receiver of the states can increase the entropy by adding another pure state.

abstract: Entropic Dynamics is a framework in which dynamical laws are derived as an application of entropic methods of inference. No underlying action principle is postulated. Instead, the dynamics is driven by entropy subject to the constraints appropriate to the problem at hand. In this paper we review three examples of entropic dynamics. First we tackle the simpler case of a standard diffusion process which allows us to address the central issue of the nature of time. Then we show that imposing the additional constraint that the dynamics be non-dissipative leads to Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, considerations from information geometry naturally lead to the type of Hamiltonian that describes quantum theory.

abstract: We show how to perform a fault-tolerant universal quantum computation in 2D architectures using only transversal unitary operators and local syndrome measurements. Our approach is based on a doubled version of the 2D color code. It enables a transversal implementation of all logical gates in the Clifford+T basis using the gauge fixing method proposed recently by Paetznick and Reichardt. The gauge fixing requires six-qubit parity measurements for Pauli operators supported on faces of the honeycomb lattice with two qubits per site. Doubled color codes are promising candidates for the experimental demonstration of logical gates since they do not require state distillation. Secondly, we propose a Maximum Likelihood algorithm for the error correction and gauge fixing tasks that enables a numerical simulation of logical circuits in the Clifford+T basis. The algorithm can be used in the online regime such that a new error syndrome is revealed at each time step. We estimate the average number of logical gates that can be implemented reliably for the smallest doubled color code and a toy noise model that includes depolarizing memory errors and syndrome measurement errors.

abstract: Information-theoretical quantities such as statistical distinguishability typically result from optimisations over all conceivable observables. Physical theories, however, are not generally considered valid for all mathematically allowed measurements. For instance, quantum field theories are not meant to be correct or even consistent at arbitrarily small lengthscales. A general way of limiting such an optimisation to certain observables is to first coarse-grain the states by a quantum channel. We show how to calculate contractive quantum information metrics on coarse-grained equilibrium states of free bosonic systems (Gaussian states), in directions generated by arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian. As an example, we study the Klein-Gordon field. If the phase-space resolution is coarse compared to h-bar, the various metrics become equal and the calculations simplify. In that context, we compute the scale dependence of the distinguishability of the quartic interaction.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03301
abstract: We examine the locality assumption of Bell's theorem in three steps of EPRB experiment. Depending on the context, locality is embodied in the conditions of separability, local causality, factorizability, relativistic causality, and non-contextuality. We show that separability, characterized by the constraint of zero covariance, is equivalent to local causality which leads to factorizability through the measurement process. Factorizability is the conjunction of parameter independence and outcome independence. It is commonly believed that relativistic causality is equivalent to parameter independence, which is satisfied by quantum mechanics. According to our approach, however, this is unjustified due to the second step analysis of EPRB experiment, including the measurement on the first particle. We define non-contextuality based on preparation procedure and measurement process. Preparation-based non-contextuality is an independent assumption, but non-locality within the framework of a separable model can be interpreted as measurement-based contextuality. Finally, we show that any fundamental theory consistent with quantum mechanics, should refute outcome independence in its framework of description.

abstract: Two electronic channels competing to screen a single impurity spin, as in the two-channel Kondo model, are expected to generate a ground state with nontrivial entanglement structure. We exploit a spin-chain representation of the two channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy, negativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization group approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels we confirm field theoretic predictions for the boundary entropy difference, $\ln (g_{UV}/g_{IR})=\ln(2)/2$, between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the leading $\ln(x)/x$ impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity entanglement, $S_{\text{imp}}$, is shown to scale with the characteristic length $\xi_{2CK}$. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of the impurity with one of the channels $-$ as measured by the negativity$-$ faithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition appearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit determination of critical exponents, $\nu\!\approx\! 2$ and $\beta \!\approx\! 0.2$. Finally, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement, measured by the tangle, only in the vicinity of the critical point.

These analyses lead us to mention some of the open problems.

It is aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduates, with no previous knowledge beyond undergraduate quantum mechanics assumed. The necessary mathematical background in differential geometry is reviewed, though a familiarity with this material is undoubtedly helpful.

abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative technology which exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure cryptographic keys. While QKD offers the promise of unconditionally secure key distribution, real world systems are built from non-ideal components which necessitates the need to model and understand the impact these non-idealities have on system performance and security. OMNeT++ has been used as a basis to develop a simulation framework to support this endeavor. This framework, referred to as "qkdX" extends OMNeT++'s module and message abstractions to efficiently model optical components, optical pulses, operating protocols and processes. This paper presents the design of this framework including how OMNeT++'s abstractions have been utilized to model quantum optical components, optical pulses, fiber and free space channels. Furthermore, from our toolbox of created components, we present various notional and real QKD systems, which have been studied and analyzed.

abstract: We study the problem of estimating the magnitude of a Gaussian beam displacement using a two pixel or 'split' detector. We calculate the maximum likelihood estimator, and compute its asymptotic mean-squared-error via the Fisher information. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is known to be simply related to the Fisher information under idealised detection, we find the two measures of precision differ markedly for a split detector. We show that a greater signal-to-noise ratio 'before' the detector leads to a greater information penalty, unless adaptive realignment is used. We find that with an initially balanced split detector, tuning the normalised difference in counts to 0.884753... gives the highest posterior Fisher information, and that this provides an improvement by at least a factor of about 2.5 over operating in the usual linear regime. We discuss the implications for weak-value amplification, a popular probabilistic signal amplification technique.
