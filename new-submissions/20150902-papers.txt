abstract: The problem of the electromagnetic self-force can be studied in terms of a quadratic PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Here, we apply a straightforward algebraic method to determine the regions of model-parameter space where the quantum-mechanical operator exhibits real spectrum. An alternative point of view consists of finding the values of the model parameters so that a symmetric operator supports bound states.

abstract: We analyze the effect of phase fluctuations in an optical communication scheme based on collective detection of sequences of binary coherent state symbols using linear optics and photon counting. When the phase noise is absent, the scheme offers qualitatively improved nonlinear scaling of the spectral efficiency with the mean photon number in the low-power regime compared to individual detection. We show that this feature, providing a demonstration of superaddivitity of accessible information in classical communication over quantum channels, is preserved if random phases imprinted on transmitted symbols fluctuate around a reference fixed over the sequence length.

abstract: We present the exact solution of the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for inverse square root potential $V=V_0/{\sqrt{x}}$. Each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the problem is given by a combination with non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric functions of a shifted argument. Alternatively, the solution is written through the first derivative of a tri-confluent Heun function. Apart from the standard quasi-polynomial eigensolutions providing the spectrum $E_n=E_1{n^{-2/3}}$, we discuss the case of bound-state wave functions vanishing both at infinity and in the origin. The exact spectrum equation for this case involves two Hermite functions of non-integer order which are not polynomials. An accurate approximation for the spectrum providing absolute error less than $10^{-3}$ is $E_n=E_1{(n-1/(2 \pi))^{-2/3}}$ . Each of the wave functions of bound states in general involves a combination with non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric and two non-integer order Hermite functions of a scaled and shifted coordinate.

abstract: Based on the mutually unbiased bases, the mutually unbiased measurements and the general symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures, we propose three separability criteria for $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum systems, which are more powerful than the corresponding ones introduced in [C. Spengler, M. Huber, S. Brierley, T. Adaktylos, and B.C. Hiesmayr, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{86}, 022311 (2012); B. Chen, T. Ma, and S.M. Fei, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{89}, 064302 (2014); B. Chen, T. Li, and S.M. Fei, arXiv:1406.7820v1 [quant-ph] (2014)]. Some states such as Werner states and Bell-diagonal states are used to further illustrate the efficiency of the presented criteria.

abstract: In this article we discuss the formal structure of a generalized information theory based on the extension of the probability calculus of Kolmogorov to a (possibly) non-commutative setting. By studying this framework, we argue that quantum information can be considered as a particular case of a huge family of non-commutative extensions of its classical counterpart. In any conceivable information theory, the possibility of dealing with different kinds of information measures plays a key role. Here, we generalize a notion of state spectrum, allowing us to introduce a majorization relation and a new family of generalized entropic measures.

abstract: We compare the standard 1/2-efficient single beam splitter method for Bell-state measurement to a proposed 3/4-efficient extension [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011)] in light of realistic experimental conditions. Our comparison is two-fold. First, we analyze the performance when one replaces number-resolving detectors with standard non-ideal ones either individually or in multiplexed arrays. Second, we analyze the performance of various detector types when the auxiliary source of perfect Bell pairs required for the enhanced scheme is replaced with a down-conversion source. On the detector side, we find that the enhanced scheme is superior to the standard scheme if fast number-resolving detectors with efficiencies greater than 82 % are used. If the number-resolving detectors are replaced with non-number-resolving detectors, then this can significantly decrease the success rate in the enhanced scheme whereas the standard scheme is less affected. Arrays of efficient detectors of various types with negligible dark count probabilities allow to increase success rates arbitrarily close to scheme maximum rates. However, with realistic efficiency and dark count probabilities noise becomes dominant with array size greater than approximately 20. On the auxiliary state side, we find that the enhanced scheme with ideal number-resolving detectors is still superior to the standard scheme when the auxiliary state is produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

abstract: We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model describing the interaction of a Cooper pair box (CPB) and a nanoresonator (NR) in the presence of a Kerr medium and losses The evolution of the entropy of both subsystems and the CPB population inversion were calculated numerically. It is found that these properties increase when the NR frequency is time-dependent, even in the presence of losses; the effect is very sensitive to detuning and disappears in the resonant regime. The roles played by the losses affecting the CPB and the NR are also compared.

abstract: By using transitionless quantum driving algorithm, we present an efficient shortcut to the holonomic quantum computation (HQC) in decoherence-free subspace (DFS). The adiabatic process can be speeded up in the shortest possible time. Besides the virtues of resilience of local fluctuations inherited from HQC and robustness against the collective noises with DFS, the present proposal requires only two-body interaction, and it is more feasible to be achieved in the specific physical system. In particular, we give a physical implementation for this shortcut on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds coupled to a whispering-gallery mode microsphere cavity in the dispersive regime. The shortcut scheme can be efficiently realized by controlling appropriately the frequencies of the external laser pulses as long as the initial conditions are prescribed. Moreover, these accelerated holonomic quantum gates, including two noncommuting single-qubit holonomic gates and a two-qubit holonomic controlled-phase gate, are insensitive to the cavity field states due to the virtual photon property. In addition, our scheme has potential extensions and generalizations to scale up the qubits.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), based on the notions of realism and noninvasive measurability, is applied in the context of a linear harmonic oscillator. It is found that merely through observing at various instants which region of the potential well, the oscillating quantum object is in, the LGI can be violated without taking recourse to any ancillary quantum system. Strikingly, this violation reveals an unexplored nonclassicality of the state which is considered the most "classical-like" of all quantum states, namely the Schr\"odinger coherent state. In the macrolimit, the extent to which such nonclassicality persists for large values of mass and classical amplitudes of oscillation is quantitatively investigated. It is found that while for any given mass and oscillator frequency, a significant quantum violation of LGI can be obtained by suitably choosing the initial peak momentum of the coherent state wave packet, as the mass is sufficiently increased, actual observability of this violation becomes increasingly difficult. A feasible experimental setup for testing the predicted quantum mechanical violation of LGI is suggested using a trapped nano-object of $\sim 10^6-10^9$ amu mass.

The focus is on how symmetry, integrability, and solvability depend on the trap shape, two-body interaction, the number of particles, and the number of spin components. A series of comments are presented that characterize the minimal symmetries possible for a composite system constructed from interacting single particles, with special focus on the contact interaction. For five and more particles with internal components like spin, a kind of universality called algebraically solvability is lost.

abstract: We present two deterministic schemes for constructing a CNOT gate and a Toffoli gate on photon-atom and photon-atom-atom hybrid quantum systems assisted by bad cavities, respectively. They are achieved by cavity-assisted photon scattering and work in the intermediate coupling region with bad cavities, which relaxes the difficulty of their implementation in experiment. Also, bad cavities are feasible for fast quantum operations and reading out information. Compared with previous works, our schemes do not need any auxiliary qubits and measurements. Moreover, the quantum circuits for these gates are simple, especially that for our Toffoli gate as only a quarter wave packet is used to interact the photon with each of the atoms every time. These atom-cavity systems can be used as the quantum nodes in long-distance quantum communication as their relatively long coherence time is suitable for multi-time operations between the photon and the system. Our calculations show that the average fidelities and efficiencies of our two universal hybrid quantum gates are high with current experimental technology.

abstract: As a follow-up to a recent study in the spin-0 case [J. Bunao and E. A. Galapon, Ann. Phys. 353, 83-106 (2015)], we construct a one-particle Time of Arrival (TOA) operator conjugate to a Hamiltonian describing a free relativistic spin-1/2 particle in one spatial dimension. Upon transformation in a representation where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, it turns out that the constructed operator consists of an operator term $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ whose action is the same as in the spin-0 case, and another operator term $\mathcal{\hat{T}}_0$ which commutes with the Hamiltonian but breaks invariance under parity inversion. If we must impose this symmetry on our TOA operator, then we can throw away $\mathcal{\hat{T}}_0$ so that the TOA operator is just $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$.

abstract: In the present work we introduce a new way of identifying quantum phase transitions of many-body systems by means of local time correlations and Leggett-Garg inequalities. This procedure allows to experimentally determine the quantum critical points not only of finite-order transitions but also those of infinite-order as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that is not always easy to detect with current methods. By means of an analytical calculation on a general spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian, and matrix product simulations of one-dimensional $XXZ$ and anisotropic $XY$ models, we argue that finite-order quantum phase transitions can be determined by singularities of the time correlations or their derivatives at criticality. The same features are exhibited by corresponding Leggett-Garg functions, which remarkably indicate violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities for early times and all the Hamiltonian parameters considered. In addition, we find that the infinite-order transition of the $XXZ$ model at the isotropic point can be revealed by the maximal violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. We thus show that quantum phase transitions can be identified by purely local measurements, and that many-body systems constitute important candidates to observe experimentally the violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities.

abstract: We construct a one-particle TOA operator $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ canonically conjugate with the Hamiltonian describing a free, charged, spin-$0$, relativistic particle in one spatial dimension and show that it is maximally symmetric. We solve for its eigenfunctions and show that they form a complete and non-orthogonal set. Plotting the time evolution of their corresponding probability densities, it implies that the eigenfunctions become more localized at the origin at the time equal to their eigenvalues. That is, a particle being described by an eigenfunction of $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ is in a state of definite arrival time at the origin and at the corresponding eigenvalue. We also calculate the TOA probability distribution of a particle in some initial state.

abstract: Tests of local realism and macrorealism have historically been discussed in very similar terms: Leggett-Garg inequalities follow Bell inequalities as necessary conditions for classical behavior. Here, we compare the probability polytopes spanned by all measurable probability distributions for both scenarios and show that their structure differs strongly between spatially and temporally separated measurements. We arrive at the conclusion that, in contrast to tests of local realism where Bell inequalities form a necessary and sufficient set of conditions, no set of inequalities can ever be necessary and sufficient for macrorealism. A recently proposed condition, no-signaling in time, fulfills this criterion, and we show why it is better suited for future experimental tests of macrorealism.

abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle (PEP) has a tremendous impact on the properties and the behavior of most fermionic quantum systems. Remarkably, even stronger restrictions on fermionic natural occupation numbers follow from the fermionic exchange statistics. Based on a hierarchy induced by PEP we develop an operationally meaningful measure which allows to quantify the potential physical relevance of those generalized Pauli constraints (GPC) beyond the well-established relevance of PEP. By studying a few fermions in a harmonic trap we explore and confirm for the first time such nontrivial significance of GPC not only for weak couplings but even up to medium interaction strengths.

abstract: Optical lossless beam splitters are frequently encountered in fundamental physics experiments regarding the nature of light, including "which-way" determination of light particles, N. Bohr's complementarity principle, or the EPR paradox and all their measurement apparatus. Although they look as common optical components at first glance, their behaviour remains somewhat mysterious since they apparently exhibit stand-alone particle-like features, and then wave-like characteristics when inserted into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this communication are examined and discussed some basic properties of these beamssplitters, both from a classical optics and quantum physics point of view. Herein some convergences and contradictions are highlighted, and the results of a few emblematic experiments demonstrating photon existence are discussed. An alternative empirical model in wave optics is also proposed in order to shed light on some remaining questions

abstract: The entropic uncertainty relation proven by Maassen and Uffink for arbitrary pairs of two observables is known to be non-optimal. Here, we call an uncertainty relation optimal, if the lower bound can be attained for any value of either of the corresponding uncertainties. In this work we establish optimal uncertainty relations by characterising the optimal lower bound in scenarios similar to the Maassen-Uffink type. We disprove a conjecture by Englert et al. and generalise various previous results. However, we are still far from a complete understanding and, based on numerical investigation and analytical results in small dimension, we present a number of conjectures.

abstract: We address the task of switching off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs) and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a $2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as $O(n \log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled quadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength decoupling for any $\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\ell \geq 2$, can be achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\ell-1} \log n)$.

abstract: Too much noise kills entanglement. This is the main problem in its production and transmission. We use a handy approach to indicate noise resistance of entanglement of a bi-partite system described by $d\times d$ Hilbert space. Our analysis uses a geometric approach based on the fact that if a scalar product of a vector $\vec{s}$ with a vector $\vec {e}$ is less than the square of the norm of $\vec{e}$, then $\vec{s}\neq\vec{e}$. We use such concepts for correlation tensors of separable and entangled states. As a general form correlation tensors for pairs of qudits, for $d>2$, is very difficult to obtain, because one does not have a Bloch sphere for pure one qudit states, we use a simplified approach. The criterion reads: if the largest Schmidt eigenvalue of a correlation tensor is smaller than the square of its norm, then the state is entangled. this criterion is applied in the case of various types of noise admixtures to the initial (pure) state. These include white noise, colored noise, local depolarizing noise and amplitude damping noise. A broad set of numerical and analytical results is presented. As the other simple criterion for entanglement is violation of Bell's inequalities, we also find critical noise parameters to violate specific family of Bell inequalities (CGLMP), for maximally entangled states. We give analytical forms of our results for $d$ approaching infinity.

We eventually prove how error, timescale and number of modes in the truncated chain are related.

abstract: We study the interplay among large-spin, spin orbit coupling, and superfluidity for bosons in a two dimensional optical lattice, focusing on the spin-1 spin-orbit coupled system recently realized at the Joint Quantum Institute [Campbell et. al., arXiv:1501.05984]. We find a rich quantum phase diagram, where, in addition to the conventional phases -superfluid and insulator- contained in the spin-$1$ Bose-Hubbard model, there are new symmetry broken spin-orbit driven exotic phases where bosons condense at single or multiple points in momentum space, that have no analog in the continuum. In the lattice, increasing the spin-orbit coupling strength induces a robust spin density wave superfluid with broken translation symmetry where a non-zero condensate fraction occurs both at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone. For strong interactions, spin density wave order is suppressed concomitantly with the condensate at zero momentum leading to a continuous transition into a superfluid only at the Brillouin zone edge. We show that the spin density wave superfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus establish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb, $^7$Li, and $^{41}$K.

abstract: Every solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set of quantum numbers, by which we can evaluate it numerically. However, no general rule is known how to give quantum numbers for the physical solutions of BAE. For the spin-1/2 XXX chain we rigorously derive all the quantum numbers for the complete set of the Bethe-ansatz eigenvectors in the two down-spin sector with any chain length $N$. Here we obtain them both for real and complex solutions. Consequently, we prove the completeness of the Bethe ansatz and give an exact expression for the number of real solutions which correspond to collapsed bound-state solutions (i.e., 2-string solutions) in the sector: $2[ (N-1)/2 - (N/\pi) \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{N-1})]$ in terms of Gauss' symbol. Moreover, we prove in the sector the scheme conjectured by Takahashi for solving BAE systematically. We also suggest that by applying the present method we can derive the quantum numbers for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain.

abstract: We demonstrate that for general conformal field theories (CFTs), the entanglement for small perturbations of the vacuum is organized in a novel holographic way. For spherical entangling regions in a constant time slice, perturbations in the entanglement entropy are solutions of a Klein-Gordon equation in an auxiliary de Sitter (dS) spacetime. The role of the emergent time-like direction in dS is played by the size of the entangling sphere. For CFTs with extra conserved charges, e.g., higher spin charges, we show that each charge gives rise to a separate dynamical scalar field in dS.

abstract: We suggest and demonstrate a protocol which suppresses dephasing due to the low-frequency noise by qubit motion, i.e., transfer of the logical qubit of information in a system of $n \geq 2$ physical qubits. The protocol requires only the nearest-neighbor coupling and is applicable to different qubit structures. We further analyze its effectiveness against noises with arbitrary correlations. Our analysis, together with experiments using up to three superconducting qubits, shows that for the realistic uncorrelated noises, qubit motion increases the dephasing time of the logical qubit as $\sqrt{n}$. In general, the protocol provides a diagnostic tool to measure the noise correlations.

abstract: More than 60 years ago, Dicke published a seminal paper on coherence in spontaneous radiation process by a collection of atoms. Superradiance has since attracted a lot of interest, from its first experimental observation in a fully inverted system in the 1970s to single photon superradiance in the 2000s. Subradiance, on the contrary, has remained elusive, mainly because subradiant states are weakly coupled to the environment and are very sensitive to non radiative decoherence processes. They are thus much harder to populate and to observe. Avoiding decoherence effects by using a dilute cloud of laser-cooled atoms containing a large number of atoms, we report on direct observation of subradiance. In our experiment, we use a far detuned laser to avoid multiple scattering and detect the temporal decay after a sudden switch-off of the laser beam. After the fast decay of most of the fluorescence, we observe a very slow decay, with time constants as long as 100 times the natural lifetime of the excited state of individual atoms. This subradiant time constant scales linearly with the cooperativity parameter, corresponding to the on-resonance optical thickness of the sample, and is independent of the laser detuning, as expected from a coupled-dipole model.

abstract: The formalism of matrix product states is used to perform a numerical study of 1+1 dimensional QED -- also known as the (massive) Schwinger model -- in the presence of an external static `quark' and `antiquark'. We obtain the large distance behavior of the interquark potential for different probe charges and this for a wide range of couplings, recovering the predicted behavior both in the weak and strong coupling limit of the continuum theory. Furthermore we give a detailed picture of the transition from the confining state at short interquark distances to the broken-string `hadronized' state at large distances. Finally, we also study this transition for fractional probe charges, simulating for the first time the phenomenon of partial string breaking.

abstract: High precision spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen has recently led to an anomaly in the Lamb shift, which has been parametrized in terms of a proton charge radius differing by seven standard deviations from the CODATA value. We show how this anomaly may be explained, within about a factor of three, in the framework of an effective Yukawian gravitational potential related to charged weak interactions, without additional free parameters with respect to the ones of the standard model. The residual discrepancy from the experimental result in this model should be attributable to the approximations introduced in the calculation, the uncertainty in the exact value of the Fermi scale relevant to the model and the lack of detailed knowledge on the gravitational radius of the proton. The latter cannot be inferred with electromagnetic probes due to the unknown gluonic contribution to the proton mass distribution. In this context, we argue that muonic hydrogen acts like a microscopic gravimeter suitable for testing a possible scenario for the reciprocal morphing between macroscopic gravitation and weak interactions, with the latter seen as the quantum, microscopic counterpart of the former.

abstract: We unveil the existence of a non-trivial Berry phase associated to the dynamics of a quantum particle in a one dimensional box with moving walls. It is shown that a suitable choice of boundary conditions has to be made in order to preserve unitarity. For these boundary conditions we compute explicitly the geometric phase two-form on the parameter space. The unboundedness of the Hamiltonian describing the system leads to a natural prescription of renormalization for divergent contributions arising from the boundary.

abstract: We establish bounds on the decay of time-dependent multipoint correlation functionals of one-dimensional quasi-free fermions in terms of the decay properties of their two-point function. At a technical level, this is done with the help of bounds on certain bordered determinants and pfaffians. These bounds, which we prove, go beyond the well-known Hadamard estimates. Our main application of these results is a proof of strong (exponential) dynamical localization of spin-correlation functions in disordered $XY$-spin chains.
