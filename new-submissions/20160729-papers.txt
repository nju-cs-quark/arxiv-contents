abstract: In the paper [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4237-4244 (2015)], Qin and Dai proposed a proactive quantum secret sharing scheme. We study the security of the proposed scheme and find that it is not secure. In the distribution phase of the proposed scheme, two dishonest participants may collaborate to eavesdrop the secret of the dealer without introducing any error. Incidentally, a possible improvement of the distribution phase is given.

abstract: In this paper, we introduce an optical analogy to quantum Fourier tanformation based on a pseudorandom phase ensemble. The optical analogy also brings about exponential speedup over classical Fourier tanformation. Using the analogy, we demonstrate three classcial fields to realize Fourier transform similar to three quantum particles.

abstract: We study interactions between polaritons, arising when photons strongly couple to collective excitations in an array of two-level atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a cavity. We consider two types of interactions between atoms: Dipolar forces and atomic saturability, which ranges from hard-core repulsion to Rydberg blockade. We show that, in spite of the underlying repulsion in the subsystem of atomic excitations, saturability induces a broadband bunching of photons for two-polariton scattering states. We interpret this bunching as a result of interference, and trace it back to the mismatch of the quantization volumes for atomic excitations and photons. We examine also bound bipolaritonic states: These include states created by dipolar forces, as well as a gap bipolariton, which forms solely due to saturability effects in the atomic transition. Both types of bound states exhibit strong bunching in the photonic component. We discuss the dependence of bunching on experimentally relevant parameters.

abstract: Drawing on an analogy with the second law of thermodynamics for adiabatically isolated systems, Cover argued that data-processing inequalities may be seen as second laws for "computationally isolated systems," namely, systems evolving without an external memory. Here we develop Cover's idea in two ways: on the one hand, we clarify its meaning and formulate it in a general framework able to describe both classical and quantum systems. On the other hand, we prove that also the reverse holds: the validity of data-processing inequalities is not only necessary, but also sufficient to conclude that a system is computationally isolated. This constitutes an information-theoretic analogue of Lieb's and Yngvason's entropy principle. We finally speculate about the possibility of employing Maxwell's demon to show that adiabaticity and memorylessness are in fact connected in a deeper way than what the formal analogy proposed here prima facie seems to suggest.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08356
abstract: Two measurements of $A$ and $B$ are carried out one after the other. The measurements of $A$ are controlled by the parameter $\lambda_A$ in the Kraus operator, where the measurements of $B$ are controlled by the parameter $\lambda_B$. Strong measurements imply that the parameters in the Kraus operators approach infinite large values while weak measurements are carried out when the parameters approach zero. Here we prove that by repeating on the two successive measurements of $A$ and $B$ then: (1) Average over all measurements of $A$ is invariant of the measurement strength parameters $\lambda_A$ and $\lambda_B$. It implies that all surprising results obtained in weak measurements of $A$ are washed out when the average is taken. (2) If the operators $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ commute then the mean value of $B$ as obtained by taking the average of the results for $B$ over all measurements is invariant of $\lambda_A$ and $\lambda_B$. Moreover it is exactly equal to the expectation value of $\hat B$ as expected for strong measurements of $B$. (3) If $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ do not commute \textit{and} another condition given in this paper is satisfied then the mean value of the results obtained for $B$ depends on the value of $\lambda_A$ and not on the value of $\lambda_B$. An illustrative possible experiment to show the effect of the strength of the measurements of A on the results obtained for the measurements of B is given.

abstract: We present a comprehensive theory of heat engines (HE) based on a quantum-mechanical "working fluid" (WF) with periodically-modulated energy levels. The theory is valid for any periodicity of driving Hamiltonians that commute with themselves at all times and do not induce coherence in the WF. Continuous and stroke cycles arise in opposite limits of this theory, which encompasses hitherto unfamiliar cycle forms, dubbed here hybrid cycles. The theory allows us to discover the speed, power and efficiency limits attainable by incoherently-operating multilevel HE depending on the cycle form and the dynamical regimes.

authors: Yu-Yu Zhang
comments: 8pages,4figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08459
abstract: Generalized squeezing rotating-wave approximation (GSRWA) is proposed dependent on both the optimal displacement and the squeezing, which improves the previous methods only with the displacement parameter. By adding the viable squeezing, the GSRWA produces a general displaced-squeezed oscillator state instead of the original displaced state. A solvable Hamiltonian is reformulated in the same form of the ordinary RWA ones, giving the ground-state and the first-excited state energies explicitly. For isotropic case, the mean photon number and the ground-state energy are expressed approximately in terms of the analytical squeezing and the displacement, exhibiting a substantial improvement of the GSRWA with the additional squeezing terms. We also obtain reasonable accurate ground-state energy after the level-crossing point in the anisotropic case. Due to the squeezing effect, the GSRWA works better for a wide range of coupling strength as the atom frequency increases.

abstract: In this work we explore a correspondence between quantum circuits and low-degree polynomials over the finite field F_2. Any quantum circuit made up of Hadamard, Z, controlled-Z and controlled-controlled-Z gates gives rise to a degree-3 polynomial over F_2 such that calculating quantum circuit amplitudes is equivalent to counting zeroes of the corresponding polynomial. We exploit this connection, which is especially clean and simple for this particular gate set, in two directions. First, we give proofs of classical hardness results based on quantum circuit concepts. Second, we find efficient classical simulation algorithms for certain classes of quantum circuits based on efficient algorithms for classes of polynomials.

title: On entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of a minimal length
authors: Alexey E. Rastegin
comments: 11 pages, no figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08512
abstract: We study entropic uncertainty relations for the position and momentum within the generalized uncertainty principle. This principle is motivated by the existence of a minimal observable length. Then the position and momentum operators satisfy the modified commutation relation, for which more than one algebraic representation is known. One of them is described by auxiliary momentum so that the momentum and coordinate wave functions are connected by the Fourier transform. However, the probability density functions of the physically true and auxiliary momenta are different. This fact results in changes of related entropies and, therefore, in a modification of entropic bounds. As measures of uncertainties, the Shannon entropy and generalized entropic functions are used. Using differential Shannon entropies, we give a state-dependent formulation with correction term. State-independent uncertainty relations are obtained in terms of the R\'{e}nyi entropies and, with binning, the Tsallis entropies. Also, these relations take into account a finiteness of measurement resolution.

authors: Terry Rudolph

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.08535
abstract: This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a `ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of distinguishing among different causal relations starting from a limited set of marginals. Our main tool is the notion of adhesivity, that is, the extension of probability or entropies defined only on subsets of variables, which provides additional independence constraints among them. Our results provide a criterion for recognizing which causal structures are indistinguishable when only limited marginal information is accessible. Furthermore, the existence of such extensions greatly simplify the characterization of a marginal scenario, a result that facilitates the derivation of new Bell inequalities both in the probabilistic and entropic frameworks, and the identification of marginal scenarios where classical, quantum, and postquantum probabilities coincide.

abstract: We propose the digital quantum simulation of a minimal AdS/CFT model in controllable quantum platforms. We consider the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing interacting Majorana fermions with randomly distributed all-to-all couplings, encoding nonlocal fermionic operators onto qubits to efficiently implement their dynamics via digital techniques. Moreover, we also give a method for probing non-equilibrium dynamics and the scrambling of information. Finally, our approach serves as a protocol for reproducing a simplified low-dimensional model of quantum gravity in advanced quantum platforms as trapped ions and superconducting circuits.

abstract: We describe the connection between inversion symmetry breaking and criticality in free fermionic lattice models. It is shown that for translation-invariant spinless fermions, the breaking of this symmetry in the ground state implies criticality, i.e., the existence of long-range correlations and the vanishing of the spectral gap; while for models with spin, only the asymmetry of the spin-averaged covariance matrix implies a similar conclusion. Our results are proved by introducing invariants under global translation-invariant free fermion quenches. Using this result, we identify a set of models where the generalized Hartree-Fock approximation must break down.

abstract: The surface Hamiltonian corresponding to the surface part of a gravitational action has $xp$ structure where $p$ is conjugate momentum of $x$. Moreover, it leads to $TS$ on the horizon of a black hole. Here $T$ and $S$ are temperature and entropy of the horizon. Imposing the hermiticity condition we quantize this Hamiltonian. This leads to an equidistant spectrum of its eigenvalues. Using this we show that the entropy of the horizon is quantized. This analysis holds for any order of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. For general relativity, the area spectrum is consistent with Bekenstein's observation. This provides a more robust confirmation of this earlier result as the calculation is based on the direct quantization of the Hamiltonian in the sense of usual quantum mechanics.

abstract: Stimulated by a very recent experiment observing successfully two superconducting states with even- and odd-number of electrons in a nanowire topological superconductor as expected from the existence of two end Majorana quasiparticles (MQs) [Albrecht \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{531}, 206 (2016)], we propose a way to manipulate Majorana qubit exploiting quantum tunneling effects. The prototype setup consists of two one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductors coupled by a tunneling junction which can be controlled by gate voltage. We show that, upon current injection, the time evolution of superconducting phase difference at the junction induces an oscillation in energy levels of the Majorana parity states, whereas the level-crossing is avoided by a small coupling energy of MQs in the individual 1D superconductors. This results in a Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) interference between the Majorana parity states. Adjusting the current pulse and gate voltage, one can build a LZS interferometry which provides an arbitrary manipulation of the Majorana qubit. The LZS rotation of Majorana qubit can be monitored by the microwave radiated from the junction.

abstract: Many-body states described by a Schr\"{o}dinger equation include states of overlapping waves of non-vanishing interaction energies. These peculiar states formed in many-body transitions remain in asymptotic regions, and lead a new component to the transition probability. The probability is computed rigorously following the von Neumann's fundamental principle of quantum mechanics with an S-matrix that is defined with normalized functions, instead of plane waves. That includes the intriguing correction term to the Fermi's golden rule, in which a visible energy is smaller than the initial energy, and reveals macroscopic quantum phenomena for light particles. Processes in Quantum Electrodynamics are analyzed and the sizable corrections are found in the dilute systems. The results suggest that these states play important roles in natural phenomena, and the verification in laboratory would be possible with recent advanced technology.

abstract: We propose a version of functional renormalization-group (fRG) approach, which is, due to including Litim-type cutoff and switching off (or reducing) the magnetic field during fRG flow, capable describing singular Fermi liquid (SFL) phase, formed due to presence of local moments in quantum dot structures. The proposed scheme allows to describe the first-order quantum phase transition from "singular" to the "regular" paramagnetic phase with applied gate voltage and shows sizable spin splitting of electronic states in the SFL phase in the limit of vanishing magnetic field $H\rightarrow 0$. The calculated conductance shows good agreement with the results of the numerical renormalization group.
