abstract: We show that two photons coupled to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency can interact via an effective Coulomb potential. This interaction gives rise to a continuum of two-body bound states. Within the continuum, metastable bound states are distinguished in analogy with quasi-bound states tunneling through a potential barrier. We find multiple branches of metastable bound states whose energy spectrum is governed by the Coulomb potential, thus obtaining a photonic analogue of the hydrogen atom. Under certain conditions, the wavefunction resembles that of a diatomic molecule in which the two polaritons are separated by a finite "bond length." These states propagate with a negative group velocity in the medium, allowing for a simple preparation and detection scheme, before they slowly decay to pairs of bound Rydberg atoms.

abstract: We suggest and demonstrate a scheme to reconstruct the two-mode quantum state of optical spectral modes (sidebands) using a single homodyne detector. The method is all-optical and based on the sole assumption of being in the stationary regime. The measurement scheme has been successfully tested on different signals, ranging from uncorrelated coherent states to entangled states generated by two-mode squeezing.

abstract: Any optical quantum information processing machine would be comprised of fully-characterized constituent devices for both single state manipulations and tasks involving the interaction between multiple quantum optical states. Ideally for the latter, would be an apparatus capable of deterministic optical phase shifts that operate on input quantum states with the action mediated solely by auxiliary signal fields. Here we present the complete experimental characterization of a system designed for optically controlled phase shifts acting on single-photon level probe coherent states. Our setup is based on a warm vapor of rubidium atoms under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency with its dispersion properties modified through the use of an optically triggered N-type Kerr non-linearity. We fully characterize the performance of our device by sending in a set of input probe states and measuring the corresponding output via balanced homodyne tomography and subsequently performing the technique of coherent state quantum process tomography. This method provides us with the precise knowledge of how our optical phase shift will modify any arbitrary input quantum state engineered in the mode of the reconstruction.

abstract: The so-called classical limit of quantum mechanics is generally studied in terms of the decoherence of the state operator that characterizes a system. This is not the only possible approach to decoherence. In previous works we have presented the possibility of studying the classical limit in terms of the decoherence of relevant observables of the system. On the basis of this approach, in this paper we introduce the classical limit from a logical perspective, by studying the way in which the logical structure of quantum properties corresponding to relevant observables acquires Boolean characteristics.

abstract: Control over the quantum state of interacting particles to a high degree of fidelity is an important ability to have in the quest for understanding fundamental properties of non-classical states. However, the quickly increasing density of the spectrum, together with the appearance of crossings in time-dependent processes, makes any effort to control the system hard and resource intensive. Here we show that in trapped systems regimes can exist, in which isolated energy bands appear that allow to easily generalize known single-particle techniques. We demonstrate this for the well known spatial adiabatic passage effect, which can control the centre-of-mass state of atoms with high fidelity.

abstract: A global solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians is derived by integrating the non-linear differential equation associated with the time-dependent wave operator. A fast iterative solution method is proposed in which, however, numerous integrals over time have to be evaluated. This internal work is done using a numerical integrator based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The case of a transition between two potential wells of a model molecule driven by intense laser pulses is used as an illustrative example. This application reveals some interesting features of the integration technique. Each iteration provides a global approximate solution on grid points regularly distributed over the full time propagation interval. Inside the convergence radius, the complete integration is competitive with standard algorithms, especially when high accuracy is required.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a two-axis counter-twisting Hamiltonian from an initial spin coherent state in a spin-$1/2$ ensemble. A characteristic feature of the two-axis counter-twisting Hamiltonian is the existence of four neutrally stable and two saddle unstable fixed points. The presence of the last one is responsible for a high level of squeezing. The squeezing is accompanied by the appearance of several quantum states of interest in quantum metrology with Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, and we show fidelity functions for some of them. We present exact results for the quantum Fisher information and the squeezing parameter. Although, the overall time evolution of both changes strongly with the number of particles, we find that they have regular dynamics for short times. We explain scaling with the system size by using a Gaussian approach.

abstract: Quantum metrology exploits quantum correlations to make precise measurements with limited particle numbers. By maximising the inter- and intra- mode correlations in an optical interferometer, we find a state that combines squeezing and entanglement to give a 7-fold enhancement in the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the NOON state for low photon numbers. Motivated by practicality we then look at the squeezed cat state, which has recently been made experimentally, and shows further precision gains, including a 3-fold improvement in the QFI over the optimal Gaussian state. We present a simple measurement scheme that saturates the QFI, and then simulate this scheme to confirm its effectiveness. Finally, we show that for small photon numbers the squeezed cat state continues to give an advantage even for significant losses, allowing us to conclude that the squeezed cat state can give a significant precision enhancement in optical quantum metrology in realistic conditions.

abstract: Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, and is the key resource for quantum information processing. Bipartite entangled states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several experiments, and post-selected entangled states involving pairs of photons, or single photons and single atoms, have also been produced. Here, we deterministically generate a "hybrid" entangled state of two different species of trapped-ion qubit, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make the first test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven two-qubit quantum logic gate, whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, to produce a maximally-entangled state of one Ca40 qubit and one Ca43 qubit, held in the same ion trap, with 99.8(5)% fidelity. We make a test of Bell's inequality for this novel entangled state, and find that it is violated by 15 sigma. Mixed-species quantum logic is an essential technique for the construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations, or are used as photonic interfaces to other processing units.

abstract: Based on the theory of quantum mechanics, intrinsic randomness in measurement distinguishes quantum effects from classical ones. From the perspective of states, this quantum feature can be summarized as coherence or superposition in a specific (classical) computational basis. Recently, by regarding coherence as a physical resource, Baumgratz et al.~present a comprehensive framework for coherence measures. Here, we propose a quantum coherence measure essentially using the intrinsic randomness of measurement. The proposed coherence measure provides an answer to the open question in completing the resource theory of coherence. Meanwhile, we show that the coherence distillation process can be treated as quantum extraction, which can replace the extraction process in quantum random number generators. From this viewpoint, the proposed coherence measure also clarifies the operational aspect of quantum coherence. Finally, our results indicate a strong similarity between two types of quantumness --- coherence and entanglement.

abstract: With the increase of complexity and coherence of superconducting systems made using the principles of circuit quantum electrodynamics, more accurate methods are needed for the characterization, analysis and optimization of these quantum processors. Here we introduce a new method of modelling that can be applied to superconducting structures involving multiple Josephson junctions, high-Q superconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique, an extension of our previous work on single-port structures [1], permits the derivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every feature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation of T1 times for qubits. We begin with a black box model of the linear and passive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance function Zsim(w), which can be obtained using a finite-element electormagnetics simulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of Josephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50 Ohm connectors to high-frequency lines. We fit Zsim(w) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s), a function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space techniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same impedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this finite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms to classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in numerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained by using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms [2, 3]. Due to the presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization methods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the Kirchhoff voltage and current laws.

abstract: We analyze the properties of a Raman quantum light-atom interface in long atomic ensemble and its applications as a quantum memory or two-mode squeezed state generator. We include both Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering and the effects of Doppler broadening in buffer gas assuming frequent velocity-averaging collisions. We find the Green functions describing multimode transformation from input to output fields of photons and atomic excitations. Proper mode basis is found via singular value decomposition. It reveals that triples of modes are coupled by a transformation equivalent to a combination of two beamsplitters and a two-mode squeezing operation. We analyze the possible transformations on an example of warm rubidium-87 vapor. We find that the fidelity of the mapping of a single excitation between the memory and light is strictly limited by the fractional contribution of the Stokes scattering in predominantly anti-Stokes process. The model we present bridges the gap between the Stokes only and anti-Stokes only interactions providing simple, universal description in a temporally and longitudinally multimode situation. Our results also provide an easy way to find an evolution of the states in a Schr\"dinger picture thus facilitating understanding and design.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04179
abstract: There is a tension in quantum theory between the existence of a widely accepted way to axiomatize the theory and the lack of similarly accepted intuitive principles from which the theory can be derived. This tension is present at the very definition of what measurements are admissible. The usual assumption is that all measurements which do not produce negative probabilities are valid measurements. However, besides simplicity, there is no conceptional reason for such an assumption. Here we show that this assumption leads to a very particular prediction that can be experimentally tested: in certain situations, the number of outcomes of a measurement is, by itself, a quantum phenomenon. For reaching this conclusion, we consider minor modifications of quantum theory in which all measurements are produced from quantum measurements with a limited number of outcomes and classical measurements, and show that any of these modifications is accessible to falsification by particular high-precision Bell-type experiments. Our analysis reveals that the results of previous experiments provide evidence that nature cannot be explained with the simplest of these modifications in which all measurements are essentially quantum dichotomic. This supports standard quantum theory versus a natural and almost indistinguishable alternative, but leaves as an open challenge to perform experiments which allow us to exclude other alternatives such as essentially trichotomic quantum theories and more general dichotomic theories.

abstract: The entanglement of coherently split electron-hole pairs in an electronic conductor is typically not considered accessible due to particle number conservation and fermionic super-selection rules. We demonstrate here that current cross-correlation measurements at the outputs of an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can nevertheless provide a robust witness of electron-hole entanglement. Specifically, we consider neutral excitations generated by modulating the transmission of an unbiased quantum point contact periodically in time. For an optimized modulation profile, an entangled state with one positively-charged leviton (a hole) and one negatively-charged leviton (an electron) gets delocalized over the two paths of the interferometer and is detected at the output arms. We evaluate the influence of finite electronic temperatures and dephasing corresponding to recent experiments.

abstract: We demonstrate a compact, spectrally-selective, and tunable delay line for single photons emitted by quantum dots. This is achieved by fine-tuning the wavelength of the optical transitions of such "artificial atoms" into a spectral window in which a cloud of natural atoms behaves as slow-light medium. By employing the ground-state fine-structure-split exciton confined in an InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot as a source of single photons at different frequencies and the hyperfine-structure-split $D_1$ transition of Cs-vapors as a tunable delay-medium, we achieve a differential delay of up 2.4 ns on a 7.5 cm long path for photons that are only 60 \mu eV (14.5 GHz) apart. To quantitatively explain the experimental data we develop a theoretical model that accounts for both the inhomogeneously broadening of the quantum-dot emission lines and the Doppler-broadening of the atomic lines. The concept we proposed here may be used to implement time-reordering operations aimed at erasing the "which-path" information that deteriorates entangled-photon emission from excitons with finite fine-structure-splitting.

abstract: We point out that neutrino oscillations imply an ambiguity in the definition of the vacuum and the coupling to gravity, with experimentally observable consequences due to the Unruh effect. In an accelerating frame, the detector should see a bath of mass Eigenstates neutrinos. In inertial processes, neutrinos are produced and absorbed as charge Eigenstates. The two cannot be reconciled by a spacetime coordinate transformation. This makes manifestations of the Unruh effect in neutrino physics a promising probe of both neutrinos and fundamental quantum field theory. In this respect, we suggest $p\rightarrow n +\ell^+ + {\nu_\ell}$ ($\ell^+ = e^+, \mu^+, \tau^+$) transitions in strong electromagnetic fields as a promising avenue of investigation. In this essay we discuss this process both in the inertial and comoving frame, we briefly describe the experimental realization and its challenges, and close by speculating on possible results of such an experiment in different scenarios of fundamental neutrino physics

abstract: A route toward lineshape engineering of Fano resonances in photonic structures is theoretically proposed, which uses dynamic modulation of the refractive index of a microcavity. The method is exemplified by considering coupled-resonator optical waveguide systems. An exact Floquet analysis, based on coupled-mode theory, is presented. Two distinct kinds of resonances can be dynamically created, depending on whether the static structure sustains a localized mode or not. In the former case a single Fano resonance arises, which can be tuned in both frequency and line width by varying the refractive index modulation amplitude and frequency. In the latter case two resonances, in the form of narrow asymmetric dips in the transmittance, are found, which can overlap resulting in an electromagnetically-induced transparency effect.

abstract: The bandstructures of [110] and [001] Bi2Te3 nanowires are solved with the atomistic 20 band tight binding functionality of NEMO5. In agreement with non-atomistic approaches, an equal energy spacing between the surface states and vanishing band gaps with half-integer magnetic fluxes are found. In contrast to non-atomistic models, atomistic tight binding considers [110] wires with chemically distinct surfaces. These surfaces are shown to have different surface state Fermi velocities. The different Fermi velocities effectively create in-surface confinement for the topological insulator surface states. The tight binding results of various wire dimensions and configurations can be reproduced with a simple analytical model presented here as well
