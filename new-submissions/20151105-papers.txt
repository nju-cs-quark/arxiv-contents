abstract: Cavity-optomechanics, an exploitation of mechanical-effects of light to couple optical-field with mechanical-objects, has made remarkable progress. Besides, spin-orbit (SO)-coupling, interaction between spin of a quantum-particle and its momentum, has provided foundation to analyze various phenomena like spin-Hall effect and topological-insulators. However, SO-coupling and corresponding topological-features have not been examined in optical-cavity with one vibrational-mirror. Here we report cavity-optomechanics with SO-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, inducing non-Abelian gauge-field in cavity. We ascertain the influences of SO-coupling and long-range atomic-interactions on low-temperature dynamics which can be experimentally measured by maneuvering area underneath density-noise spectrum. It is detected that not only optomechanical-coupling is modifying topological properties of atomic dressed-states but SO-coupling induced topological-effects are also enabling us to control effective-temperature of mechanical-mirror and dynamic structure factor, which is measurable by detecting neutron-scattering. Our findings are testable in a realistic setup and provide foundations to manipulate SO-coupling in the field of quantum optics and quantum computation.

abstract: We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary rules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely operational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S; no ontic assumptions are necessary. From the rules we derive the state spaces for N qubits and show that (a) they coincide with the set of density matrices over N qubit Hilbert spaces; (b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) the binary questions by means of which O interrogates the systems corresponds to projective measurements on Pauli operators with outcome probabilities given by the Born rule. Besides offering a novel conceptual perspective on qubit quantum theory, the reconstruction also unravels new structural insights. Namely, we show that, in a quadratic information measure, (d) qubits satisfy informational complementarity inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually complementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually complementary questions for 2 qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of information in pure states. The latter relations constitute 6 conserved informational charges which define the unitary group and, together with their 15 conservation conditions, the set of pure states. This underscores the benefits of this informational approach and emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to an observer's information in order to reconstruct the theory. This article completes the work started in arXiv:1412.8323.

abstract: Within the hierarchy of inseparable quantum correlations, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is distinguished from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality by its asymmetry -- there exist conditions where the steering phenomenon changes from being observable to not observable, simply by exchanging the role of the two measuring parties. Whilst this one-way steering feature has been previously demonstrated for the restricted class of Gaussian measurements, for the general case of positive-operator-valued measures even its theoretical existence has only recently been settled. Here, we prove, and then experimentally observe, the one-way steerability of an experimentally practical class of entangled states in this general setting. As well as its foundational significance, the demonstration of fundamentally asymmetric nonlocality also has practical implications for the distribution of the trust in quantum communication networks.

abstract: A maximal steady-state fermionic entanglement of a nanoelectronic system is generated in finite temperature non-Markovian environments. The fermionic entanglement dynamics is presented by connecting the exact solution of the system with an appropriate definition of fermionic entanglement. We prove that the two understandings of the dissipationless non-Markovian dynamics, namely the bound state and the modified Laplace transformation are completely equivalent. For comparison, the steady-state entanglement is also studied in the wide-band limit and Born-Markovian approximation. When the environments have a finite band structure, we find that the system presents various kinds of relaxation processes. The final states can be: thermal or thermal-like states, quantum memory states and oscillating quantum memory states. Our study provide an analytical way to explore the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of identical fermions in a realistic setting, i.e., finite temperature reservoirs with a cutoff spectrum.

abstract: We investigate dynamics of an optomechanical system under the Non-Markovian environment. In the weak optomechanical single-photon coupling regime, we provide an analytical approach fully taking into account the non-Markovian memory effects. When the cavity-bath coupling strength crosses a certain threshold, an oscillating memory state for the classical cavity field (called bound state) is formed. Due to the existence of the non-decay optical bound state, a nonequilibrium optomechanical thermal entanglement is preserved even without external driving laser. Our results provide a potential usage to generate and protect entanglement via Non-Markovian environment engineering.

abstract: Coherent evolution governs the behaviour of all quantum systems, but in nature it is often subjected to influence of a classical environment. For analysing quantum transport phenomena quantum walks emerge as suitable model systems. In particular, quantum walks on percolation structures constitute an attractive platform for studying open system dynamics of random media. Here, we present an implementation of quantum walks differing from the previous experiments by achieving dynamical control of the underlying graph structure. We demonstrate the evolution of an optical time-multiplexed quantum walk over six double steps, revealing the intricate interplay between the internal and external degrees of freedom. The observation of clear non-Markovian signatures in the coin space testifies the high coherence of the implementation and the extraordinary degree of control of all system parameters. Our work is the proof-of-principle experiment of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph, paving the way towards complex simulation of quantum transport in random media.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the coupling of an ultracold three-level atomic gas and a nano-mechanical mirror via classical electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pressure on the mirror is modulated by absorption of a probe light field, caused by the atoms which are electromagnetically rendered nearly transparent, allowing the gas to affect the mirror. In turn, the mirror can affect the gas as its vibrations generate opto-mechanical sidebands in the control field. We show that the sidebands cause modulations of the probe intensity at the mirror frequency, which can be enhanced near atomic resonances. Through the radiation pressure from the probe beam onto the mirror, this results in resonant driving of the mirror. Controllable by the two photon detuning, the phase relation of the driving to the mirror motion decides upon amplification or damping of mirror vibrations. This permits direct phase locking of laser amplitude modulations to the motion of a nano-mechanical element opening a perspective for cavity-free cooling through coupling to an atomic gas.

abstract: A central tenet of theoretical cryptography is the study of the minimal assumptions required to implement a given cryptographic primitive. One such primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here, we show how to use quantum information, together with the assumption of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure OTMs. This is in sharp contrast with the classical case, where stateless hardware tokens alone cannot yield OTMs. In addition, our scheme is technologically simple. We prove security in the quantum universal composability framework, employing semi-definite programming results of Molina, Vidick and Watrous [TQC 2013] and combinatorial techniques of Pastawski et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2012].

abstract: We study the behavior of the non-adiabatic population transfer between resonances at an exceptional point in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. It is known that, when the exceptional point is encircled, the system always ends up in the same state, independent of the initial occupation within the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the states coalescing at the exceptional point. We verify this behavior for a realistic quantum system, viz. the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields. It is also shown that the non-adiabatic hypothesis can be violated when resonances in the vicinity are taken into account. In addition, we study the non-adiabatic population transfer in the case of a third-order exceptional point, in which three resonances are involved.

abstract: Processing and distributing quantum information using photons through fibre-optic or free-space links is essential for building future quantum networks. The scalability needed for such networks can be achieved by employing photonic quantum states that are multiplexed into time and/or frequency, and light-matter interfaces that are able to store and process such states with large time-bandwidth product and multimode capacities. Despite important progress in developing such devices, the demonstration of these capabilities using non-classical light remains challenging. Employing the atomic frequency comb quantum memory protocol in a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped optical fibre, we report the quantum storage of heralded single photons at a telecom-wavelength (1.53 {\mu}m) with a time-bandwidth product approaching 800. Furthermore we demonstrate frequency-multimode storage as well as memory-based spectral-temporal photon manipulation. Notably, our demonstrations rely on fully integrated quantum technologies operating at telecommunication wavelengths, i.e. a fibre-pigtailed nonlinear waveguide for the generation of heralded single photons, an erbium-doped fibre for photon storage and manipulation, and fibre interfaced superconducting nanowire devices for efficient single photon detection. With improved storage efficiency, our light-matter interface may become a useful tool in future quantum networks.

abstract: Transfer matrix is an indispensable tool in the study of scattering phenomena in (effectively) one-dimensional systems. We introduce a genuine multidimensional notion of transfer matrix and use it to develop a powerful alternative to the standard S-matrix formulation of scattering theory. Because this transfer matrix shares the composition property of its one-dimensional analog, our formulation allows for the determination of the scattering properties of any scattering potential $v$ from that of any collection of its truncations $v_j$ along the scattering axis as long as $v=\sum_jv_j$. This is the main advantage of our approach particularly with regard to the numerical solution of multidimensional scattering problems. We demonstrate its application in solving the scattering problem for delta-function potentials in two and three-dimensions and provide an analytic treatment of the scattering of electromagnetic waves from an infinite slab of optically active material with a surface line defect. In particular, we determine the laser threshold condition for the latter system and show that the presence of the defect makes the slab begin lasing for arbitrarily small gain coefficients.

abstract: A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.

abstract: We study the dynamical entanglement of two identical atoms interacting with a quantum field. As a simplified model for this physical system we consider two harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to a massless scalar field in the dressed coordinates and states approach and enclose the whole system inside a spherical cavity of radius R. Through a quantity called concurrence, the entanglement evolution for the two-atom system will be discussed, for a range of initial states composed of a superposition of atomic states. Our results reveals how the concurrence of the two atoms behaves through the time evolution, for arbitrary cavity size and for arbitrary coupling constant, weak, intermediate or strong. All our computations are exact and only the final step is numerical. These numerical solutions give us fascinating results for the concurrence, such as quasi-random fluctuations, with a resemblance of periodicity. Another interesting result we found is when the system is initially maximally entangled (disentangled), after the time t = 2R, the system becomes again strongly entangled (disentangled) particularly during the first oscillations, later this phenomenon could be wrecked depending on the initial condition. We also show the concurrence after a too long time elapsed with a good precision.

abstract: We study the problem of quantum-state tomography under the realistic assumption that the state of the system is close to pure. In the context of pure-state tomography we typically wish to formulate measurements that distinguish a pure state from any other pure state. However, since the set of pure states is nonconvex, in general such measurements cannot be used to robustly estimate of the state. Nevertheless, we prove that the physical constraint that the density matrix is positive semidefinite allows us to define measurements that, in fact, yield a robust estimation of the state. Furthermore, the estimation can be obtained by solving essentially any convex program. We argue that one can implement such tomography relatively simply by measuring only a few random orthonormal bases. Our conjecture is supported by strong numerical evidence. These results are generalized for estimation of states close to bounded-rank.

abstract: Light beams can carry a discrete, in principle unbounded amount of angular momentum. Examples of such beams, the Laguerre-Gauss modes, are frequently expressed as solutions of the paraxial wave equation. There, they are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator. The paraxial solutions predict that beams with large OAM could be used to resolve arbitrarily small distances - a dubious situation. Here we show how to solve that situation by calculating the properties of beams free from the paraxial approximation. We find the surprising result that indeed one can resolve smaller distances with larger OAM, although with decreased visibility. If the visibility is kept constant (for instance at the Rayleigh criterion, the limit where two points are reasonably distinguishable), larger OAM does not provide an advantage. The drop in visibility is due to a field in the direction of propagation, which is neglected within the paraxial limit.

abstract: Burning something, (e.g. the proverbial lump of coal, or an encyclopaedia for that matter), in a blackbody furnace leads to an approximately Planck emission spectrum with an average entropy/information transfer of approximately $3.9 \pm 2.5$ bits per emitted photon. This quantitative and qualitative result depends only on the underlying unitarity of the quantum physics of burning, combined with the statistical mechanics of blackbody radiation. The fact that the utterly standard and unitarity preserving process of burning something (in fact, burning anything) nevertheless *has* an associated entropy/information budget, and the quantitative *size* of that entropy/information budget, is a severely under-appreciated feature of standard quantum statistical physics.

abstract: We develop a new lower bound method for analysing the complexity of the Equality function (EQ) in the Simultaneous Message Passing (SMP) model of communication complexity. The new technique gives tight lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ for both EQ and its negation NE in the non-deterministic version of quantum-classical SMP, where Merlin is also quantum $-$ this is the strongest known version of SMP where the complexity of both EQ and NE remain high (previously known techniques seem to be insufficient for this). Besides, our analysis provides to a unified view of the communication complexity of EQ and NE, allowing to obtain tight characterisation in all previously studied and a few newly introduced versions of SMP, including all possible combination of either quantum or randomised Alice, Bob and Merlin in the non-deterministic case. Some of our results highlight that NE is easier than EQ in the presence of classical proofs, whereas the problems have (roughly) the same complexity when a quantum proof is present.

abstract: We review some features of BEC models of black holes obtained by means of the HWF formalism. We consider the KG equation for a toy graviton field coupled to a static matter current in spherical symmetry. The classical field reproduces the Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding quantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with continuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for bound states to form, so that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the system of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the Schwarzschild radius. The HWF is then used to show that the radius of such a system corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the horizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with the increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), in agreement with semiclassical calculations and different from a single very massive particle. The spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$ (the bosons forming the black hole), and a continuous spectrum with energy $\omega > m$ (representing the Hawking radiation and modelled with a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature). The $N$-particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian distribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition function is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a logarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of modes with $\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass.

abstract: We present a proposal for controlling the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules by fixing the phase difference between two oscillating magnetic fields. The scheme is based on the use of a magnetic Feshbach resonance with a field modulation that incorporates terms oscillating with frequencies corresponding to the main resonance and one of the subharmonics. The interference between the two association processes activated by the oscillating terms is controlled via the phase difference. As a result, significant increase or decrease of the effective interaction strength can be achieved. The realization of the proposal is feasible under standard technical conditions. In particular, the method is found to be robust against the effect of the sources of decoherence present in the practical setup. The applicability of the approach to deal with quadratic terms in the field modulation is discussed.

We present a new model of light-induced loss spectra, employing continuum-dressed basis states, that agrees in shape and magnitude with measurements for both broad and narrow resonances.

abstract: We provide a self-contained review of master equation approaches to modelling phonon effects in optically driven self-assembled quantum dots. Coupling of the (quasi) two-level excitonic system to phonons leads to dissipation and dephasing, the rates of which depend on the excitation conditions, intrinsic properties of the QD sample, and its temperature. We describe several techniques, which include weak-coupling master equations that are perturbative in the exciton-phonon coupling, as well as those based on the polaron transformation that can remain valid for strong phonon interactions. We additionally consider the role of phonons in altering the optical emission characteristics of quantum dot devices, outlining how we must modify standard quantum optics treatments to account for the presence of the solid-state environment.

abstract: We examine the performance of our recently developed LFAs-PBE exchange-correlation (XC) potential [C.-R. Pan, P.-T. Fang, and J.-D. Chai, Phys. Rev. A, 2013, 87, 052510] for the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra and related properties of H2+ molecules aligned parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of an intense linearly polarized laser pulse, employing the real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT). The results are compared with the exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation as well as those obtained with other XC potentials in RT-TDDFT. Owing to its correct $(-1/r)$ asymptote, the LFAs-PBE potential significantly outperforms conventional XC potentials for the HHG spectra and the properties that are sensitive to the XC potential asymptote. Accordingly, the LFAs-PBE potential, which has a computational cost similar to that of the popular Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential, can be very promising for the study of the ground-state, excited-state, and time-dependent properties of large electronic systems, extending the applicability of density functional methods for a diverse range of applications.

abstract: The structure of Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex has long been recognized as containing seven bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. Recently, an additional BChl molecule was discovered in the crystal structure of the FMO complex, which may serve as a link between baseplate and the remaining seven molecules. Here, we investigate excitation energy transfer (EET) process by simulating single-molecule pump-dump experiment in the eight-molecules complex. We adopt the coherent modified Redfield theory and non-Markovian quantum jump method to simulate EET dynamics. This scheme provides a practical approach of detecting the realistic EET pathway in BChl complexes with currently available experimental technology. And it may assist optimizing design of artificial light-harvesting devices.
