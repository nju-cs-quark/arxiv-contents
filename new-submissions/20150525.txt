abstract: Real life quantum computers are inevitably affected by intrinsic noise resulting in dissipative non-unitary dynamics realized by these devices. We consider an open system quantum annealing algorithm optimized for a realistic analog quantum device which takes advantage of noise-induced thermalization and relies on incoherent quantum tunneling at finite temperature. We analyze the performance of this algorithm considering a p-spin model which allows for a mean field quasicalssical solution and at the same time demonstrates the 1st order phase transition and exponential degeneracy of states. We demonstrate that finite temperature effects introduced by the noise are particularly important for the dynamics in presence of the exponential degeneracy of metastable states. We determine the optimal regime of the open system quantum annealing algorithm for this model and find that it can outperform simulated annealing in a range of parameters.

abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that a polarized nuclear spin modifies the dynamic behavior of a neighboring electronic spin. Specifically, an out-of-phase component appears in the electronic spin-echo signal. This component is proportional to the nuclear spin degree of polarization and strongly depends on the nuclear polarization direction. When the electronic spin is surrounded by a polarized nuclear spin bath, the spin-echo quadrature manifests a characteristic frequency related only to the nuclear spins abundance and their collective polarization. We use this analysis to propose a novel measurement method for the local nuclear spin bath of a single electronic spin. We quantify the realistic experimental regimes at which the scheme is efficient. Our proposal has potential applications for quantum sensing schemes, and opens a route for a systematic study of polarized mesoscopical-systems.

abstract: We address how a quantum phase estimation using a $|\phi 0\rangle+|0\phi\rangle$-type entangled state can be controllable by Mandel Q-factor of a single-mode state $|\phi\rangle$. From a simple form of the quantum Fisher information, we show that quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound can be enhanced with super-Poissonianity of the single-mode component. For an optical phase estimation, these bounds can also be achieved in a certain range of unknown phases by performing a parity measurement at the output. On the other hand, over an entire range $[0,2\pi]$ of unknown phase shifts, we show that the phase-shift range for beating shot-noise limit can be enlarged with sub-Poissonianity of the single-mode component.

abstract: We postulate a master equation, written in the language of creation and annihilation operators, as a candidate for unambiguous quantum mechanical description of unstable particles. We have found Kraus representation for the evolution driven by this master equation and study its properties. Both Schroedinger and Heisenberg picture of the system evolution are presented. We show that the resulting time evolution leads to exponential decay law. Moreover, we analyse mixing of particle flavours and we show that it can lead to flavour oscillation phenomenon.

abstract: The most basic local conversion is local operations and classical communications (LOCC), which is also the most natural restriction in quantum information processing. We investigate the conversions between the ground states in quantum critical systems via LOCC and propose an novel method to reveal the different convertibility via majorization relation when a quantum phase transition occurs. The ground-state local convertibility in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model is studied. It is shown that the LOCC convertibility changes nearly at the phase transition point. The relation between the order of quantum phase transitions and the LOCC convertibility is discussed. Our results are compared with the corresponding results using the Renyi entropy and the LOCC convertibility with assisted entanglement.

abstract: We investigate finite-size scaling of genuine multisite entanglement in the ground state of quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. We obtain the ground states of odd- and even-legged Heisenberg ladder Hamiltonians and compute genuine multisite entanglement, the generalized geometric measure (GGM), which shows that for even rungs, GGM increases for odd-legged ladder while it decreases for even ones. Interestingly, the ground state obtained by short-range dimer coverings, under the resonating valence bond (RVB) ansatz, encapsulates the qualitative features of GGM for both the ladders. We find that while the GGMs for higher legged odd- and even-ladders converge to a single value in the asymptotic limit of a large number of rungs, the finite-size scaling exponents of the same tend to diverge. The scaling exponent of GGM obtained by employing density matrix recursion method is therefore a reliable quantity in distinguishing the odd-even dichotomy in Heisenberg ladders, even when the corresponding multisite entanglements merge.

abstract: In this work we generalize the Bochner criterion addressing the characteristic function, i.e., the Fourier transform, of the Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space function. For this purpose we extend the Bochner theorem by including derivatives of the characteristic function. The resulting necessary and sufficient nonclassicality criteria unify previously known moment-based criteria with those based on the characteristic function. For applications of the generalized nonclassicality probes, we provide direct sampling formulas for balanced homodyne detection. A squeezed vacuum state is experimentally realized and characterized with our method. This complete framework -- theoretical unification, sampling approach, and experimental implementation -- presents an efficient toolbox to characterize quantum states of light for applications in quantum technology.

abstract: Optical beams with topological singularities have a Schmidt decomposition. Hence, they display features typically associated with bipartite quantum systems; in particular, these classical beams can exhibit entanglement. This classical entanglement can be quantified by a Bell inequality formulated in terms of Wigner functions. We experimentally demonstrate the violation of this inequality for Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams and confirm that the violation increases with increasing orbital angular momentum. Our measurements yield negativity of the Wigner function at the origin for $\LG_{10}$ beams, whereas for $\LG_{20}$ we always get a positive value.

abstract: Photon-atom coupling, in particular for proposed quantum repeater schemes, requires pure and versatile sources of quantum light. Here we demonstrate coupling to alkali dipole transitions in the near-infrared with a tunable source of photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a whispering-gallery mode resonator (WGMR). We have developed novel wavelength tuning mechanisms, which allow for a coarse step-wise central wavelength tuning from 790 nm to 1630 nm as well as continuous tuning with MHz resolution. We demonstrate the compatibility of our source with atomic transitions, such as the D1 line of rubidium at 795 nm (idler at 1608 nm) and cesium at 895\,nm (idler at 1312 nm). At the cesium D1 transition, we exemplarily show a continuous scanning of the signal wavelength over the Doppler-broadened absorption line, and finally a heralded single photon spectroscopy of the atomic decay. Providing this flexibility in connecting various atomic transitions with telecom wavelengths, we demonstrate a compact tool for interfacing quantum memories and realizing essential building blocks for quantum repeaters.

abstract: We propose a method to read-out the spin-state of an electron in a quantum dot in a Voigt geometry magnetic field using cycling transitions induced by the AC Stark effect. We show that cycling transitions can be made possible by a red-detuned, circularly-polarized laser, which modifies the spin eigenstates and polarization selection rules via the AC Stark effect. A Floquet-Liouville supermatrix approach is used to calculate the time-evolution of the density matrix under the experimental conditions of a spin read-out operation. With an overall detection efficiency of 2.5%, the read-out is a single-shot measurement with a fidelity of 76.2%.

abstract: In this article we have developed a formalism to obtain the Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation for a particle in a frame undergoing an uniform acceleration in an otherwise flat Minkowski space-time geometry. We have presented an exact solution of the equation and obtained the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues. It has been observed that the Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation can be reduced to an one dimensional hydrogen atom problem. Whereas, the quantized energy levels are exactly identical with that of an one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Hence considering transitions, we have predicted the existence of a new kind of quanta, which will either be emitted or absorbed if the particles get excited or de-excited respectively.

abstract: The black hole firewall conjecture is based on Page curve hypothesis, which claims that entanglement between black hole and Hawking radiation is almost maximum. The hypothesis is inspired by Lubkin-Lloyd-Pagels-Page theorem for degenerate systems with zero Hamiltonian. Adopting canonical typicality for nondegenerate systems with nonvanishing Hamiltonians, the entanglement becomes nonmaximal, and energetic singularities (firewalls) do not emerge for general systems. For static thermal pure states of black hole and Hawking radiation, it is proven that entanglement entropy equals thermal entropy of the smaller system.

abstract: We study energy transport in a chain of quantum harmonic and anharmonic oscillators where the anharmonicity is induced by interaction between local vibrational states of the chain. Using adiabatic elimination and numerical simulations with matrix product states, we show how strong interactions significantly slow down the relaxation dynamics (with the emergence of a new time scale) and can alter the properties of the steady state. We also show that steady state properties are completely different depending on the order in which the limits of infinite time and infinite interaction are taken.

abstract: The Shale-Stinespring Theorem (1965) together with Ruijsenaar's criterion (1977) provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the implementability of the evolution of external field quantum electrodynamics between constant-time hyperplanes on standard Fock space. The assertion states that an implementation is possible if and only if the spacial components of the external electromagnetic four-vector potential $A_\mu$ are zero. We generalize this result to smooth, space-like Cauchy surfaces and, for general $A_\mu$, show how the second-quantized Dirac evolution can always be implemented as a map between varying Fock spaces. Furthermore, we give equivalence classes of polarizations, including an explicit representative, that give rise to those admissible Fock spaces. We prove that the polarization classes only depend on the tangential components of $A_\mu$ w.r.t. the particular Cauchy surface, and show that they behave naturally under Lorentz and gauge transformations.

abstract: Manipulating energy levels while controlling the electron localization is an essential step for many applications of confined systems. In this paper we demonstrate how to achieve electron localization and induce energy level oscillation in one-dimensional quantum systems by externally controlling the deformation of the system. From a practical point of view, the one-dimensional potentials can be realized using layered structures. In the analysis, we considered three different examples. The first one is a graded quantum well between confining infinite walls where the deformation is modeled by varying slightly the graded well. The second systems is a symmetric multiple quantum well between infinite walls under the effect of biasing voltage. The third system is a layered 2D hybrid perovskites where pressure is used to induce deformation. The calculations are conducted both numerically and analytically using the perturbation theory. It is shown that the obtained oscillations are associated with level avoided crossings and that the deformation results in changing the spatial localization of the electrons.

abstract: Ultracold gases promise access to many-body quantum phenomena at convenient length and time scales. However, it is unclear whether the entropy of these gases is low enough to realize many phenomena relevant to condensed matter physics, such as quantum magnetism. Here we report reliable single-shot temperature measurements of a degenerate $^{87}$Rb gas by imaging the momentum distribution of thermalized magnons, which are spin excitations of the atomic gas. We record average temperatures as low as $0.022(1)_\text{stat}(2)_\text{sys}$ times the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature, indicating an entropy per particle, $S/N\approx0.001\, k_B$ at equilibrium, that is well below the critical entropy for antiferromagnetic ordering of a Bose-Hubbard system. The magnons themselves can reduce the temperature of the system by absorbing energy during thermalization and by enhancing evaporative cooling, allowing low-entropy gases to be produced within deep traps.
