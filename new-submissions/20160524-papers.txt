abstract: The relationship between thermal light and coherent pulses is of fundamental interest, and is also central to relating coherent optical experiments on photophysical processes to the natural occurrence of those processes in sunlight. We now know that thermal light cannot be represented as a statistical mixture of single pulses. In this paper we ask whether or not thermal light can be represented as a statistical mixture of sets of pulses. We consider thermal light in a one-dimensional waveguide, and find a convex decomposition into products of orthonormal coherent states of localized, nonmonochromatic modes.

abstract: Tightly confined modes of light, as in optical nanofibers or photonic crystal waveguides, can lead to large optical coupling in atomic systems, which mediates long-range interactions between atoms. These one-dimensional systems can naturally possess couplings that are asymmetric between modes propagating in different directions. Strong long-range interaction among atoms via these modes can drive them to a self-organized periodic distribution. In this paper, we examine the self-organizing behavior of atoms in one dimension coupled to a chiral reservoir. We determine the solution to the equations of motion in different parameter regimes, relative to both the detuning of the pump laser that initializes the atomic dipole-dipole interactions and the degree of reservoir chirality. In addition, we calculate possible experimental signatures such as reflectivity from self-organized atoms and motional sidebands.

abstract: We investigate two special classes of two-mode Gaussian states of light that are important from both the experimental and theoretical points of view: the mode-mixed thermal states and the squeezed thermal ones. Aiming to a parallel study, we write the Uhlmann fidelity between pairs of states belonging to each class in terms of their defining parameters. The quantum Fisher information matrices on the corresponding four-dimensional manifolds are diagonal and allow insightful parameter estimation. The scalar curvatures of the Bures metric on both Riemannian manifolds of special two-mode Gaussian states are evaluated and discussed. They are functions of two variables, namely, the mean numbers of photons in the incident thermal modes. Our comparative analysis opens the door to further investigation of the interplay between geometry and statistics for Gaussian states produced in simple optical devices.

abstract: We find that two of the most important theorems of Quantum Mechanics, the Ehrenfest theorem and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, lack in their standard form important information: there are cases where non-Hermitian boundary contributions emerge. These contributions actually appear naturally, in order for the above theorems to be valid and applicable, and this occurs for physical quantities that are not represented by well-defined self-adjoint operators (such as the position operator in a periodic potential, or in general Aharonov-Bohm configurations, either in real or in any parameter space, in the sense of Berry adiabatic and cyclic procedures). In this short note, we report modifications of these two theorems when such non-Hermiticities appear, and we demonstrate how these modifications restore earlier but also recent Quantum Mechanical paradoxes (these are violations of the so-called Hypervirial theorem in Quantum Chemistry, and also a textbook error in the formulation of band theory in Solid State Physics that seems to have gone unnoticed). This restoration of paradoxes (which is actually the reestablishment of applicability of the Ehrenfest theorem even in multiply-connected spaces) always proceeds through the appearance of certain generalized currents, in a theoretical picture with interesting structure (where a generalized violated continuity equation shows up naturally).

abstract: Advances in quantum photonics have shown that chip-scale quantum devices are translating from the realm of basic research to applied technologies. Recent developments in integrated photonic circuits and single photon detectors indicate that the bottleneck for fidelity in quantum photonic processes will ultimately lie with the photon sources. We present and demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic chip capable of emitting telecommunication band photon pairs that exhibit the highest raw degree of time-energy entanglement from a micro/nanoscale source, to date. Biphotons are generated through cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a high-Q silicon microdisk resonator, wherein the nature of the triply-resonant generation process leads to a dramatic Purcell enhancement, resulting in highly efficient pair creation rates as well as extreme suppression of the photon noise background. The combination of the excellent photon source and a new phase locking technique, allow for the observation of a nearly perfect coincidence visibility of (96.6 $\pm$ 1.1)$\%$, without any background subtraction, at a large pair generation rate of (4.40 $\pm$ 0.07) $\times$ 10$^5$ pairs/s.

abstract: We realise a simple and robust optomechanical system with a multitude of long-lived ($Q>10^7$) mechanical modes in a phononic-bandgap shielded membrane resonator. An optical mode of a compact Fabry-Perot resonator detects these modes' motion with a measurement rate ($96~\mathrm{kHz}$) that exceeds the mechanical decoherence rates already at moderate cryogenic temperatures ($10\,\mathrm{K}$). Reaching this quantum regime entails, i.~a., quantum measurement backaction exceeding thermal forces, and thus detectable optomechanical quantum correlations. In particular, we observe ponderomotive squeezing of the output light mediated by a multitude of mechanical resonator modes, with quantum noise suppression up to -2.4 dB (-3.6 dB if corrected for detection losses) and bandwidths $\lesssim 90\,\mathrm{ kHz}$. The multi-mode nature of the employed membrane and Fabry-Perot resonators lends itself to hybrid entanglement schemes involving multiple electromagnetic, mechanical, and spin degrees of freedom.

abstract: Claude Shannon proved in 1949 that information-theoretic-secure encryption is possible if the encryption key is used only once, is random, and is at least as long as the message itself. Notwithstanding, when information is encoded in a quantum system, the phenomenon of quantum data locking allows one to encrypt a message with an exponentially shorter key and still provide information-theoretic security. We present the first feasible experimental demonstration of quantum data locking for direct communication and propose a scheme for a quantum enigma machine that encrypts 6 bits per photon (containing messages, new encryption keys, and forward error correction bits) with less than 6 bits per photon of encryption key while remaining information-theoretically secure.

abstract: We demonstrate the phenomenon of blockade in two-photon excitations to the Rydberg state in thermal vapor. A technique based on optical heterodyne is used to measure the dispersion of a probe beam far off resonant to the D2 line of rubidium in the presence of a strong laser beam that couples to the Rydberg state via two-photon resonance. Density dependent suppression of the dispersion peak is observed while coupling to the Rydberg state with principal quantum number, n = 60. The experimental observation is explained using the phenomenon of Rydberg blockade. The blockade radius is measured to be about 2.2 {\mu}m which is consistent with the scaling due to the Doppler width of 2-photon resonance in thermal vapor. Our result promises the realization of single photon source and strong single photon non-linearity based on Rydberg blockade in thermal vapor.

This interface implements quantum spin transducers and further enables electrical manipulation of local electron spin qubits, which lays the foundation for all-electrical control of state transfer protocols between two distant quantum nodes in a quantum network. We numerically evaluate the state transfer processes and proceed to estimate the effect of each coupling strength on the operation fidelities.

abstract: Effect algebras are one of the generalizations of Boolean algebras proposed in the quest for a quantum logic. Frobenius algebras are a tool of categorical quantum mechanics, used to present various families of observables in abstract, often nonstandard frameworks. Both effect algebras and Frobenius algebras capture their respective fragments of quantum mechanics by elegant and succinct axioms, and both come with their conceptual mysteries. A particularly elegant and mysterious constraint, imposed on Frobenius algebras to characterize a class of tripartite entangled states, is the antispecial law. A particularly contentious issue on the quantum logic side is the modularity law, proposed by von Neumann to mitigate the failure of distributivity of quantum logical connectives. We show that, if quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics are formalized in the same framework, then the antispecial law of categorical quantum mechanics corresponds to the natural requirement of effect algebras that the units are each other's unique complements, and that the modularity law corresponds to the Frobenius condition. These correspondences lead to the equivalence announced in the title. Aligning the two formalisms, at the very least, sheds new light on the concepts that are more clearly displayed on one side than on the other (such as e.g. the orthogonality). Beyond that, it may also open up new approaches to deep and important problems of quantum mechanics (such as the classification of complementary observables).

The value of this quantity is checked with quantum field theoretical simulations for several field configurations and found that it can describe the creation process with rich physical picture, showing all the creation channels and giving the yields of each channel specifically. Evenly as a very convenient and powerful detection quantity it can be applicable to some complicated pair creation processes such as that triggered by cooperation of two different photons as well as the dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism.

abstract: We consider mechanism of generation of hybrid states and implementation of two-qubit unitary operations for quantum computation. The mechanism is based on displaced properties of optical qubits. Coherent states with large modulo but opposite in sign amplitudes deterministically displaces microscopic qubit. Registration of a certain number of photons in the auxiliary mode (probabilistic operation) creates output hybrid entangled state. Symmetry properties of the decomposition amplitudes of the microscopic states over the displaced number states with respect to change of the sign of the displacement amplitude are the basis for generation of hybrid states and implementation of two-qubit controlled-sign gate (direct and reverse actions). It is shown that this mechanism works for a variety of basic states. Near-deterministic protocol of quantum teleportation between coherent and dual-rail microscopic qubits by means of hybrid channel is analyzed.

abstract: Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy uses classical light to detect matter properties through the variation of its response with frequencies or time delays. Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing parameters of the quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the variation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. We present an intuitive diagrammatic approach for calculating ultrafast spectroscopy signals induced by quantum light, focusing on applications involving entangled photons with nonclassical bandwidth properties - known as "time-energy entanglement". Nonlinear optical signals induced by quantized light fields are expressed using time ordered multipoint correlation functions of superoperators. These are different from Glauber's g- functions for photon counting which use normally ordered products of ordinary operators. Entangled photon pairs are not subjected to the classical Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and spectral resolution. After a brief survey of properties of entangled photon pairs relevant to their spectroscopic applications, different optical signals, and photon counting setups are discussed and illustrated for simple multi-level model systems.

abstract: The engineering of quantum devices has reached the stage where we now have small scale quantum processors containing multiple interacting qubits within them. Simple quantum circuits have been demonstrated and scaling up to larger numbers is underway. However as the number of qubits in these processors increases, it becomes challenging to implement switchable or tunable coherent coupling among them. The typical approach has been to detune each qubit from others or the quantum bus it connected to, but as the number of qubits increases this becomes problematic to achieve in practice due to frequency crowding issues. Here, we demonstrate that by applying a fast longitudinal control field to the target qubit, we can turn off its couplings to other qubits or buses (in principle on/off ratio higher than 100 dB). This has important implementations in superconducting circuits as it means we can keep the qubits at their optimal points, where the coherence properties are greatest, during coupling/decoupling processing. Our approach suggests a new way to control coupling among qubits and data buses that can be naturally scaled up to large quantum processors without the need for auxiliary circuits and yet be free of the frequency crowding problems.

abstract: The experimental realization of many-body entangled states is one of the main goals of quantum technology as these states are a key resource for quantum computation and quantum sensing. However, increasing the number of photons in an entangled state has been proved to be a painstakingly hard task. This is a result of the non-deterministic emission of current photon sources and the distinguishability between photons from different sources. Moreover, the generation rate and the complexity of the optical setups hinder scalability. Here we present a new scheme that is compact, requires a very modest amount of components, and avoids the distinguishability issues by using only one single-photon source. States of any number of photons are generated with the same configuration, with no need for increasing the optical setup. The basic operation of this scheme is experimentally demonstrated and its sensitivity to imperfections is considered.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of various tensor network parameterizations within the Complete Graph Tensor Network States (CGTNS) approach. We extend our 2-site CGTNS scheme by introducing 3-site correlators. For this we devise three different strategies. The first relies solely on 3-site correlators and the second on 3-site correlators added on top of the 2-site correlator ansatz. To avoid an inflation of the variational space introduced by higher-order correlators, we limit the number of higher-order correlators to the most significant ones in the third strategy. Approaches for the selection of these most significant correlators are discussed. The sextet and doublet spin states of the spin-crossover complex manganocene serve as a numerical test case. In general, the CGTNS scheme achieves a remarkable accuracy for a significantly reduced size of the variational space. The advantages, drawbacks, and limitations of all CGTNS parameterizations investigated are rigorously discussed.

abstract: For a given (and, say, one-dimensional) phenomenological potential $V(x)$ a fairly reliable upper estimate of its low-lying bound-state energies is often provided by the majorization of $V(x)$ by a suitable harmonic-oscillator well $V^{(+)}_{(a,b)}(x)=a+bx^2$. Alternatively, people often construct, numerically, the two asymptotically correct branches of wave functions and match their logarithmic derivatives near the minimum of $V(x)$. Using a toy model $V(x)= -g^2\exp (-|x|)$ we discuss the situation in which neither of these approaches gives satisfactory results. An optimal strategy of the determination of the spectra is found provided by the shooting method initiated in the origin.

abstract: We suggest a hybrid plasmonic device consisting of a bimodal metallic nanoantenna coupled to an incoherently pumped quantum emitter. This hybrid device emits light into the two modes entangled in the number of photons. The process is a prime example where losses are turned from a nuisance into something beneficial, since, even though counterintuitively, the entanglement is enabled by strong incoherent processes, i.e. dominant scattering and absorption rates of the nanoantenna. Both, the high emission rate and the degree of entanglement of the emitted light are insensitive with respect to imperfections in the nanoantenna geometry, rendering the scheme feasible for an implementation.

abstract: We consider quantum state tomography with measurement procedures of the following type: First, we subject the quantum state we aim to identify to a know time evolution for a desired period of time. Afterwards we perform a measurement with a fixed measurement set-up. This procedure can then be repeated for other periods of time, the measurement set-up however remains unaltered. Given an $n$-dimensional system with suitable unitary dynamics, we show that any two states can be discriminated by performing a measurement with a set-up that has $n$ outcomes at $n+1$ points in time. Furthermore, we consider scenarios where prior information restricts the set of states to a subset of lower dimensionality. Given an $n$-dimensional system with suitable unitary dynamics and a semi-algebraic subset $\mathcal{R}$ of its state space, we show that any two states of the subset can be discriminated by performing a measurement with a set-up that has $n$ outcomes at $l$ steps of the time evolution if $(n-1)l\ge 2\dim\mathcal{R}$. In addition, by going beyond unitary dynamics, we show that one can in fact reduce to a set-up with the minimal number of two outcomes.

abstract: We propose a method to achieve high degree control of nanomechanical oscillators by coupling their mechanical motion to single spins. By manipulating the spin alone and measuring its quantum state heralds the cooling or squeezing of the oscillator even for weak spin-oscillator couplings. We analytically show that the asymptotic behavior of the oscillator is determined by a spin-induced thermal filter function whose overlap with the initial thermal distribution of the oscillator determines its cooling, heating or squeezing. Counterintuitively, the rate of cooling dependence on the instantaneous thermal occupancy of the oscillator renders robust cooling or squeezing even for high initial temperatures and damping rates. We further estimate how the proposed scheme can be used to control the motion of a thin diamond cantilever by coupling it to its defect centers at low temperature.

abstract: We propose a total measure of multi-particle quantum correlation in a system of N two-level atoms. We construct a parameter that encompasses all possible quantum correlations among N two-level atoms in arbitrary symmetric pure states and define its numerical value to be the total measure of the net atom-atom correlations. We use that parameter to quantify the total quantum correlations in atomic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat states, which are generated by the dispersive interaction in a cavity. We study the variation of the net amount of quantum correlation as we vary the number of atoms from N=2 to N=100 and obtain some interesting results. We also study the variation of the net correlation, for fixed interaction time, as we increase the number of atoms in the excited state of the initial system, and notice some interesting features. We also observe the behaviour of the net quantum correlation as we continuously increase the interaction time, for the general state of N two-level atoms in a dispersive cavity.

abstract: We analyze the storage and retrieval of intense-broadband pulses with the added effects of Doppler broadening and detuning in a $\Lambda$ configuration. We compute analytical solutions via the inverse scattering technique and show how the signal field is transferred to a spin-wave in the atomic medium and later retrieved by the interaction of a control pulse. Due to the intensity of the pulses, the pulse area (as defined for self-induced transparency) plays a key role in the interaction, as it determines the location of the spin wave within the medium. Additionally, we compare our results to non-ideal conditions by considering pulses of finite length and the effect of spontaneous emission.

abstract: In continuous-variable tomography, with finite data and limited computation resources, reconstruction of a quantum state of light is performed on a finite-dimensional subspace. No systematic method was ever developed to assign such a reconstruction subspace---only ad hoc methods that rely on hard-to-certify assumptions about the source and strategies. We provide a straightforward and numerically feasible procedure to uniquely determine the appropriate reconstruction subspace for any given unknown quantum state of light and measurement scheme. This procedure makes use of the celebrated statistical principle of maximum likelihood, along with other validation tools, to grow an appropriate seed subspace into the optimal reconstruction subspace, much like the nucleation of a seed into a crystal. Apart from using the available measurement data, no other spurious assumptions about the source or ad hoc strategies are invoked. As a result, there will no longer be reconstruction artifacts present in state reconstruction, which is a usual consequence of a bad choice of reconstruction subspace. The procedure can be understood as the maximum-likelihood reconstruction for quantum subspaces, which is an analog to, and fully compatible with that for quantum states.

abstract: The notion of chemical bond is a very useful concept in chemistry. It originated at the beginning of chemistry, it is expressive for the classically thinking mind, and the errors arising from the approximative nature of the concept can often be ignored. In the first half of the twentieth century, however, we learned that the proper description of the microworld is given by quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics gives more accurate results for chemical systems than any preceding model, however, it is very inexpressive for the classically thinking mind. The quantum mechanical description of the chemical bond is given in terms of delocalized bonding orbitals, or, alternatively, in terms of correlations of occupations of localized orbitals. However, in the latter case, multiorbital correlations were treated only in terms of two-orbital correlations, although the structure of multiorbital correlations is far richer; and, in the case of bonds established by more than two electrons, multiorbital correlations represent a more natural point of view. Here, for the first time, we introduce the true multiorbital correlation theory, consisting of a framework for handling the structure of multiorbital correlations, a toolbox of true multiorbital correlation measures, and an algorithm for the multiorbital correlation clustering. These make it possible to characterize quantitatively, how well a bonding picture describes the chemical system. Illustrating this novel theory, we apply it for the investigation of the bond structures of several molecules. We show that the reason for ambiguous or debated bonding picture is the non-existence of well-defined multiorbital correlation clustering.

abstract: The extension problem asks when two bipartite states $s_{XY}$ and $s_{YZ}$ are marginals of a tripartite state $s_{XYZ}$. It is especially pertinent in quantum theory, where pairwise compatibility need not imply global compatibility. We generalise its solution for classical probability distributions to commutative monads on cartesian categories that preserve terminal objects, and then apply this to the valuation monad in topos quantum theory. In doing so, we define composite systems in topos quantum theory, analyse their states, and prove that they correspond to positive over pure tensor states.

Although other options continue to be explored, effort is coalescing around topological coding models as the most practical implementation option for error correction on realizable microarchitectures. Scalability concerns have also motivated architects to propose distributed memory multicomputer architectures, with experimental efforts demonstrating some of the basic building blocks to make such designs possible.

abstract: Quantum features of correlated optical modes define a major aspect of the nonclassicality in quantized radiation fields. However, the phase sensitive detection of a two-mode light field is restricted to interferometric setups and local intensity measurements. Even the full reconstruction of the quantum state of a single radiation mode relies on such detection layouts and the preparation of a well-defined reference light field. In this work, we establish the notion of the essential quantum correlations of two-mode light fields. It refers to those quantum correlations which are measurable by a given device, i.e., the accessible part of a nonclassical Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space distribution, which does not depend on a global phase. Assuming a simple four-port interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, we derive the reconstruction method and nonclassicality criteria based on the Laplace-transformed moment generating function of the essential quasiprobability. With this technique, we demonstrate that the essential quantum correlations of a polarization tomography scheme is observable even if the detectors are imperfect and cannot truly resolve the photon statistics.

title: Non-Uniform Code Concatenation for Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing

abstract: Using transversal gates is a straightforward and efficient technique for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Since transversal gates alone cannot be computationally universal, they must be combined with other approaches such as magic state distillation, code switching or code concatenation in order to achieve universality. In this paper we propose an alternative approach for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing mainly based on the code concatenation approach proposed in [PRL 112, 010505 (2014)] but in a non-uniform fashion. The proposed approach which is described based on non-uniform concatenation of 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, leads to a 49-qubit code for correcting any arbitrary single physical error with ability to perform a universal set of fault-tolerant gates, without using magic state distillation.

abstract: The role of electron-nuclear entanglement on the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is investigated. While nonadiabatic couplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO approximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is found to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation. This is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by their deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation, the accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of the BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context of a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an adequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO approximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately unentangled. Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement properties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely unentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.

abstract: It has recently been recognized by the author that the quantum contextuality paradigm may be formulated in terms of the properties of some subgroups of the two-letter free group $G$ and their corresponding point-line incidence geometry $\mathcal{G}$. I introduce a fundamental homomorphism $f$ mapping the (infinitely many) words of G to the permutations ruling the symmetries of $\mathcal{G}$. The substructure of $f$ is revealing the essence of geometric contextuality in a straightforward way.

abstract: We propose a protocol to dissipatively cool a room temperature mechanical resonator using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensemble. The spin ensemble is coupled to the resonator through its orbitally-averaged excited state, which has a spin-strain interaction that has not been previously characterized. We experimentally demonstrate that the spin-strain coupling in the excited state is $13.5\pm0.5$ times stronger than the ground state spin-strain coupling. We then theoretically show that this interaction combined with a high-density spin ensemble enables the cooling of a mechanical resonator from room temperature to a fraction of its thermal phonon occupancy.

abstract: Data of the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of a system containing one spin-1/2 particle interacting with a bath of up to 32 spin-1/2 particles is used to construct a Markovian quantum master equation describing the dynamics of the system spin. The procedure of obtaining this quantum master equation, which takes the form of a Bloch equation with time-independent coefficients, accounts for all non-Markovian effects in as much the general structure of the quantum master equation allows. Our simulation results show that, with a few rather exotic exceptions, the Bloch-like equation with time-independent coefficients provides a simple and accurate description of the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in contact with a thermal bath. A calculation of the coefficients that appear in the Redfield master equation in the Markovian limit shows that this equation yields a rather poor description of the original data.

abstract: Traditionally, covariant scalar field theory models are either super renormalizable, strictly renormalizable, or nonrenormalizable. The goal of `Mixed Models' is to make sense of sums of these distinct examples, e.g., $g\varphi^4_3+g'\varphi^6_3+g''\varphi^8_3$, which includes an example of each kind for spacetime dimension $n=3$. We show how the several interactions such mixed models have may be turned on and off in any order without any difficulties. Analogous results are shown for $g\varphi^4_n+g'\varphi^{138}_n$, etc., for all $n\ge3$. Different categories hold for $n=2$ such as, e.g., ${g P(\varphi)_2+g' N\!P}(\varphi)_2$, that involve polynomial ($P$) and suitable nonpolynomial ($N\!P$) interactions, etc. Analogous situations for $n=1$ (time alone) offer simple `toy' examples of how such mixed models may be constructed.

abstract: The effect of ion mass on pair production in the interaction of an ultraintense laser with overdense plasmas has been explored by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. It is found that the heavier ion mass excites the higher and broader electrostatic field, which is responsible for the enhancement of backward photon number. The pair yields are also reinforced due to the increase of head-on collision of backwards photon with incoming laser. By examining the density evolution and angle distribution of each particle species the origin of pair yields enhancement has been clarified further.

abstract: Recent realizations of quantum gas microscope offer the possibility of continuously monitoring the dynamics of a quantum many-body system. By analyzing effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians of interacting bosons in an optical lattice and continuum, we show that the backaction of quantum measurement shifts the quantum critical point and gives rise to a unique critical phase beyond the scope of the standard universality class. Our results can be investigated by current experimental techniques in ultracold atoms and are relevant to trapped ions and atom-cavity systems.

abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical efforts have focused on the effect of dissipation on quantum many-body systems in their many-body localized (MBL) phase. While in the presence of dephasing noise such systems reach a unique ergodic state, their dynamics is characterized by slow relaxation manifested in non-exponential decay of self-correlations. Here we shed light on a currently much debated issue, namely the role of interactions for this relaxation dynamics. We focus on the experimentally relevant situation of the evolution from an initial charge density wave in the presence of strong dephasing noise. We find a crossover from a regime dominated by disorder to a regime dominated by interactions, with a concomitant change of time correlators from stretched exponential to compressed exponential form. The strongly interacting regime can be explained in terms of nucleation and growth dynamics of relaxing regions - reminiscent of the kinetics of crystallization in soft matter systems - and should be observable experimentally. This interaction-driven crossover suggests that the competition between interactions and noise give rise to a much richer structure of the MBL phase than anticipated so far.

abstract: Multi-configurational approaches yield universal wave function parameterizations that can qualitatively well describe electronic structures along reaction pathways. For quantitative results, multi-reference perturbation theory is required to capture dynamic electron correlation from the otherwise neglected virtual orbitals. Still, the overall accuracy suffers from the finite size and choice of the active orbital space and peculiarities of the perturbation theory. Fortunately, the electronic wave functions at equilibrium structures of reactants and products can often be well described by single-reference methods and hence are accessible to accurate coupled cluster calculations. Here, we calculate the heterolytic double dissociation energy of four 3d-metallocenes with the complete active space self-consistent field method and compare to highly accurate coupled cluster data. Our coupled cluster data are well within the experimental error bars. This accuracy can also be approached by complete active space calculations with an orbital selection based on information entropy measures. The entropy based active space selection is discussed in detail. We find a very subtle balance between static and dynamic electron correlation effects that emphasizes the need for algorithmic active space selection and that differs significantly from restricted active space results for identical active spaces reported in the literature.

abstract: We provide new query complexity separations against sensitivity for total Boolean functions: a power 3 separation between deterministic (and even randomized or quantum) query complexity and sensitivity, and a power 2.1 separation between certificate complexity and sensitivity. We get these separations by using a new connection between sensitivity and a seemingly unrelated measure called one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity ($UC_{\min}$). Finally, we show that $UC_{\min}$ is lower-bounded by fractional block sensitivity, which means we cannot use these techniques to get a super-quadratic separation between bs(f) and s(f).

abstract: We characterize non-perturbatively the R\'enyi entropies of degree n=2,3,4, and 5 of three-dimensional, strongly coupled many-fermion systems in the scale-invariant regime of short interaction range and large scattering length, i.e. in the unitary limit. We carry out our calculations using lattice methods devised recently by us. Our results show the effect of strong pairing correlations on the entanglement entropy, which modify the sub-leading behavior for large subsystem sizes (as characterized by the dimensionless parameter x=kF L_A, where kF is the Fermi momentum and L_A the linear subsystem size), but leave the leading order unchanged relative to the non-interacting case. Moreover, we find that the onset of the sub-leading asymptotic regime is at surprisingly small x=2-4. We provide further insight into the entanglement properties of this system by analyzing the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian of the two-body problem from weak to strong coupling. The low-lying entanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling is varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and scale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum appears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical characterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as the coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum represents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In contrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the noninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees that our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and represent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were recently shown to have direct access to the entanglement entropy.
