abstract: On the base of the general Lindblad equation, we build a phenomenological theory of thermalization where, assigned the environment, the Lindblad operators are determined by exploiting a few basic thermodynamic principles. Here, we specialize this procedure to the case in which the environment is a blackbody radiation and the system is a set of $N$ noninteracting atoms. For such systems, degeneracies of the energy levels and/or of the energy gaps are unavoidable, even if the spectra of each atom are nondegenerate. We show that our phenomenological approach leads to a consistent scenario for the dissipation and decoherence times, resolving a number of serious pathologies present in the popular quantum optical master equation.

abstract: Realization of Quantum information and communications technologies requires robust, stable solid state single photon sources. However, most existing sources cease to function above cryogenic or room temperature due to thermal ionization or strong phonon coupling which impede their emissive and quantum properties. Here we present an efficient single photon source based on a defect in a van der Waals crystal that is optically stable and operates at elevated temperatures of up to 800 K. The quantum nature of the source and the photon purity are maintained upon heating to 800 K and cooling back to room temperature. Our report of a robust high temperature solid state single photon source constitutes a significant step to-wards practical, integrated quantum technologies for real-world environments.

abstract: We prove that the energy gap of the model proposed by Zhang, Ahmadain, and Klich [1] is exponentially small in the square of the system size. In [2] a class of exactly solvable quantum spin chain models was proposed that have integer spins ($s$), with a nearest neighbors Hamiltonian, and a unique ground state. The ground state can be seen as a uniform superposition of all $s-$colored Motzkin walks. The half-chain entanglement entropy provably violates the area law by a square root factor in the system's size ($\sim\sqrt{n}$) for $s>1$. For $s=1$, the violation is logarithmic [3]. Moreover in [2] it was proved that the gap vanishes polynomially and is $O(n^{-c})$ with $c\ge2$. Recently, a deformation of [2], which we call "weighted Motzkin quantum spin chain" was proposed [1]. This model has a unique ground state that is a superposition of the $s-$colored Motzkin walks weighted by $t^{\text{area\{Motzkin walk\}}}$ with $t>1$. The most surprising feature of this model is that it violates the area law by a factor of $n$. Here we prove that the gap of this model is upper bounded by $8ns\text{ }t^{-n^{2}/3}$ for $t>1$.

abstract: We investigate equilibration and generalized thermalization of quantum Harmonic chain --- an integrable system which in the thermodynamic limit mimics a free scalar field --- under global quantum quench. The quench action we consider is connecting two disjoint harmonic chains of different sizes and the system jumps between two integrable settings. We verify the validity of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble description for this system and also identify equilibration between the subsystems as in classical systems. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we show that the eigenstates of the system prior to the quench evolve towards the Gibbs Generalized Ensemble description. Further, through the phase space properties of a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble and the strength of stimulated emission, we identify the necessary criterion on the initial states for the thermalization at late times, which is satisfied by the system in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: A quantum state is fully characterized by its density matrix or equivalently by its quasiprobabilities in phase space. A scheme to identify the quasiprobabilities of a quantum state is an important tool in the recent development of quantum technologies. Based on our highly efficient vacuum measurement scheme, we measure the quasiprobability $Q$-function of the vibrational motion for a \Yb ion {\it resonantly} interacting with its internal energy states. This interaction model is known as the Jaynes-Cummings model which is one of the fundamental models in quantum electrodynamics. We apply the capability of the vacuum measurement to study the Jaynes-Cummings dynamics, where the Gaussian peak of the initial coherent state is known to bifurcate and rotate around the origin of phase space. They merge at the so-called revival time at the other side of phase space. The measured $Q$-function agrees with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, we reconstruct the Wigner function by deconvoluting the $Q$-function and observe the quantum interference in the Wigner function at half of the revival time, where the vibrational state becomes nearly disentangled from the internal energy states and forms a superposition of two composite states. The scheme can be applied to other physical setups including cavity or circuit-QED and optomechanical systems.

abstract: Quantum states of light play a pivotal role in modern science[1] and future photonic applications[2]. While impressive progress has been made in their generation and manipulation with high fidelities, the common table-top approach is reaching its limits for practical quantum applications. Since the advent of integrated quantum nanophotonics[3] different material platforms based on III-V nanostructures-, color centers-, and nonlinear waveguides[4-8] as on-chip light sources have been investigated. Each platform has unique advantages and limitations in terms of source properties, optical circuit complexity, and scaling potentials. However, all implementations face major challenges with efficient and tunable filtering of individual quantum states[4], scalable integration and deterministic multiplexing of on-demand selected quantum emitters[9], and on-chip excitation-suppression[10]. Here we overcome all of these challenges with a novel hybrid and scalable nanofabrication approach to generate quantum light on-chip, where selected single III-V quantum emitters are positioned and deterministically integrated in a CMOS compatible circuit[11] with controlled on-chip filtering and excitation-suppression.Furthermore, we demonstrate novel on-chip quantum wavelength division multiplexing, showing tunable routing of single-photons. Our reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits with a foot print one million times smaller than similar table-top approaches, offering outstanding excitation suppression of more than 95 dB and efficient routing of single photons over a bandwidth of 40 nm, are essential to unleash integrated quantum optical technologies full potential.

abstract: The adiabatic quantum computation is a universal and robust method of quantum computing. In this architecture, the problem can be solved by adiabatically evolving the quantum processor from the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian to that of a final one, which encodes the solution of the problem. By far, there is no experimental realization of adiabatic quantum computation on a single solid spin system under ambient conditions, which has been proved to be a compatible candidate for scalable quantum computation. In this letter, we report on the first experimental realization of an adiabatic quantum algorithm on a single solid spin system under ambient conditions. All elements of adiabatic quantum computation, including initial state preparation, adiabatic evolution, and final state readout, are realized experimentally. As an example, we factored 35 into its prime factors 5 and 7 on our adiabatic quantum processor.

abstract: Phase space dynamics in classical mechanics is described by transport along trajectories. Amongst quantum mechanical systems, only systems with at most quadratic potentials allow for a trajectory-based description of their phase space dynamics. We show that anharmonic quantum mechanical systems' generation of quantum-mechanical coherences is responsible for the occurrence of singularities in their phase space velocity fields. This implies that anharmonic quantum systems cannot feature trajectories. For their quantum phase space dynamics the Lagrangian approach of moving-with-the-flow along trajectories yields misleading results. This invalidates some trajectory-based approaches to quantum phase space studies.

abstract: Symmetrically evolving discrete quantum walk results in dynamic localization with zero mean displacement when the standard evolution operations are replaced by a temporal disorder evolution operation. In this work we show that the quantum ratchet, that is, a directed transport in standard and disordered discrete-time quantum walk can be realized by introducing a pawl like effect using a fixed coin operation at marked positions different from the one used for evolution at other positions. We also show that the combination of standard and disordered evolution operations can be optimized to get the mean displacement of the order $\propto$ t (number of walk steps). This model of quantum ratchet in quantum walk is defined using only a set of entangling unitary operators resulting in the coherent quantum transport.

abstract: We construct an error-detected block, assisted by the quantum-dot spins in double-side optical microcavities. With this block, we propose three error-detected schemes for the deterministic generation, the complete analysis, and the complete nondestructive analysis of hyperentangled Bell states in both the polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom of two-photon systems. In these schemes, the errors can be detected, which can improve their fidelity largely, far different from other previous schemes assisted by the interaction between the photon and the QD-cavity system. Our scheme for the deterministic generation of hyperentangled two-photon systems can be performed by repeat until success. These features make our schemes more useful in high-capacity quantum communication with hyperentanglement in the future.

abstract: In the study of open quantum systems, one of the most common ways to describe environmental effects on the reduced dynamics is through the spectral density. However, in many models this object cannot be computed from first principles and needs to be inferred on phenomenological grounds or fitted to experimental data. Consequently, some uncertainty regarding its form and parameters is unavoidable; this in turn calls into question the accuracy of any theoretical predictions based on a given spectral density. Here, we focus on the spin-boson model as a prototypical open quantum system, and find two error bounds on predicted expectation values in terms of the spectral density variation considered, and state a sufficient condition for the strongest one to apply. We further demonstrate an application of our result, by bounding the error brought about by the approximations involved in the Hierarchical Equations of Motion resolution method for spin-boson dynamics.

abstract: In this article the robustness of tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states is investigated against Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (i.e. DM) interaction. We consider a closed system of three qubits and an environmental qubit. The environmental qubit interacts with any one of the three qubits through DM interaction. The tripartite system is initially prepared in GHZ and W states respectively. The composite four qubits system evolve with unitary dynamics. We detach the environmental qubit by tracing out from four qubits and profound impact of DM interaction is studied on the initial entanglement of the system. As a result we find that the bipartite partitions of W states suffer from entanglement sudden death (i.e. ESD), while tripartite entanglement does not. On the other hand bipartite partitions and tripartite entanglement in GHZ states does not feel any influence of DM interaction. So, we find that GHZ states have robust character than W states. In this work we consider generalised GHZ and W states and three $\pi$ is used as an entanglement measure. This study can be useful in quantum information processing where unwanted DM interaction takes place.

abstract: In bipartite quantum systems, entanglement correlations between the parties exerts direct influence in the phenomenon of wave-particle duality. This effect has been quantitatively analyzed in the context of two qubits by M. Jakob and J. Bergou [Optics Communications 283(5) (2010) 827]. Employing a description of the K-meson propagation in free space where its weak decay states are included as a second party, we study here this effect in the kaon-antikaon oscillations. We show that a new quantitative "triality" relation similar to the one considered by Jakob and Bergou holds. In our case, it relates the distinguishability between the decay products states corresponding to the distinct kaon propagation modes $K_S $, $K_L $, the amount of wave-like path interference between these states, and the amount of entanglement given by the reduced von Neumann entropy. The inequality can account for the complementarity between strangeness oscillations and lifetime information previously considered in the literature, therefore allowing one to see how it is affected by entanglement correlations. As we will discuss, it allows one to visualize clearly through the $K^{0}$$\overline{K}\,^{0}$ oscillations the fundamental role of entanglement in quantum complementarity.

abstract: Contrary to counterfactual definiteness quantum theory teaches us that measuring instruments are not passively reading predetermined values of physical observables. Counterfactual definiteness allows proving Bell inequalities. If the contextual character of quantum measurements is correctly taken into account the proofs of these inequalities may not be done. In recent computer simulations of idealized Bell experiment predetermined successive outcomes of measurements for each setting and predetermined time delays of their registrations are calculated. Time windows and time delays are used to select various samples. Correlations, estimated using these selected samples are consistent with the predictions of quantum theory and the time window dependence is similar to the dependence observed in some real experiments. It is an important example how correlations can be explained without evoking quantum magic. However by using a suitable post-selection one may prove anything. Moreover before the post-selection generated samples may not violate Bell inequalities as significantly as finite samples generated using quantum predictions therefore we disagree with the conclusion that counterfactual definiteness is not able to distinguish classical from quantum physics. Moreover we show that for each choice of a time window there exists a contextual hidden variable probabilistic model consistent with the post-selection procedure used by the authors what explains why they are able to reproduce quantum predictions.

abstract: We estimate the teleported and the gained parameters by means of Fisher information in a non-inertial frame. The sender and the receiver share an accelerated maximum or partial entangled state. The estimation degree of these parameters depends on Unruh acceleration, the used single mode approximation(within/ beyond), the structure of the initial teleported state, and the entanglement of the initial communication channel. The maximization and minimization estimation degree of the teleported parameters depend on the initial encoded information. The estimation degree of the parameters can be maximized if the partners teleport classical information.

We provide an explicit universal protocol to construct all possible quantum channels, using a single qubit ancilla with quantum non-demolition readout and adaptive control. Our construction is efficient in both physical resources and circuit depth, and can be demonstrated using superconducting circuits and various other physical platforms. There are many applications of quantum channel construction, including system stabilization and quantum error correction, Markovian and exotic channel simulation, implementation of generalized quantum measurements and more general quantum instruments. Efficient construction of arbitrary quantum channels opens up exciting new possibilities for quantum control, quantum sensing and information processing tasks.

abstract: The precise measurement of molecular vibrational transition frequencies is useful in the search for variation in the proton-to-electron mass ratio {\mu}. Homonuclear diatomic molecules are particularly advantageous for precise measurement because of the small Stark shift. This paper discusses the Stark and Zeeman shifts in the 16O2+ vibrational transition frequencies.To search for the variation {\mu}(<10-17/yr), the X2{\Pi}1/2(v,J)=(0,1/2)-(v',1/2)(v'>1)in transition frequencies are much more advantageous than the transition frequencies between the X2{\Pi}1/2 v=21 and a4{\Pi}1/2 v=0 states, whose sensitivity to the variation in {\mu} is high because of the accidental degeneracy.

abstract: Expanding the frontiers of information processing technologies and, in particular, computing with ever increasing speed and capacity has long been recognized an important societal challenge, calling for the development of the next generation of quantum technologies. With its potential to exponentially increase computing power, quantum computing opens up possibilities to carry out calculations that ordinary computers could not finish in the lifetime of the Universe, while optical communications based on quantum cryptography become completely secure. At the same time, the emergence of Big Data and the ever increasing demands of miniaturization and energy saving technologies bring about additional fundamental problems and technological challenges to be addressed in scientific disciplines dealing with light-matter interactions. In this context, quantum plasmonics represents one of the most promising and fundamental research directions and, indeed, the only one that enables ultimate miniaturization of photonic components for quantum optics when being taken to extreme limits in light-matter interactions.

abstract: Hybrids consisting of macroscopic superconducting circuits and microscopic components, such as atoms and spins, have the potential of transmitting an arbitrary state between different quantum species, leading to the prospective of high-speed operation and long-time storage of quantum information. Here we propose a novel hybrid structure, where a neutral-atom qubit directly interfaces with a superconducting charge qubit, to implement the qubit-state transmission. The highly-excited Rydberg atom located inside the gate capacitor strongly affects the behavior of Cooper pairs in the box while the atom in the ground state hardly interferes with the superconducting device. In addition, the DC Stark shift of the atomic states significantly depends on the charge-qubit states. By means of the standard spectroscopic techniques and sweeping the gate voltage bias, we show how to transfer an arbitrary quantum state from the superconducting device to the atom and vice versa.

abstract: A quantum phase transition is an unequivocal signature of strongly correlated many-body physics. Signatures of such phenomena are yet to be observed in ballistic transport through quantum wires. Recent developments in quantum wires have made it possible to enhance the interaction between the electrons. Here we show that hitherto unexplained anticrossing between conduction energy sub-bands, observed in such experiments, can be explained through a simple yet effective discretised model which undergoes a quantum phase transition within the Ising universality class. Accordingly, we observe how the charge distribution, transverse to the direction of the wire will vary across the phase transition. We show that data coming from three different samples with differing electron densities and gate voltages show a remarkable universal scaling behavior, determined by the relevant critical exponent, which is only possible near a quantum phase transition.

abstract: We study a system of interacting matter quasiparticles strongly coupled to photons inside an optomechanical cavity. The resulting normal modes of the system are represented by hybrid polaritonic quasiparticles, which acquire effective nonlinearity. Its strength is influenced by the presence of the mechanical mode and depends on the resonance frequency of the cavity. This leads to an interactive type of optomechanical coupling, being distinct from the previously studied dispersive and dissipative couplings in optomechanical systems. The emergent interactive coupling is shown to generate effective optical nonlinearity terms of high order, being quartic in the polariton number. We consider particular systems of exciton-polaritons and dipolaritons, and show that the induced effective optical nonlinearity due to the interactive coupling can exceed in magnitude the strength of Kerr nonlinear terms, such as those arising from polariton-polariton interactions. As applications, we show that the higher order terms give rise to localized bright flat top solitons, which may form spontaneously in polariton condensates.

abstract: Understanding and probing phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems is an ongoing challenge in physics. A particular instance are phase transitions that occur between a non-fluctuating absorbing phase, e.g., an extinct population, and one in which the relevant order parameter, such as the population density, assumes a finite value. Here we report the observation of signatures of such a non-equilibrium phase transition in an open driven quantum system. In our experiment rubidium atoms in a quasi one-dimensional cold disordered gas are laser-excited to Rydberg states under so-called facilitation conditions. This conditional excitation process competes with spontaneous decay and leads to a crossover between a stationary state with no excitations and one with a finite number of excitations. We relate the underlying physics to that of an absorbing state phase transition in the presence of a field which slightly offsets the system from criticality. We observe a characteristic power-law scaling of the Rydberg excitation density as well as increased fluctuations close to the transition point. Furthermore, we argue that the observed transition relies on the presence of atomic motion which introduces annealed disorder into the system and enables the formation of long-ranged correlations. Our study paves the road for future investigations into the largely unexplored physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions in open many-body quantum systems.

abstract: We show that dephasing of individual atoms destroys the superradiance transition of the Dicke model, but that adding individual decay toward the spin down state can restore this transition. To demonstrate this, we present a method to give an exact solution for the $N$ atom problem with individual dephasing which scales polynomially with $N$. By comparing finite size scaling of our exact solution to a cumulant expansion, we confirm the destruction and restoration of the superradiance transition holds in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: We consider a model of an electron in a crystal moving under the influence of an external electric field: Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a potential which is the sum of a periodic function and a general smooth function. We identify two dimensionless parameters: (re-scaled) Planck's constant and the ratio of the lattice spacing to the scale of variation of the external potential. We consider the special case where both parameters are equal and denote this parameter $\epsilon$. In the limit $\epsilon \downarrow 0$, we prove the existence of solutions known as semiclassical wavepackets which are asymptotic up to `Ehrenfest time' $t \sim \ln 1/\epsilon$. To leading order, the center of mass and average quasi-momentum of these solutions evolve along trajectories generated by the classical Hamiltonian given by the sum of the Bloch band energy and the external potential. We then derive all corrections to the evolution of these observables proportional to $\epsilon$. The corrections depend on the gauge-invariant Berry curvature of the Bloch band, and a coupling to the evolution of the wave-packet envelope which satisfies Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a time-dependent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that this coupling of observables (discrete particle-like degrees of freedom) to the wave-envelope (continuum field-like degrees of freedom) can have a very significant impact on the overall dynamics. We show that the coupled `particle-field' system for the evolution of the observables and wavepacket envelope may be derived from an `extended' $\epsilon$-dependent Hamiltonian.
