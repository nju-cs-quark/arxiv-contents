abstract: The response of inertial particle detectors coupled to a scalar field satisfying nonlocal dynamics described by non-analytic functions of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ is studied. We show that spontaneous emission processes of a low energy particle detector are very sensitive to high-energy non-locality scales. This allows us to suggest a nuclear physics experiment ($\sim$ MeV energy scales) that outperforms the sensitivity of LHC experiments by many orders of magnitude. This may have implications for the falsifiability of theoretical proposals of quantum gravity.

abstract: An optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum is a paradigm optomechanical system for sensing and studying macroscopic quantum mechanics. While its center-of-mass motion has been investigated intensively, its torsional vibration has only been studied theoretically in limited cases. Here we report the first experimental observation of the torsional vibration of an optically levitated nonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum. We achieve this by utilizing the coupling between the spin angular momentum of photons and the torsional vibration of a nonspherical nanoparticle whose polarizability is a tensor. The torsional vibration frequency can be one order of magnitude higher than its center-of-mass motion frequency, which is promising for ground state cooling. With an ellipsoidal model, we propose a simple yet novel scheme to achieve ground state cooling of its torsional vibration with a linearly-polarized Gaussian cavity mode. A levitated nonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum will also be an ultrasensitive nanoscale torsion balance with a torque detection sensitivity on the order of $10^{-29} ~\mathrm{N}\cdot \mathrm{m}/\sqrt{\mathrm{ Hz}}$ under realistic conditions.

abstract: Classical correlation can be locked via quantum means--quantum data locking. With a short secret key, one can lock an exponentially large amount of information, in order to make it inaccessible to unauthorized users without the key. Quantum data locking presents a resource-efficient alternative to one-time pad encryption which requires a key no shorter than the message. We report experimental demonstrations of quantum data locking scheme originally proposed by DiVincenzo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 067902 (2004)] and a loss-tolerant scheme developed by Fawzi, Hayde, and Sen [J. ACM. 60, 44 (2013)]. We observe that the unlocked amount of information is larger than the key size in both experiments, exhibiting strong violation of the incremental proportionality property of classical information theory. As an application example, we show the successful transmission of a photo over a lossy channel with quantum data (un)locking and error correction.

abstract: Quantum coherence is important in quantum mechanics, and its essence is from superposition principle. We study the coherence of any two pure states and that of their arbitrary superposition, and obtain the relationship between them. In the case that the two states have support on orthogonal subspaces, the relationship is simple, that is, the difference between the coherence of their superposition state and the average coherence of them is smaller than 1. In other cases, we obtain different and a little more complicated relationships. Furthermore, we also obtain the lower bound of coherence of superpositions.

abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanical and quantum information processing. Following the question who \emph{witnesses} entanglement witnesses, we show entangled states play as the role of super entanglement witnesses. We show separable states play the role of "super super entanglement witnesses" and "witness" other observables than entanglement witnesses. We show that there exists a hierarchy structure of witnesses and there exist "witnesses" everywhere. Furthermore, we show the properties and characterization of entangled states as super entanglement witnesses. By the role of super witnesses of entangled states, we immediately find the question when different entanglement witnesses can detect the same entangled states [{\it Phys. Lett. A }{\bf 356} 402 (2006)] is the same as the question when different entangled states can be detected by the same entanglement witnesses [{\it Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 75} 052333 (2007)]. By the role of "witnesses", we define finer entangled states and optimal entangled states. The definition gives a nonnumeric measurement of entanglement and an unambiguous discrimination of entangled states, and the procedure of optimization for a general entangled state $\rho$ is just finding the best separable approximation (BSA) to $\rho$ in [ {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 80} 2261 (1998)].}

abstract: A simple and standard model is suggested in order to produce a quantum entanglement between two mechanical resonators in a two optomechanical cavities. These two cavities are coupled by the photon-hopping process. The strong coupling regime is considered and the two cavities are assumed driven. In order to quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. The analytical solutions are presented for the system in a parameter regime very close to the newly experiments results. We show that when there is photon hopping strength between two optomechanical cavities, the two mechanical resonators and the field modes can be entangled. This tells us clearly that the entanglement can be transfer via radiation pressure of a photon hopping coupling from the intracavity photon-phonon entanglements to an inter-cavity photon-photon or phonon-phonon entanglement.

abstract: Based on the exact dynamics of a two-qubit system and environment, we investigate system-environment (SE) quantum and classical correlations. The coupling is chosen to represent a dephasing channel for one of the qubits and the environment is a proper thermal bath. First we discuss the general issue of dilation for qubit phase damping. Based on the usual thermal bath of harmonic oscillators, we derive criteria of separability and entanglement between an initial $X$ state and the environment. Applying these criteria to initial Werner states, we find that entanglement between the system and environment is built up in time for temperatures below a certain critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{crit}}$. On the other hand, the total state remains separable during those short times that are relevant for decoherence and loss of entanglement in the two-qubit state. Close to $T_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the SE correlations oscillate between separable and entangled. Even though these oscillations are also observed in the entanglement between the two qubits, no simple relation between the loss of entanglement in the two-qubit system and the build-up of entanglement between the system and environment is found.

abstract: We introduce a general framework for the construction of completely positive dynamical evolutions in the presence of system-environment initial correlations. The construction relies upon commutativity of the compatibility domain obtained by considering the marginals with respect to the environmental degrees of freedom of the considered class of correlated states. Our approach allows to consider states whose discord is not necessarily zero and explicitly show the non-uniqueness of the completely positive extensions of the obtained dynamical map outside the compatibility domain. The relevance of such maps for the treatment of open quantum system dynamics is discussed and connection to previous literature is critically assessed.

abstract: The more information a measurement provides about a quantum system's position statistics, the less information a subsequent measurement can provide about the system's momentum statistics. This information trade-off is embodied in the entropic formulation of the uncertainty principle. Traditionally, uncertainty relations correspond to resolution limits; increasing a detector's position sensitivity decreases its momentum sensitivity and vice-versa. However, this is not required in general; for example, position information can instead be extracted at the cost of noise in momentum. Using random, partial projections in position followed by strong measurements in momentum, we efficiently determine the transverse-position and transverse-momentum distributions of an unknown optical field with a single set of measurements. The momentum distribution is directly imaged, while the position distribution is recovered using compressive sensing. At no point do we violate uncertainty relations; rather, we economize the use of information we obtain.

abstract: We give the first construction of a family of quantum-proof extractors that has optimal seed length dependence $O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$ on the input length $n$ and error $\varepsilon$. Our extractors support any min-entropy $k=\Omega(\log{n} + \log^{1+\alpha}(1/\varepsilon))$ and extract $m=(1-\alpha)k$ bits that are $\varepsilon$-close to uniform, for any desired constant $\alpha > 0$. Previous constructions had a quadratically worse seed length or were restricted to very large input min-entropy or very few output bits. Our result is based on a generic reduction showing that any strong classical condenser is automatically quantum-proof, with comparable parameters. The existence of such a reduction for extractors is a long-standing open question; here we give an affirmative answer for condensers. Once this reduction is established, to obtain our quantum-proof extractors one only needs to consider high entropy sources. We construct quantum-proof extractors with the desired parameters for such sources by extending a classical approach to extractor construction, based on the use of block-sources and sampling, to the quantum setting. Our extractors can be used to obtain improved protocols for device-independent randomness expansion and for privacy amplification.

abstract: Solutions to the Maxwell-Bloch equations for a $\Lambda$ system are computed using the single-soliton Darboux transformation and the nonlinear superposition principle. These allow complete control of information deposited by a signal pulse (with the help of an auxiliary control pulse) in the coherence of the medium's ground states by injecting sub-sequential pulses. Additionally, we study the encoding of two signal pulses and their manipulation by a control pulse and show that multipulse storage and control are possible as long as the imprints made by encoding the signal pulses are sufficiently separated.

abstract: Violation of Mermin inequalities is tested on the 5-qubit IBM quantum computer. For 3, 4 and 5 parties, quantum states that violate the corresponding Mermin inequalities are constructed using quantum circuits on superconducting qubits. Measurements on different basis are included as additional final gates in the circuits. The experimental results obtained using the quantum computer show violation of all Mermin inequalitites, with a clear degradation of the results in the 5 qubit case. Though this quantum computer is not competitive to test Mermin inequalities as compared to other techniques when applied to few qubits, it does offer the opportunity to explore multipartite entanglement for four and five qubits beyond the reach of other alternative technologies.

Sudden transitions among optimal states and measurements are observed. Usefulness of measuring occupation levels is shown for all times of the evolution, together with the role of entanglement in the optimal scenario. For low values of magnetic field, memory effects stemming from the interaction with environment provide limited metrological advantage.

abstract: We investigate the emergent open dynamics of a quantum system that undergoes rapid repeated unitary interactions with a sequence of ancillary systems. We study in detail how decoherence appears as a subleading effect when a quantum system is 'bombarded' by a quick succession of ancillas. In the most general case, these ancillas are a) taken from an ensemble of quantum systems of different dimensions, b) prepared in different states, and c) interacting with the system through different Hamiltonians. We derive an upper bound on decoherence rates in this regime, and show how a rich variety of phenomena in open dynamics (such as projection, thermalization, purification, and dephasing) can emerge out of our general model of repeated interaction. Furthermore, we show a fundamental link between the strength of the leading order dissipation and the intrinsic "unpredictability" in the system-ancilla interaction. We also discuss how these results encompass and extend results obtained with other earlier models of repeated interaction.

abstract: We present new version of previously published Fortran and C programs for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interaction in one, two and three spatial dimensions in imaginary and real time, yielding both stationary and non-stationary solutions. To reduce the execution time on multicore processors, new versions of parallelized programs are developed using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) interface. The input in the previous versions of programs was the mathematical quantity nonlinearity for dimensionless form of Gross-Pitaevskii equation, whereas in the present programs the inputs are quantities of experimental interest, such as, number of atoms, scattering length, oscillator length for the trap, etc. New output files for some integrated one- and two-dimensional densities of experimental interest are given. We also present speedup test results for the new programs.

abstract: Loss-induced transmission in waveguides, and reversed pump dependence in lasers, are two prominent examples of counter-intuitive effects in non-Hermitian systems with patterned gain and loss. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of complex symmetric matrices when a system parameter is varied, we introduce a general theoretical condition for these two effects. We show that these effects arise in any irreducible system where the gain or loss is added to a subset of the elements of the system, without the need for parity-time symmetry or an exceptional point. This condition vastly expands the design space for observing these effects. We also show that a similarly broad class of systems exhibit a loss-induced narrowing of the density of states.

abstract: We present a simple general proof that Casimir force cannot originate from the vacuum energy of electromagnetic (EM) field. The full QED Hamiltonian consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term $H_{\rm em}$, the pure matter term $H_{\rm matt}$ and the interaction term $H_{\rm int}$. The $H_{\rm em}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, $H_{\rm em}$ cannot generate any forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The erroneous statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that $H_{\rm em}$ attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and the erroneous treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by $H_{\rm int}$.

abstract: We report on a method for measuring the branching ratios of dipole transitions of trapped atomic ions by performing nested sequences of population inversions. This scheme is broadly applicable and does not use ultrafast pulsed or narrow linewidth lasers. It is simple to perform and insensitive to experimental variables such as laser and magnetic field noise as well as ion heating. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we make the most accurate measurements thus far of the branching ratios of both 5P1/2 and 5P3/2 states in 88Sr+ with sub-1% uncertainties. We measure 17.175(27) for the branching ratio of 5P1/2-5S1/2, 15.845(71) for 5P3/2-5S1/2, and 0.05609(21) for 5P3/2-4D5/2, ten- fold and thirty-fold improvements in precision for 5P1/2 and 5P3/2 branching ratios respectively over the best previous experimental values.

abstract: Non-locality is a fundamental trait of quantum many-body systems, both at the level of pure states, as well as at the level of mixed states. Due to non-locality, mixed states of any two subsystems are correlated in a stronger way than what can be accounted for by considering correlated probabilities of occupying some microstates. In the case of equilibrium mixed states, we explicitly build two-point quantum correlation functions, which capture the specific, superior correlations of quantum systems at finite temperature, and which are directly { accessible to experiments when correlating measurable properties}. When non-vanishing, these correlation functions rule out a precise form of separability of the equilibrium state. In particular, we show numerically that quantum correlation functions generically exhibit a finite \emph{quantum coherence length}, dictating the characteristic distance over which degrees of freedom cannot be considered as separable. This coherence length is completely disconnected from the correlation length of the system -- as it remains finite even when the correlation length of the system diverges at finite temperature -- and it unveils the unique spatial structure of quantum correlations.
