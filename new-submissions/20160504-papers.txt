abstract: The ontology emerging from quantum field theory and the results following from Bell's theorems allowed the development of an intuitive picture of the microscopic world described by quantum mechanics, that is, we can say that we understand this theory. However there remain several aspects of it that are still mysterious and require more work on the foundations of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Randomness is both a useful way to model natural systems and a useful tool for engineered systems, e.g. in computation, communication and control. Fully random transformations require exponential time for either classical or quantum systems, but in many case pseudorandom operations can emulate certain properties of truly random ones. Indeed in the classical realm there is by now a well-developed theory of such pseudorandom operations. However the construction of such objects turns out to be much harder in the quantum case. Here we show that random quantum circuits are a powerful source of quantum pseudorandomness. This gives the for the first time a polynomialtime construction of quantum unitary designs, which can replace fully random operations in most applications, and shows that generic quantum dynamics cannot be distinguished from truly random processes. We discuss applications of our result to quantum information science, cryptography and to understanding self-equilibration of closed quantum dynamics.

abstract: We study the physical properties of double-cavity optomechanical system in which the mechanical resonator interacts with one of the coupled cavities and another cavity is used as an auxiliary cavity. The model can be expected to achieve the strong optomechanical coupling strength and overcome the optomechanical cavity decay, simultaneously. Through the coherent auxiliary cavity interferences, the steady-state squeezing of mechanical resonator can be generated in highly unresolved sideband regime. The validity of the scheme is assessed by numerical simulation and theoretical analysis of the steady-state variance of the mechanical displacement quadrature. The scheme provides a platform for the mechanical squeezing beyond the resolved sideband limit and addresses the restricted experimental bounds at present.

abstract: The difficulty that the probability infinitely increases with time in time-dependent perturbation theory for a quantum system is resolved by means of a method similar to the Poincare-Lindstedt method dealing with the secular terms in weakly nonlinear problems. The absurd increase is due to improper treatments of the small renormalization of the frequencies, but in a nonuniform manner. An alternative formulation of theory for quantum systems is presented. Three exactly solvable models are used to check this formulation, and excellent agreements are achieved.

abstract: We construct the photon added coherent states of a noncommutative harmonic oscillator associated to a $q$-deformed oscillator algebra. Various nonclassical properties of the corresponding system are explored, first, by studying two different types of higher order quadrature squeezing, namely the Hillery-type and the Hong--Mandel-type and, second, by testing the sub-Poissonian nature of photon statistics in higher order with the help of the correlation function and the Mandel parameter. By comparing our results with those of the usual harmonic oscillator, we notice that the quadratures and photon number distributions in noncommutative case are more squeezed for the same values of the parameters and, thus, the photon added coherent states of noncommutative harmonic oscillator may be more nonclassical in comparison to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize the cooling of mechanical resonator by exposing the optomechanical system in non-Markovian environment. Because of the the back-flow from the engineering environment, the mean number of the mechanical oscillator is capable of breaking the conventional cooling limit of Markovian environment. The detail analysis reveals that the non-Markovian memory effect do benifit the cooling process. Based on recent experiment, we show that the cooling process is highly effective by engineering non-Markovian environment. Our study provides new method for the ground state cooling of mechanical oscillator.

abstract: With the advent of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), PUF-based quantum authentication systems (QAS) have been proposed for security purposes and recently proof-of-principle experiment has been demonstrated. As a further step towards completing the security analysis, we investigate quantum cloning attacks against PUF-based quantum authentication systems and prove that quantum cloning attacks outperform the so-called challenge-estimation attacks. We present the analytical expression of the false accept probability by use of the corresponding optimal quantum cloning machines and extend the previous results in the literature. In light of these findings, an explicit comparison is made between PUF-based quantum authentication systems and quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols in the context of cloning attacks. Moreover, from an experimental perspective, a trade-off between the average photon number and the detection efficiency is discussed in detail.

abstract: We formulate the Frobenius-norm-based measures for quantum coherence and asymmetry respectively. In contrast to the resource theory of coherence and asymmetry, we construct a natural measure of quantum coherence inspired from optical coherence theory while the group theoretical approach is employed to quantify the asymmetry of quantum states. Besides their simple structures and explicit physical meanings, we observe that these quantities are intimately related to the purity (or linear entropy) of the corresponding quantum states. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the proposed coherence quantifier is not only a measure of mixedness, but also an intrinsic (basis-independent) quantification of quantum coherence contained in quantum states, which can also be viewed as a normalized version of Brukner-Zeilinger invariant information. In our context, the asymmetry of N-qubit quantum systems is considered under local independent and collective SU(2) transformations. Intriguingly, it is illustrated that the collective effect has a significant impact on the asymmetry measure, and quantum correlation between subsystems plays a non-negligible role in this circumstance.

abstract: We theoretically investigate quantum interference of two single photons at a lossy asymmetric beam splitter, the most general passive 2$\times$2 optical circuit. The losses in the circuit result in a non-unitary scattering matrix with a non-trivial set of constraints on the elements of the scattering matrix. Our analysis using the noise operator formalism shows that the loss allows tunability of quantum interference to an extent not possible with a lossless beam splitter. Our theoretical studies support the experimental demonstrations of programmable quantum interference in highly multimodal systems such as opaque scattering media and multimode fibers.

abstract: We present a formulation of quantum circuits where the focus is set on whether a given circuit (made of unitary operators and projective measurements with definite outcomes) does reflect an actually realizable physical experiment. In order to do this, we introduce verifications statements which are purely epistemic assertions indicating whether a outcome is possible at some point and develop our formalism which, in the end, consists in a set of logical rules about verification statements. Finally, we argue that our formalism provides a Lorentz-invariant realistic formulation of quantum circuits and illustrate this by considering a circuit corresponding to Hardy's paradox and showing how our formalism prevents making contradictory assertions regarding our knowledge about the circuit.

abstract: Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations, stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and quantum correlations in composite states. We focus on various approaches to define and quantify general quantum correlations, based on different yet interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks fit to play a key role.

authors: Janos Polonyi
comments: 43 pages, 8 figures

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.00834
abstract: To study the phenomenon of decoherence the effective Lagrangian of a test particle interacting with an ideal gas is derived in the leading order of the perturbation expansion and in order $\ord{\partial^2_t}$. Two concepts of decoherence are distinguished and investigated in details: The general dynamical decoherence and the stationary decoherence, an approximation of the dynamical phenomenon corresponding to the assumption of a static test particle trajectory. Comparison of the stationary decoherence described by the present effective theory with the traditional description of decoherence based on collision theory reveals a qualitative similarity within their domain of applicability. However, the effective theory predicts comparable time scales for decoherence and dissipation in contrast to the deviation of this scales by many orders of magnitudes, estimated by referring to the collision approach. In particular the extremely fast decoherence predicted by the collisional approach can only be reproduced by the effective theory for parameter values which violate the applicability of both approaches. On the other hand, in harmonic systems, the true dynamical decoherence is indeed an extremely fast process involving a double exponential time dependence. It is argued that, in realistic systems, the dissipative effective dynamics is non-perturbative in nature and its asymptotic, relaxed state incorporates strong quantum fluctuations.

abstract: The action reaction principle is violated in the standard formulation of Quantum Mechanics, so that its phase space is incomplete. Moreover, projection of state of a quantum system under indirect measurement, when there are alternative virtual paths and one of them is discarded by negative detection implies, according to the action reaction principle, a reaction on the detector, although its macroscopic state does not change. If all interactions are local, mediated by fields with relativistically causal evolution, some system, different from the particle which follows another path, must locally interact with the detector. Relativistic locality and the action reaction principle predict the existence of de Broglie fields. A formulation of Quantum Mechanics in extended Hilbert spaces is presented, in which kinematic and dynamical representations of physical magnitudes are distinguished.

Here, we consider two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state as a purification of the thermal state, and construct a general formalism of the Gaussian purification process, and also introduce another Gaussian maximally entangled states via the process. Our purified states of Gaussian maximally mixed states have all Gaussian profiles, thus the states are all having maximal quantum entanglement.

abstract: Laser noise is a decisive limiting factor in high precision spectroscopy of narrow lines using atomic ensembles. In an idealized Doppler and differential light shift free magic wavelength lattice configuration, it remains as one distinct principle limitation beyond collective atomic decay. In this work we study the limitations originating from laser phase and amplitude noise in an idealized Ramsey pulse interrogation scheme. Phase noise leads to a saturation of the frequency sensitivity with increasing atom number while amplitude noise implies a scaling of $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ with the measurement time. We propose a transformation that can restore the scaling with the square root of the inverse particle number $1/\sqrt{N}$. Similar results and improvements are obtained numerically for a Rabi spectroscopy setup.

Measurement back-action quenches the system dynamics at all times and we show that the ensuing transient evolution is more sensitive to system parameters than the steady state of the system. The parameter sensitivity can be quantified by the Fisher information, and we investigate numerically and analytically how the temporal noise correlations in the measurement signal contribute to the ultimate sensitivity limit of homodyne detection.

abstract: In the presence of a complex classical dynamics associated with a mixed phase space, a quantum wave function can tunnel between two stable islands through the chaotic sea, an effect that has no classical counterpart. This phenomenon, referred to as chaos assisted tunneling, is characterized by large fluctuations of the tunneling rate when a parameter is varied. To date the full extent of this effect as well as the associated statistical distribution have never been observed in a quantum system. Here we analyze the possibility of characterizing these effects accurately in a cold atom experiment. Using realistic values of the parameters of an experimental setup, we examine through analytical estimates and extensive numerical simulations a specific system that can be implemented with cold atoms, the atomic modulated pendulum. We assess the efficiency of three possible routes to observe in detail chaos assisted tunneling properties. Our main conclusion is that due to the fragility of the symmetry between positive and negative momenta as a function of quasimomentum, it is very challenging to use tunneling between classical islands centered on fixed points with opposite momentum. We show that it is more promising to use islands symmetric in position space, and characterize the regime where it could be done. The proposed experiment could be realized with current state-of-the-art technology.

abstract: We describe an experimentally feasible protocol for performing a variant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment with massive objects. In this scheme, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond driven by microwave fields is dispersively coupled to a massive mechanical resonator. A double-pulse Ramsey interferometer can be implemented with the spin-mechanical setup, where the second Ramsey microwave pulse drives the spin conditioned on the number states of the resonator. The probability for finding the NV center in definite spin states exhibits interference fringes when the mechanical resonator is prepared in a specific number state. On the other hand, the interference is destroyed if the mechanical resonator stays in some other number states. The wavelike and particlelike behavior of the NV spin can be superposed by preparing the mechanical resonator in a superposition of two distinct number states. Thus a quantum version of Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment is implemented, allowing of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with massive objects.

abstract: Quantum state teleportation of optical number states is conspicuously absent from the list of experimental milestones achieved to date. Here we demonstrate analytically a teleportation scheme with fidelity $100\%$ for optical number states of arbitrary dimension using linear optical elements only. To this end, we develop an EPR source to supply Bell-type states for the teleportation, and show how the same set-up can also be used as a Bell-state analyser (BSA) when implemented in a time-reversal manner. These two aspects are then brought together to complete the teleportation protocol in a scheme that can deliver perfect fidelity, albeit with an efficiency that decays exponentially as the occupation of the number states increases stepwise. The EPR source and BSA schemes both consist of two optical axes in a symmetrical V-shape experimental layout, along which beam-splitters are placed cross-beam fashion at regular intervals, with their transmittivities treated as variables for which the values are calculated ad hoc. In particular, we show the full treatment for the case of qutrit teleportation, and calculate the transmittivity values of the beam splitters required for teleporting qubits, qutrits, qupentits, quheptits and qunits. The general case for arbitrary-dimensional number state teleportation is demonstrated through a counting argument.

abstract: Quantum computers are hypothetical devices, based on quantum physics, that would enable us to perform certain computations hundreds of orders of magnitude faster than digital computers. This feature is coined as "quantum supremacy" and one aspect or another of such quantum computational supremacy might be brought about in experiments in the near future: by implementing quantum error-correction, systems of non-interacting bosons, exotic new phases of matter called anyons, quantum annealing, or in various other ways. A main concern regarding the feasibility of quantum computers is that quantum systems are inherently noisy: we cannot accurately control them, and we cannot accurately describe them. We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum noise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that wouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses. Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as explained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of noise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small scale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum evolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational power. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior of noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow reaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy, making them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel implicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on the behavior of noisy quantum systems.

abstract: We consider an analytical approach that involves the complex poles of the propagator to investigate the effect due to the lack of time reversal invariance on the time evolution of decay for purely absorptive potentials. We find that the choice of the initial state may change the exponential decaying regime into a nonexponential oscillatory behavior at time scales of the order of a lifetime of the system. We illustrate this effect for a spectral singularity corresponding to a purely imaginary delta-shell potential.

abstract: In this paper it is studied the influence of a minimal thermal environment on the dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator (labelled A), prepared in a coherent state. The environment itself consists of a second oscillator (labelled B), initially in a thermal state. Two types of interaction Hamiltonians are considered, and the time-evolution of the reduced density operator of oscillator A is compared to the one obtained from the usual master equation approach, i.e., assuming that oscillator A is coupled to a large reservoir. An analysis of the linear entropy evolution of oscillator A shows that simplified models may be able to describe important features related to the phenomenon of decoherence, such as the rapid growth of the linear entropy, as well as its dependence on the effective temperature of the environment.

abstract: Invariant Set Theory (IST) is a realistic, locally causal theory of fundamental physics which assumes a much stronger synergy between cosmology and quantum physics than exists in contemporary theory. In IST the (quasi-cyclic) universe $U$ is treated as a deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $I_U$ of its state space. In this approach, the geometry of $I_U$, and not a set of differential evolution equations in space-time $\mathcal M_U$, provides the most primitive description of the laws of physics. As such, IST is non-classical. The geometry of $I_U$ is based on Cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic to the algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. In IST, the non-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from number theory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\phi$ and $\cos \phi$. The complex Hilbert Space and the relativistic Dirac Equation respectively are shown to describe $I_U$, and evolution on $I_U$, in the singular limit of IST at $p=\infty$; particle properties such as de Broglie relationships arise from the helical geometry of trajectories on $I_U$ in the neighbourhood of $\mathcal M_U$. With the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $I_U$, certain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to the more traditional Euclidean metric, take points away from $I_U$ and are therefore unphysically large. This allows (the $\psi$-epistemic) IST to evade the Bell and Pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. In IST, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining the pseudo-Riemannian metric of $\mathcal M_U$ with the p-adic metric of $I_U$. A generalisation of the field equations of general relativity which can achieve this is proposed.

abstract: We construct a new model of two-dimensional quantum spin systems that combines both symmetry-protected and intrinsic topological orders. It is referred as the bilayer Doubled Semion model (bDS) and is an instance of symmetry-enriched topological order. The model provides an explicit solution to the problem of combining symmetry-protected topological phases present in the Doubled Semion model with those in the Kitaev model. A bilayer lattice is introduced to this purpose, which allows us to combine a global spin-flip symmetry with a global spin-flavor symmetry. The bDS model exhibits non-trival braiding self-statistics of excitations and novel edge states protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ global symmetry. This construction makes compatible the methods of topological charge-fractionalization based on dualities and on string-flux mechanisms.

abstract: We investigate the logarithmic negativity in strongly-disordered spin chains in the random-singlet phase. We focus on the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain and the random XX chain. We find that for two arbitrary intervals the disorder-averaged negativity and the mutual information are proportional to the number of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent intervals grows logarithmically with the intervals length. In particular, the scaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different prefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal simple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function of the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in contrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our predictions using a numerical implementation of the SDRG method. Finally, we also implement DMRG simulations for the negativity in open spin chains. The chains accessible in the presence of strong disorder are not sufficiently long to provide a reliable confirmation of the SDRG results.

abstract: The mesoscopic characteristics of a quantum dot (QD), which make the dipole approximation (DA) break down, provide a new dimension to manipulate light-matter interaction [M. L. Andersen et al., Nat. Phys. 7, 215 (2011)]. Here we investigate the power spectrum and the second-order correlation property of the fluorescence from a resonantly driven QD placed on a planar metal. It is revealed that due to the pronounced QD spatial extension and the dramatic variation of the triggered surface plasmon near the metal, the fluorescence has a notable contribution from the quadrupole moment. The {\pi}-rotation symmetry of the fluorescence to the QD orientation under the DA is broken. By manipulating the QD orientation and quadrupole moment, the spectrum can be switched between the Mollow triplet and a single peak, and the fluorescence characterized by the antibunching in the second-order correlation function can be changed from the weak to the strong radiation regime. Our result is instructive for utilizing the unique mesoscopic effects to develop nanophotonic devices.

abstract: We evaluate the difference between the Casimir free energies corresponding to either grounded or isolated perfect conductors, at high temperatures. We show that a general and simple expression for that difference can be given, in terms of the electrostatic capacitance matrix for the system of conductors. For the case of close conductors, we provide approximate expressions for that difference, by evaluating the capacitance matrix using the proximity force approximation. Since the high-temperature limit for the Casimir free energy for a medium described by a frequency-dependent conductivity diverging at zero frequency coincides with that of an isolated conductor, our results may shed light on the corrections to the Casimir force in the presence of real materials.

abstract: When an impurity is immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, impurity-boson interactions are expected to dress the impurity into a quasiparticle, the Bose polaron. We superimpose an ultracold atomic gas of $^{87}$Rb with a much lower density gas of fermionic $^{40}$K impurities. Through the use of a Feshbach resonance and RF spectroscopy, we characterize the energy, spectral width and lifetime of the resultant polaron on both the attractive and the repulsive branches in the strongly interacting regime. The width of the polaron in the attractive branch is narrow compared to its binding energy, even as the two-body scattering length formally diverges.

abstract: We investigate spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid of a one-dimensional spin-1 Bose gas in a harmonic trap.\ In this regime highly degenerate spin configurations emerge since the spin exchange energy is much less than the thermal energy of the system, while the temperature is low enough that the lowest energetic orbitals are occupied.\ As an example we numerically study the momentum distribution of a one-dimensional spin-1 Bose gas in Tonks-Girardeau gas limit and in the sector of zero magnetization.\ We find that the momentum distributions broaden as the number of atoms increase due to the averaging of spin function weightings.\ Large momentum ($p$) asymptotic is analytically derived, showing the universal $1/p^4$ dependence.\ We demonstrate that the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid has a momentum distribution also distinct from spinless bosons at finite temperature.

abstract: We discuss an open-system analogue of a topological Thouless pump in the steady state of a one-dimensional spin lattice driven by Markovian reservoirs. Periodic variations in a two-dimensional parameter space are shown to lead to quantized transport through the lattice. On an extremal path in parameter space the steady state is pure state and coincides with the ground state of the Rice-Mele Hamiltonian for fermions at half filling. Here the quantized transport can be associated with a topological invariant based on geometric phases, the Chern number. On a more general path, where the steady state is mixed, we introduce the winding of the many-body polarization as a generalized topological invariant. We show that it applies to open quantum systems and includes the effects of interactions and moderate particle-number fluctuations. The winding of polarization, which characterizes the Thouless pump is robust against Hamiltonian perturbations as well as dephasing and particle losses.

abstract: We present a method to describe driven-dissipative multi-mode systems by considering a truncated hierarchy of equations for the correlation functions. We consider two hierarchy truncation schemes with a global cutoff on the correlation order, which is the sum of the exponents of the operators involved in the correlation functions: a 'hard' cutoff corresponding to an expansion around the vacuum, which applies to a regime where the number of excitations per site is small; a 'soft' cutoff which corresponds to an expansion around coherent states, which can be applied for large excitation numbers per site. This approach is applied to describe the bunching-antibunching transition in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model for photonic systems. The results have been successfully benchmarked by comparison with calculations based on the corner-space renormalization method in 1D and 2D systems. The regime of validity and strengths of the present truncation methods are critically discussed.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the effect of different pigment-protein couplings and the role of quantum interference among different energy transfer channels in excitation energy transfer (EET) in FMO complex. We employ the non-Markovian master equation that allows the use of different values of pigment-protein couplings and cut-off frequencies for different BChla sites, in the adiabatic limit of electron transfer in FMO complex. Several pathways of EET are identified and investigated using a realistic set of pigment-pigment couplings and the site energy of each BChla site. We analyze that it is the destructive interference between different channels of a particular pathway that is responsible for the time-scales of oscillations of excitation energy as observed in the recent experiments.

abstract: The existence of anyons, \textit{i.e.} quantum states with an arbitrary spin, is a generic feature of standard quantum mechanics in $(2+1)-$dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Here it is shown that relativistic anyons may exist also in quantum theories where a minimal length is present. The interplay between minimal length and arbitrary spin effects are discussed.

abstract: We investigate the quantum melting of one dimensional crystals that are realized in an atomic lattice in which ground state atoms are laser excited to two Rydberg states. We focus on a regime where both, intra- and inter-state density-density interactions as well as coherent exchange interactions contribute. We determine stable crystalline phases in the classical limit and explore their melting under quantum fluctuations introduced by the excitation laser as well as two-body exchange. We find that quantum fluctuations introduced by the laser give rise to a devil's staircase structure which one might associate with transitions in the classical limit. The melting through exchange interactions is shown to also proceed in a step-like fashion, in case of mesoscopic crystals, due to the proliferation of Rydberg spinwaves.
