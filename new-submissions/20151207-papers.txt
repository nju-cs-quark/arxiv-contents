abstract: General analytical solutions of the Quantum Hamilton Jacobi Equation for conservative one-dimensional or reducible motion are presented and discussed. The quantum Hamilton's characteristic function and its derivative, i.e. the quantum momentum function, are obtained in general, and it is shown that any one-dimensional wave function can be exactly represented in a WKB-like form. The formalism is applied to the harmonic oscillator and to the electron's motion in the hydrogen atom, and the above mentioned functions are computed and discussed for different quantum numbers. It is analyzed how the quantum quantities investigated tend to the corresponding classical ones, in the limit $\hbar\to 0$. These results demonstrate that the Quantum Hamilton Jacobi Equation is not only completely equivalent to the Schr\"odinger Equation, but allows also to fully investigate the transition from quantum to classical mechanics.

title: Dissipation enabled efficient excitation transfer from a single photon to a single quantum emitter

abstract: We propose a scheme for triggering a dissipation dominated highly efficient excitation transfer from a single photon wave packet to a single quantum emitter. This single photon induced optical pumping turns dominant dissipative processes, such as spontaneous photon emission by the emitter or cavity decay, into valuable tools for quantum information processing and quantum communication. It works for an arbitrarily shaped single photon wave packet with sufficiently small bandwidth provided a matching condition is satisfied which balances the dissipative rates involved. Our scheme does not require additional laser pulses or quantum feedback and is not restricted to highly mode selective cavity quantum electrodynamical architectures. In particular, it can be used to enhance significantly the coupling of a single photon to a single quantum emitter implanted in a one dimensional waveguide or even in a free space scenario. We demonstrate the usefulness of our scheme for building a deterministic quantum memory and a deterministic frequency converter between photonic qubits of different wavelengths.

abstract: We demonstrate that a phase-insensitive parametric amplifier, coupled to a quantum correlated source, can be used as a quantum information tap for noiseless three-way signal splitting. We find that the output signals are amplified noiselessly in two of the three output ports while the other can more or less keep its original input size without adding noise. This scheme is able to cascade and scales up for efficient information distribution in an optical network. Furthermore, we find this scheme satisfies the criteria for a non-ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and thus can serve as a QND measurement device. With two readouts correlated to the input, we find this scheme also satisfies the criterion for sequential QND measurement.

abstract: A recent experiment yielding results in agreement with quantum theory and violating Bell inequalities was interpreted [Nature 526 (29 Octobert 2015) p. 682 and p. 649] as ruling out any local realistic theory of nature. But quantum theory itself is both local and realistic when properly interpreted using a quantum Hilbert space rather than the classical hidden variables used to derive Bell inequalities. There is no spooky action at a distance in the real world we live in if it is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Violation of a Bell inequality guarantees the existence of quantum correlations in a quantum state. A pure bipartite quantum state, having nonvanishing quantum correlation, always violates a Bell inequality. Such correspondence is absent for multipartite pure quantum states. For a shared multipartite quantum state, we establish a connection between the monogamy of Bell inequality violation and genuine multi-site entanglement as well as monogamy-based multiparty quantum correlation measures. We find that generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and another single-parameter family states which we refer to as the "special Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger" states have the status of extremal states in such relations.

abstract: The present paper is the first of two articles aimed at constructing $n$-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems by an algebraic approach. In molecular spectroscopy, the construction of vibrational Hamiltonian for strongly excited molecular systems by using an algebraic formalism requires the introduction by hand the operators describing the change in energy by numerous quanta and it is tedious to predict in advance the total number of operators appearing in the development. The goal of the two articles is not only to propose in the local limit a systematic method for constructing a normalized vibrational Hamiltonian for a strongly excited $n$-degree-of-freedom molecular system from the generators of the Lie algebra, the algebra of polynomial invariants, but also to enumerate the number of independent operators needed for the construction of the Hamiltonian developed in the base of these generators up to the given order $N$. The first article introduces the theoretical tools used in the both papers (section \ref{norm}), and presents the method of construction in case of absence of resonance (section \ref{const}). Finally, an application for a triatomic non-linear ClOH molecule is considered in case close to the dissociation limit. (section \ref{Appli}).

abstract: In this paper, we show that it is possible to measure the phase shift between two pathways of light with an accuracy above the standard quantum limit without using entanglement. To illustrate this, we propose a quantum-enhanced metrology scheme based on a laser-driven optical cavity inside an instantaneous quantum feedback loop. The purpose of the feedback laser is to provide a reference frame and to enhance the dependence of the dynamics of the system on the measured phase. Since our scheme does not require highly-efficient single photon detectors, it is of practical interest until technologies for the generation of highly-entangled many-photon states become more readily available.

abstract: Measuring the state of a quantum system is a fundamental process in quantum mechanics and plays an essential role in quantum information and quantum technologies. One method to measure a quantum observable is to sort the system in different spatial modes according to the measured value, followed by single-particle detectors on each mode. Examples of quantum sorters are polarizing beam-splitters (PBS) -- which direct photons according to their polarization -- and Stern-Gerlach devices. Here we propose a general scheme to sort a quantum system according to the value of any $d$-dimensional degree of freedom, such as spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM), wavelength etc. Our scheme is universal, works at single-particle level and has a theoretical efficiency of 100%. As an application we design an efficient OAM sorter consisting of a single multi-path interferometer which is suitable for a photonic chip implementation.

abstract: Following the membrane paradigm, we explore the effect of the gravitational $\Theta$-term on the behavior of the stretched horizon of a black hole in (3+1)-dimensions. We reformulate the membrane paradigm from a quantum path-integral point of view where we interpret the macroscopic properties of the horizon as effects of integrating out the region inside the horizon. The gravitational $\Theta$-term is a total derivative, however, using our framework we show that this term affects the transport properties of the horizon. In particular, the horizon acquires a third order parity violating, dimensionless transport coefficient which affects the way localized perturbations scramble on the horizon. Then we consider a large-N gauge theory in (2+1)-dimensions which is dual to an asymptotically AdS background in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime to show that the $\Theta$-term induces a non-trivial contact term in the energy-momentum tensor of the dual theory. As a consequence, the dual gauge theory in the presence of the $\Theta$-term acquires the same third order parity violating transport coefficient.

abstract: A strongly driven quantum system, coupled to a thermalizing bath, generically evolves into a highly non-thermal state as the external drive competes with the equilibrating force of the bath. We demonstrate a notable exception to this picture for a microwave resonator interacting with a periodically driven double quantum dot (DQD). In the limit of strong driving and long times, we show that the resonator field can be driven into a thermal state with a chemical potential given by a harmonic of the drive frequency. Such tunable chemical potentials are achievable with current devices and would have broad utility for quantum simulation in circuit quantum electrodynamics. As an example, we show how several DQDs embedded in an array of microwave resonators can induce a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate of light.

abstract: We model and simulate the performance of charge-transfer in nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the CP29 light-harvesting antenna-complex associated with photosystem II (PSII). The model consists of five discrete excitonic energy states and two sinks, responsible for the potentially damaging processes and charge-transfer channels, respectively. We demonstrate that by varying (i) the parameters of the chlorophyll-based dimer, (ii) the resonant properties of the protein-solvent environment interaction, and (iii) the energy transfer rates to the sinks, one can significantly improve the performance of the NPQ. Our analysis suggests strategies for improving the performance of the NPQ in response to environmental changes, and may stimulate experimental verification.

abstract: Charged spinor matter field is quantized in a spatial region bounded by two parallel neutral plates. The most general set of boundary conditions ensuring the confinement of matter within the plates is considered. We study a response of the vacuum of the confined matter to the background uniform magnetic field which is directed orthogonally to the plates. It is proven that, in the case of a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the vacuum pressure onto the plates is positive and independent of the boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the plates.

abstract: In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the spontaneous generation of singularities in continue and finite wave functions, is a well understood phenomenon also occurring for free particles. We use the familiar analogy between the two-dimensional Schroedinger equation and the optical paraxial wave equation to show that even weakly-focused collimated light beams may develop a spatial singularity during free-space propagation. We find that according to the shape of the field, its amplitude may be either finite or infinite at the singular point.

abstract: The authors report on the design and measurement of a reflective single-pole single-throw microwave switch with no internal power dissipation, based on a superconducting circuit containing a single Josephson junction. The data demonstrate the switch operation with 2 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 10 GHz, low insertion loss, and better than 20 dB on/off ratio. The switch's measured performance agrees well with simulations for input powers up to -100 dBm. An extension of the demonstrated circuit to implement a single-pole double-throw switch is shown in simulation.
