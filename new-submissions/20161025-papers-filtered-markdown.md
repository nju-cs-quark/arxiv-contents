**1.    Steady cat state generation for nuclear spins through electric quadrupole interaction**

<blockquote>
<p>
Cat codes are one of the promising encoding schemes for quantum information that enables hardware-efficient error correction. So far, only photonic cat states produced by superconducting circuits have been under consideration. Their realization within coherent spin states (CSS) can pave the way toward nuclear magnetic resonance-based implementations of this new class of codes. Here, we show how the crucial superpositions of CSS can be generated for the nuclear spins. This is through the intrinsic electric quadrupole interaction involving a critical role by the biaxiality term that is readily available, as in strained heterostructures of semiconductors, or defect centers having nearby quadrupolar spins. The persistence of the cat states is achieved using a rotation pulse so as to harness the underlying fixed points of the classical Hamiltonian. We classify the two distinct types as polar- and equator-bound over the Bloch sphere with respect to principal axes, both of which are, so-called mod~2 cat states. Their optimal performance as well as sensitivity under numerous parameter deviations are analyzed. Finally, we show that a higher level, mod 4 cat state, with one of the legs rotating can also be produced along the same spirit using three pulses.

**2.    Efficient quantum circuits for continuous-time quantum walks on composite graphs**  
T. Loke, J. B. Wang  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.07107  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we investigate the simulation of continuous-time quantum walks on specific classes of graphs, for which it is possible to fast-forward the time-evolution operator to achieve constant-time simulation complexity and to perform the simulation exactly, while maintaining $\mbox{poly}(\mbox{log}(n))$ efficiency. In particular, we discuss two classes of composite graphs, commuting graphs and Cartesian product of graphs, that contain classes of graphs which can be simulated in this fashion. This allows us to identify new families of graphs that we can efficiently simulate in a quantum circuit framework, providing practical and explicit means to explore quantum-walk based algorithms in laboratories.

**3.    Mesoscopic fluctuations in biharmonically driven flux qubits**  
Alejandro Ferrón, Daniel Domínguez, María José Sánchez  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.07502  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate flux qubits driven by a biharmonic magnetic signal, with a phase lag that acts as an effective time reversal broken parameter. The driving induced transition rate between the ground and the excited state of the flux qubit can be thought as an effective transmitance, profiting from a direct analogy between interference effects at avoided level crossings and scattering events in disordered electronic systems. For time scales prior to full relaxation but large compared to the decoherence time, this characteristic rate has been accessed experimentally and its sensitivity with both the phase lag and the dc flux detuning explored. In this way signatures of Universal Conductance Fluctuations-like effects have recently been analized in flux qubits and compared with a phenomenological model that only accounts for decoherence, as a classical noise. We here solve the full dynamics of the driven flux qubit in contact with a quantum bath employing the Floquet Markov Master equation. Within this formalism relaxation and decoherence rates result strongly dependent on both the phase lag and the dc flux detuning. Consequently, the associated pattern of fluctuations in the characteristic rates display important differences with those obtained within the mentioned phenomenological model. In particular we demonstrate the Weak Localization-like effect in the averages values of the relaxation rate. Our predictions can be tested for accessible, but longer time scales than the current experimental times.
