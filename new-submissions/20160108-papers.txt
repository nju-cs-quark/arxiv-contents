abstract: We rigorously establish an Arrhenius law for the mixing time of quantum doubles based on any Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_d$. We have made the concept of the energy barrier therein mathematically well-defined, it is related to the minimum energy cost the environment has to provide to the system in order to produce a generalized Pauli error, maximized for any generalized Pauli errors, not only logical operators. We evaluate this generalized energy barrier in Abelian quantum double models and find it to be a constant independent of system size. Thus, we rule out the possibility of entropic protection for this broad group of models.

abstract: We report on experimentally observed addition, subtraction and cancellation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the process of parametric four-wave mixing that results in frequency up- and down-converted emission in Rb vapour. Specific features of OAM transfer from resonant laser fields with different optical topological charges to the spatially and temporally coherent blue light have been considered. We have observed the conservation of OAM in nonlinear wave mixing in a wide range of experimental conditions including a non-collinear geometry of the applied laser beams and furthermore that the coherent blue light accumulates the total orbital angular momentum of the applied laser light. Spectral and power dependences of vortex and plane wave front blue light beams have been compared.

abstract: One of the very first applications of the quantum field theoretic vacuum state was in the development of the notion of Casimir energy. Now field theoretic Casimir energies, considered individually, are always infinite. But differences in Casimir energies are quite often finite --- a fortunate circumstance which luckily made some of the early calculations, (for instance, for parallel plates and hollow spheres), tolerably tractable. We shall explore the extent to which this observation can be systematised. For instance: What are necessary and sufficient conditions for Casimir energy differences to be finite? When the Casimir energy differences are not finite, can anything useful be said? We shall see that it is the difference in the first few Seeley-DeWitt coefficients that is central to answering these questions. In particular, for any collection of conductors (perfect or imperfect) and/or dielectrics, as long as one merely moves them around without changing shape or volume, then the Casimir energy difference (and so the Casimir forces) are guaranteed finite.

abstract: Squeezed state of light is one of the important subjects in quantum optics which is generated by optical nonlinear interactions. In this paper, we especially focus on qubit like entangled squeezed states (ESS's) generated by beam splitters, phase-shifter and cross Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover the Wigner function of two-mode qubit and qutrit like ESS are investigated. We will show that the distances of peaks of Wigner functions for two-mode ESS are entanglement sensitive and can be a witness for entanglement. Unlike the qubit cases, it is shown that there are qutrit like ESS violating monogamy inequality. These trends are compared with those obtained for qubit and qutrit like entangled coherent state (ECS).

abstract: We provide several examples and an intuitive diagrammatic representation demonstrating the use of two-qubit unitary transformations for mapping coupled spin Hamiltonians to simpler ones and vice versa. The corresponding dualities may be exploited to identify phase transition points or to aid the diagonalization of such Hamiltonians. For example, our method shows that a suitable one-parameter family of coupled Hamiltonians whose ground states transform from an initially factorizing state to a final cluster state on a lattice of arbitrary dimension is dual to a family of trivial decoupled Hamiltonians containing local on-site terms only. As a consequence, the minimum enery gap (which determines the adiabatic run-time) does not scale with system size, which facilitates an efficient and simple adiabatic preparation of e.g. the two-dimensional cluster state used for measurement-based quantum computation.

abstract: With the purpose to devise a novel lasing scheme, we consider a two level system with both a transversal and longitudinal coupling to the electromagnetic field. If the longitudinal coupling is sufficiently strong, multi-photon transitions become possible. We assume furthermore that the electromagnetic environment has a spectrum with a single sharp resonance, which serves as a lasing cavity. Additionally, the electromagnetic environment should have a very broad resonance around a frequency which differs form the sharp resonance. We use the polaron transformation and derive a rate equation to describe the dynamics of such system. We find that lasing at the frequency of the sharp mode is possible, if the energy difference of the atomic transition is similar to the sum of the frequencies of both peaks in the spectral function. This allows for the creation of lasing over a large frequency range and may in perspective enable THz lasing at room temperature.

abstract: A theoretical investigation on slow light propagation based on eletromagnetically induced transparency in a three-level quantum-dot system is performed including non-Markovian effects and correlated dephasing reservoirs. It is demonstraonated that the non-Markovian nature of the process is quite essential even for conventional dephasing typical of quantum dots leading to significant enhancement or inhibition of the group velocity slow-down factor as well as to the shifting and distortion of the transmission window. Furthermore, the correlation between dephasing reservoirs may also either enhance or inhibit non-Markovian effects.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous emission of a two-level atom with an arbitrarily polarized electric dipole in front of a flat dielectric surface. We treat the general case where the atomic dipole matrix element is a complex vector, that is, the atomic dipole can rotate with time in space. We calculate the rates of spontaneous emission into evanescent and radiation modes, and study the angular densities of the rates in the space of wave vectors for the field modes. We show that, when the ellipticity of the atomic dipole is not zero, the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate of the atom may have different values for the modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors. We find that the asymmetry of the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate under the central inversion in the space of in-plane wave vectors is a result of spin-orbit coupling of light and occurs when the ellipticity vector of the atomic dipole overlaps with the ellipticity vector of the field polarization. Due to the fast decay of the field in the evanescent modes, the difference between the rates of spontaneous emission into the evanescent modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. Due to the oscillatory behavior of the interference between the emitted and reflected fields, the difference between the rates of spontaneous emission into the radiation modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors oscillates with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. This difference can be positive or negative depending on the atom-interface distance, and is zero for the zero distance.

abstract: The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum information, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental implementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the theory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a level of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified without direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is solely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of verification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In this paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct access to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing via EPR steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between full state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies EPR steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what advantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do partial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally entangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR steering allows for simpler analysis and better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the other hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to constants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main advantage in self-testing based on EPR steering could be in the case of self-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum system.

abstract: We question the microcanonical hypothesis, often made to account for the thermalization of complex closed quantum systems, on the specific example of a chain of two-level atoms optically driven by a resonant laser beam and strongly interacting via Rydberg-Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions. Along its (necessarily unitary) evolution, this system is indeed expected to thermalize, i.e. observables, such as the number of excitations, stop oscillating and reach equilibrium-like expectation values. The latter are often calculated through assuming the system can be effectively described by a thermal-like microcanonical state. Here, we compare the distribution of excitations in the chain calculated either according to the microcanonical assumption or through direct exact numerical simulation. This allows us to show the limitations of the thermal equilibrium hypothesis and precise its applicability conditions.

abstract: The question whether a given quantum state is a ground or thermal state of a few-body Hamiltonian can be used to characterize the complexity of the state and is important for possible experimental implementations. We provide methods to characterize the states generated by two- and, more generally, k-body Hamiltonians as well as the convex hull of these sets. This leads to new insights into the question which states are uniquely determined by their marginals and to a generalization of the concept of entanglement. Finally, certification methods for quantum simulation can be derived.

abstract: We present a novel proposal for generating quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct states of a bulk mechanical oscillator, compatible with existing optomechanical devices operating in the readily achievable bad-cavity limit. The scheme is based on a pulsed cavity optomechanical quantum non-demolition (QND) interaction, driven by displaced non-Gaussian states, and measurement-induced feedback, avoiding the need for strong single-photon optomechanical coupling. Furthermore, we show that single-quadrature cooling of the mechanical oscillator is sufficient for efficient state preparation, and we outline a three-pulse protocol comprising a sequence of QND interactions for squeezing-enhanced cooling, state preparation, and tomography.

abstract: A key ingredient for quantum photonic technologies is an on-demand source of indistinguishable single photons. State-of-the-art indistinguishable-single-photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed repetition rates, creating a string of single photons with predetermined arrival times. However, in future applications, an independent electronic signal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of an indistinguishable photon. Further, operating the photon source up to the limit imposed by its lifetime is desirable. Here we report on the application of a true on-demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise arrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse duration. We investigate in detail the effect of finite duration of an excitation $\pi$ pulse on the degree of photon antibunching. Finally, we demonstrate that highly indistinguishable single photons can be generated using this on-demand approach, enabling maximum flexibility for future applications.

abstract: In this work we study the de Haas van Alfhen (dHvA) effect for neutral atoms with a nonvanishing magnetic moment interacting with an electric field. Considering the particles confined in a two dimensional (2D) atomic cloud and using the Landau-Aharonov-Casher (LAC) theory, we obtain the effective magnetic field as well as the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the system. Assuming the neutral atoms as being $ ^{87}\mathrm{Rb} $ ultracold Rydberg atoms we calculate the degeneracy of the energy levels. Under a strong effective magnetic field regime we present the quantum oscillations in the energy and effective magnetization of the atomic gas. From the dHvA period we determine the area of the Fermi circle of the atomic cloud.

abstract: Analyzing some well established facts, we give a model-independent parameterization of black hole quantum computing in terms of a set of macro and micro quantities and their relations. These include the relations between the extraordinarily-small energy gap of black hole qubits and important time-scales of information-processing, such as, scrambling time and Page's time. We then show, confirming and extending previous results, that other systems of nature with identical quantum informatics features are attractive Bose-Einstein systems at the critical point of quantum phase transition. Here we establish a complete isomorphy between the quantum computational properties of these two systems. In particular, we show that the quantum hair of a critical condensate is strikingly similar to the quantum hair of a black hole. Irrespectively whether one takes the similarity between the two systems as a remarkable coincidence or as a sign of a deeper underlying connection, the following is evident. Black holes are not unique in their way of quantum information processing and we can manufacture black hole based quantum computers in labs by taking advantage of quantum criticality.

We first examine the wave function and the degeneracy of the single-particle ground state, followed by a study of two weakly interacting bosons or fermions. For the two-particle ground state, we focus on the effects of the interaction on the degeneracy, the spin density profiles, and the density-density correlation functions. Finally we show how these studies help us to understand the many-body properties of the system.

abstract: The recent experimental realization of Bose-Fermi superfluid mixtures of dilute ultracold atomic gases has opened new perspectives in the study of quantum many-body systems. Depending on the values of the scattering lengths and the amount of bosons and fermions, a uniform Bose-Fermi mixture is predicted to exhibit a fully mixed phase, a fully separated phase or, in addition, a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a mixed phase. The occurrence of this intermediate configuration has interesting consequences when the system is nonuniform. In this work we theoretically investigate the case of solitonic solutions of coupled Bogoliubov-de Gennes and Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the fermionic and bosonic components, respectively. We show that, in the partially separated phase, a dark soliton in Fermi superfluid is accompanied by a broad bosonic component in the soliton, forming a dark-bright soliton which keeps full spatial coherence.

abstract: Understanding the quantum nature of light in situations where it interacts very strongly with matter is a question that is becoming experimentally relevant for qubits coupled to new classes of metamaterials with impedance close to the quantum limit. This problem enters the realm of many-body physics because the effective fine structure constant reaches values of order one, so that perturbative methods and concepts of quantum optics cannot be simply borrowed. Remarkably, describing the time-dependent state vector in terms of quantum-superposed classical (coherent) states provides not only a very efficient computational tool, but also a simple way to rationalize the physics at play. By analyzing the Wigner distribution of the radiated field, we find that spontaneous atomic decay does not lead to the standard emission of one-photon Fock states, but rather to the release of many-body Schr\"odinger cats.

abstract: In ferromagnet/normal metal heterostructures, spin pumping and spin-transfer torques are two reciprocal processes that occur concomitantly. Their interplay introduces a dynamic feedback effect interconnecting energy dissipation channels of both magnetization and current. By solving the spin diffusion process in the presence of the spin Hall effect in the normal metal, we show that the dynamic feedback gives rise to: (i) a nonlinear magnetic damping that is crucial to sustain uniform steady-state oscillations of a spin Hall oscillator at large angles. (ii) a frequency dependent spin Hall magnetoimpedance that reduces to the spin Hall magnetoresistance in the dc limit.
