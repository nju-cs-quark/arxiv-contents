abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem holds that operations from the Clifford group, when combined with preparation and detection of qubit states in the computational basis, are insufficient for universal quantum computation. Indeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a local hidden variable theory, so that there is no need for a quantum mechanical explanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup. Unfortunately, Clifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and measurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are otherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum computation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an additional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate the Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable theory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell violations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the already existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems. We conclude with an experimentally feasible schematic combining the two, which should potentially lead to the demonstration of Bell violation in a Majorana experiment in the near future. Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which we describe.

abstract: Living organisms capitalize on their ability to predict their environment to maximize their available free energy, and invest this energy in turn to create new complex structures. Is there a preferred method by which this manipulation of structure should be done? Our intuition is "simpler is better," but this is only a guiding principal. Here, we substantiate this claim through thermodynamic reasoning. We present a new framework for the manipulation of patterns (structured sequences of data) by predictive devices. We identify the dissipative costs and how they can be minimized by the choice of memory in these predictive devices. For pattern generation, we see that simpler is indeed better. However, contrary to intuition, when it comes to extracting work from a pattern, any device capable of making statistically accurate predictions can recover all available energy.

abstract: Computing entanglement entropy and its cousins is often challenging even in the simplest continuum and lattice models, partly because such entropies depend nontrivially on all geometric characteristics of the entangling region. Quantum information measures between two or more regions are even more complicated, but contain more, and universal, information. In this paper, we focus on Renyi entropy and information of the order n=2. For a free field theory, we show that these quantities are mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy by introducing boundaries subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in one higher dimension. This mapping allows us to exploit the powerful tools available in the context of thermal Casimir effect, specifically a multipole expansion suited for computing the Renyi information between arbitrarily-shaped regions. We provide an alternative representation as a sum over closed-loop polymers, which establishes a connection to purely entropic effects, and proves useful in deriving information inequalities. Finally, we discuss specific examples that suggest a similar thermodynamic mapping for conformal field theories.

abstract: We analyze radiative processes of a quantum system composed by two identical two-level atoms interacting with a massless scalar field prepared in the vacuum state in the presence of perfect reflecting flat boundaries. We consider that the atoms are prepared in a stationary maximally entangled state. We investigate the spontaneous transition rates from the entangled states to its collective ground state induced by vacuum fluctuations. In the empty-space case, the spontaneous decay rates can be enhanced or inhibited depending on the specific entangled state and changes with the distance between the atoms. Next, we consider the presence of perfect mirrors and impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on such surfaces. In the presence of a single boundary the transition rate for the symmetric state undergoes a strong reduction, whereas for the antisymmetric state our results indicate a slightly enhancement. For completeness we also investigate the case of two perfect mirrors.

abstract: Current parameter estimation techniques rely on photodetectors which have low brightness and thus are based on gathering averaged statistics. Recently it was claimed that perfect photodetction will change the nature of sensing algorithms and will increase sensing efficiency beyond the immediate effect of having larger collection efficiency. In this paper we bring up the observation that perfect photodetection implies Heisenberg scaling($\frac{1}{T}$) for parameter estimations. We analyze a specific example in detail.

abstract: Efficient preparation and detection of the motional state of trapped ions is important in many experiments ranging from quantum computation to precision spectroscopy. We investigate the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique for the manipulation of motional states in a trapped ion system. The presented technique uses a Raman coupling between two hyperfine ground states in $^{25}$Mg$^+$, implemented with delayed pulses, which removes a single phonon independent of the initial motional state. We show that for a thermal state the STIRAP population transfer is more efficient than a stimulated Raman Rabi pulse on a motional sideband. In contrast to previous implementations, a large detuning of more than 200 times the natural linewidth of the transition is used. This approach renders STIRAP suitable for atoms in which resonant laser fields would populate fluorescing excited states and thus impede the STIRAP process. We use the technique to measure the wavefunction overlap of excited motional states with the motional ground state. This is an important application for photon recoil spectroscopy and other force sensing applications that utilize the high sensitivity of the motional state of trapped ions to external fields. Furthermore, a determination of the ground state population enables a simple measurement of the ion's temperature.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We construct a general measure for detecting the real speedup of quantum evolution in both closed and open systems. This speed measure is based on the rate of change of the states on a manifold of density operators with appropriate monotone Riemannian metrics. Any increase in speed is a clear signature of real dynamical speedup. We apply the proposed measure to several typical closed and open quantum systems, illustrating that entanglement and the memory effect of the environment together can become resources for accelerating dynamical evolution under certain conditions. Remarkably, a direct measurement of such speedup is feasible without the need for a tomographic reconstruction of the density matrix, which greatly enhances the feasibility of practical experimental tests.

abstract: The class $\MIP^*$ of promise problems that can be decided through an interactive proof system with multiple entangled provers provides a complexity-theoretic framework for the exploration of the nonlocal properties of entanglement. Little is known about the power of this class. The only proposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of semidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et al. This hierarchy converges to a value that is only known to coincide with the provers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible but difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds on the rate of convergence are known. We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any solution to its $N$-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in which measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise commutator bounded by $O(\ell^2/\sqrt{N})$ in operator norm, where $\ell$ is the number of possible answers per prover. Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of $\MIP^*$, called $\MIP_\delta^*$, in which the soundness property is required to hold as long as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at most $\delta$. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound $\MIP_\delta^* \subseteq \DTIME(\exp(\exp(\poly)/\delta^2))$. In terms of lower bounds we establish that $\MIP^*_{2^{-\poly}}$, with completeness $1$ and soundness $1-2^{-\poly}$, contains $\NEXP$. The relationship of $\MIP_\delta^*$ to $\MIPstar$ has connections with the mathematical literature on approximate commutation. Our rounding scheme gives an elementary proof that the Strong Kirchberg Conjecture implies that $\MIPstar$ is computable. We discuss applications to device-independent cryptography.

abstract: We present quantum algorithms to efficiently perform discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction and classification over an exponentially large input data set. Compared with the best-known classical algorithms, the quantum algorithms show an exponential speedup in both the number of training vectors $M$ and the feature space dimension $N$. We generalize the previous quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] to efficiently implement a Hermitian chain product of $k$ normalized $N\times N$ Hermitian positive-semidefinite matrices with time complexity of $O(\log (N))$. Using this result, we perform linear as well as nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction over $M$ vectors, each in an $N$-dimensional feature space, in time $O(\log (MN)/\epsilon ^{3})$, where $\epsilon $ denotes the tolerance error. We also present a quantum discriminant analysis algorithm for data classification with time complexity $O(\log (MN)/\epsilon ^{3})$.

abstract: Composite quantum systems exhibit non-local correlations. These counter intuitive correlations form a resource for quantum information processing and quantum computation. In our previous work on two qubit maximally entangled mixed states, we observed that entangled states, states that can be used for quantum teleportaion, states that violate Bell-CHSH inequality and states that do not admit local hidden variable description is the hierarchy in terms of the order of nonlocal correlations. In order to establish this hierarchy, in the present work, we investigate the effect of noise on two quibt states that exhibit higher order nonlocal correlations. We find that dilapidation of nonlocal correlations in the presence of noise follow the same hierarchy, that is, higher order nonlocal correlation disappears for small strength of noise, where as lower order nonlocal correlations survive strong noisy environment. We show the results for decoherence due to amplitude damping channel on various quantum states. However, we observe that same hierarchy is followed by states undergoing decoherence due to phase damping as well as depolarizing channels.

abstract: Continuous-time quantum error correction is a technique for protecting quantum information against decoherence, where both the decoherence and error correction processes are considered continuous in time. Given any [[$n,k,d$]] quantum stabilizer code, we formulate a class of protocols to implement CTQEC, involving weak coherent measurements and weak unitary corrections. Under this formalism, we show that the minimal required size of the ancillary system is $n-k+1$ qubits, and we propose one scheme that meets this minimal requirement. Furthermore, we compare our method with other known schemes, and show that a particular measure of performance described in this paper is better when using our method.

abstract: Nearly thirty years ago the possibility of anomalous weak amplfication (AWA) was revealed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman [1]. Recently two papers presents two AWA schemes which are beyond the traditional proposal given by them [9, 10]. At the first glance the two papers seems very different. Ref. [9] discusses the thermal light cross-Kerr effect and finds only postselection can give the amplification effect without interference and Ref. [10] shows that only weak interaction can give the amplification effect without postselection. Here the relationships between the two papers are pointed out and a generalized framework for AWA via postselecting a pair of orthogonal final state are shown.

abstract: Two major challenges in the development of optomechanical devices are achieving a low mechanical and optical loss rate and vibration isolation from the environment. We address both issues by fabricating novel trampoline resonators made from low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si$_3$N$_4$ with a distributed bragg reflector (DBR) mirror. We construct a nested double resonator structure that generates approximately 80 dB of mechanical isolation from the mounting surface, eliminating the strong mounting dependence of the quality factor observed with single resonators. With the consistency provided by this isolation scheme we reliably fabricate devices with mechanical quality factors of around 400,000 at room temperature. In addition these devices were used to form optical cavities with finesse up to 181,000 $\pm$ 1,000. These promising parameters will enable experiments in the quantum regime with macroscopic mechanical resonators.

This is how it has been implemented in all recent Bell experiment addressing this loophole. I point out in this note that quantum random number generators are unnecessary for such experiments and that a Bell experiment with a pseudo-random (but otherwise completely deterministic) mechanism for selecting the measurement settings, such as taking a hash function of the latest million tweets with the hashtag #quantum, would be as convincing, or even more, than one using quantum random number generators.

abstract: Recently, a new type of quantum key distribution, called the round-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol [Nature 509, 475 (2014)], was proposed, where the security can be guaranteed without monitoring any statistics. In this Letter, we investigate source imperfections and side-channel attacks on the source of this protocol. We show that only three assumptions are needed for the security, and no detailed characterizations of the source or the side-channel attacks are needed. This high robustness is another striking advantage of the RRDPS protocol over other protocols.

abstract: The electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities for a relativistic electron gas are calculated from quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature and density as functions of temperature, chemical potential, frequency, and wavevector. The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both electric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and zero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical potential-dependent medium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend on three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the Lindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit, we obtain: i) for $\omega=0$, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known nonrelativistic limits; ii) for $\omega \neq 0$, Drude-type responses at zero and at high temperatures. The latter implies that one may have both $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials. This unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron plasma is one of nature's candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction system. Moreover, Maxwell's equations in the medium yield the dispersion relation and the index of refraction of the electron plasma. Present results should be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations, synchrotrons, and other environments with fast moving electrons.

abstract: We develop a framework for resource efficient compilation of higher-level programs into lower-level reversible circuits. Our main focus is on optimizing the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first, wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to "garbage collection" for reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed. We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions, reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method, REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to compile the reversible networks.

abstract: We directly measured the normalized $\it{s}$-wave scattering cross-section of ultracold $^{40}\rm{K}$ atoms across a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance by colliding pairs of degenerate Fermi gases (DFGs) and imaging the scattered atoms. We extracted the scattered fraction for a range of bias magnetic fields, and measured the resonance location to be $B_0 = 20.206(15)$ mT with width $\Delta = 1.0(5)$ mT. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of atom number in scattering images, we developed techniques to interpret absorption images in a regime where recoil induced detuning corrections are significant. These imaging techniques are generally applicable to experiments with lighter alkalis that would benefit from maximizing signal-to-noise ratio on atom number counting at the expense of spatial imaging resolution.

abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall edge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall edge modes which occur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of quantum spin Hall edge modes is because of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These quantum spin Hall edge modes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing directions. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than charge- in lieu of this its expected that quantum spin Hall edge modes will be more robust to disorder and inelastic scattering than quantum Hall edge modes which are charge dependent and independent of spin. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to quantum spin Hall edge modes when subjected to same degree of disorder and/or inelastic scattering in similar setups as quantum Hall edge modes. In fact we observe that quantum spin Hall edge modes are more susceptible to decoherence and disorder than quantum Hall edge modes and while a single disordered contact has no effect on quantum Hall edge modes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall edge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. In case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while quantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a finite charge Hall current still flows. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry can have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in quantum Hall case.

abstract: Critical dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to understanding the universal behavior of spontaneous defect formation in various system from the early universe, condensed-matter systems to ultracold atomic systems. We explore the universal real-time dynamics in an array of coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates, which undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking from the symmetric Rabi oscillation to the broken-symmetry self-trapping. In addition to Goldstone modes, there exist gapped Higgs mode whose excitation gap vanishes at the critical point. In the slow passage through the critical point, we analytically find that the symmetry-breaking dynamics obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. From the scalings of bifurcation delay and domain formation, we numerically extract two Kibble-Zurek exponents $b_{1}=\nu/(1+\nu z)$ and $b_{2}=1/(1+\nu z)$, which give the static correlation-length critical exponent $\nu=1/2$ and the dynamic critical exponent $z=1$. Our approach provides an efficient way to simultaneous determination of the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ for a continuous phase transition.

Here we propose the use of the optical Stark effect to reduce the sensitivity of the effective hole Zeeman energy to fluctuations in the local electric-field. Calculations using measured quantum dot parameters are presented, and demonstrate a factor of 10-100 reduction in the extrinsic dephasing. Compared to active stabilization methods, this technique should benefit from reduced experimental complexity.

abstract: We propose a realistic scheme to quantum simulate the so-far experimentally unobserved topological Mott insulator phase -- an interaction-driven topological insulator -- using cold atoms in an optical Lieb lattice. To this end, we study a system of spinless fermions in a Lieb lattice, exhibiting repulsive nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions, and derive the associated zero temperature phase diagram within mean-field approximation. In particular, we analyze how the interactions can dynamically generate a charge density wave ordered, a nematic as well as a topologically non-trivial quantum anomalous Hall phase. We characterize the topology of the different phases by the Chern number and discuss the possibility of phase coexistence. Based on the identified phases, we propose a realistic implementation of this model using cold Rydberg-dressed atoms in an optical lattice. The scheme, which allows one to access in particular the topological Mott insulator phase, robustly and independently of its exact position in parameter space, merely requires global, always-on off-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states and is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques.

abstract: In this paper we present a general framework for solving the stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) on a network of one-dimensional wires modelled by a metric graph with suitable matching conditions at the vertices. A formal solution is given that expresses the wave function and its derivative at one end of an edge (wire) nonlinearly in terms of the values at the other end. For the cubic NLSE this nonlinear transfer operation can be expressed explicitly in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Its application reduces the problem of solving the corresponding set of coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations to a finite set of nonlinear algebraic equations. For sufficiently small amplitudes we use canonical perturbation theory that allows to extract the leading nonlinear corrections over large distances.
