abstract: We study a quantum heat engine at strong coupling between the system and the thermal reservoirs. Exploiting a collective coordinate mapping, we incorporate system-reservoir correlations into a consistent thermodynamic analysis, thus circumventing the usual restriction to weak coupling and vanishing correlations. We apply our formalism to the example of a quantum Otto cycle, demonstrating that the performance of the engine is diminished in the strong coupling regime with respect to its weakly coupled counterpart, producing a reduced net work output and operating at a lower energy conversion efficiency. We identify costs imposed by sudden decoupling of the system and reservoirs around the cycle as being primarily responsible for the diminished performance, and define an alternative operational procedure which can partially recover the work output and efficiency. More generally, the collective coordinate mapping holds considerable promise for wider studies of thermodynamic systems beyond weak reservoir coupling.

abstract: A new way of constructing unextendible maximally entangled basis (UMEB) from maximally entangled basis (MEB) is proposed. Consequently, it is shown that if there is an $N$-member UMEB in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^d$, then there exists a $(qd)^2-q(d^2-N)$-member UMEB in $\mathbb{C}^{qd}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{qd}$ for any $q\in\mathbb{N}$. This improves the results in [Phys. Rev. A 90, 034301(2014)], which shows that there exists a $(qd)^2-(d^2-N)$-member UMEB in $\mathbb{C}^{qd}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{qd}$ provided that an $N$-member UMEB exsits in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^d$. In addition, a very easy way of constructing UMEB in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d'}$ with $d<d'$ is presented, which promotes and covers all the previous related work.

abstract: In the framework of cavity QED, we propose a quantum repeater scheme that uses coherent light and chains of atoms coupled to optical cavities. In contrast to conventional repeater schemes, we avoid the usage of two-qubit quantum logical gates by exploiting solely the cavity QED evolution. In our previous paper [D. Gonta and P. van Loock: Phys. Rev. A 88, 052308 (2013)], we already proposed a quantum repeater in which the entanglement between two neighboring repeater nodes was distributed using controlled displacements of input coherent light, while the produced low-fidelity entangled pairs were purified using ancillary (four-partite) entangled states. In this paper, the entanglement distribution is realized using a sequence of controlled phase shifts and displacements of input coherent light. Compared to previous coherent-state-based distribution schemes for two-qubit entanglement, the present scheme relies only upon a simple discrimination of two coherent states with opposite signs, which can be performed in a quantum mechanically optimal fashion via a beam splitter and two on-off detectors. The entanglement purification utilizes a scheme that avoids the usage of ancillary entangled resources. Our repeater scheme exhibits reasonable fidelities and repeater rates providing an attractive platform for long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: The full solution of the optimization problem giving the Gaussian capacity of the single-mode fiducial Gaussian quantum channel is provided. Since it was shown that the Gaussian capacity of an arbitrary (phase-sensitive or insensitive) single-mode Gaussian quantum channel is equal to the Gaussian capacity of this fiducial channel, the solution presented in this work can be regarded as universal. The analytical study of this solution, below and above the energy threshold, shows that the dependence of the Gaussian capacity on the environment noise squeezing is not monotonic. In particular, the capacity may have a saddle point, one or two extrema at finite squeezing, or be a monotonically increasing function of the squeezing parameter. The exact dependence is defined by the determinant of the noise covariance matrix and by the transmissivity (or gain) of the fiducial Gaussian channel.

abstract: We review the geometric features of negative conditional entropy and the properties of the conditional amplitude operator proposed by Cerf and Adami for two qubit states in comparison with entanglement and nonlocality of the states. We identify the region of negative conditional entropy in the tetrahedron of locally maximally mixed two-qubit states. Within this set of states, negative conditional entropy implies nonlocality and entanglement, but not vice versa, and we show that the Cerf-Adami conditional amplitude operator provides an entanglement witness equivalent to the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Outside of the tetrahedron this equivalence is generally not true.

abstract: A new frontier in the search for dark matter (DM) is based on the idea of detecting the decoherence caused by DM scattering against a mesoscopic superposition of normal matter. Such superpositions are uniquely sensitive to very small momentum transfers from new particles and forces, especially DM with a mass below 100 MeV. Here we investigate what sorts of dark sectors are inaccessible with existing methods but would induce noticeable decoherence in the next generation of matter interferometers. We show that very soft, but medium range (0.1 nm - 1 {\mu}m) elastic interactions between matter and DM are particularly suitable. We construct toy models for such interactions, discuss existing constraints, and delineate the expected sensitivity of forthcoming experiments. The first hints of DM in these devices would appear as small variations in the anomalous decoherence rate with a period of one sidereal day. This is a generic signature of interstellar sources of decoherence, clearly distinguishing it from terrestrial backgrounds. The OTIMA experiment under development in Vienna will begin to probe Earth-thermalizing DM once sidereal variations in the background decoherence rate are pushed below one part in a hundred for superposed 5-nm gold nanoparticles. The proposals by Bateman et al. and Geraci et al. could be similarly sensitive, although they would require at least a month of data taking. DM that is absorbed or elastically reflected by the Earth, and so avoids a greenhouse density enhancement, would not be detectable by those three experiment. On the other hand, aggressive proposals of the MAQRO collaboration and Pino et al. would immediately open up many orders of magnitude in DM mass, interaction range, and coupling strength, regardless of how DM behaves in bulk matter.

abstract: We study the single photon scattering on a system composed by a coupling cavity array with a two-level atom in the center cavity, which, by varying two outside coupling parameters, corresponds to a model from a supercavity QED to a waveguide QED with counter-rotating wave (CRW) interaction. By applying a time-independent scattering theory based on the bound states in the scattering region, we find that the CRW interaction obviously changes the transmission valley even in the weak atom-cavity coupling regime; In the ultrastrong coupling regime, the CRW interaction leads to an inelastic scattering process and a Fano-like resonance, whether in the supercavity QED case or in the waveguide case.

abstract: As discovered by P. W. Anderson, excitations do not propagate freely in a disordered lattice, but, due to destructive interference, they localise. As a consequence when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice one indeed observes, a non-trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice. Such non-trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a non-trivial quantum information backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian dynamics. To investigate the above scenario we consider a quantum emitter, or atom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity array (CCA). If initially excited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes a Markovian spontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially in its vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal modes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic dynamics. We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous measure of quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore show that the average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described by a phenomenological model in which the atom is coupled, at the same time, to a single mode and to a standard - Markovian - dissipative bath.

abstract: We investigate steady-state properties of a two-dimensional incoherent-pumped dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, which describes a photon square lattice. This incoherent pumping exhibits an important environment-induced higher-order fluctuation effect, which induces a strong competition between the driven-dissipative channel, the photon-photon interaction, and the photon hopping in multi-photon processes. This new competition gives rise to a spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry of system. As a result, we predict a many-body steady-state localized-delocalized phase transition and an anti-blockade effect, in which the increasing of the repulsive photon-photon interaction promotes the emergence of phase transition. These unconventional many-body steady-state phenomena can be understood by analyzing the single-cavity properties. Our results pave a new way to control many-body dynamics of driven-dissipative systems.

Using a heralded single-photon source and a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM), we steer single photons to specific positions in a virtual grid on a large-area spatially resolving photon-counting detector (ICCD). We experimentally demonstrate selective addressing any location (symbol) in a 9072 size grid (alphabet) to achieve 10.5 bit of mutual information between the sender and receiver per detected photon. Our results set the stage for very-high-dimensional quantum information processing.

abstract: The properties of non-product states, both (anti)symmetrized and entangled, have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, by extending previous partial results, we introduce a general framework to describe atomic absorption and emission in these states. Our approach shows the existence of some fundamental differences between entanglement and (anti)symmetrization and between absorption and emission. For instance, modifications of the emission properties with respect to that of uncorrelated systems occur for any (anti)symmetrized state but only for some very specific entangled states.

abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is related to the appearance of emergent phenomena, while a non-vanishing order parameter has been viewed as the sign of turning into such symmetry breaking phase. Recently, we have proposed a continuous measure of symmetry of a physical system using group theoretical approach. Within this framework, we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the conventional superconductor and Bose-Einstein condensation by showing both the two many body systems can be mapped into the many spin model. Moreover we also formulate the underlying relation between the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the order parameter quantitatively. The degree of symmetry stays unity in the absence of the two emergent phenomena, while decreases exponentially at the appearance of the order parameter which indicates the inextricable relation between the spontaneous symmetry and the order parameter.

abstract: A system in the ultrastrong coupling regime is predicted to emit photons if the intensity of the light-matter coupling is modulated in time. This phenomenon, that presents strong similarities with other forms of quantum vacuum emission like the dynamical Casimir effect and the Hawkins radiation, has been theoretically studied in various strongly coupled systems but to date eluded experimental verifications. In this paper we investigate the impact of losses and detuning on the intensity of the emitted radiation. We will prove that losses have a limited effect and that not only quasi-resonance is not required, but a red-detuned photonic mode can actually enhance the emission. Those results prove that strong coupling and quasi-resonance between light and matter excitations are not required to observe quantum vacuum emission upon modulation of light-matter coupling, opening novel venues to observe this fascinating but elusive effect.

abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the master equation describing a general time-dependent quantum system with classical Poisson white noise and outline its various properties. We discuss the limiting cases of Poisson white noise and provide approximations for the different noise strength regimes. We show that using the eigenstates of the noise superoperator as a basis can be a useful way of expressing the master equation. Using this we simulate various settings to illustrate different effects of Poisson noise. In particular, we show a dip in the fidelity as a function of noise strength where high fidelity can occur in the strong noise regime for some cases. We also investigate recent claims [Jing et al., Phys. Rev. A 89 032110 (2014)] that this type of noise may improve rather than destroy adiabaticity.

abstract: Recently, Zhong et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 022337(2013)] investigated the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the presence of decoherence. We here reform their results and propose two schemes to enhance and preserve the QFIs for a qubit system subjected to a decoherence noisy environment by applying $\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operators process. The proposed schemes are related to the $\textit{prior}$ (or the $\textit{post}$ ) non-Hermitian operator process corresponding to before (or after) the interest system suffers from decoherence, respectively. Resorting to the Bloch sphere representation, we derive the exact analytical expressions of the QFIs with respect to the amplitude parameter $\theta$ and the phase parameter $\phi$, and in detail investigate the influence of $\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters on the QFIs. Compared with purity decoherence process (without non-Hermitian operator process), we find that the $\textit{post non-Hermitian}$ operator process can potentially enhance and preserve the QFIs by choosing appropriate $\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters, while with the help of the $\textit{prior non-Hermitian}$ operator process one could completely eliminate the effect of decoherence to improve the parameters estimation. Finally, a generalized non-Hermitian operator parameters effect on the parameters estimation is also considered.

abstract: Quantum state tomography on a d-dimensional system demands resources that grow rapidly with d. Model selection can be used to tailor the number of fit parameters to the data, but quantum tomography violates some common assumptions that underly canonical model selection techniques based on ratios of maximum likelihoods (loglikelihood ratio statistics), due to the nature of the state space boundaries. Here, we study the behavior of the maximum likelihood in different Hilbert space dimensions, and derive an expression for a complexity penalty -- the expected value of the loglikelihood ratio statistic (roughly, the logarithm of the maximum likelihood) -- that can be used to make an appropriate choice for d.

abstract: Quantum mechanics dictates bounds for the minimal evolution time between predetermined initial and final states. Several of these Quantum Speed Limit (QSL) bounds were derived for non-unitary dynamics using different approaches. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the most common QSL bounds in the damped Jaynes-Cummings model, covering the Markovian and non-Markovian regime. We show that only one of the analysed bounds cleaves to the essence of the QSL theory outlined in the pioneer works of Mandelstam \& Tamm and Margolus \& Levitin in the context of unitary evolutions. We also show that all of QSL bounds analysed reflect the fact that in our model non-Markovian effects speed up the quantum evolution. However, it is not possible to infer the Markovian or non-Markovian behaviour of the dynamics only analysing the QSL bounds.

abstract: The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) famously avoids the issue of wave function collapse. Different MWI trees representing the same quantum events can have different topologies, depending upon the observer. However, they are all isomorphic to the group of block universes containing all of the outcomes of all of the events, and so, in that sense, the group of block universes is a more fundamental representation. Different branches of the MWI tree, representing different universes in MWI, ultimately share the same quantum state in a common ancestor branch. This branching topology is incompatible with that of the Minkowski block universe; the resolution is to replace the branches with discrete, parallel block universes, each of which extends from the trunk to the outermost twigs. The number of universes in a branch is proportional to its thickness which, in turn, depends upon the absolute square of the probability amplitude for the state in that branch. Every quantum event may be represented by a kernel of universes, which is the smallest group of universes that will reproduce the quantum probabilities of the outcomes of that event. By considering the ratios of the probabilities of the outcomes of any event, it can be shown that the number of universes in every kernel must finite, as must be the total number of universes in the multiverse. Further, every universe in the multiverse must be finite both in space and time. Another consequence is that quantum probabilities must be rational, which suggests that quantum mechanics is only an approximation to a discrete theory. A corollary is that not every conceivable universe exists in the multiverse, no doubt to the disappointment of those who enjoy alternate-history novels.

abstract: The author's attempt to construct a local causal model of quantum theory (QT) that includes quantum field theory (QFT) resulted in the identification of "quantum objects" as the elementary units of causality and locality. Quantum objects are collections of particles (including single particles) whose collective dynamics and measurement results can only be described by the laws of QT and QFT. Local causal models of quantum objects' internal dynamics are not possible if a locality is understood as a space-point locality. Within quantum objects, state transitions may occur which instantly affect the whole quantum object. The identification of quantum objects as the elementary units of causality and locality has two primary implications for a causal model of quantum objects: (1) quantum objects run autonomously with system-state update frequencies based on their local proper times and with either no or minimal dependency on external parameters. (2) The laws of physics that describe global (but relativistic) interrelationships must be translated to a causal model of interactions between quantum objects and interactions between quantum objects and the space.

abstract: The flourishing field of two-dimensional (2D) nanophotonics has generated much excitement in the quantum technologies community after the identification of quantum emitters (QEs) in layered materials (LMs). LMs offer many advantages as platforms for quantum circuits, such as integration within hybrid technologies, valley degree of freedom and strong spin-orbit coupling. QEs in LMs, however, suffer from uncontrolled occurrences, added to the uncertainty over their origin, which has been linked to defects and strain gradients. Here, we report a scalable method to create arrays of single-photon emitting QEs in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2) using a nanopatterned silica substrate. We obtain devices with QE numbers in the range of hundreds, limited only by the flake size, and a QE yield approaching unity. The overall quality of these deterministic QEs surpasses that of their randomly appearing counterparts, with spectral wanderings of around 0.1 meV, an order of magnitude lower than previous reports. Our technique solves the scalability challenge for LM-based quantum photonic devices.

abstract: Two of the most striking experimental findings when investigating exciton spectra in cuprous oxide using high-resolution spectroscopy are the observability and the fine structure splitting of $F$ excitons reported by J. Thewes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 027402 (2015)]. These findings show that it is indispensable to account for the complex valence band structure and the cubic symmetry of the solid in the theory of excitons. This is especially true for magnetoexcitons, where the external magnetic field reduces the symmetry of the system even further. We present the theory of excitons in all direct semiconductors with a complex valence band structure in an external magnetic field, and show in particular that all degeneracies are completely lifted. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we also present the corresponding experimental spectra for cuprous oxide. The theoretical results and experimental spectra are in excellent agreement as regards not only the positions but also the oscillator strengths. Furthermore, this comparison allows for the determination of the fourth Luttinger parameter of this semiconductor.

Only by considering the complete valence band structure of a direct cubic semiconductor, the Hamiltonian of excitons leads to GUE statistics without the need for interactions with other quasi-particles like phonons. Hence, we give theoretical evidence for a spatially homogeneous system breaking all antiunitary symmetries.

abstract: We study the vacuum (i.e., zero-temperature) Casimir energy for a system of neutral conductors which are isolated, as opposed to grounded. The former is meant to describe a situation where the total charge on each conductor, as well as all of its fluctuations, vanishes, while the latter describes a situation where the conductors are connected to a charge reservoir. We compute the difference between the vacuum energies for a given system of conductors, but subjected to the two different conditions stated above. The results can be written in terms of a generalized, frequency-dependent capacitance matrix of the system. Using a multipolar expansion, we show that the grounded Casimir energy includes a monopole-monopole interaction term that is absent in the isolated case in the large distance limit
