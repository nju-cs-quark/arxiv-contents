abstract: Correlated photon pairs produced by a spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process can be used for secure quantum communication over long distances including free space transmission over a link through turbulent atmosphere. We experimentally investigate the possibility to utilize the intrinsic strong correlation between the pump and output photon spatial modes to mitigate the negative targeting effects of atmospheric beam wander. Our approach is based on a demonstration observing the deflection of the beam on a spatially resolved array of single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD-array).

abstract: This manuscript is inspired by the paper [2]. In the paper, they investigate a method to detect existence of an object with arbitrarily small interaction. Below, we sketch their protocol to motivate the present manuscript. The object of their protocol is to detect whether the given blackbox interact with input states or not, with negligible distortion of the blackbox, and high detection probability. In this paper, we do two things. First, we prove the above mentioned protocol is optimal in a certain setting. The main tool here is adversary method, a classical method in query complexity. Second, we present a protocol to detect unitary operations with negligible error and no distortion of the input at all.

abstract: Using circuit QED, we consider the measurement of a superconducting transmon qubit via a coupled microwave resonator. For ideally dispersive coupling, ringing up the resonator produces coherent states with frequencies matched to transmon energy states. Realistic coupling is not ideally dispersive, however, so transmon-resonator energy levels hybridize into joint eigenstate ladders of the Jaynes-Cummings type. Previous work has shown that ringing up the resonator approximately respects this ladder structure to produce a coherent state in the eigenbasis (a dressed coherent state). We numerically investigate the validity of this coherent state approximation to find two primary deviations. First, resonator ring-up leaks small stray populations into eigenstate ladders corresponding to different transmon states. Second, within an eigenstate ladder the transmon nonlinearity shears the coherent state as it evolves. We then show that the next natural approximation for this sheared state in the eigenbasis is a dressed squeezed state, and derive simple evolution equations for such states using a hybrid phase-Fock-space description.

abstract: The hybridization of distinct quantum systems is now seen as an effective way to engineer the properties of an entire system leading to applications in quantum metamaterials, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. One well known example is superconducting circuits coupled to ensembles of microscopic natural atoms. In such cases, the properties of the individual atom are intrinsic, and so are unchangeable. However, current technology allows us to fabricate large ensembles of macroscopic artificial atoms such as superconducting flux qubits, where we can really tailor and control the properties of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate coherent coupling between a microwave resonator and several thousand superconducting flux qubits, where we observe a large dispersive frequency shift in the spectrum of 250 MHz induced by collective behavior. These results represent the largest number of coupled superconducting qubits realized so far. Our approach shows that it is now possible to engineer the properties of the ensemble, opening up the way for the controlled exploration of the quantum many-body system.

abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the displacement and momentum fluctuations spectra of the movable mirror in a standard optomechanical system driven by a finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum light accompanying a coherent laser field. Two cases in which the squeezed vacuum is generated by degenerated and non-degenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We find that for the case of finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection, the two spectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband squeezing excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a four-peaked structure, respectively, for the squeezing injection from DPO and NDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as squeezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be highly sensitive to the squeezing parameters and the temperature of the mirror. We also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum quadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the squeezing parameters of the input field on the mechanical squeezing. It will be shown that the parameters of driven squeezed vacuum affects the squeezing. We find the optimal mechanical squeezing is achievable via finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection which is affected by the intensity of squeezed vacuum. We also show that the phase of incident squeezed vacuum determines whether position or momentum squeezing occurs. Our proposed scheme not only provides a feasible experimental method to detect and characterize squeezed light by optomechanical systems, but also suggests a way for controllable transfer of squeezing from an optical field to a mechanical oscillator.

abstract: A recent paper [1] argues that bipartite "PR-box" correlations, though designed to respect relativistic causality, in fact violate relativistic causality in the classical limit. As a test of Ref. [1], we consider GHZ correlations as a tripartite version of PR-box correlations, and ask whether the arguments of Ref. [1] extend to GHZ correlations. If they do - i.e. if they show that GHZ correlations violate relativistic causality in the classical limit - then Ref. [1] must be incorrect, since GHZ correlations are quantum correlations and respect relativistic causality. But the arguments fail. We also show that both PR-box correlations and GHZ correlations can be retrocausal, but the retrocausality of PR-box correlations leads to self-contradictory causal loops, while the retrocausality of GHZ correlations does not.

title: Separability and entanglement of n-qubits and a qubit with a qudit using Hilbert-Schmidt decompositions

abstract: Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions are employed for analyzing systems of n-qubits, and a qubit with a qudit. Negative eigenvalues, obtained by partial-transpose (PT) plus local unitary transformations (PTU) for one qubit from the whole system, are used for indicating inseparability. A sufficient criterion for full separability of the n-qubits and qubit-qudit systems is given. We use the singular value decomposition (SVD) for improving the criterion for full separability. General properties of entanglement and separability are analyzed for a system of a qubit and a qudit and n-qubits systems, with emphasis on maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) (i.e., density matrices rho(MDS) for which tracing over any subsystem gives the unit density matrix). A sufficient condition that rho(MDS) is not separable is that it has an eigenvalue larger than 1/d for a qubit and a qudit, and larger than 1/2^(n-1) for n-qubits system. The PTU transformation does not change the eigenvalues of the n-qubits MDS density matrices for odd n. Thus the Peres-Horodecki criterion does not give any information about entanglement of these density matrices, but this criterion is useful for indicating inseparability for even n. The changes of the entanglement and separability properties of the GHZ state, the Braid entangled state and the W state by mixing them with white noise are analyzed by the use of the present methods. The entanglement and separability properties of the GHZ-diagonal density matrices, composed of mixture of 8 GHZ density matrices with probabilities p(i), is analyzed as function of these probabilities. In some cases we show that the Peres-Horodecki criterion is both sufficient and necessary.

abstract: The success probability in an ancilla based circuit generally decreases exponentially in the number of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially combine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine two or more ancilla based circuits. However, this type of the amplification only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow close to a unitary. In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary matrices on ancilla based quantum circuits in which the success probability is maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla based circuit design along with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified probabilities are generally around 0.75 and the fidelity of the final state is mostly high and around 0.95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis and show that combining two such ancilla based circuits, a matrix product can be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers.

abstract: We propose the implementation of a switch of particle statistics with an embedding quantum simulator. By encoding both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics into an enlarged Hilbert space, the statistics of quantum particles may be changed in situ during the time evolution, from bosons to fermions and from fermions to bosons, as many times as desired. We illustrate our proposal with few-qubit examples, although the protocol is straightforwardly extendable to larger numbers of particles. This proposal can be implemented on different quantum platforms such as trapped ions, quantum photonics, and superconducting circuits, among others. The possibility to implement permutation symmetrization and antisymmetrization of quantum particles enhances the toolbox of quantum simulations, for unphysical operations as well as for symmetry transformations.

abstract: The statistical properties of photons are fundamental to investigating quantum mechanical phenomena using light. In multi-photon, two-mode systems, correlations may exist between outcomes of measurements made on each mode which exhibit useful properties. Correlation in this sense can be thought of as increasing the probability of a particular outcome of a measurement on one subsystem given a measurement on a correlated subsystem. Here, we show a statistical property we call "discorrelation," in which the probability of a particular outcome of one subsystem is reduced to zero, given a measurement on a discorrelated subsystem. We show how such a state can be constructed using readily available building blocks of quantum optics, namely coherent states, single photons, beam splitters and projective measurement. We present a variety of discorrelated states, show that they are entangled, and study their sensitivity to loss.

abstract: We consider generic pure $n$-qubit states and a general class of pure states of arbitrary dimensions and arbitrary many subsystems. We characterize those states which can be reached from some other state via Local Operations assisted by finitely many rounds of Classical Communication ($LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}$). For qubits we show that this set of states is of measure zero, which implies that the maximally entangled set is generically of full measure if restricted to the practical scenario of finite-round LOCC. Moreover, we identify a class of states for which any $LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}$ protocol can be realized via a concatenation of deterministic steps. We show, however, that in general there exist state transformations which require a probabilistic step within the protocol, which highlights the difference between bipartite and multipartite LOCC.

abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism refers to the forward/backward asymmetry in the photoelectron angular distribution with respect to the propagation axis of circularly polarized light. It has recently been demonstrated in femtosecond multi-photon photoionization experiments with randomly oriented camphor and fenchone molecules [C. Lux et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51, 5001 (2012);C. S. Lehmann et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234307 (2013)]. A theoretical framework describing this process as (2+1) resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization is constructed, which consists of two-photon photoselection from randomly oriented molecules and successive one-photon ionisation of the photoselected molecules. It combines perturbation theory for the light-matter interaction with ab initio calculations for the two-photon absorption and a single-center expansion of the photoelectron wavefunction in terms of hydrogenic continuum functions. It is verified that the model correctly reproduces the basic symmetry behavior expected under exchange of handedness and light helicity. When applied it to fenchone and camphor, semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found, for which a sufficient d wave character of the electronically excited intermediate state is crucial.

abstract: In this study, we solve analytically the Schrodinger equation for a macroscopic quantum oscillator as a central system coupled to a large number of environmental micro-oscillating particles. Then, the Langevin equation is obtained for the system using two approaches: Quantum Mechanics and Bohmian Theory. Our results show that the predictions of the two theories are inherently different in real conditions. Nevertheless, the Langevin equation obtained by Bohmian approach could be reduced to the quantum one, when the vibrational frequency of the central system is high enough compared to the maximum frequency of the environmental particles.

abstract: In this study, we solve analytically the Schrodinger equation for a macroscopic quantum oscillator as a central system coupled to two environmental micro-oscillating particles. Then, the double-slit interference patterns are investigated in two limiting cases, considering the limits of uncertainty in the position probability distribution. Moreover, we analyze the interference patterns based on a recent proposal called stochastic electrodynamics with spin. Our results show that when the quantum character of the macro-system is decreased, the diffraction pattern becomes more similar to a classical one. We also show that, depending on the size of the slits, the predictions of quantum approach could be apparently different with those of the aforementioned stochastic description

abstract: Light-matter interfaces enable the generation of entangled states of light and matter which can be exploited to steer the quantum state of matter through measurement of light and feedback. Here we consider continuous-time, interferometric homodyne measurements of light on an array of light-matter interfaces followed by local feedback acting on each material system individually. While the systems are physically non-interacting, the feedback master equation we derive describes driven-dissipative, interacting many-body quantum dynamics, and comprises pairwise Hamiltonian interactions and collective jump operators. We characterize the general class of driven-dissipative many body systems which can be engineered in this way, and derive necessary conditions on models supporting non-trivial quantum dynamics beyond what can be generated by local operations and classical communication. We provide specific examples of models which allow for the creation of stationary many-particle entanglement, and the emulation of dissipative Ising models. Since the interaction between the systems is mediated via feedback only, there is no intrinsic limit on the range or geometry of the interaction, making the scheme quite versatile.

abstract: Time resolved intensity cross-correlation measurements of radiative cascades are used for studying non-radiative relaxation processes of excited carriers confined in semiconductor quantum dots. We spectrally identify indirect radiative cascades which include intermediate phonon assisted relaxations. The energy of the first photon reveals the multicarrier configuration prior to the non-radiative relaxation, while the energy of the second photon reveals the configuration after the relaxation. The intensity cross correlation measurements thus provide quantitative measures of the non-radiative processes and their selection rules. We construct a model which accurately describes the experimental observations in terms of the electron-phonon and electron-hole exchange interactions. Our measurements and model provide a new tool for engineering relaxation processes in semiconductor nanostructures.

abstract: Understanding the causal influences that hold among the parts of a system is critical both to explaining that system's natural behaviour and to controlling it through targeted interventions. In a quantum world, understanding causal relations is equally important, but the set of possibilities is far richer. The two basic ways in which a pair of time-ordered quantum systems may be causally related are by a cause-effect mechanism or by a common cause acting on both. Here, we show that it is possible to have a coherent mixture of these two possibilities. We realize such a nonclassical causal relation in a quantum optics experiment and derive a set of criteria for witnessing the coherence based on a quantum version of Berkson's paradox. The interplay of causality and quantum theory lies at the heart of challenging foundational puzzles, such as Bell's theorem and the search for quantum gravity, but could also provide a resource for novel quantum technologies.

abstract: We consider the non-equilibrium time evolution of piecewise homogeneous states in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain, a paradigmatic example of interacting integrable model. The initial state can be thought as the result of joining chains with different global properties. Through dephasing, at late times the state becomes locally equivalent to a stationary state which explicitly depends on position and time. We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and derive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of the model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where the chains are prepared: 1) at different temperatures; 2) in the ground state of two different models; 3) in the "domain wall" state. We find excellent agreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on TEBD algorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation values of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.

abstract: Phase transitions, where observable properties of a many-body system change discontinuously, can occur in both open and closed systems. Ultracold atoms have provided an exemplary model system to demonstrate the physics of closed-system phase transitions, confirming many theoretical models and results. Our understanding of dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems is less developed, and experiments that probe this physics even less so. By placing cold atoms in optical cavities, and inducing strong coupling between light and excitations of the atoms, one can experimentally study phase transitions of open quantum systems. Here we observe and study a novel form of nonequilibrium phase transition, the condensation of supermode-density-wave-polaritons. These polaritons are formed from a hybrid "supermode" of cavity photons coupled to atomic density waves of a quantum gas. Because the cavity supports multiple photon spatial modes, and because the matter-light coupling can be comparable to the energy splitting of these modes, the composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the matter-light coupling upon condensation. These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate cavity regime, demonstrate the potential of fully multimode cavities to exhibit physics beyond mean-field theories. Such systems will provide experimental access to nontrivial phase transitions in driven dissipative quantum systems as well as enabling the studies of novel non-equilibrium spin glasses and neuromorphic computation.

abstract: Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. Applications such as precision measurement, interferometry, and quantum computation are enabled by physical systems that have quantum states with robust coherence. With the creation of molecular ensembles at sub-$\mu$K temperatures, diatomic molecules have become a novel system under full quantum control. Here, we report on the observation of stable coherence between a pair of nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic NaK molecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Employing microwave fields, we perform Ramsey spectroscopy and observe coherence times on the scale of one second. This work opens the door for the exploration of single molecules as a versatile quantum memory. Switchable long-range interactions between dipolar molecules can further enable two-qubit gates, allowing quantum storage and processing in the same physical system. Within the observed coherence time, $10^4$ one- and two-qubit gate operations will be feasible.

abstract: The dynamics of atom trapping in a radio-frequency-dressed-state potential formed by static and radio frequency (rf) fields has been studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. Using the simulations, a case of formation of a toroidal trap for cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms is investigated for atoms trapped in a static quadrupole magnetic trap and exposed to an rf-field with temporally increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency. We first calculate the adiabatic rf-dressed potential for an atom interacting with these fields and then apply DSMC algorithm to simulate the motion of the atom in this time dependent adiabatic potential. In the simulations the Landau-Zener (LZ) transition probability is calculated to know if the atom is in the trappable or untrappable dressed state. The results show that, initially at lower rf-field strength, the rf-field ejects atoms from the trap and leads to evaporative cooling of the atom cloud. However at higher rf-field strength, the atoms make LZ transition to the trappable dressed state which results in a toroidal shape to the atom cloud. The results of numerical simulations show a qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

abstract: Master equations of Lindblad type have attained prominent status in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information since they are guaranteed to satisfy fundamental notions of quantum dynamics such as complete positivity. When Lindblad operators are used to describe thermal reservoirs in contact with an open quantum system, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem provide additional mandatory criteria. We show several examples of innocent-looking Lindblad operators which have questionable properties in this regard. Compatibility criteria between Hamiltonian and Lindblad terms as well as consequences of their violation are discussed. An alternative stochastic approach to dissipative quantum dynamics is outlined and illustrated through a harmonic-chain model for which the approach of local Lindblad operators fails.

We also explore a quantum route towards extremality of the black holes.

abstract: Anisotropy is a fundamental property of particle interactions. It occupies a central role in cold and ultra-cold molecular processes, where long range forces have been found to significantly depend on orientation in ultra-cold polar molecule collisions. Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence of quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions regime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although these states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect of anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far. Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of $k_B$ x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of the art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to show that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for $H_2$ molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally ground state $H_2$ interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium. Control over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to switch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the interaction. These quantum phenomena provide a challenging benchmark for even the most advanced theoretical descriptions, highlighting the advantage of using cold collisions to advance the microscopic understanding of particle interactions.
