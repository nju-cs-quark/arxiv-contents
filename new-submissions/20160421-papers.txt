abstract: Methods for achieving quantum control and detection of individual nuclear spins by single electrons of solid-state defects play a central role for quantum information processing and nano-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, with standard techniques, no more than 8 nuclear spins have been resolved. Here we develop a method that improves significantly the ability to spectrally resolve nuclear spins and demonstrate its capabilities with detailed numerical simulations by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre as model system. Based on delayed entanglement control, a technique combining microwave and radio-frequency (rf) fields, nuclei with resonances in a broad frequency band can be unambiguously and individually addressed by the sensor electron. Additionally the spectral resolution can extend beyond the electron spin relaxation time by using a long-lived qubit memory. Our method greatly increases the number of useful register qubits accessible to a defect centre and improves the signals of nano-scale NMR.

abstract: Coherent quantum-state manipulation of trapped ions using classical laser fields is a trademark of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we study aspects of work statistics and irreversibility in a single trapped ion due to sudden interaction with the impinging laser. This is clearly an out-of-equilibrium process where work is performed through illumination of an ion by the laser. Starting with the explicit evaluation of the first moments of the work distribution, we proceed to a careful analysis of irreversibility as quantified by the nonequilibrium lag. The treatment employed here is not restricted to the Lamb-Dicke limit, what allows us to investigate the interplay between nonlinearities and irreversibility. We show, for instance, that in the resolved carrier and sideband regimes, variation of the Lamb-Dicke parameter may cause a non-monotonic behavior of the irreversibility indicator. Counterintuitively, we find a working point where nonlinearity helps reversibility, making the sudden quench of the Hamiltonian closer to what would have been obtained quasistatically and isothermally.

abstract: Are the electromagnetic scalar and vector potentials dispensable? Lev Vaidman has suggested that local interactions of gauge-invariant quantities, e.g. magnetic torques, suffice for the description of all quantum electromagnetic phenomena. We analyze six thought experiments that challenge this suggestion. All of them have explanations in terms of $local$ interactions of gauge-dependent quantities, in addition, some have explanations in terms of nonlocal interactions of gauge-invariant quantities. We claim, however, that two of our examples have no gauge-invariant formal description and that, in general, no local description can dispense with electromagnetic potentials.

abstract: I'm presenting a new elegant formulation of the theory of fully nonlinear adiabatic TWM (FNA-TWM) in terms of elliptic function here. Note that the linear case of SFG and DFG in the undepleted pump approximation described by the FVH representation has been exploited several years ago. For the sake of completeness, I present the pseudo-FVH representation to describe OPA. Moreover, I'm trying to display an overview of TWM processes and show that both the linear cases, the linear adiabatic SFG(DFG) and the linear OPA, are only the special cases of my theory. Finally I also point out that the geometric image of the so-called adiabatic basis acts as the geodesic line of the generalized Bloch sphere.

abstract: Nonlocal unitary operations can create quantum entanglement between distributed particles, and the quantification of created entanglement is a hard problem. It corresponds to the concepts of entangling and assisted entangling power when the input states are respectively product and arbitrary pure states. We analytically derive them for Schmidt-rank-two bipartite unitary and some complex bipartite permutation unitaries. In particular the entangling power of permutation unitary of Schmidt rank three can only take one of two values: $\log_2 9 - 16/9$ or $\log_2 3$ ebits. The entangling power, assisted entangling power and disentangling power of $2\times d_B$ permutation unitaries of Schmidt rank four are all $2$ ebits. These quantities are also derived for generalized Clifford operators. We further show that any bipartite permutation unitary of Schmidt rank greater than two has entangling power greater than 1 ebit. We construct the generalized CNOT gates whose assisted entangling power reaches the maximum. We quantitatively compare the entangling power and assisted entangling power for general bipartite unitaries, and their connection to the disentangling power by proposing a probabilistic protocol for implementing bipartite unitaries.

abstract: According to Landauer's principle, erasing information requires a minimum energy cost. Recently, Vaccaro and Barnett explored the role of multiple conserved quantities in information erasure, and demonstrated that for energy degenerate spin reservoirs, the cost of erasure is solely in terms of a minimum amount of spin angular momentum and no energy. As opposed to the Landauer case, this cost is associated with a discrete variable. We study here the discrete fluctuations in this memory erasure protocol. We obtain the analogous Jarzynski equality and also study the probability of violation of the Vaccaro-Barnett bound when fluctuations are important. We find that the discrete nature of spin angular momentum exchange is reflected as jumps in the probability of violation. We further analyze the statistics in the two different regimes of reservoir spin polarization, and expose a tradeoff between size of the fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We also state the first laws of thermodynamics for this particular erasure protocol. Our work opens up the novel possibilities of heat engines based on information erasure scheme that do not incur an energy cost.

We also explain how Gr\"obner bases can be used to reduce the degree of Hamiltonians.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is the ability of joint quantum systems to possess global properties (correlation among systems) even when subsystems have no definite individual property. Whilst the 2-dimensional (qubit) case is well-understood, currently, tools to characterise entanglement in high dimensions are limited. We experimentally demonstrate a new procedure for entanglement certification that is suitable for large systems, based entirely on information-theoretics. It scales more efficiently than Bell's inequality, and entanglement witness. The method we developed works for arbitrarily large system dimension $d$ and employs only two local measurements of complementary properties. This procedure can also certify whether the system is maximally entangled. We illustrate the protocol for families of bipartite states of qudits with dimension up to $32$ composed of polarisation-entangled photon pairs.

We discuss the experimental conditions under which the detection of either Continuous Spontaneous Localization or fundamental decoherence becomes possible.

abstract: We define the quaternionic quantum walk on a finite graph and investigate its properties. This walk can be considered as a natural quaternionic extension of the Grover walk on a graph. We explain the way to obtain all the right eigenvalues of a quaternionic matrix and a notable property derived from the unitarity condition for the quaternionic quantum walk. Our main results determine all the right eigenvalues of the quaternionic quantum walk by using complex eigenvalues of the quaternionic weighted matrix which is easily derivable from the walk. Since our derivation is owing to a quaternionic generalization of the determinant expression of the second weighted zeta function, we explain the second weighted zeta function and the relationship between the walk and the second weighted zeta function.

abstract: Zero-frequency Casimir theory is analyzed from different viewpoints, focusing on the Drude-plasma issue that turns up when one considers thermal corrections to the Casimir force. The problem is that the plasma model, although leaving out dissipation in the material, apparently gives the best agreement with recent experiments. We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric half-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following categories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by H{\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is replaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic potentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the Drude prediction. No use of Fresnel's reflection coefficients is made at this stage. (2) Then turning to the field theoretical description implying use of the reflection coefficients, we derive results in agreement with the forgoing when first setting the frequency equal to zero, before letting the permittivity becoming large. With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero frequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the surfaces and lies between 0 and 1. This contradicts basic electrostatic theory. (3) Turning to high permeability magnetic materials the TE zero frequency mode describes the static magnetic field in the same way as the TM zero frequency modes describe the static electric fields in electrostatics. With the plasma model magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals. i.e.~metals effectively become superconductors. However, recent experimental results clearly favor the plasma model. We shortly discuss a possible explanation for this apparent conflict with electrostatics.

abstract: For a two-level system, it is believed that a far-off-resonant driving can not help coherent population transfer between the states. In this work, we propose a scheme to implement the coherent transfer with far-off-resonant driving. The scheme works well with both constant driving and Gaussian driving. The total time to finish population transfer is also minimized by optimizing the detuning and coupling constants. We find that the scheme is sensitive to spontaneous emission much more than dephasing. It might find potential applications in X-ray quantum optics and population transfer in Rydberg atoms as well.

abstract: The Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation quantitatively expresses the impossibility of jointly sharp preparation of incompatible observables. However it does not capture the concept of incompatible observables because it can be trivial even for two incompatible observables. We experimentally demonstrate the new stronger uncertainty relations proposed by Maccone and Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 260401 (2014)] relating on that sum of variances are valid in a state-dependent manner and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial for two observables being incompatible on the state of the system being measured. The behaviour we find agrees with the predictions of quantum theory and obeys the new uncertainty relations even for the special states which trivialize Heisenberg-Robertson relation. We realize a direct measurement model and give the first experimental investigation of the strengthened relations.

abstract: Two unknown states can be unambiguously distinguished by a universal programmable discriminator, which has been widely discussed in previous works and the optimal solution has also been obtained. In this paper, we investigate the programmable unambiguous discriminator between two unknown "latitudinal" states, which lie in a subspace of the total state space. By equivalence of unknown pure states to known average mixed states, the optimal solution for this problem is systematically derived, and the analytical success probabilities for the optimal unambiguous discrimination are obtained. It is beyond one's expectation that the optimal setting for the programmable unambiguous discrimination between two unknown "latitudinal" states is the same as that for the universal ones.

abstract: Dynamical decoupling techniques are the method of choice for increasing gate fidelities. While these methods have produced very impressive results in terms of decreasing local noise and increasing the fidelities of single qubit operations, dealing with the noise of two qubit gates has proven more challenging. The main obstacle is that the noise time scale is shorter than the two qubit gate itself so that refocusing methods do not work. We present a measurement and feedback based method to refocus two qubit gates which cannot be refocused by conventional methods. We analyze in detail this method for an error model which is relevant for trapped ions quantum information.

abstract: Does information play a significant role in the foundations of physics? We investigate whether information-theoretic constraints characterize quantum theory. In a C*-algebraic framework, this is known to hold via three equivalences: no broadcasting and noncommutativity; no bit commitment and nonlocality; no signalling and kinematic independence. But this complex linear framework could be said to build in quantum theory from the start. We show that the first two equivalences break, and the third holds, in a framework of generalized, possibly nonlinear, C*-algebras. This uncovers a hierarchy of notions of when (quantum) information is classical.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.05973
abstract: What is called "orthodox" quantum mechanics, as presented in standard foundational discussions, relies on two substantive assumptions --- the projection postulate and the eigenvalue-eigenvector link --- that do not in fact play any part in practical applications of quantum mechanics. I argue for this conclusion on a number of grounds, but primarily on the grounds that the projection postulate fails correctly to account for repeated, continuous and unsharp measurements (all of which are standard in contemporary physics) and that the eigenvalue-eigenvector link implies that virtually all interesting properties are maximally indefinite pretty much always. I present an alternative way of conceptualising quantum mechanics that does a better job of representing quantum mechanics as it is actually used, and in particular that eliminates use of either the projection postulate or the eigenvalue-eigenvector link, and I reformulate the measurement problem within this new presentation of orthodoxy.

abstract: The theory of Quantum Brownian Motion describes the properties of a large class of open quantum systems. Nonetheless, its description in terms of a Born-Markov Master Equation, widely used in literature, is known to violate the positivity of the density operator at very low temperatures. We propose a simple modification of existing models, leading to an equation in the Lindblad form, which is free of this problem. We study the dynamics of the model, including the detailed properties of its stationary solution, for both constant and position-dependent coupling of the Brownian particle to the bath, focusing in particular on the correlations and the squeezing of the probability distribution induced by the environment.

abstract: The Differential Transfer Matrix Method is extended to the complex plane, which allows dealing with singularities at turning points. The result for real-valued systems are simplified and a pair of basis functions is found. These bases are a bit less accurate than WKB solutions but much easier to work with. Furthermore, these bases exactly satisfy the initial conditions and may go over the turning points without the divergent behavior of WKB solutions. The findings of this paper allow explicit evaluation of eigenvalues of confined modes with high precision, as demonstrated by few examples.

The memory capacity of up to 60 independent atomic spin-wave modes is evidenced by analyzing angular distributions of coincidences between Stokes and time-delayed anti-Stokes photons, observed down to the single spin-wave excitation level. We also show how to practically enhance rates of single and multiple photons generation by combining our multimode emissive memory with existing optical switches reconfigurable much faster than the memory several $\mu$s-lifetime.

abstract: The Casimir free energy and pressure of thin metal films deposited on metallic plates are considered using the Lifshitz theory and the Drude and plasma model approaches to the role of conduction electrons. The bound electrons are taken into account by using the complete optical data of film and plate metals. It is shown that for films of several tens of nanometers thickness the Casimir free energy and pressure calculated using these approaches differ by hundreds and thousands percent and can be easily discriminated experimentally. According to our results, the free energy of a metal film does not vanish in the limiting case of ideal metal if the Drude model approach is used in contradiction with the fact that the fluctuating field cannot penetrate in its interior. Numerical computations of the Casimir free energy and pressure of Ag and Au films deposited on Cu and Al plates have been performed using both theoretical approaches. It is shown that the free energy of a film can be both negative and positive depending on the metals used. For a Au film on a Ag plate and vice versa the Casimir energy of a film changes its sign with increasing film thickness. Applications of the obtained results for resolving the Casimir puzzle and the problem of stability of thin films are discussed.

abstract: Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as the calculus they imply, are non-unique. The examples of four-dimensional spaces, $\mathbb{R}_+^4$ and $(-L/2,L/2)^4$, are considered where different types of arithmetic and calculus coexist simultaneously. In all the examples there exists a non-Diophantine arithmetic that makes the space globally Minkowskian, and thus the laws of physics are formulated in terms of the corresponding calculus. However, when one switches to the `natural' Diophantine arithmetic and calculus, the Minkowskian character of the space is lost and what one effectively obtains is a Lorentzian manifold. I discuss in more detail the problem of electromagnetic fields produced by a pointlike charge. The solution has the standard form when expressed in terms of the non-Diophantine formalism. When the `natural' formalsm is used, the same solution looks as if the fields were created by a charge located in an expanding universe, with nontrivially accelerating expansion. The effect is clearly visible also in solutions of the Friedman equation with vanishing cosmological constant. All of this suggests that phenomena attributed to dark energy may be a manifestation of a miss-match between the arithmetic employed in mathematical modeling, and the one occurring at the level of natural laws. Arithmetic is as physical as geometry.

abstract: We study all-optical switches operating on a single four-level atom with the $N$-type transition configuration in a two-mode nanofiber cavity with a significant length (on the order of $20$ mm) and a moderate finesse (on the order of 300) under the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In our model, the gate and probe fields are the quantum nanofiber-cavity fields excited by weak classical light pulses, and the parameters of the $D_2$ line of atomic cesium are used. We examine two different switching schemes. The first scheme is based on the effect of the presence of a photon in the gate mode on the EIT of the probe mode. The second scheme is based on the use of EIT to store a photon of the gate mode in the population of an appropriate atomic level, which leads to the reduction of the transmission of the field in the probe mode. We investigate the dependencies of the switching contrast on various parameters, such as the cavity length, the mirror reflectivity, and the detunings and powers of the cavity driving field pulses. For a nanofiber cavity with fiber radius of 250 nm, cavity length of 20 mm, and cavity finesse of 313 and a cesium atom at a distance of 200 nm from the fiber surface, we numerically obtain a switching contrast on the order of about 67% for the first scheme and of about 95% for the second scheme. These switching operations require small mean numbers of photons in the nanofiber cavity gate and probe modes.

abstract: We present an improved shadow wave function approach to quantum Monte Carlo for large-scale fermionic systems. It is based on employing the antisymmetric shadow wave function in conjunction with the Gaussian determinant method to reduce the variance and an enhanced stochastic reconfiguration scheme to efficiently optimize the trail wave function, as well as refined twist averaged boundary conditions and periodic coordinates techniques. The predictive power of this approach is demonstrated by revisiting the pressure-induced metal-insulator-transition of solid hydrogen. It is found that the ameliorated accuracy of the antisymmetric shadow wave function results in a significantly increased transition pressure.

abstract: We prove that the corner angle distributions in the bound three-body system AAB, which consists of two particles of type A and one particle of type B, approach universal form if the pair AA has a virtual state at zero energy and the binding energy of AAB goes to zero. We derive explicit expressions for the universal corner angle distributions in terms of elementary functions, which depend solely on the mass ratio m(A)/m(B) and do not depend on pair interactions. On the basis of experimental data and calculations we demonstrate that such systems as the asymmetric Helium trimer $^3$He$^4$He$_2$ and the halo nucleus $^{22}$C exhibit universal features. Thus our result establishes an interesting link between atomic and nuclear physics through the few-body universality.
