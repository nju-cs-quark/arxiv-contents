abstract: We obtain stationary measures for the one-dimensional three-state Grover walk with one defect by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem. We clarify a relation between stationary and limit measures of the walk.

abstract: In approximate density functional theory (DFT), the self-interaction error is a pervasive electron delocalization associated with underestimated insulating gaps. It exhibits a predominantly quadratic energy-density curve that is amenable to correction using computationally efficient, constraint-resembling methods such as DFT + Hubbard U (DFT+U). Constrained DFT (cDFT) exactly enforces conditions on DFT by means of self-consistently optimized Lagrange multipliers, and its use to automate DFT+U type corrections is a compelling possibility. We show that constraints beyond linear order are incompatible with cDFT. For DFT+U, we overcome this by separating its Hubbard U parameters into linear and quadratic terms. For a one-electron system, the resulting generalized DFT+U method can recover the exact subspace occupancy and free-energy, but neither the exact total-energy nor the exact ionization potential, for reasonable parameters. Approximate functionals thus cannot be systematically corrected by constraining their ground-states.
