abstract: The interpretation of quantum theory is one of the longest-standing debates in physics. Type-I interpretations see quantum probabilities as determined by intrinsic properties of the world. Type-II interpretations see quantum probabilities as not directly dealing with intrinsic properties of the world but with relational experiences between an observer and the world. It is usually believed that deciding between these two types cannot be made simply on purely physical grounds but it requires an act of metaphysical judgement. Here we show that, although the problem is undecidable within the framework of quantum theory, it is decidable, under some assumptions, within the framework of thermodynamics. We prove that type-I interpretations are incompatible with the following assumptions: (i) the decision of which measurement is performed on a quantum system can be made independently of the system, (ii) a quantum system has limited memory, and (iii) Landauer's principle is valid. We consider an ideal experiment in which an individual quantum system is submitted to a sequence of quantum projective measurements that leave the system in pure quantum states. We show that in any type-I interpretation satisfying (i)-(iii) the system must reset its internal state, which implies that a minimum amount of heat per measurement has to be dissipated into the system's environment. We calculate a lower bound to the heat dissipated per measurement assuming that the measurements are chosen from a set of size $2^n$. Then, we show that this lower bound becomes infinite in the limit of $n$ tending to infinity. This leads to the conclusion that either type-I interpretations are untenable or at least one of the assumptions (i)-(iii) has to be abandoned.

abstract: We study how to understand the complex coordinates involved in the non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric systems. We explore a PT-symmetric oscillator model to show that the entire information on the complex position is attainable. Its real part is from the observation while its imaginary part is from the non-Hermiticity parameter. We also propose a new complex extension of P-transformation and T-transformation (the `parity' and `time reflection' respectively). Particularly, the P-transformation realizes the left-right reflection in the complex plane.

abstract: Most research on spin squeezing thus far has focused on realizations involving either atomic or nuclear degrees of freedom. In this article we discuss a concrete proposal for spin squeezing the ultracold ground state polar paramagnetic molecule OH, a system currently under fine control in the laboratory. Starting from an experimentally relevant effective Hamiltonian, we identify a parameter regime where different combinations of static electric and magnetic fields can be used to realize the single-axis twisting Hamiltonian of Kitagawa and Ueda [M. Kitagawa and M. Ueda, Phys. Rev. A 47, 5138 (1993)], the uniform field Hamiltonian proposed by Law et al. [C. K. Law, H. T Ng and P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev. A 63, 055601 (2001)], and a model of field propagation in a Kerr medium considered by Agarwal and Puri [G. S. Agarwal and R. R. Puri, Phys. Rev. A 39, 2969 (1989)]. To support our conclusions, we provide analytical expressions as well as numerical calculations, including optimization of field strengths and accounting for the effects of field misalignment. Our results have consequences for applications such as precision spectroscopy, techniques such as magnetometry, and stereochemical effects such as the orientation-to-alignment transition.

abstract: Optical nanofibers provide a rich platform for exploring atomic and optical phenomena even when they support only a single spatial mode. Nanofibers supporting higher-order modes provide additional degrees of freedom to enable complex evanescent field profiles for interaction with the surrounding medium, but local control of these profiles requires nondestructive evaluation of the propagating fields. Here, we use Rayleigh scattering for rapid measurement of the propagation of light in few-mode optical nanofibers. Imaging the Rayleigh scattered light provides direct visualization of the spatial evolution of propagating fields throughout the entire fiber, including the transition from core-cladding guidance to cladding-air guidance. We resolve the interference between higher-order modes to determine local beat lengths and modal content along the fiber, and show that the modal superposition in the waist can be systematically controlled by adjusting the input superposition. With this diagnostic we can measure variations in the radius of the fiber waist to below 3 nm in situ using purely optical means. This nondestructive technique also provides useful insight into light propagation in optical nanofibers.

abstract: Schr\"odinger's thought experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of both alive and dead states reveals profound consequences of quantum mechanics and has attracted enormous interests. Here we propose a straightforward method to create quantum superposition states of a living microorganism by putting a small bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator. Our proposal is based on recent developments that the center-of-mass oscillation of a 15-$\mu$m-diameter aluminium membrane has been cooled to its quantum ground state [Nature 475, 359 (2011)], and entangled with a microwave field [Science, 342, 710 (2013)]. A microorganism with a mass much smaller than the mass of the electromechanical membrane will not significantly affect the quality factor of the membrane and can be cooled to the quantum ground state together with the membrane. Quantum superposition and teleportation of its center-of-mass motion state can be realized with the help of superconducting microwave circuits. More importantly, the internal states of a microorganism, such as the electron spin of a glycine radical, can be prepared in a quantum superposition state and entangled with its center-of-mass motion. Our proposal can be realized with state-of-art technologies. The proposed setup is also a quantum-limited magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM) that not only can detect the existence of an electron spin, but also can coherently manipulate and detect the quantum state of the spin.

abstract: We theoretically study the generation of quantum correlations in a hybrid system composed by two interacting semiconductor quantum dots mediated by a metal nanoparticle and coupled to an external applied continuous wave laser field. All interactions present in the system are treated using a semiclassical approximation. We report entanglement of formation which gives information about entanglement quantum correlations. We have found that for proper values of the characteristic parameters of the hybrid system and the intensity of the applied field we can produce steady state quantum correlations of significant value so that they can be useful in quantum information and computation processes.

abstract: In recent years, Bayesian methods have been proposed as a solution to a wide range of issues in quantum state and process tomography. State-of- the-art Bayesian tomography solutions suffer from three problems: numerical intractability, a lack of informative prior distributions, and an inability to track time-dependent processes. Here, we solve all three problems. First, we use modern statistical methods, as pioneered by Husz\'ar and Houlsby and by Ferrie, to make Bayesian tomography numerically tractable. Our approach allows for practical computation of Bayesian point and region estimators for quantum states and channels. Second, we propose the first informative priors on quantum states and channels. Finally, we develop a method that allows online tracking of time-dependent states and estimates the drift and diffusion processes affecting a state. We provide source code and animated visual examples for our methods.

abstract: We present an exact quantization condition for the time independent solutions (energy eigenstates) of the one-dimensional Dirac equation with a scalar potential well that gives only two `effective' turning points (defined by the roots of $V(x)+mc^2=\pm E$) for a given energy $E$ and satisfies $\min V(x)+mc^2\geq 0$. This result generalizes the previously known non-relativistic quantization formula and preserves many physically desirable symmetries, besides, attaining the correct non-relativistic limit. A numerical routine is also presented that makes the formulation useful for computing energy eigenvalues.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03812
abstract: In general, classical measurement statistics of a quantum measurement is disturbed by performing an additional incompatible quantum measurement beforehand. Using this observation, we introduce a state-independent definition of disturbance by relating it to the distinguishability problem between two classical statistical distributions --- one resulting from a single quantum measurement and the other from a succession of two quantum measurements. Interestingly, we find an error-disturbance trade-off relation for any measurements in two-dimensional Hilbert space and for measurements with mutually unbiased bases in any finite-dimensional Hilbert space. This relation shows that error should be reduced to zero in order to minimize the sum of error and disturbance. We conjecture that a similar trade-off relation can be generalized to any measurements in an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

abstract: Decoherence of superconducting transmon qubits is purported to be consistent with surface loss from two-level systems on the substrate surface. Here, we present a study of surface loss in transmon devices, explicitly designed to have varying sensitivities to different surface loss contributors. Our experiments also encompass two particular different sapphire substrates, which reveal the onset of a yet unknown additional loss mechanism outside of surface loss for one of the substrates. Tests across different wafers and devices demonstrate substantial variation, and we emphasize the importance of testing large numbers of devices for disentangling di?erent sources of decoherence.

abstract: We demonstrate the simultaneous dressing of both vacuum-to-exciton and exciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot in a high-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by spectrally tuning the quantum dot emission with respect to the cavity mode. The cavity couples to both transitions and amplifies the Rabi-frequency of the likewise resonant cw laser, driving the transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the emission lines, which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the cavity-laser detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom correctly predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission spectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further provided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for cavity coupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor medium.

abstract: Conventional statistical mechanics describes large systems and averages over many particles or over many trials. But work, heat, and entropy impact the small scales that experimentalists can increasingly control, e.g., in single-molecule experiments. The statistical mechanics of small scales has been quantified with two toolkits developed in quantum information theory: resource theories and one-shot information theory. The field has boomed recently, but the theorems amassed have hardly impacted experiments. Can thermodynamic resource theories be realized experimentally? Via what steps can we shift the theory toward physical realizations? Should we care? I present eleven opportunities in physically realizing thermodynamic resource theories.

abstract: We systematically study the localization effect in discrete-time quantum walks on a honeycomb network and establish the mathematical framework. We focus on the Grover walk first and rigorously derive the limit form of the walker's state, showing it has a certain probability to be localized at the starting position. The relationship between localization and the initial coin state is concisely represented by a linear map. We also define and calculate the average probability of localization by generating random initial states. Further, coin operators varying with positions are considered and the sufficient condition for localization is discussed. We also similarly analyze another four-state Grover walk. Theoretical predictions are all in accord with numerical simulation results. Finally, our results are compared with previous works to demonstrate the unusual trapping effect of quantum walks on a honeycomb network, as well as the advantages of our method.

abstract: We consider a system consisting of a large individual quantum dot with excitonic resonance coupled to a single mode photonic cavity in the nonlinear regime when exciton- exciton interaction becomes important. We show that in the presence of time-modulated external coherent pumping the system demonstrates essentially non classical behavior reflected in sub-Poissonian statistics of exciton- and photon-modes and the Wigner functions with negative values in phase-space for time-intervals exceeding the characteristic time of dissipative processes, $t\gg\gamma^{-1}$. It is shown that these results are cardinally different from the analogous results in the regime of the monomode continues-wave (cw) excitation.

abstract: The generic bound of quantum speed limit time (the minimal evolution time) for a qubit system interacting with structural environment is investigated. We define a new bound for the quantum speed limit. It is shown that the non-Markovianity and the population of the excited state can fail to signal the quantum evolution acceleration, but the initial-state dependence is an important factor. In particular, we find that different quantum speed limits could produce contradictory predictions on the quantum evolution acceleration.

abstract: In this paper we present a high-level numerical model for estimating rates of accidental correlations between a pair of passively quenched Geiger mode avalanche photodiodes operating in the saturated regime. By considering the recovery time of both the diodes and the detection circuit we introduce the concept of an "effective duty cycle" and show that it may be estimated by numeric simulation. The impact of effective duty cycle on the observed accidental rate is examined and we demonstrate that the updated model leads to an improved correction factor in actual experiments. This will improve the signal-to-noise ratio in applications depending on correlation measurements.

abstract: We present a quantum circuit representation consisting entirely of qubit initialisations (I), a network of controlled-NOT gates (C) and measurements with respect to different bases (M). The ICM representation is useful for optimisation of quantum circuits that include teleportation, which is required for fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. The non-deterministic nature of teleportation necessitates the conditional introduction of corrective quantum gates and additional ancillae during circuit execution. Therefore, the standard optimisation objectives, gate count and number of wires, are not well-defined for general teleportation-based circuits. The transformation of a circuit into the ICM representation provides a canonical form for an exact fault-tolerant, error corrected circuit needed for optimisation prior to the final implementation in a realistic hardware model.

abstract: Quantum simulators based on nuclear spin-systems controlled by NMR techniques have been used for studying various quantum phenomena. In this work, using a four-qubit NMR quantum simulator, we investigate the recently postulated quantum pigeon-hole effect. In mathematics, the pigeonhole effect is described by a set of three objects being allocated with only two containers. Classically, one would expect at least one container to accommodate more than one object. However, recently it was predicted that there exist quantum scenarios wherein three quantum particles appear to reside in two containers in such a way that no two particles can be simultaneously assigned with a single container. In our experiments, quantum pigeons are emulated by three nuclear qubits whose states are probed jointly and noninvasively by an ancillary spin. The qubit-states $\{\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}\}$ emulate the two containers available for each of the qubits. The experimental results are in good agreement with quantum theoretical predictions.

abstract: One long-standing difficult problem in quantum dissipative dynamics is to solve the spin-boson model in a non-Markovian regime where a tractable systematic master equation does not exist. The spin-boson model is particularly important due to its crucial applications in quantum noise control and manipulation as well as its central role in developing quantum theories of open systems. Here we solve this important model by developing a non-Markovian quantum Langevin approach. By projecting the quantum Langevin equation onto the coherent states of the bath, we can derivie a set of non-Markovian quantum Bloch equations containing no explicit noise variables. This special feature offers a tremendous advantage over the existing stochastic Schr\"odinger equations in numerical simulations. The physical significance and generality of our approach are briefly discussed.

abstract: We derive a general theory for the joint weak measurement with arbitrary postselection and employ it in the time-delay measurement. Especially, we study two special cases, i.e., the balanced and unbalanced postselection regimes, and present an experiment to verify the theoretical results. The experimental results show that under similar conditions, the signal-to-noise ratio of using joint weak measurement scheme remains higher than 12 dB when the measured time-delay is smaller the ultimate precision limit of the weak-value amplification scheme. Moreover, the joint weak measurement scheme is robust to the misalignment errors and the wavelength-dependency of optical components, which indicates its advantage of improving the measurement precision with convenient laboratory equipments.

abstract: In order to improve the key rate of the decoy-state method, we need to jointly study yields of different bases. Given the delicate fact that pulses of the same preparation state can have different counting rates if they are measured in different bases, for example, those vacuum pulses and those single-photon pulses, existing results of decoy-state quantum key distribution using biased bases are actually flawed by assuming that they are equal. We fix this flaw through using the idea that yields of pulses prepared in different bases are same provided that they are prepared in the same state and also they are measured in the same basis, for example, those single-photon pulses prepared in different bases but measured in the same basis. Based on this, we present correct formulas for the decoy-state method using biased bases. Taking the effects of statistical fluctuations into account, we then numerically study the key rates of different protocols with all parameters being fully optimized. Our result confirms the prior art conclusion that decoy-state method using biased bases can have advantage to the symmetric protocol with unbiased bases. We obtain high key rates of our 4-intensity protocol (two in X bases and two in Z bases) without using any vacuum source.

We test our scheme by simulating coherence and entanglement detection in a three-qubit GHZ-diagonal state.

abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum estimation by means of parametric amplification in circuit Quantum Electrodynamics. The modulation of a SQUID interrupting a superconducting waveguide transforms an initial thermal two-mode squeezed state in such a way that the new state is sensitive to the features of the parametric amplifier. We find the optimal initial parameters which maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. In order to achieve a large number of independent measurements we propose to use an array of non-interacting resonators. We show that the combination of both large QFI and large number of measurements enables -in principle- the use of this setup for Quantum Metrology applications.

abstract: The security proof of continuous variable (CV) measurement device independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) cannot be reduced to the analysis of one-mode Gaussian attacks (in particular, independent entangling-cloner attacks). To stress this point, the present note provides a very simple (almost trivial) argument, showing that there are an infinite number of two-mode Gaussian attacks which cannot be reduced to or simulated by one-mode Gaussian attacks. This result further confirms that the security analysis of CV-MDI-QKD must involve a careful minimization over two-mode attacks as originally performed in [S. Pirandola et al., Nature Photon. 9, 397-402 (2015)].

abstract: We present a few-parameter ansatz for pulses to implement arbitrary simultaneous single-qubit rotations in frequency-crowded multi-level systems. Specifically, we consider a system of two qutrits whose working and leakage transitions suffer from spectral crowding (detuned by $\delta$). In order to achieve precise controllability, we make use of two driving fields (each having two quadratures) at two different tones to implement arbitrary simultaneous rotations. Expanding the waveforms in terms of Hanning windows, we show how analytic pulses containing smooth and composite-pulse features can easily achieve gate errors $<10^{-4}$ and considerably outperform known adiabatic techniques. Moreover, we find a generalization of the WahWah method by Schutjens et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052330 (2013)] that allows precise separate single-qubit rotations for all gate times beyond a quantum speed limit. We find in all cases a quantum speed limit $\sim 2\pi/\delta$ for the gate time and show that our pulses are robust against variations in system parameters and filtering due to transfer functions, making them suitable for experimental implementations.

abstract: Adiabatic state engineering is a powerful technique in quantum information and quantum control. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior. Here, we propose a superadiabatic route to implement universal quantum computation. Our method is based on the realization of piecewise controlled superadiabatic evolutions. Remarkably, they can be obtained by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. In particular, we discuss the implementation of fast rotation gates and arbitrary n-qubit controlled gates, which can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates. Concerning the energy cost of the superadiabatic implementation, we show that it is dictated by the quantum speed limit, providing an upper bound for the corresponding adiabatic counterparts.

abstract: The laws of thermodynamics put limits to the efficiencies of thermal machines. Analogues of these laws are now established for quantum engines weakly and passively coupled to the environment providing a framework to find improvements to their performance. Systems whose interaction with the environment is actively controlled do not fall in that framework. Here we consider systems actively and locally coupled to the environment, evolving with a so-called boundary-driven Lindblad equation. Starting from a unitary description of the system plus the environment we simultaneously obtain the Lindblad equation and the appropriate expressions for heat, work and entropy-production of the system extending the framework for the analysis of new, and some already proposed, quantum heat engines. We illustrate our findings in spin 1/2 chains and explain why an XX chain coupled in this way to a single heat bath relaxes to thermodynamic-equilibrium while and XY chain does not. Additionally, we show that an XX chain coupled to a left and a right heat baths behaves as a quantum engine, a heater or refrigerator depending on the parameters, with efficiencies bounded by Carnot efficiencies.

abstract: The properties of quantum information in space-time can be investigated by studying operational tasks. In one such task, summoning, an unknown quantum state is supplied at one point, and a call is made at another for it to be returned at a third. Hayden-May recently proved necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteeing successful return of a summoned state for finite sets of call and return points when there is a guarantee of at most one summons. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions when there may be several possible summonses and complying with any one constitutes success. We show there is a "quantum paradox of choice" in summoning: the extra freedom in completing the task makes it strictly harder. This intriguing result has practical applications for distributed quantum computing and cryptography and also implications for our understanding of relativistic quantum information and its localization in space-time.

abstract: We study discrete quantum dynamics where single evolution step consists of unitary system transformation followed by decoherence via coupling to an environment. Often non-Markovian memory effects are attributed to structured environments whereas here we take a more general approach within discrete setting. In addition of controlling the structure of the environment, we are interested in how local unitaries on the open system allow the appearance and control of memory effects. Our first simple qubit model, where local unitary is followed by dephasing, illustrates how memory effects arise despite of having no-structure in the environment the system is coupled with. We then elaborate this observation by constructing a model for open quantum walk where the unitary coin and transfer operation is augmented with dephasing of the coin. The results demonstrate that in the limit of strong dephasing within each evolution step, the combined coin-position open system always displays memory effects and their quantity is independent of the structure of the environment. Our construction makes possible an experimentally realizable open quantum walk with photons exhibiting non-Markovian features.

abstract: We present recursive multiport schemes for implementing quantum Fourier transforms and the inversion step in Grover's algorithm on an integrated linear optics device. In particular, each scheme shows how to execute a quantum operation on $2d$ modes using a pair of circuits for the same operation on $d$ modes. To evaluate the schemes against realistic errors, we ran simulations of proof-of-principle experiments using a simple fabrication model of silicon-based photonic integrated devices that employ directional couplers and thermo-optic modulators for beam splitters and phase shifters, respectively. We find that high-fidelity performance is achievable with our multiport circuits for $2$-qubit and $3$-qubit quantum Fourier transforms, and for quantum search on $4$-item and $8$-item databases.

abstract: We present here a compact and self-contained review of recently developed Keldysh formalism for multiple parallel worlds. The formalism has been applied to consistent quantum evaluation of the flows of informational quantities, in particular, to evaluation of Renyi and Shannon entropy flows. We start with the formulation of standard and extended Keldysh technique in single world in a form convenient for our presentation. We explain the use of Keldysh contours encompassing multiple parallel worlds In the end, we shortly summarize the concrete results obtained with the method.

authors: Tomas Jochym-O'Connor, Stephen D. Bartlett

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04255
abstract: We introduce a new class of 3D color codes, which we call stacked codes, together with a fault-tolerant transformation that will map logical qubits encoded in 2D color codes into stacked codes and back. The stacked code allows for the transversal implementation of a non-Clifford $\pi/8$ logical gate, which when combined with the logical Clifford gates that are transversal in the 2D color code give a gate set which is both fault-tolerant and universal without requiring non-stabilizer magic states. We then show that the layers forming the stacked code can be unfolded and arranged in a 2D layout. As only Clifford gates can be implemented transversally for 2D topological stabilizer codes, a non-local operation must be incorporated in order to allow for this transversal application of a non-Clifford gate. Our code achieves this operation through the transformation from a 2D color code to the unfolded stacked code induced by measuring only geometrically local stabilizers and gauge operators within the bulk of 2D color codes together with a non-local operator that has support on a 1D boundary between such 2D codes. We believe that this proposed method to implement the non-local operation is a realistic one for 2D stabilizer layouts and would be beneficial in avoiding the large overheads caused by magic state distillation.

abstract: In a complex system, the individual components are neither so tightly coupled or correlated that they can all be treated as a single unit, nor so uncorrelated that they can be approximated as independent entities. Instead, patterns of interdependency lead to structure at multiple scales of organization. Evolution excels at producing such complex structures. In turn, the existence of these complex interrelationships within a biological system affects the evolutionary dynamics of that system. I present a mathematical formalism for multiscale structure, grounded in information theory, which makes these intuitions quantitative, and I show how dynamics defined in terms of population genetics or evolutionary game theory can lead to multiscale organization. For complex systems, "more is different," and I address this from several perspectives. Spatial host--consumer models demonstrate the importance of the structures which can arise due to dynamical pattern formation. Evolutionary game theory reveals the novel effects which can result from multiplayer games, nonlinear payoffs and ecological stochasticity. Replicator dynamics in an environment with mesoscale structure relates to generalized conditionalization rules in probability theory. The idea of natural selection "acting at multiple levels" has been mathematized in a variety of ways, not all of which are equivalent. We will face down the confusion, using the experience developed over the course of this thesis to clarify the situation.

abstract: Plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering can push single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy beyond a regime addressable by classical electrodynamics. We employ a quantum electrodynamics (QED) description of the coherent interaction of plasmons and molecular vibrations that reveal the emergence of nonlinearities in the inelastic response of the system. For realistic situations, we predict the onset of \textit{phonon-stimulated Raman scattering} and an counter-intuitive dependence of the anti-Stokes emission on the frequency of excitation. We further show that this novel QED framework opens a venue to analyze the correlations of photons emitted at a plasmonic cavity

abstract: Room-temperature semiconductor quantum dot excitons in InGaN nanostructures used as single and entangled state photon sources could have a large impact in many areas of quantum information including quantum cryptography,1-2 quantum computation3-4 and quantum metrology,5 where currently solid state devices have required cryogenic cooling. Here we present coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy data on an ensemble of In0.54Ga0.46N dots-in-nanowires (DINWs) that show pronounced resonances that persist up to room temperature in the nonlinear optical spectrum, a finding that we show is consistent with the presence of self-formed quantum dot excitons in the system. The data enables the first demonstration measurement of optical absorption by DINW excitons which is differentiated from radiative background states formed by material disorder. This finding opens up the way to the possible engineering of these structures for single photon emitters and quantum devices at room temperature.

abstract: We discuss the universal nature of relaxation in isolated many-body quantum systems subjected to global and strong periodic driving. Our rigorous Floquet analysis shows that the energy of the system remains almost constant up to an exponentially long time in frequency for arbitrary initial states and that an effective Hamiltonian obtained by a truncation of the Floquet-Magnus expansion is a quasi-conserved quantity for long time scale. These two general properties lead to intriguing classification on the initial stage of relaxation, one of which is similar to the prethermalization phenomenon in quasi-integrable systems.

abstract: Secrecy issues of free-space optical links realizing information theoretically secure communications as well as high transmission rates are discussed. We numerically study secrecy communication rates of optical wiretap channel based on on-off keying modulation under typical conditions met in satellite-ground links. It is shown that under reasonable degraded conditions on a wiretapper, information theoretically secure communications should be possible in a much wider distance range than a range limit of quantum key distribution, enabling secure optical links between geostationary earth orbit satellites and ground stations with currently available technologies. We also provide the upper bounds on the decoding error probability and the leaked information to estimate a necessary code length for given required levels of performances. This result ensures that a reasonable length wiretap channel code for our proposed scheme must exist.

We follow the analysis of the Dirac equation in the curved spacetime with torsion, proposed by Kostelecky (Phys. Rev. D69, 105009 (2004)), and apply the Foldy--Wouthuysen transformations. We derive the effective low-energy gravitational potentials for slow fermions, coupled to the gravitational field of the Earth, the chameleon field and to torsion with minimal and non-minimal couplings.

abstract: We study theoretically the squeezing spectrum and second-order correlation function of the output light for an optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator modulates the cavity linewidth (dissipative coupling). We find strong squeezing coinciding with the normal-mode frequencies of the linearized system. In contrast to dispersive coupling, squeezing is possible in the resolved-sideband limit simultaneously with sideband cooling. The second-order correlation function shows damped oscillations, whose properties are given by the mechanical-like, the optical-like normal mode, or both, and can be below shot-noise level at finite times, $g^{(2)} (\tau) < 1$.

abstract: It was shown that quantum mechanical qubit states as elements of two dimensional complex space can be generalized to elements of even subalgebra of geometric (Clifford) algebra over Euclidian space. The construction critically depends on generalization of formal, unspecified, complex plane to arbitrary variable, but explicitly defined, planes in 3D, and of usual Hopf fibration to maps generated by arbitrary unit value bivectors. Analysis of the new structure demonstrates that quantum state evolution in terms of two dimensional complex space gives only restricted information compared to that in even geometric algebra.

abstract: We report on the experimental observation of a strongly interacting gas of ultracold two-electron fermions with orbital degree of freedom and magnetically tunable interactions. This realization has been enabled by the demonstration of a novel kind of Feshbach resonance occurring in the scattering of two 173Yb atoms in different nuclear and electronic states. The strongly interacting regime at resonance is evidenced by the observation of anisotropic hydrodynamic expansion of the two-orbital Fermi gas. These results pave the way towards the realization of new quantum states of matter with strongly correlated fermions with orbital degree of freedom.
