abstract: A causal structure is a relationship between observed variables that in general restricts the set of possible correlations between them. This relationship can be mediated by unobserved systems, which correspond to random variables in the classical case and shared density operators in the quantum case. Here we investigate the use of entropy vectors - vectors whose components correspond to the entropies of each subset of the observed variables - as a means to differentiate between the classical and quantum cases of particular causal structures. We use non-Shannon entropic inequalities to give additional constraints on the sets of possible entropy vectors in the classical case and hence obtain tighter outer approximations of the set of realisable entropy vectors. We also discuss how to obtain inner approximations. We provide several examples and analyse the triangle causal structure in detail. In most causal structures where it is unknown whether or not there is a classical-quantum separation in terms of entropy vectors, non-Shannon inequalities give a tighter characterisation in the classical case. The question of whether these improved characterisations also hold in the quantum case remains open, i.e., we remain without an example of an entropy vector that is attainable in a quantum causal structure, but not in the classical analogue. These techniques may also shed light on the question of whether non-Shannon inequalities also hold for the von Neumann entropy.

abstract: We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that the state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value $r$. In this scenario two notions of informationally complete measurements emerge: rank-$r$ complete measurements and rank-$r$ strictly-complete measurements. Whereas in the first notion, a rank-$r$ state is uniquely identified from within the set of rank-$r$ states, in the second notion the same state is uniquely identified from within the set of all physical states, of any rank. We argue, therefore, that strictly-complete measurements are compatible with convex optimization, and we prove that they allow robust quantum state estimation in the presence of experimental noise. We also show that rank-$r$ strictly-complete measurements are as efficient as rank-$r$ complete measurements. We construct examples of strictly-complete measurements and give a complete description of their structure in the context of matrix completion. Moreover, we numerically show that a few random bases form such measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency-robustness property for different strictly-complete measurements with numerical experiments. We thus conclude that only strictly-complete measurements are useful for practical tomography.

abstract: P\"oschl-Teller-driven solutions for quantum mechanical fluctuations are triggered off by single scalar field theories obtained through a systematic perturbative procedure for generating deformed defects. The analytical properties concerning the quantum fluctuations in one-dimension, zero-mode states, first- and second- excited states, and energy density profiles are all obtained from deformed topological and non-topological structures supported by real scalar fields. Results are firstly derived from an integrated $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, with corresponding generalizations applied to starting $\lambda \chi^4$ and {\em sine}-Gordon theories. By focusing our calculations on structures supported by the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, the outcome of our study suggests an exact quantitative correspondence to P\"oschl-Teller-driven systems. Embedded into the perturbative quantum mechanics framework, such a correspondence turns into a helpful tool for computing excited states and continuous mode solutions, as well as their associated energy spectrum, for quantum fluctuations of perturbatively deformed structures. Perturbative deformations create distinct physical scenarios in the context of exactly solvable quantum systems and may also work as an analytical support for describing novel braneworld universes embedded into a $5$-dimensional gravity bulks.

abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a universal concept throughout science. For instance, the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm of translational symmetry breaking underlies the classification of nearly all quantum phases of matter and explains the emergence of crystals, insulators, and superconductors. Usually, the consequences of translational invariance are studied in large systems to suppress edge effects which cause undesired symmetry breaking. While this approach works for investigating global properties, studies of local observables and their correlations require access and control of the individual constituents. Periodic boundary conditions, on the other hand, could allow for translational symmetry in small systems where single particle control is achievable. Here, we crystallize up to fifteen 40Ca+ ions in a microscopic ring with inherent periodic boundary conditions. We show the ring's translational symmetry is preserved at millikelvin temperatures by delocalizing the Doppler laser cooled ions. This establishes an upper bound for undesired symmetry breaking at a level where quantum control becomes feasible. These findings pave the way towards studying quantum many-body physics with translational symmetry at the single particle level in a variety of disciplines from simulation of Hawking radiation to exploration of quantum phase transitions.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the generalized monogamy inequalities in terms of convex-roof extend- ed negativity (CREN) in multi-level systems. The generalized monogamy inequalities provide the upper and lower bounds of bipartite entanglement, which are obtained by using the CREN and the convex-roof extended negativity of assistance (CRENOA). Furthermore, we show that the CREN of multi-qubit pure states satisfies some monogamous relations. We further test the generalized monogamy inequalities for qudits by considering partially coherent superposition of a generalized W-class state with the vacuum and show that the generalized monogamy inequalities for qudits is satisfied in this case as well.

abstract: The counterfactuality of recently proposed protocols is analyzed. A definition of `counterfactuality' is offered and it is argued that an interaction-free measurement of the presence of an opaque object can be named `counterfactual', while proposed "counterfactual" measurements of the absence of such objects are not counterfactual. The quantum key distribution protocols which rely only on measurements of the presence of the object are counterfactual, but quantum direct communication protocols are not. Therefore, the name `counterfactual' is not appropriate for recent "counterfactual" protocols which transfer quantum states by quantum direct communication.

abstract: The interaction of two orthogonally polarized beams and a four-level GaAs quantum well (QW) waveguide is investigated. It is shown that, by applying a static magnetic field normal to the propagation direction of the driving beams, the birefringence can be induced in the QW waveguide. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the dephasing rate between two ground states of the QW waveguide makes it a dichromatic medium and can also diminish the induced birefringence. Our results show how a large and complete magneto-optical rotation in the QW waveguide can be obtained via adjusting the intensity of the magnetic field and also the length of the QW waveguide.

abstract: The interaction of two quantized fields and three-level quantum system in a lambda-type configuration is investigated in the presence of cross-Kerr nonlinearity. We consider three models of coupling for the atom-photon interaction. First, we study the dynamical behavior of the atom-photon entanglement and show that increasing the cross-Kerr nonlinearity results in different behaviors in three considered models. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the two quantized modes can be entangled, on the other hand, by applying a classical driving field to the lower levels. Increasing the classical driving field destroys the long time atom-photon entanglement. Our results show that an oscillatory two-mode squeezing can be generated in the absence of a driving classical field and the cross-Kerr nonlinearity.

abstract: We find that the perfect distinguishability of two quantum operations by a parallel scheme depends only on an operator subspace generated from their Choi-Kraus operators. We further show that any operator subspace can be obtained from two quantum operations in such a way. This connection enables us to study the parallel distinguishability of operator subspaces directly without explicitly referring to the underlining quantum operations. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the parallel distinguishability of an operator subspace that is either one-dimensional or Hermitian. In both cases the condition is equivalent to the non-existence of positive definite operator in the subspace, and an optimal discrimination protocol is obtained. Finally, we provide more examples to show that the non-existence of positive definite operator is sufficient for many other cases, but in general it is only a necessary condition.

abstract: Multimode entanglement is quintessential for the design and fabrication of quantum networks, which play a central role in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, an experimental setup is generally constructed with a specific network configuration in mind and therefore exhibits reduced versatility and scalability. The present work demonstrates an on-demand, reconfigurable quantum network simulator, using an intrinsically multimode quantum resource and a homodyne detection apparatus. Without altering either the initial squeezing source or experimen- tal architecture, we realize the construction of thirteen cluster states of various size and connectivity as well as the implementation of a secret sharing protocol. In particular, this simulator enables the interrogation of quantum correlations and fluctuations for a Gaussian quantum network. This initi- ates a new avenue for implementing on-demand quantum information processing by only adapting the measurement process and not the experimental layout.

We illustrate the result by applying it to an optomechanical device--a typical continuous measurement setup.

abstract: As one of the most intriguing intrinsic properties of quantum world, quantum superposition provokes great interests in its own generation. Though a universal quantum machine that creates superposition of arbitrary two unknown states has been shown physically impossible, a probabilistic protocol exists in the case of the two input states have nonzero overlap with the referential state. Here we report the first heralded quantum machine realizing superposition of arbitrary two unknown photonic qubits as long as they have nonzero overlap with horizontal polarization state $|H\rangle$. A total of 11 different qubit pairs are chosen to test this protocol by comparing the reconstructed output state with theoretical expected superposition of input states. We obtain the average fidelity as high as 0.99, which shows the excellent reliability of our realization. This realization not only deepens our understanding of quantum superposition but also has significant applications in quantum information and quantum computation, e.g., generating non-classical states in the context of quantum optics and realizing information compression by coherent superposition of results of independent runs of subroutines in a quantum computation.

abstract: We present a new exactly solvable (classical and quantum) model that can be interpreted as the generalization to the two-dimensional sphere and to the hyperbolic space of the two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator with any pair of frequencies $\omega_x$ and $\omega_y$. The new curved Hamiltonian ${H}_\kappa$ depends on the curvature $\kappa$ of the underlying space as a deformation/contraction parameter, and the Liouville integrability of ${H}_\kappa$ relies on its separability in terms of geodesic parallel coordinates, which generalize the Cartesian coordinates of the plane. Moreover, the system is shown to be superintegrable for commensurate frequencies $\omega_x: \omega_y$, thus mimicking the behaviour of the flat Euclidean case, which is always recovered in the $\kappa\to 0$ limit. The additional constant of motion in the commensurate case is, as expected, of higher-order in the momenta and can be explicitly deduced by performing the classical factorization of the Hamiltonian. The known $1:1$ and $2:1$ anisotropic curved oscillators are recovered as particular cases of ${H}_\kappa$, meanwhile all the remaining $\omega_x: \omega_y$ curved oscillators define new superintegrable systems. Furthermore, the quantum Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ is fully constructed and studied by following a quantum factorization approach. In the case of commensurate frequencies, the Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ turns out to be quantum superintegrable and leads to a new exactly solvable quantum model. Its corresponding spectrum, that exhibits a maximal degeneracy, is explicitly given as an analytical deformation of the Euclidean eigenvalues in terms of both the curvature $\kappa$ and the Planck constant $\hbar$. In fact, such spectrum is obtained as a composition of two one-dimensional (either trigonometric or hyperbolic) P\"osch-Teller set of eigenvalues.

abstract: We measure properties of the 795 nm $^3$H$_6$ to $^3$H$_4$ transition of a rare-earth-ion-doped waveguide, Tm$^{3+}$:Ti$^{4+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$, at temperatures as low as 800 mK. Coherence and hyperfine population lifetimes up to 117 $\mu$s and 2.5 hours, respectively, are observed. They are at least one order of magnitude greater than those measured at 3 K, and match those observed in a bulk Tm$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$ crystal under similar conditions. Furthermore, taking advantage of these properties, we prepare a 0.5 GHz-bandwidth atomic frequency comb quantum memory of finesse $>$2 on a vanishing background. Finally, we measure high Rabi frequencies and calculate a transition dipole moment of $\sim$10$^{-32}$ C$\cdot$m, which is equivalent to that of Tm$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$. Our results show the suitability of rare-earth-doped waveguides created using industry-standard Ti-indiffusion in LiNbO$_3$ for on-chip quantum applications.

abstract: Quantum coherence (QCh) is considered to be a key ingredient in quantum resource theories and also plays a pivotal role in the design and implementation of various information processing tasks. Consequently, it becomes important for us to create more number coherent quantum states between two labs from a given coherent state shared initially. We call this process as \textbf{Broadcasting of Quantum Coherence (QCh)}. In this work we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of QCh. In order to have a holistic view of broadcasting, we start with a most general representation two qubit mixed state in terms of Bloch vectors. As a cloning transformation we have used both state dependent and independent version of universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery (BH) cloner locally as well as non locally. Remarkably, we find that in either of the case it is impossible to do optimal broadcasting of QCh. Further we show in case of non optimal broadcasting it is impossible to increase QCh of the state by both local and non local cloning operations. In non optimal case we consider examples like, a) Werner like states and b) Bell diagonal states and obtain ranges for broadcasting in terms of input state parameters.

abstract: We propose a driven spin as the working fluid of a quantum Otto cycle in the presence of internal friction. The role of total allocated time to the adiabatic branches of the cycle, generated by different driving pulses, on the extractable work and the thermal efficiency are analyzed in detail. The internal friction is characterized by the excess entropy production and quantitatively determined by studying the closeness of an actual unitary process to an infinitely long one via quantum relative entropy. It is found that the non-ideal, finite-time adiabatic transformations negatively effect the work output and the thermal efficiency of the quantum heat engine. The non-monotone dependence of the work output, thermal efficiency, entropy production and the internal friction on the total adiabatic time are elucidated. It is also found that almost frictionless adiabatic transformations with small entropy production can be obtained in a short adiabatic time.

abstract: Here we consider the speed at which quantum information can be transferred between the nodes of a linear network. Because such nodes are linear oscillators, this speed is also important in the cooling and state preparation of mechanical oscillators, as well as frequency conversion. We show that if there is no restriction on the size of the linear coupling between two oscillators, then there exist control protocols that will swap their respective states with high fidelity within a time much less than a single oscillation period. Standard gradient search methods fail to find these fast protocols. We were able to do so by augmenting standard search methods with a path-tracing technique, demonstrating that this technique has remarkable power to solve time-optimal control problems, as well as confirming the highly challenging nature of these problems. As a further demonstration of the power of path-tracing, first introduced by Moore-Tibbets et al. [Phys. Rev. A 86, 062309 (2012)], we apply it to the generation of entanglement in a linear network.

This approach has the benefit of being applicable in the thick, thin, and intermediate crystal regimes. The method is applied to a three-blade neutron interferometer to predict the output beam profiles, interference patterns, and contrast variation.

abstract: This study presents the confinement influences of Aharonov-Bohm-flux (AB-flux), electric and magnetic fields directed along $z$-axis and encircled by quantum plasmas, on the hydrogen atom. The all-inclusive effects result to a strongly attractive system while the localizations of quantum levels change and the eigenvalues decrease. We find that, the combined effect of the fields is stronger than solitary effect and consequently, there is a substantial shift in the bound state energy of the system. We also find that to perpetuate a low-energy medium for hydrogen atom in quantum plasmas, strong electric field and weak magnetic field are required, where AB-flux field can be used as a regulator. The application of perturbation technique utilized in this paper is not restricted to plasma physics, it can also be applied in molecular physics.

For an initial state with no zero eigenvalues, there are always such observables, and which are independent of this state.

abstract: We describe the design and characterization of superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities tailored to facilitate strong coupling between superconducting quantum circuits and single trapped Rydberg atoms. For initial superconductor-atom experiments at 4.2 K, we show that resonator quality factors above $10^4$ can be readily achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of thick-film copper electrodes at a voltage antinode of the resonator provides a route to enhance the zero-point electric fields of the resonator in a trapping region that is 40 $\mu$m above the chip surface, thereby minimizing chip heating from scattered trap light. The combination of high resonator quality factor and strong electric dipole coupling between the resonator and the atom should make it possible to achieve the strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics with this system.

abstract: Determining the prime factors of a given number N is a problem, which requires super-polynomial time for conventional digital computers. A polynomial-time algorithm was invented by P. Shor for quantum computers. However, the realization of quantum computers is associated with significant technological challenges in achieving and preserving quantum entanglement. Prime factorization can be also solved by using classical wave interference without quantum entanglement. In this work, we present experimental data showing prime factorization by utilizing spin wave interference. The prime factorization includes three major steps. First, general type computer calculates the sequence of numbers mkmod(N), where N is the number to be factorized, m is a randomly chosen positive integer, and k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 .. . Next, the period of calculated sequence r is determined by exploiting spin wave interference. Finally, the general type computer finds the primes based on the obtained r. The experiment on the period finding was accomplished on the 6-terminal Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 device. We chose number 15 for a test and found its primes in a sequence of measurements. The obtained data demonstrate an example of solving a prime factorization problem using classical wave interference. We discuss the physical and technological limitations of this approach, which define the maximum size of N and the computational speed. Though this classical approach cannot compete with the quantum algorithm in efficiency, magnonic holographic devices can be potentially utilized as complementary logic units aimed to speed up prime factorization with classical computers.

abstract: Time-evolution of open, dissipative quantum system is a stochastic process that consists of a series of quantum jumps that take place at random times. Between quantum jumps quantum system idles for some time in a particular quantum state. Based on superfermion/superboson formalism and general Kossakowski- Lindblad master equation for an open quantum system we develop a method to compute distribution of waiting times between quantum jumps. We illustrate the use of the theory by computing waiting time distribution for model Fermi-system in thermodynamic equilibrium.

abstract: We investigate the interaction caused by quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations between a gravitationally polarizable object and a gravitational boundary, and find a position-dependent energy shift of the object, which induces a force in close analogy to the Casimir-Polder force in the electromagnetic case. For a Dirichlet boundary, the explicit form of the quantum gravitational potential for the polarizable object in its ground-state is worked out and is found to behave like $z^{-5}$ in the near regime, and $z^{-6}$ in the far regime, where $z$ is the distance to the boundary. Taking a Bose-Einstein condensate as a gravitationally polarizable object, we find that the relative correction to the radius caused by fluctuating quantum gravitational waves in vacuum is of order $10^{-21}$. Although far too small to observe in comparison with its electromagnetic counterpart, it is nevertheless of the order of the gravitational strain caused by a recently detected black hole merger on the arms of the LIGO.

abstract: For two positive maps $\phi_i:B(\mathcal{K}_i)\to B(\mathcal{H}_i)$, $i=1,2$, we construct a new linear map $\phi:B(\mathcal{H})\to B(\mathcal{K})$, where $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{K}_1\oplus\mathcal{K}_2\oplus\mathbb{C}$, $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_1\oplus\mathcal{H}_2\oplus\mathbb{C}$, by means of some additional ingredients such as operators and functionals. We call it a merging of maps $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$. We discuss properties of this construction. In particular, we provide conditions for positivity of $\phi$, as well as for $2$-positivity, complete positivity and nondecomposability. In particular, we show that for a pair composed of $2$-positive and $2$-copositive maps, there is a nondecomposable merging of them. One of our main results asserts, that for a canonical merging of a pair composed of completely positive and completely copositive extremal maps, their canonical merging is an exposed positive map. This result provides a wide class of new examples of exposed positive maps.

abstract: We reconsider the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, which is commonly used for generating spin squeezing, and treat its dynamics within the Heisenberg operator approach. To this end we solve the underlying Heisenberg equations of motion perturbatively and evaluate the expectation values of the resulting time-dependent Heisenberg operators in order to determine approximately the dynamics of spin squeezing. Comparing our results with those originating from exact numerics reveals that they are more accurate than the commonly used frozen spin approximation.

abstract: The problem of finding code distance has been long studied for the generic ensembles of linear codes and led to several algorithms that substantially reduce exponential complexity of this task. However, no asymptotic complexity bounds are known for distance verification in other ensembles of linear codes. Our goal is to re-design the existing generic algorithms of distance verification and derive their complexity for LDPC codes. We obtain new complexity bounds with provable performance expressed in terms of the erasure-correcting thresholds of long LDPC codes. These bounds exponentially reduce complexity estimates known for linear codes.

abstract: Current descriptions of the ab initio DMRG algorithm use two superficially different languages: an older language of the renormalization group and renormalized operators, and a more recent language of matrix product states and matrix product operators. The same algorithm can appear dramatically different when written in the two different vocabularies. In this work, we carefully describe the translation between the two languages in several contexts. First, we describe how to efficiently implement the ab-initio DMRG sweep using a matrix product operator based code, and the equivalence to the original renormalized operator implementation. Next we describe how to implement the general matrix product operator/matrix product state algebra within a pure renormalized operator-based DMRG code. Finally, we discuss two improvements of the ab initio DMRG sweep algorithm motivated by matrix product operator language: Hamiltonian compression, and a sum over operators representation that allows for perfect computational parallelism. The connections and correspondences described here serve to link the future developments with the past, and are important in the efficient implementation of continuing advances in ab initio DMRG and related algorithms.

abstract: We present two simple designs of matter-wave beam splitters in a trapped Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). In our scheme, identical pairs of atomic solitons are produced by an adequate control --- in time and/or space --- of the scattering length. Our analysis is performed by numerical integration of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and supported by several analytic estimates. Our results show that these devices can be implemented in the frame of current BEC experiments. The system has potential applications for the construction of a soliton interferometer.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the kicked Dicke model(KDM) in terms of the Floquet operator and analyze the connection between the chaos and thermalization in this context. The Hamiltonian map is constructed by taking the classical limit of the Heisenberg equation of motion suitably to study the corresponding phase space dynamics which shows a crossover from regular to chaotic motion by tuning the kicking strength. The fixed point analysis and calculation of the Lyapunov exponent(LE) provides us a complete picture of the onset of chaos in phase space dynamics. We carry out the spectral analysis of the Floquet operator which include the calculation of quasienergy spacing distribution, structural entropy and show the correspondence to the random matrix theory in the chaotic regime. Finally, we analyze the thermodynamics and statistical properties of the bosonic sector as well as the spin sector and discuss how such periodically kicked system relaxes to a thermalized state in accordance with the laws of statistical mechanics. We introduce the notion of an effective temperature and show that a microcanonical picture is emerging out in the thermodynamic limit indicating the thermalization occurring in such system.

abstract: We predict a linear logarithmical scaling law of Bloch oscillation dynamics in Weyl semimetals (WSMs), which can be applied to detect Weyl nodal points. Applying the semiclassical dynamics for quasiparticles which are accelerated bypassing a Weyl point, we show that transverse drift exhibits asymptotically a linear log-log relation with respect to the minimal momentum measured from the Weyl point. This linear scaling behavior is a consequence of the monopole structure nearby the Weyl points, thus providing a direct measurement of the topological nodal points, with the chirality and anisotropy being precisely determined. We apply the present results to two lattice models for WSMs which can be realized with cold atoms in experiment, and propose realistic schemes for the experimental detection. With the analytic and numerical results we show the feasibility of identifying topological Weyl nodal points based on the present prediction.
