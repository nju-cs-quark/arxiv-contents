abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks is studied motivated by a recent experiment. We present the explicit definition of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by employing a concept of symmetry time frame. We provide necessary and sufficient condition so that the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks retains $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model depend on position. It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded in the time-evolution operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the non-unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

abstract: In analogy with usual Anderson localization taking place in time-independent disordered quantum systems where the disorder acts in configuration space, systems exposed to temporally disordered potentials can display Anderson localization in the time domain. We demonstrate this phenomenon with one-dimensional examples where a temporally disordered potential induces localization during the quantum evolution of wave-packets, in contrast with a fully delocalized classical dynamics. This is an example of a time crystal phenomenon, i.e., a crystalline behavior in the time domain.

abstract: This study investigates unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum walks. We prove that one-dimensional quantum walks are unitary equivalent to quantum walks of Ambainis type and that translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walks are Szegedy walks. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for a one-dimensional quantum walk to be a Szegedy walk.
