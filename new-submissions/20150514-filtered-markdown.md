<p>
The quantum walk provides a unique way to realize Floquet topological insulators, systems driven by a time-periodic field. While theoretical work on topological phases of quantum walks has mostly concentrated on walks with coin operators described by a spin rotation matrix, in experiments the Hadamard coin operator is often used instead. We establish a relation between the two coin operators to apply the theory of topological phases of quantum walks to the Hadamard quantum walk. We derive correct phase diagrams of the topological numbers for the one-dimensional (1D) Hadamard quantum walks. This accounts for the {\it hidden topological phase} of a recent 1D photonic quantum walk experiment, in which edge states were observed, even though the parameter space was considered to be topologically trivial.
