abstract: The way in which geometry encodes entanglement is a topic of much recent interest in quantum many-body physics and the AdS/CFT duality. This relation is particularly pronounced in the case of topological quantum field theories, where topology alone determines the quantum states of the theory. In this work, we study the set of quantum states that can be prepared by the Euclidean path integral in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Specifically, we consider arbitrary 3-manifolds with a fixed number of torus boundaries in both abelian U(1) and non-abelian SO(3) Chern-Simons theory. For the abelian theory, we find that the states that can be prepared coincide precisely with the set of stabilizer states from quantum information theory. This constrains the multipartite entanglement present in this theory, but it also reveals that stabilizer states can be described by topology. In particular, we find an explicit expression for the entanglement entropy of a many-torus subsystem using only a single replica, as well as a concrete formula for the number of GHZ states that can be distilled from a tripartite state prepared through path integration. For the nonabelian theory, we find a notion of "state universality", namely that any state can be prepared to an arbitrarily good approximation. The manifolds we consider can also be viewed as toy models of multi-boundary wormholes in AdS/CFT.

abstract: In the last decade, there has been remarkable progress on the practical integration of on-chip quantum photonic devices yet quantum state generators remain an outstanding challenge. Simultaneously, the quantum-dot photonic-crystal-resonator platform has demonstrated a versatility for creating nonclassical light with tunable quantum statistics, thanks to a newly discovered self-homodyning interferometric effect that preferentially selects the quantum light over the classical light when using an optimally tuned Fano resonance. In this work, we propose a general structure for the cavity quantum electrodynamical generation of quantum states from a waveguide-integrated version of the quantum-dot photonic-crystal-resonator platform, which is specifically tailored for preferential quantum state transmission. We support our results with rigorous Finite-Difference Time-Domain and quantum optical simulations, and show how our proposed device can serve as a robust generator of highly pure single- and even multi-photon states.

abstract: On the background of the Born-Oppenheimer (adiabatic) approximation, we investigate the geometrical and topological structure in the theory of quantum gravitation by use of the path integral method and half-classical approximation. As we know, Berry curvature can be extracted from the linear response of a driven two-level system to nonadiabatic manipulations of its Hamiltonian. In parameter space of the Hamiltonian, magnetic monopoles can be artificially simulated. Ripples occur in Hilbert space when the monopole travels from inside to outside the surface of energy manifold spanned by system parameters. From this point, we set up the connection between the ripples characterized by the fidelity of quantum states in Hilbert space and gravitational waves in microscopic scales. This may open a window for the study of geometrical and topological properties of quantum gravity with the help of qubit systems.

abstract: The properties that quantify photonic topological insulators (PTIs), Berry phase, Berry potential, and Chern number, are typically obtained by making analogies between classical Maxwell's equations and the quantum mechanical Schr\"{o}dinger equation, writing both in Hamiltonian form. However, the aforementioned quantities are not necessarily quantum in nature, and for photonic systems they can be explained using only classical concepts. Here we provide a derivation and description of PTI quantities using classical Maxwell's equations, we demonstrate how an electromagnetic mode can acquire Berry phase, and we discuss the ramifications of this effect. We consider several examples, including wave propagation in a biased plasma, and radiation by a rotating isotropic emitter. These concepts are discussed without invoking quantum mechanics, and can be easily understood from an engineering electromagnetics perspective.

abstract: We identify the simplest combinations of entanglement and incompatibility giving the maximum quantum violation for each of the 46 classes of tight Bell inequalities for the (3,2,2) scenario, i.e., three parties, two measurements per party, and two outcomes per measurement. This allows us to classify the maximum quantum nonlocality according to the simplest resources needed to achieve it. We show that entanglement and incompatibility only produce maximum nonlocality when they are combined in specific ways. For each entanglement class there is, in most cases, just one incompatibility class leading to maximum nonlocality. We also identify two interesting cases. We show that the maximum quantum violation of \'Sliwa inequality 23 only occurs when the third party measures the identity, so nonlocality cannot increase when we add a third party to the bipartite case. Surprisingly, almost quantum correlations predict that adding a new party increases nonlocality. This points out that either almost quantum correlations violate a fundamental principle or that there is a form of tripartite entanglement which quantum theory cannot account. The other interesting case is the maximum quantum violation of \'Sliwa inequality 26, which, like Mermin inequality, requires maximum incompatibility for all parties. In contrast, it requires a specific entangled state which has the same tripartite negativity as the W state.

abstract: We consider a linear chain made of spins of one half in contact with a finite temperature environment for which periodic delta-kicks are applied to the qubits of the linear chain in two different ways: periodic kicks are applied to a single qubit and alternate kicks are applied to two qubits of the linear chain. In both cases the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary condition in the long time limit. We study the transient to the quasi stationary condition and the properties of the quasi-steady state as function of the period of the kicks by defining averaged quantities at the quasi stationary regime. For doing our study we have derived an approximation to a master equation which serves us to analyze the effects of a finite temperature and the zero temperature environment. The linear chain we use in our model has been used as model for a quantum computer devices based on magnetic resonance techniques.

abstract: Since quantum coherence is an undoubted characteristic trait of quantum physics, the quantification and application of quantum coherence has been one of the long-standing central topics in quantum information science. Within the framework of a resource theory of quantum coherence proposed recently, a fiducial basis should be pre-selected for characterizing the quantum coherence in specific circumstances, namely, the quantum coherence is a basis-dependent quantity. Therefore, a natural question is raised: what are the maximum and minimum coherences contained in a certain quantum state with respect to the random bases? While the minimum case is trivial, it is not so intuitive to verify in which basis the quantum coherence is maximal. Based on the coherence measure of relative entropy, we indicate the particular basis in which the quantum coherence is maximal for a given state, where the Fourier matrix (or more generally, complex Hadamard matrices) plays a critical role in determining the basis. Intriguingly, though we can prove that the basis associated with the Fourier matrix is suboptimal (e.g., a local extremum) for the $l_1$ norm of coherence, numerical simulation shows that it is not a global optimal choice.

Existence thresholds for the ground state and first excited states are identified, both in the purely radial and orbitally nontrivial cases. This contributes to an understanding of how energy may be stored or accumulated in the form of bound states of Schr\"odinger - type quantum systems that are devoid of any mass.

abstract: Temporal Bell inequalities, or Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGI), are studied for continuous-variable systems placed in a squeezed state. The importance of those systems lies in their broad applicability which allows the description of many different physical settings in various branches of physics, ranging from cosmology to condensed matter physics and from optics to quantum information theory. LGI violations are explored and systematically mapped in squeezing parameter space. Configurations for which LGI violation occurs are found but it is shown that no violation can be obtained if all squeezing angles vanish, contrary to what happens for the spatial Bell inequalities. We also assess the effect of decoherence on the detectability of such violations. Our study opens up the possibility of new experimental designs for the observation of LGI violation.

abstract: In this didactic article we explore the concept of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. We begin by introducing and motivating the classically correlated states and then showing how to quantify the quantum correlations using an entropic approach, arriving at a well known measure called the quantum discord. Quantum correlations and discord are then operationally linked with the task of local broadcasting. We conclude by providing some alternative perspectives on quantum correlations and how to measure them.

abstract: A quantum system inevitably interacts with its surroundings. In general, one does not have detailed information on an environment. Identifying the environmental features can help us to control the environment and its effects on the dynamics of an open system. Here, we consider a tripartite system and introduce a witness for the initial correlations between environments by means of the concept of the trace distance. Due to the existence of the initial environmental correlations, a tight upper bound is obtained for the growth of the trace distance of an open quantum system states. Therefore, the initial correlations among the environments can be detected by measurements on the open system.

abstract: Measuring the speed of evolution of a quantum system can reveal its key properties and structure. Yet, it usually requires experimental and computational resources which increase exponentially with the system size. Here we show how to evaluate the speed of a multipartite quantum system by measurement networks scaling linearly with the system parts. We employ the scheme to detect fundamental quantum properties including metrologically useful coherence and entanglement in an all-optical experiment. The result paves the way for the investigation of quantum phenomena in large complex systems with limited resources.

abstract: Lamata et al. use an inductive approach to classify the entangled pure states of four qubits under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) [PRA 75(2), 022318 (2007)]. The inductive method yields a priori ten different entanglement superclasses, of which they discard three as empty. One of the remaining superclasses is split in two, resulting in eight superclasses of genuine four-qubit entanglement. Here, we show that two of the three discarded superclasses are in fact non-empty and should have been retained. We give explicit expressions for the canonical states for those superclasses, up to SLOCC and qubit permutations. Furthermore, we confirm that the third discarded superclass is indeed empty, yielding a total of ten superclasses of genuine four-qubit entanglement under the inductive classification scheme.

abstract: Interesting nonlinear generalization of both Schr\"odinger's and Klein-Gordon's equations have been recently advanced by Tsallis, Rego-Monteiro, and Tsallis (NRT) in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 140601 (2011)]. There is much current activity going on in this area. The non-linearity is governed by a real parameter $q$. It is a fact that the ensuing non linear q-Schr\"odinger and q-Klein-Gordon equations are natural manifestations of very high energy phenomena, as verified by LHC-experiments. This happens for $q-$values close to unity [Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 955}, 16 (2016), Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 948}, 19 (2016)]. It is also well known that q-exponential behavior is found in quite different settings. An explanation for such phenomenon was given in [Physica A {\bf 388}, 601 (2009)] with reference to empirical scenarios in which data are collected via set-ups that effect a normalization plus data's pre-processing. Precisely, the ensuing normalized output was there shown to be q-exponentially distributed if the input data display elliptical symmetry, generalization of spherical symmetry, a frequent situation. This makes it difficult, for q-values close to unity, to ascertain whether one is dealing with solutions to the ordinary Schr\"odinger equation (whose free particle solutions are exponentials, and for which $q=1$) or with its NRT nonlinear q-generalizations, whose free particle solutions are q-exponentials. In this work we provide a careful analysis of the $q \sim 1$ instance via a perturbative analysis of the NRT equations.

abstract: Following Dirac, the rules of canonical quantization include classical and quantum contact transformations of classical and quantum phase space variables. While arbitrary classical canonical coordinate transformations exist that is not the case for some analogous quantum canonical coordinate transformations. This failure is due to the rigid connection of quantum variables arising by promoting the corresponding classical variable from a $c$-number to a $q$-number. A different relationship of $c$-numbers and $q$-numbers in the procedures of Enhanced Quantization shows the compatibility of all quantum operators with all classical canonical coordinate transformations.

abstract: We present a device demonstrating a lithographically patterned transmon integrated with a micromachined cavity resonator. Our two-cavity, one-qubit device is a multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC), comprising a basic unit capable of performing circuit-QED (cQED) operations. We describe the qubit-cavity coupling mechanism of a specialized geometry using an electric field picture and a circuit model, and finally obtain specific system parameters using simulations. Fabrication of the MMIQC includes lithography, etching, and metallic bonding of silicon wafers. Superconducting wafer bonding is a critical capability that is demonstrated by a micromachined storage cavity lifetime $34.3~\mathrm{\mu s}$, corresponding to a quality factor of 2 million at single-photon energies. The transmon coherence times are $T_1=6.4~\mathrm{\mu s}$, and $T_2^{Echo}= 11.7~\mathrm{\mu s}$. We measure qubit-cavity dispersive coupling with rate $\chi_{q\mu}/2\pi=-1.17~$MHz, constituting a Jaynes-Cummings system with an interaction strength $g/2\pi=49~$MHz. With these parameters we are able to demonstrate cQED operations in the strong dispersive regime with ease. Finally, we highlight several improvements and anticipated extensions of the technology to complex MMIQCs.

abstract: Trapped Rydberg ions are a promising new system for quantum information processing. They have the potential to join the precise quantum operations of trapped ions and the strong, long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms. Technically, the ion trap will need to stay active while exciting the ions into the Rydberg state, else the strong Coulomb repulsion will quickly push the ions apart. Thus, a thorough understanding of the trap effects on Rydberg ions is essential for future applications. Here we report the observation of two fundamental trap effects. First, we investigate the interaction of the Rydberg electron with the quadrupolar electric trapping field. This effect leads to Floquet sidebands in the spectroscopy of Rydberg D-states whereas Rydberg S-states are unaffected due to their symmetry. Second, we report on the modified trapping potential in the Rydberg state compared to the ground state which results from the strong polarizability of the Rydberg ion. We observe the resultant energy shifts as a line broadening which can be suppressed by cooling the ion to the motional ground state in the directions orthogonal to the excitation laser.

abstract: Quantum walks are the quantum analogues of classical random walks, and depending on the quantization scheme, several definitions of them exist. The most popular discrete-time versions are the coined quantum walk and Szegedy's quantum walk. In the coined quantum walk, the randomly walking quantum particle has an internal coin state that encodes the directions in which the particle can hop. The walk consists of a coin flip that shuffles the internal state followed by a shift to adjacent vertices. In Szegedy's quantum walk, the original graph is doubled to create an associated bipartite graph, and the walk occurs on the edges of this graph by applying two reflections. We show that these quantum walks are equivalent to each other, with two applications of the coined walk precisely equal to one of Szegedy's, when the coined walk uses the usual Grover diffusion coin and flip-flop shift. This equivalence also extends to the prototypical spatial search schemes, where the coined quantum walk utilizes the negative identity operator as the coin for marked vertices, and Szegedy's quantum walk utilizes absorbing marked vertices. Thus, the abundance of prior results for each kind of quantum walk immediately apply to the other. A similar equivalence also holds for other search models.

abstract: Precise knowledge of an optical device's frequency response is crucial for it to be useful in most applications. Traditional methods for determining the frequency response of an optical system (e.g. optical cavity or waveguide modulator) usually rely on calibrated broadband photo-detectors or complicated RF mixdown operations. As the bandwidths of these devices continue to increase, there is a growing need for a characterization method that does not have bandwidth limitations, or require a previously calibrated device. We demonstrate a new calibration technique on an optical system (consisting of an optical cavity and a high-speed waveguide modulator) that is free from limitations imposed by detector bandwidth, and does not require a calibrated photo-detector or modulator. We use a low-frequency (DC) photo-detector to monitor the cavity's optical response as a function of modulation frequency, which is also used to determine the modulator's frequency response. Knowledge of the frequency-dependent modulation depth allows us to more precisely determine the cavity's characteristics (free spectral range and linewidth). The precision and repeatability of our technique is demonstrated by measuring the different resonant frequencies of orthogonal polarization cavity modes caused by the presence of a non-linear crystal. Once the modulator has been characterized using this simple method, the frequency response of any passive optical element can be determined.

abstract: Strong coupling between light and matter occurs when the two interact strongly enough to form new hybrid modes called polaritons. Here we report on the strong coupling of both the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom to an ultrafast terahertz (THz) frequency electromagnetic wave. In our system, optical phonons in a slab of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) are strongly coupled to a THz electric field to form phonon-polaritons, which are simultaneously strongly coupled to magnons in an adjacent slab of canted antiferromagnetic erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO$_3$) via the THz magnetic field. The strong coupling leads to the formation of new magnon-phonon-polariton modes, which we experimentally observe in the wavevector-frequency dispersion curve as an avoided crossing and in the time-domain as a normal-mode beating. Our simple yet versatile on-chip waveguide platform provides a promising avenue by which to explore both ultrafast THz spintronics applications and the quantum nature of the interaction.

abstract: In three spatial dimensions, the Compton wavelength $(R_C \propto M$) and Schwarzschild radius $(R_S \propto M^{-1}$) are dual under the transformation $M \rightarrow M_{P}^2/M$, where $M_{P}$ is the Planck mass. This suggests that there is a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles in the $M < M_{P}$ regime and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the presence of $n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$, one expects $R_S \propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R < R_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may be restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength depends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is spherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \propto M^{-1}$, as in the $3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the Planck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black hole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function is pancaked in the extra dimensions and maximally asymmetric, then $R_C \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$, so that the duality between $R_C$ and $R_S$ is preserved. In this case, the effective Planck length is reduced but the Planck mass is unchanged, so TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes cannot be generated in collider experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions could still have consequences for the detectability of black hole evaporations and the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$. Though phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results are shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional uncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes.

abstract: We study the interactions among phonons and the phonon lifetime in a pair-condensed Fermi gas in the BEC-BCS crossover. To compute the phonon-phonon coupling amplitudes we use a microscopic model based on a generalized BCS Ansatz including moving pairs, which allows for a systematic expansion around the mean field BCS approximation of the ground state. We show that the quantum hydrodynamic expression of the amplitudes obtained by Landau and Khalatnikov apply only on the energy shell, that is for resonant processes that conserve energy. The microscopic model yields the same excitation spectrum as the Random Phase Approximation, with a linear (phononic) start and a concavity at low wave number that changes from upwards to downwards in the BEC-BCS crossover. When the concavity of the dispersion relation is upwards at low wave number, the leading damping mechanism at low temperature is the Beliaev-Landau process 2 phonons $\leftrightarrow$ 1 phonon while, when the concavity is downwards, it is the Landau-Khalatnikov process 2 phonons $\leftrightarrow$ 2 phonons. In both cases, by rescaling the wave vectors to absorb the dependence on the interaction strength, we obtain a universal formula for the damping rate. This universal formula corrects and extends the original analytic results of Landau and Khalatnikov [ZhETF {\bf 19}, 637 (1949)] for the $2\leftrightarrow2$ processes in the downward concavity case. In the upward concavity case, for the Beliaev 1$\leftrightarrow$ 2 process for the unitary gas at zero temperature, we calculate the damping rate of an excitation with wave number $q$ including the first correction proportional to $q^7$ to the $q^5$ hydrodynamic prediction, which was never done before in a systematic way.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate collective strong coupling, optical bi-stability (OB) and all-optical switching in a system consisting of ultracold 85Rb atoms, trapped in a dark magneto-optical trap (DMOT), coupled to an optical Fabry-Perot cavity. The strong coupling is established by measuring the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) of a weak on-axis probe beam. The dependence of VRS on the probe beam power is measured and bi-stability in the cavity transmission is observed. We demonstrate control over the transmission of the probe beam through the atom-cavity system using a free-space off-axis control beam and show that the cavity transmission can be switched on and off in micro-second timescales using micro-Watt control powers. The utility of the system as a tool for sensitive, in-situ and rapid measurements is envisaged.

abstract: We study generation and dynamics of an exchange spin qubit encoded in three coherently coupled quantum dots with three electrons. For two geometries of the system a linear and a triangular one, the creation and coherent control of the qubit states are performed by the Landau--Zener transitions. In the triangular case both the qubit states are equivalent and can be easily generated for particular symmetries of the system. If one of the dots is smaller than the others one can observe Rabi oscillations, that can be used for coherent manipulation of the qubit states. The linear system is easier to fabricate; however, then the qubit states are not equivalent, making qubit operations more difficult to control.

abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct characteristic features of an unknown stochastic system from the long-time full counting statistics of some of the system's transitions that are monitored by a detector. The full counting statistics is conveniently parametrized by so-called generalized factorial cumulants. Taking only a few of them as input information is sufficient to reconstruct important features such as the lower bound of the system dimension and the full spectrum of relaxation rates. The use of generalized factorial cumulants reveals system dimensions and rates that are hidden for ordinary cumulants. We illustrate the inverse counting-statistics procedure for two model systems: a single-level quantum dot in a Zeeman field and a single-electron box subjected to sequential and Andreev tunneling.

abstract: The diagonal ensemble is the infinite time average of a quantum state following unitary dynamics. In analogy to the time average of a classical phase space dynamics, it is intimately related to the ergodic properties of the quantum system giving information on the spreading of the initial state in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In this work we apply a concept from quantum information, known as total correlations, to the diagonal ensemble. Forming an upper-bound on the multipartite entanglement, it quantifies the combination of both classical and quantum correlations in a mixed state. We generalize the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble to more general $\alpha$-Renyi entropies and focus on the the cases $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=2$ with further numerical extensions in mind. Here we show that the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble is a generic indicator of ergodicity breaking, displaying a sub-extensive behaviour when the system is ergodic. We demonstrate this by investigating its scaling in a range of spin chain models focusing not only on the cases of integrability breaking but also emphasize its role in understanding the transition from an ergodic to a many body localized phase in systems with disorder or quasi-periodicity.

subjects: Combinatorics (math.CO); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1611.02093
abstract: In this paper we study quantum state transfer (also called quantum tunneling) on graphs when there is a potential function on the vertex set. We present two main results. First, we show that for paths of length greater than three, there is no potential on the vertices of the path for which perfect state transfer between the endpoints can occur. In particular, this resolves (in the negative) a conjecture of Godsil in [8]. Second, we show that if a graph has two vertices that share a common neighborhood, then there is a potential on the vertex set for which perfect state transfer will occur between those two vertices. This gives numerous examples where perfect state transfer does not occur without the potential, but adding a potential makes perfect state transfer possible. In addition, we investigate perfect state transfer on graph products, which gives further examples where perfect state transfer can occur.

abstract: In the literature the $CPT$ theorem has only been established for Hamiltonians that are Hermitian. Here we extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum field theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our derivation is a quite minimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar products and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The latter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$ symmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over Hermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding principle for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a non-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive, ghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal gravity. Since our approach allows for complex energies and decays, our work justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the lifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. In the quantum-mechanical limit where charge conjugation is separately conserved, the key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are recovered.

abstract: We have designed, built, and characterized a high-resolution objective lens that is compatible with an ultra-high vacuum environment. The lens system exploits the principle of the Weierstrass-sphere solid immersion lens to reach a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.92. Tailored to the requirements of optical lattice experiments, the objective lens features a relatively long working distance of 150 micrometers. Our two-lens design is remarkably insensitive to mechanical tolerances in spite of the large NA. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of a tapered optical fiber tip, as used in scanning near-field optical microscopy, to measure the point spread function of a high NA optical system. From the point spread function, we infer the wavefront aberration for the entire field of view of about 75 micrometers. Pushing the NA of an optical system to its ultimate limit enables novel applications in quantum technologies such as quantum control of atoms in optical microtraps with an unprecedented spatial resolution and photon collection efficiency.

abstract: We analytically study the effect of gravitational and harmonic forces on ultra-cold atoms with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular, we focus on the recently observed transitions between internal states induced by acceleration of the external modes. Our description corresponds to a generalized version of the Landau-Zener (LZ) model: the dimensionality is enlarged to combine the quantum treatment of the external variables with the internal-state characterization; additionally, atomic-interaction effects are considered. The emergence of the basic model is analytically traced. Namely, by using a sequence of unitary transformations and a subsequent reduction to the spin space, the SOC Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated, is exactly converted into the primary LZ scenario. Moreover, the transitions induced by harmonic acceleration are approximately cast into the framework of the basic LZ model through a complete analytical procedure. We evaluate how the validity of our picture depends on the system preparation and on the magnitude of atomic-interaction effects. The identification of the regime of applicability and the rigorous characterization of the parameters of the effective model provide elements to control the transitions.
