abstract: We point out a contrasting role the entanglement plays in communication and estimation scenarios. In the first case it brings noticeable benefits at the measurement stage (output super-additvity), whereas in the latter it is the entanglement of the input probes that enables significant performance enhancement (input super-additvity). We identify a weak estimation regime where a strong connection between concepts crucial to the two fields is demonstrated; the accessible information and the Holevo quantity on one side and the quantum Fisher information related quantities on the other. This allows us to shed new light on the problem of super-additivity in communication using the concepts of quantum estimation theory.

abstract: Fock states are a fundamental resource for many quantum technologies such as quantum metrology. While much progress has been made in single-photon source technologies, preparing Fock states with large photon number remains challenging. We present and analyze a bootstrapped approach for non-deterministically preparing large photon-number Fock states by iteratively fusing smaller Fock states on a beamsplitter. We show that by employing state recycling we are able to exponentially improve the preparation rate over conventional schemes, allowing the efficient preparation of large Fock states. The scheme requires single-photon sources, beamsplitters, number-resolved photo-detectors, fast-feedforward, and an optical quantum memory.

abstract: From the Hamiltonian connecting the inside and outside of an Fabry-Perot cavity, which is derived from the Maxwell boundary conditions at a mirror of the cavity, a master equation of a non-Lindblad form is derived when the cavity embeds matters, although we can transform it to the Lindblad form by performing the rotating-wave approximation to that Hamiltonian. We calculate absorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also by the Maxwell boundary conditions in framework of the classical electrodynamics, which we consider the most reliable approach. We found that, compared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra by the non-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions. Although the discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultra-strong light-matter interaction regime with a relatively large broadening, the master equation of the non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the Lindblad one for pursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.

abstract: Photon modes have an important role in characterizing the quantum sources of light. Proper coupling of various photon modes obtained in spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in optical fibers is essential to generate an effective source of entangled photons. The two main pre-detection factors affecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing parameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental results on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon modes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton coupling efficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We attribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of down-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the ellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam. We also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry with the pump focusing parameter. These results may be useful in selecting optimum conditions in the down-conversion process for generating efficient sources of entangled photons for quantum information applications.

abstract: We present an analog quantum simulator of spacetimes containing traversable wormholes. A suitable spatial dependence in the external bias of a dc-SQUID array mimics the propagation of light in a 1D wormhole background. The impedance of the array places severe limitations on the type of spacetime that we are able to implement. However, we find that wormhole throat radius in the sub-mm range are achievable. We show how to modify this spacetime in order to allow the existence of closed timelike curves. The quantum fluctuations of the phase associated to the finite array impedance might be seen as an analogue of Hawking's chronology protection mechanism.

abstract: Quantum metrology promises high-precision measurements beyond the capability of any classical techniques. This has the potential to be integral to investigative techniques. However, all sensors must tolerate imperfections if their operation is to be practical. Here we show that photons without perfectly overlapped modes, which are therefore partially-distinguishable, are not required for quantum-enhancement of measurement and partially-distinguishable photons do not have to be engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of distinguishability. We quantify the effect of distinguishability on quantum metrology experiments and conduct an experiment to verify the utility of two- and four-photon states containing partially-distinguishable photons by observing quantum-enhanced sensitivity with low-visibility quantum interference. This demonstrates that sources producing photons with mixed spectral states can be readily utilised in quantum-metrology systems.

abstract: With a recent rising interest of single photon superradiance due to its potential usefulness for efficient collection of single photon from an atomic ensemble, bright and narrow photon pair source is a key component in realization of quantum communication and quantum computer based on coherent interaction between light and atomic ensemble. We report the superradiant emission of ultra-bright photon pairs with a coincidence counting rate per input power of 64,600 cps/mW via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a thermal vapour cell. The photon-pair generation rate is enhanced by the contribution of two-photon coherence of almost atomic velocity groups in the Doppler-broadened ladder-type atomic system. The quadratic proportionality of the probability of detecting a heralded single photon as a function of the optical depth clarifies that the ultra-brightness results from the superradiance. In addition, a single photon superradiant beating at a high optical depth of the atomic ensemble is observed for the first time.

abstract: On this work, we consider a particle moving in front of a dielectric plate, and study two of the most relevant effects of the vacuum field fluctuations: the dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle's internal degrees of freedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed trajectory. To study the dissipative effects, we calculate the in-out effective action by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of both the plate and the particle. This in-out effective action develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability for the decay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the dissipation is affected by the relative velocity between the particle and the plate and the properties of the microscopic degrees of freedom. In order to study the effects of decoherence over the internal degrees of freedom of the particle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh influence action, by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the plate. We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by two different quantum configurations (of the internal degree of freedom of the particle) to be possible to differentiate from one another. We analyze the way in which the presence of the mirror affects the decoherence, and the possible ways to maximize or reduce its effects.

abstract: Recently, the negatively charged silicon vacancy centre (SiV) in diamond has emerged as a novel promising system for quantum information processing (QIP) due to its superior spectral properties and advantageous electronic structure: The SiV offers an optically accessible {\Lambda}-type level structure with a large orbital level splitting even without the need of an external magnetic field and previous studies determined the ground state coherence time of the centre to be on the order of 35-45ns. While these studies already indicate the feasibility of an ultrafast all-optical coherent control of the SiV, no experimental realization has been presented so far. Here, we report on optical Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference between the ground and the excited state of the SiV using 12 ps long, resonant rotation pulses. Moreover, utilizing a {\Lambda}-scheme, we demonstrate Raman-based coherent Rabi rotations and Ramsey interference within the ground state manifold using a single, 1ps long off-resonant pulse. These measurements prove the accessibility of the complete set of single-qubit operations relying solely on optical fields and pave the way for high-speed QIP applications using SiV centres.

abstract: We develop a framework for studying the well-known universal term in the Renyi entropy for an arbitrary entangling region in four-dimensional conformal field theories that are holographically dual to gravitational theories. The shape dependence of the Renyi entropy $S_n$ is described by two coefficients: $f_b(n)$ for extrinsic curvature deformations and $f_c(n)$ for Weyl tensor deformations. We provide the first calculation of the coefficient $f_b(n)$ in interacting theories by relating it to the stress tensor one-point function in a deformed hyperboloid background. The latter is then determined by a straightforward holographic calculation. Our results show that a previous conjecture $f_b(n) = f_c(n)$, motivated by surprising evidence from a variety of free field theories and studies of conical defects, fails holographically.

abstract: The behaviour of fermions in the background of a double-step potential is analyzed with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous chiral-conjugation transformation. Provided the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling, a Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step potential shows that the transmission coefficient exhibits oscillations and that a finite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-state solutions might appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. An isolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled first-order equations might also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound solutions disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of the so-called spin and pseudospin symmetries in a four-dimensional space-time. Furthermore, we show that due to the additional mass acquired by the fermion from the scalar background the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime does not violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

abstract: We investigate an efficient two-photon up-conversion process in more than one molecule coupled to an optical antenna. In the previous work [Y. Osaka et al., PRL 112, 133601 (2014)], we considered the two-photon up-conversion process in a single molecule within one-dimensional input-output theory, and revealed that controlling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the efficient up-conversion with radiative loss in the antenna suppressed. In this work, aiming to propose a way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend the model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more than one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome the difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies that, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can enlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion.

abstract: We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.

abstract: Motivated by the current interest in dynamically preparing topological states in ultracold atomic gases, we consider a two-dimensional system initialized in a topologically trivial state before its Hamiltonian is ramped into a Chern-insulator phase. Under coherent dynamics, the non-equilibrium Hall response is found to approach a topologically quantized time averaged value in the limit of slow parameter ramps, even though the Chern number of the state is constrained to remain trivial. Quite remarkably, the destruction of quantum coherence by dephasing stabilizes the Hall response towards its asymptotically quantized mean value by damping its oscillations. We demonstrate how this phenomenology generically arises from the interplay of Landau-Zener dynamics and dephasing. In the limit of a fast ramp (quench), we show how the presence of a cooling quantum bath enables a dynamical transition of the state's Chern number from trivial to non-trivial, accompanied by the onset of a quantized Hall response.

abstract: The environment of a quantum dot, which is connected to two leads, is modeled by telegraph noise, i.e. random Markovian jumps of the (spinless) electron energy on the dot between two levels. The temporal evolutions of the charge on the dot and of the currents in the leads are studied using a recently developed single-particle basis approach, which is particularly convenient for the averaging over the histories of the noise. In the steady state limit we recover the Landauer formula. At a very fast jump rate between the two levels, the noise does not affect the transport. As the jump rate decreases, the effective average transmission crosses over from the transmission through a single (average) level to an incoherent sum of the transmissions through the two levels. 13 pages, 6 figuresThe transient temporal evolution towards the steady state is dominated by the displacement current at short times, and by the Landauer current at long times. It contains oscillating terms, which decay to zero faster than for the case without noise. When the average chemical potential on the leads equals the dot's "original" energy, without the noise, the oscillations disappear completely and the transient evolution becomes independent of the noise.

We characterize the shift and dephasing as a function of atomic density, probe Rabi frequency, and principal quantum number of Rydberg states, and demonstrate that the observed spectral shift and dephasing are reduced if the size of a Gaussian atomic cloud is increased. We simulate our experiment with a semi-analytical model, which gives results in good agreement with our experimental data.

abstract: Generation of even-order harmonics due to spatial symmetry breaking in high-order harmonic generation investigated by numerically solving one-dimensional electronic time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The simple molecular ions H$_2^+$ and T$_2^+$ is chosen under a 14-cycle trapezoidal laser pulse at 800 nm wavelength and $I=$3 $\times 10^{14}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity. For an isotope (H$_2^+$) that has not a significant HHG at the laser falling edge, only odd harmonic orders are observed. Whereas, for one (T$_2^+$) with considerable HHG at the falling part of the laser pulse, frequency redshift occurs for odd-order harmonics and also even harmonic orders appear as a result of spatial symmetry breaking. To clarify further, spatial distribution of HHG and resolving HHG into different components are demonstrated. The contribution of different electronic states to the complexities in terms of internuclear distance is also demonstrated. The results also help to understand better complicated features observed for even a non-trapezoidal laser pulse and even a multi-electron molecular system.

abstract: Using numerical simulations of two-photon electronic absorption with femtosecond pulses in Na$_2$ we show that: i) it is possible to avoid the characteristic saturation or dumped Rabi oscillations in the yield of absorption by time-delaying the laser pulses; ii) it is possible to accelerate the onset of adiabatic passage by using the vibrational coherence starting in a wave packet; and iii) it is possible to prepare the initial wave packet in order to achieve full state-selective transitions with broadband pulses. The findings can be used, for instance, to achieve ultrafast adiabatic passage by light-induced potentials and understand its intrinsic robustness.

abstract: The scattering of matter wave solitons on attractive potentials enables one to populate bound states, a feature impossible with noninteracting wave packets. Compared to noninteracting states, the populated states are renormalized by the attractive interactions between atoms and keep the same topology. This renormalization can even transform a virtual state into a bound state. Our numerical studies show how such scattering experiments can reveal and characterize the surface states of a periodic structure whose translational invariance has been broken. Our proposal can be implemented with current experimental techniques.

abstract: A new perspective on how to manipulate molecules by means of very strong laser pulses is emerging with insights from the so-called light-induced potentials, which are the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of molecules severely distorted by the effect of the strong field. Different effects appear depending on how the laser frequency is tuned, to a certain electronic transition, creating light-induced avoided crossings, or very off-resonant, generating Stark shifts. In the former case it is possible to induce dramatic changes in the geometry and redistribution of charges in the molecule while the lasers are acting and to fully control photodissociation reactions as well as other photochemical processes. Several theoretical proposals taken from the work of the authors are reviewed and analyzed showing the unique features that the strong-laser chemistry opens to control the transient properties and the dynamics of molecules.
