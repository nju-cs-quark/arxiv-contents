abstract: Analytical evidence for the physical relevance of generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) has recently been provided in [PRL 110, 040404]: Natural occupation numbers $\vec{\lambda}\equiv (\lambda_i)$ of the ground state of a model system in the regime of weak couplings $\kappa$ of three spinless fermions in one spatial dimension were found extremely close, in a distance $D_{min}\sim \kappa^8$ to the boundary of the allowed region. We provide a self-contained and complete study of this quasipinning phenomenon. In particular, we develop tools for its systematic exploration and quantification. We confirm that quasipinning in one dimension occurs also for larger particle numbers and extends to intermediate coupling strengths, but vanishes for very strong couplings. We further explore the non-triviality of our findings by comparing quasipinning by GPCs to potential quasipinning by the less restrictive Pauli exclusion principle constraints. This allows us to eventually confirm the significance of GPCs beyond Pauli's exclusion principle.

abstract: We investigate the separable states $\r$ of an arbitrary multipartite quantum system with Hilbert space $\cH$ of dimensionin $d$. The length $L(\r)$ of $\r$ is defined as the smallest number of pure product states having $\r$ as their mixture. The length filtration of the set of separable states, $\cS$, is the increasing chain $\emptyset\subset\cS'_1\subseteq\cS'_2\subseteq\cdots$, where $\cS'_i=\{\r\in\cS:L(\r)\le i\}$. We define the maximum length, $L_{\rm max}=\max_{\r\in\cS} L(\r)$, critical length, $L_{\rm crit}$, and yet another special length, $L_c$, which was defined by a simple formula in one of our previous papers. The critical length indicates the first term in the length filtrartion whose dimension is equal to $\dim\cS$. We show that in general $d\le L_c\le L_{\rm crit}\le L_{\rm max}\le d^2$. We conjecture that the equality $L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ holds for all finite-dimensional multipartite quantum systems. Our main result is that $L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ for the bipartite systems having a single qubit as one of the parties. This is accomplished by computing the rank of the Jacobian matrix of a suitable map having $\cS$ as its range.

abstract: We study the gain-assisted light transmissions in optomechanical systems, especially the nonlinear higher-order sideband process. We find that: (i) in a single active cavity, the efficiency of the second-order process is considerably enhanced, and the accompanying group delay can surpass that of the probe field, which is unattainable for a lossy cavity (i.e. without any gain); (ii) in an active-passive compound system, the second-order process can be further enhanced by approaching to the gain-loss balance, and hundreds of microsecond of relative delay or advance are achievable between the probe and the second-order signal, indicating an active optomechanical modulator both in frequency and time domains.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of the phase noise, intensity and quadrature squeezing power spectra of the transmitted field of a driven optical cavity containing an interacting one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. We show how the pattern of the output power spectrum of the cavity changes due to the nonlinear effect of atomic collisions. Furthermore, it is shown that due to a one-to-one correspondence between the splitting of the peaks in the phase noise power spectrum of the cavity output field and the \textit{s}-wave scattering frequency of the atom-atom interaction, one can measure the strength of interatomic interaction. Besides, we show how the atomic collisions affect the squeezing behavior of the output field.

abstract: Compared to the quantum noise in the measurement of the translational motion of a suspended mirror using laser light, the quantum noise in the measurement of the angular motion of a suspended mirror has not been investigated intensively despite its potential importance. In this letter, an expression for the quantum noise in the angular motion measurement is explicitly derived. The expression indicates that one quadrature of the vacuum field of the first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode of light causes quantum sensing noise and the other causes quantum backaction noise, or in other words the first-order vacuum field is ponderomotively squeezed. It is also shown that the Gouy phase shift the light acquires between the mirror and the position of detection of the light corresponds to the homodyne angle. Therefore, the quantum backaction noise can be cancelled and the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by choosing the appropriate position of detection analogously to the cancellation of quantum radiation pressure noise by choosing an appropriate homodyne angle.

abstract: We present a construction of new bound entangled states from given bound entangled states for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems. One way to construct bound entangled states is to show that these states are PPT (positive partial transpose) and violate the range criterion at the same time. By applying certain operators to given bound entangled states or to one of the subsystems of the given bound entangled states, we obtain a set of new states which are both PPT and violate the range criterion. We show that the derived bound entangled states are not local unitary equivalent to the original bound entangled states by detail examples.

abstract: In this paper we discuss the representational realist stance as a pluralist ontic approach to inter-theoretic relationships. Our stance stresses the fact that physical theories require the necessary consideration of a conceptual level of discourse which determines and configures the specific field of phenomena discussed by each particular theory. We will criticize the orthodox line of research which has grounded the analysis about QM in two (Bohrian) metaphysical presuppositions -accepted in the present as dogmas that all interpretations must follow. We will also examine how the orthodox project of "bridging the gap" between the quantum and the classical domains has constrained the possibilities of research, producing only a limited set of interpretational problems which only focus in the justification of "classical reality" and exclude the possibility of analyzing the possibilities of non-classical conceptual representations of QM. The representational realist stance introduces two new problems, namely, the superposition problem and the contextuality problem, which consider explicitly the conceptual representation of orthodox QM beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and measurement outcomes. In the final part of the paper, we revisit, from a representational realist perspective, the quantum to classical limit and the orthodox claim that this inter-theoretic relation can be explained through the principle of decoherence.

abstract: We study how useful random states are for quantum metrology, i.e., surpass the classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase estimation scenario. First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space of distinguishable particles typically do not lead to super-classical scaling of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we show that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization. Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low purity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for such states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to typically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from three types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation.

abstract: A problem in quantum information theory is to find the experimental setup that maximizes the nonlocality of correlations with respect to some suitable measure such as the violation of Bell inequalities. The latter has however some drawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of Bell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find the experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation suffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the Bell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct information-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical communication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per instance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a convex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number of measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental setup. In this paper, we present a simple method for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space and, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the corresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional relationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is illustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the violation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit as well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed by qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed as a measure of nonlocality.

abstract: Persistent control of a transmon qubit is performed by a feedback protocol based on continuous weak measurement of its fluorescence. By driving the qubit and cavity with microwave signals whose amplitudes depend linearly on the instantaneous values of the quadratures of the measured fluorescence field, we demonstrate the permanent stabilization of the qubit in any direction of the Bloch sphere. Using a Josephson mixer as a phase-preserving amplifier, it was possible to reach a total measurement efficiency $\eta$=35%, leading to a maximum of 59% of excitation and 44% of coherence for the stabilized states. The experiment demonstrates multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) analog markovian feedback in the quantum regime.

abstract: Compared with introductory physics, relatively little is known about the development of expertise in advanced physics courses, especially in the case of quantum mechanics. Here, we describe a framework for understanding the patterns of student reasoning difficulties and how students develop expertise in quantum mechanics. The framework posits that the challenges many students face in developing expertise in quantum mechanics are analogous to the challenges introductory students face in developing expertise in introductory classical mechanics. This framework incorporates both the diversity in upper-level students' prior preparation, goals, and motivation in general (i.e., the facts that even in upper-level courses, students may be inadequately prepared, have unclear goals, and have insufficient motivation to excel) as well as the "paradigm shift" from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The framework is based on empirical investigations demonstrating that the patterns of reasoning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring difficulties in quantum mechanics bear a striking resemblance to those found in introductory classical mechanics. Examples from research in quantum mechanics and introductory classical mechanics are discussed to illustrate how the patterns of difficulties are analogous as students learn to unpack the respective principles and grasp the formalism in each knowledge domain during the development of expertise. Embracing such a framework and contemplating the parallels between the difficulties in these two knowledge domains can enable researchers to leverage the extensive literature for introductory physics education research to guide the design of teaching and learning tools for helping students develop expertise in quantum mechanics.

abstract: Learning advanced physics, in general, is challenging not only due to the increased mathematical sophistication but also because one must continue to build on all of the prior knowledge acquired at the introductory and intermediate levels. In addition, learning quantum mechanics can be especially challenging because the paradigms of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are very different. Here, we review research on student reasoning difficulties in learning upper-level quantum mechanics and research on students' problem-solving and metacognitive skills in these courses. Some of these studies were multi-university investigations. The investigations suggest that there is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum mechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor and many students in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the fundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum mechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in introductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to over-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to another context where they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in distinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the formalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of the research-based approached that take advantage of research on student difficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics.

We have been investigating the difficulties that the advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with Dirac notation. We administered written free response and multiple-choice questions to students and also conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 23 students using a think-aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale behind their responses. We find that many students struggle with Dirac notation and they are not consistent in using this notation across various questions in a given test. In particular, whether they answer questions involving Dirac notation correctly or not is context dependent.

In the Schr\"odinger representation, the wave function evolves in time according to the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The time dependence of the wave function gives rise to time dependence of the expectation value of observables. We have been exploring the difficulties that advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with time dependence of expectation values in quantum mechanics. We have developed and administered conceptual free response and multiple-choice questions to students to investigate these difficulties. We also interviewed 23 students individually using a think-aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale behind students' written responses. We find that many students struggle with time dependence of expectation values of observables. We discuss some findings.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of single-qubit operations by oscillatory fields on various semiconductor platforms. We explicitly show how to perform faster gate operations by going beyond the universally-used rotating wave approximation (RWA) regime, while using only two sinusoidal pulses. No complicated pulse shaping or optimal control sequences are required. We first show for specific published experiments how much error is currently incurred by implementing pulses designed using standard RWA. We then show that an even modest increase in gate speed would cause problems in using RWA for gate design in the singlet-triplet (ST) and resonant-exchange (RX) qubits. We discuss the extent to which analytically keeping higher orders in the perturbation theory would address the problem. More strikingly, we give a new prescription for gating with strong coupling far beyond the RWA regime. We perform numerical calculations for the phases and the durations of two consecutive pulses to realize the key Hadamard and $\frac{\pi}{8}$ gates with coupling strengths up to several times the qubit splitting. Working in this manifestly non-RWA regime, the gate operation speeds up by two to three orders of magnitude.

abstract: In this paper we propose an extended Kundu-Eckhaus equation (KEE) for modeling the dynamics of skewed rogue waves emerging in the vicinity of a wave blocking point due to opposing current. The equation we propose is a KEE with an additional potential term therefore the results presented in this paper can easily be generalized to study the quantum tunneling properties of the rogue waves and ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses of the KEE. In the frame of the extended KEE, we numerically show that the chaotic perturbations of the ocean current trigger the occurrence of the rogue waves on the ocean surface. We propose and implement a split-step scheme and show that the extended KEE that we propose is unstable against random chaotic perturbations in the current profile. These perturbations transform the monochromatic wave field into a chaotic sea state with many peaks. We numerically show that the shapes of rogue waves due to perturbations in the current profile closely follow the form of rational rogue wave solutions, especially for the central peak. We also discuss the effects of magnitude of the chaotic current perturbations on the statistics of the rogue wave occurrence.

abstract: We study the energy transport in a system of two half-infinite XXZ chains initially kept separated at different temperatures, and later connected and let free to evolve unitarily. By changing independently the parameters of the two halves, we highlight, through bosonisation and time-dependent matrix-product-state simulations, the different contributions of low-lying bosonic modes and of fermionic quasi-particles to the energy transport. In the simulations we also observe that the energy current reaches a finite value which only slowly decays to zero. The general pictures that emerges is the following. Since integrability is only locally broken in this model, a pre-equilibration behaviour may appear. In particular, when the sound velocities of the bosonic modes of the two halves match, the low-temperature energy current is almost stationary and described by a formula with a non-universal prefactor interpreted as a transmission coefficient. Thermalisation, characterized by the absence of any energy flow, occurs only on longer time-scales which are not accessible with our numerics.

abstract: We study the propagation of a hole in degenerate (paramagnetic) spin environments. This canonical problem has important connections to a number of physical systems, and is perfectly suited for experimental realization with ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice. At the short-to-intermediate timescale that we can access using a stochastic-series-type numeric scheme, the propagation turns out to be distinctly non-diffusive with the proba- bility distribution featuring minima in both space and time due to quantum interference, yet the motion is not ballistic, except at the beginning. We discuss possible scenarios for long-term evolution that could be explored with an unprecedented degree of detail in experiments with single-atom resolved imaging.

First, we present efficient simulations of probabilistic and quantum automata by means of affine automata which allows us to characterized the class of exclusive stochastic languages. Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state numbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded.

abstract: We investigate confinement-induced resonances in a system composed by a tightly trapped ion and a moving atom in a waveguide. We determine the conditions for the appearance of such resonances in a broad region -- from the "long-wavelength" limit to the opposite case when the typical length scale of the atom-ion interaction essentially exceeds the transverse waveguide width. We find considerable dependence of the resonance position on the atomic mass which, however, disappears in the "long-wavelength" limit, where the result for the confined atom-atom scattering is reproduced. We also derive an analytic formula for the resonance position in the "long-wavelength zero-energy" limit. Our results, which can be investigated in current experiments, indicate a strategy to determine the atom-ion scattering length, the temperature of the atomic ensemble in the presence of an ion impurity, and a pathway to control the atom-phonon coupling in a one dimensional ion crystal in interaction with an atomic quantum gas.

abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetric systems have two distinguished phases, e.g., one with real energy eigenvalues and the other with complex conjugate eigenvalues. To enter one phase from the other, it is believed that the system must pass through an exceptional point, which is a non-Hermitian degenerate point with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this letter we reveal an anomalous PT transition that takes place away from an exceptional point in a nonlinear system: as the nonlinearity increases, the original linear system evolves along two distinct PT-symmetric trajectories, each of which can have an exceptional point. However, the two trajectories collide and vanish away from these exceptional points, after which the system is left with a PT-broken phase. We first illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify it using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.
