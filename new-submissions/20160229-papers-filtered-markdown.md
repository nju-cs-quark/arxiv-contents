**1.    Harnessing disordered quantum dynamics for machine learning**

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computer has an amazing potential of fast information processing. However, realisation of a digital quantum computer is still a challenging problem requiring highly accurate controls and key application strategies. Here we propose a novel platform, quantum reservoir computing, to solve these issues successfully by exploiting natural quantum dynamics, which is ubiquitous in laboratories nowadays, for machine learning. In this framework, nonlinear dynamics including classical chaos can be universally emulated in quantum systems. A number of numerical experiments show that quantum systems consisting of at most seven qubits possess computational capabilities comparable to conventional recurrent neural networks of 500 nodes. This discovery opens up a new paradigm for information processing with artificial intelligence powered by quantum physics.

**2.    Eigenfunction structure and scaling of two interacting particles in the one-dimensional Anderson model**

<blockquote>
<p>
The localization properties of eigenfunctions for two interacting particles in the one-dimensional Anderson model are studied for system sizes up to $N=5000$ sites corresponding to a Hilbert space of dimension $\approx 10^7$ using the Green function Arnoldi method. The eigenfunction structure is illustrated in position, momentum and energy representation, the latter corresponding to an expansion in non-interacting product eigenfunctions. Different types of localization lengths are computed for parameter ranges in system size, disorder and interaction strengths inaccessible until now. We confirm that one-parameter scaling theory can be successfully applied provided that the condition of $N$ being significantly larger than the one-particle localization length $L_1$ is verified. The enhancement effect of the two-particle localization length $L_2$ behaving as $L_2\sim L_1^2$ is clearly confirmed for a certain quite large interval of optimal interactions strengths. Further new results for the interaction dependence in a very large interval, an energy value outside the band center, and different interaction ranges are obtained.
