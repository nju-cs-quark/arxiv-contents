abstract: We examine a class of operations for topological quantum computation based on fusing and measuring topological charges for systems with SU$(2)_4$ or $k=4$ Jones-Kauffman anyons. We show that such operations augment the braiding operations, which, by themselves, are not computationally universal. This augmentation results in a computationally universal gate set through the generation of an exact, topologically protected irrational phase gate and an approximate, topologically protected controlled-$Z$ gate.

abstract: Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of a classical description of objects in terms of the creation of many redundant registers in an environment containing their classical information. This amplification phenomenon, where only classical information reaches the macroscopic observer and through which different observers can agree on the objective existence of such object, has been revived lately for several types of situations, successfully explaining classicality. We explore quantum Darwinism in the setting of an environment made of two level systems which are initially prepared in the ground state of the XX model, which exhibits different phases; we find that the different phases have different ability to redundantly acquire classical information about the system, being the "ferromagnetic phase" the only one able to complete quantum Darwinism. At the same time we relate this ability to how non-Markovian the system dynamics is, based on the interpretation that non-Markovian dynamics is associated to back flow of information from environment to system, thus spoiling the information transfer needed for Darwinism. Finally, we explore mixing of bath registers by allowing a small interaction among them, finding that this spoils the stored information as previously found in the literature.

abstract: We demonstrate arbitrary coherent addressing of individual neutral atoms in a $5\times 5\times 5$ array formed by an optical lattice. Addressing is accomplished using rapidly reconfigurable crossed laser beams to selectively ac Stark shift target atoms, so that only target atoms are resonant with state-changing microwaves. The effect of these targeted single qubit gates on the quantum information stored in non-targeted atoms is smaller than $3\times 10^{-3}$ in state fidelity. This is an important step along the path of converting the scalability promise of neutral atoms into reality.

abstract: Consider a bipartite quantum system with at least one of its two components being itself a composite system. By tracing over part of one (or both) of these two subsystems it is possible to obtain a reduced (separable) state that exhibits quantum correlations even if the original state of the full system is endowed only with classical correlations. This effect, first pointed out by Li and Luo in (2008), is of considerable interest because there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that quantum correlations in non-entangled, mixed states may constitute a useful resource to implement non trivial information related tasks. Here we conduct a systematic exploration of the aforementioned effect for particular families of states of quantum systems of low dimensionality (three qubits states). In order to assess the non-classicality of the correlations of the reduced states we use an indicator of quantum correlations based upon the state disturbances generated by the measurement of local observables. We show, for a three-qubit system, that there exists a relationship between the classical mutual information of the original classically correlated states and the maximum quantum correlation exhibited by the reduced states.

abstract: We report the storage of microwave pulses at the single-photon level in a spin-ensemble memory consisting of $10^{10}$ NV centers in a diamond crystal coupled to a superconducting LC resonator. The energy of the signal, retrieved $100\, \mu \mathrm{s}$ later by spin-echo techniques, reaches $0.3\%$ of the energy absorbed by the spins, and this storage efficiency is quantitatively accounted for by simulations. This figure of merit is sufficient to envision first implementations of a quantum memory for superconducting qubits.

abstract: Here we propose and analyse in detail protocols that can achieve rapid hyperpolarization of 13C nuclear spins in randomly oriented ensembles of nanodiamonds at room temperature. Our protocols exploit a combination of optical polarization of electron spins in nitrogen-vacancy centers and the transfer of this polarization to 13C nuclei by means of microwave control to overcome the severe challenges that are posed by the random orientation of the nanodiamonds and their nitrogen-vacancy centers. Specifically, these random orientations result in exceedingly large energy variations of the electron spin levels that render the polarization and coherent control of the nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins as well as the control of their coherent interaction with the surrounding 13C nuclear spins highly inefficient. We address these challenges by a combination of an off-resonant microwave double resonance scheme in conjunction with a realization of the integrated solid effect which, together with adiabatic rotations of external magnetic fields or rotations of nanodiamonds, leads to a protocol that achieves high levels of hyperpolarization of the entire nuclear-spin bath in a randomly oriented ensemble of nanodiamonds even at room temperature. This hyperpolarization together with the long nuclear spin polarization lifetimes in nanodiamonds and the relatively high density of 13C nuclei has the potential to result in a major signal enhancement in 13C nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and suggests functionalized and hyperpolarized nanodiamonds as a unique probe for molecular imaging both in vitro and in vivo.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: One of the defining traits of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle which was originally expressed in terms of the standard deviation of two observables. Alternatively, it can be formulated using entropic measures, and can also be generalized by including a memory particle that is entangled with the particle to be measured. Here we consider a realistic scenario where the memory particle is an open system interacting with an external environment. Through the relation of conditional entropy to mutual information, we provide a link between memory effects and the rate of change of conditional entropy controlling the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation. Our treatment reveals that the memory effects stemming from the non-Markovian nature of quantum dynamical maps directly control the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation in a general way, independently of the specific type of interaction between the memory particle and its environment.

abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in terms of information-theoretic principles is a popular chapter in quantum foundations. Traditionally, the principles designed for this scope have been expressed in terms of conditional probability distributions, specifying the probability that a black box produces a certain output upon receiving a certain input. This framework is known as "device-independent". Another major topic in quantum foundations is the information-theoretic characterization of quantum theory as a physical theory, with its sets of states and measurements, and with its allowed dynamics. The different frameworks adopted for this scope are known under the umbrella term "general probabilistic theories". With only a few exceptions, the two programmes have proceeded on separate tracks, each one developing its own methods and agenda. However, the two programmes share the same basic goal: a new and better understanding of quantum mechanics in information-theoretic terms. From this viewpoint, it is quite striking that the connections are still largely undeveloped. This paper aims at bridging the gap, by presenting "Rosetta stone" for the two frameworks and by illustrating how ideas from one programme can shed light on the other. As a case study, we focus on two device-independent features known as Local Orthogonality (LO) and Consistent Exclusivity (CE) and reconstruct them from a different set of principles about pure orthogonal measurements, that is, measurements that cannot be further refined and that identifies states without error.

abstract: We develop a microscopic toy model for Cavity dynamical Casimir effect (DCE), namely, the photon generation from vacuum due to a nonstationary dielectric slab in a fixed single mode cavity. We represent the slab by $N\gg 1$ noninteracting two-level atoms coupled to the field via the standard dipole interaction. We show that the DCE is contained implicitly in the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian when its parameters are externally prescribed functions of time. We also predict several new phenomena, such as saturation of the photon growth due to effective Kerr nonlinearity, generation of pairs of atomic excitations instead of photons ("Inverse DCE") and coherent annihilation of pair of system excitations due to the atomic modulation ("Anti-DCE"). These results are extended to the circuit QED architecture, where similar effects can be implemented with a single qubit providing an alternative way to generate cavity and atom-field entangled states.

abstract: Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) seems attractively simple: information is borne entirely by light and processed by components such as beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors. However this very simplicity leads to limitations, such as the lack of deterministic entangling operations, which are compensated for by using substantial hardware overheads. Here we quantify the resource costs for full scale LOQC by proposing a specific protocol based on the surface code. With the caveat that our protocol can be further optimised, we report that the required number of physical components is at least five orders of magnitude greater than in comparable matter-based systems. Moreover the resource requirements grow higher if the per-component photon loss rate is worse than one in a thousand, or the per-component noise rate is worse than $10^{-5}$. We identify the performance of switches in the network as the single most influential factor influencing resource scaling.

abstract: We construct a model of quantum metrology inspired by the computational model known as \emph{deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit} (DQC1). Using only one pure qubit together with $l$ fully-mixed qubits we obtain measurement precision at the standard quantum limit, which is typically obtained using the same number of uncorrelated qubits in fully-pure states. The standard quantum limit can be exceeded using an additional qubit which adds only a small amount of purity. We show that the discord in the final state vanishes only in the limit of attaining infinite precision for the parameter being estimated.

abstract: We outline a general method of constructing finite-range cloaking potentials which render a given finite-range real or complex potential $v(x)$ unidirectionally reflectionless or invisible at a wavenumber $k_0$ of our choice. We give explicit analytic expressions for three classes of cloaking potentials which achieve this goal while preserving some or all of the other scattering properties of $v(x)$. The cloaking potentials we construct are the sum of up to three constituent unidirectionally invisible potentials. We also discuss their application in making $v(x)$ bidirectionally invisible at $k_0$, and demonstrate the application of our method to obtain anti-reflection and invisibility cloaks for a Bragg reflector.

Numerical results regarding the asymptotic behavior of the localization are also presented.

abstract: We study the role of quantum statistics in the performance of Otto cycles. First, we show analytically that the work distributions for bosonic and fermionic working fluids are identical for cycles driven by harmonic trapping potentials. Subsequently, in the case of non-harmonic potentials, we find that the interplay between different energy level spacings and particle statistics strongly affects the performances of the engine cycle. To demonstrate this, we examine three trapping potentials which induce different (single particle) energy level spacings: monotonically decreasing with the level number, monotonically increasing, and the case in which the level spacing does not vary monotonically.
