abstract: For $N$ spin-polarized fermions in a $1$-dimensional trap with strong attractive interactions an odd-even effect is found. The entanglement spectrum of the $1$-particle reduced density matrix of the system's ground state differs qualitatively for $N$ odd and $N$ even. Since this effect does not occur for bosons it is the result of the competition between the attractive interaction and the repulsive nature of Pauli's exclusion principle. In contrast to the spectrum, the fermionic $1$-particle density and correlation function do not show any sensitivity on the number parity. This suggests that reduced density matrix functional theory for strong attractive interactions has a more subtle $N$-dependency than density functional theory.

abstract: We introduce a new approach to analyzing the interaction between classical and quantum systems that is based on a limiting procedure applied to multi-particle Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The limit equations obtained by this procedure, which we refer to as the classical-quantum limit, govern the interaction between classical and quantum systems, and they possess many desirable properties that are inherited in the limit from the multi-particle quantum system. As an application, we use the classical-quantum limit equations to identify the source of the non-local signalling that is known to occur in the classical-quantum hybrid scheme of Hall and Reginatto. We also derive the first order correction to the classical-quantum limit equation to obtain a fully consistent first order approximation to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation that should be accurate for modeling the interaction between particles of disparate mass in the regime where the particles with the larger masses are effectively classical.

abstract: The possibility to induce predetermined coherent quantum dynamics by controlling only the dissipative environmental parameters (such as temperature and pressure) is studied using the combined optimal control and environment engineering frameworks. As an example, we consider the problem of transforming an optically excited donor state into free charge carriers via intermediate higher-lying bridge state(s), with a view to solar energy conversion. In this context, vibrational bath engineering allows to promote fast, directional charge transfer and to suppress recombinative losses.

abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a way to characterize the NV centers. Recently, a remarkably sharp dip was observed in the ODMR with a high-density ensemble of NV centers, and this was reproduced by a theoretical model in [Zhu et al., Nature Communications 5, 3424 (2014)], showing that the dip is a consequence of the spin-1 properties of the NV centers. Here, we present much more details of analysis to show how this model can be applied to investigate the properties of the NV centers. By using our model, we have reproduced the ODMR with and without applied magnetic fields. Also, we theoretically investigate how the ODMR is affected by the typical parameters of the ensemble NV centers such as strain distributions, inhomogeneous magnetic fields, and homogeneous broadening width. Our model could provide a way to estimate these parameters from the ODMR, which would be crucial to realize diamond-based quantum information processing.

abstract: We extend recent results on expectation values of coherent oscillator states and SU(2) coherent states to the case of the discrete representations of su(1,1). Systematic semiclassical expansions of products of arbitrary operators are derived. In particular, the leading order of the energy uncertainty of an arbitrary Hamiltonian is found to be given purely in terms of the time dependence of the classical variables. The coherent states considered here include the Perelomov-Gilmore coherent states. As an important application we discuss the pseudoharmonic oscillator and compare the Perelomov-Gilmore states with the states introduced by Barut and Girardello. The latter ones turn out to be closer to the classical limit as their relative energy variance decays with the inverse square root of energy, while in the former case a constant is approached.

abstract: A simple formula is derived for the maximum squeezing rate which occurs at the initial stages of the squeezing process: the rate only depends on the second partial derivatives of a classical Hamiltonian. Rules for optimum rotation of the phase space are found to keep the state optimally located and oriented for fastest squeezing. These operations transform the phase-space point of interest into a saddle point with opposite principal curvatures. Similar results are found for the Bloch-sphere phase space and spin squeezing. Application of the general formulas is illustrated by several model examples including parametric downconversion, Kerr nonlinearity, Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and spin squeezing by one-axis twisting and two-axis countertwisting.

The measurement is performed by applying a microwave pulse to induce the transition between different electronic spin states. Under the practical experimental conditions, our calculations properly show that there exist both quantum Zeno and Zeno-like effects in an NV center.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove a local optimality property of a recently proposed coherent feedback configuration for distributed generation of EPR entanglement using two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs) in the idealized infinite bandwidth limit. This local optimality is with respect to a class of similar coherent feedback configurations but employing different unitary scattering matrices, representing different scattering of propagating signals within the network. The infinite bandwidth limit is considered as it significantly simplifies the analysis, allowing local optimality criteria to be explicitly verified. Nonetheless, this limit is relevant for the finite bandwidth scenario as it provides an accurate approximation to the EPR entanglement in the low frequency region where EPR entanglement exists.

abstract: We propose a new test of local realism based on correlation measurements of continuum valued functions of positions and momenta, known as modular variables. The Wigner representation of these observables are bounded in phase space, and therefore, the associated inequality holds for any state described by a non-negative Wigner function. This agrees with Bell's remark that positive Wigner functions, serving as a valid probability distribution over local (hidden) phase space coordinates, do not reveal non-locality. We construct a class of entangled states resulting in a violation of the inequality, and thus truly demonstrate non-locality in phase space. The states can be realized through grating techniques in space-like separated interferometric setups. The non-locality is verified from the spatial correlation data, collected from the screens.

abstract: The future of quantum repeater networking will require interoperability between various error correcting codes. A few specific code conversions and even a generalized method are known, however, no detailed analysis of these techniques in the context of quantum networking has been performed. In this paper, we analyze a generalized procedure to create Bell pairs encoded heterogeneously between two separate codes used often in error corrected quantum repeater network designs. We begin with a physical Bell pair, then encode each qubit in a different error correcting code, using entanglement purification to increase the fidelity. We investigate three separate protocols for preparing the purified encoded Bell pair. We calculate the error probability of those schemes between the Steane [[7,1,3]] code, a distance three surface code and single physical qubits by Monte Carlo simulation under a standard Pauli error model, and estimate the resource efficiency of the procedures. A local gate error rate of $10^{-3}$ allows us to create high-fidelity logical Bell pairs between any of our chosen codes. We find that a postselected model, where any detected parity flips in code stabilizers result in a restart of the protocol, performs the best.

abstract: The non-classical nature of quantum states, often illustrated using entanglement measures or quantum discord, constitutes a resource for quantum information protocols. However, the non-classicality of a quantum system cannot be encapsulated as a property of the state alone, as the set of available measurements used to extract information on the system is typically restricted. In this work we study how the non-classicality of quantum measurements, quantified via their incompatibility, is influenced by quantum noise and, further, how a non-Markovian environment may help us in maintaining the measurement resources.

abstract: We present a method to accelerate the dynamical evolution of multiqubit open system by employing dynamical decoupling pulses (DDPs) when the qubits are initially in W-type states. It is found that this speed-up evolution can be achieved in both of the weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling regime. The physical mechanism behind the acceleration evolution is explained as the result of the joint action of the non-Markovianity of reservoirs and the excited-state population of qubits. It is shown that both of the non-Markovianity and the excited-state population can be controlled by DDPs to realize the quantum speed-up.

abstract: Quantum vacuum fluctuations impose strict limits on precision displacement measurements, those of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors among them. Introducing squeezed states into an interferometer's readout port can improve the sensitivity of the instrument, leading to richer astrophysical observations. However, optomechanical interactions dictate that the vacuum's squeezed quadrature must rotate by 90 degrees around 50Hz. Here we use a 2-m-long, high-finesse optical resonator to produce frequency-dependent rotation around 1.2kHz. This demonstration of audio-band frequency-dependent squeezing uses technology and methods that are scalable to the required rotation frequency, heralding application of the technique in future gravitational-wave detectors.

abstract: We explore energy transfer in a generic three-level system, which is coupled to three non-equilibrium baths. Built on the concept of quantum heat engine, our three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including light-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced isomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of light-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is transferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and finally decays to the ground state. The efficiency of this process is evaluated by steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus a wide range of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the coupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in population inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which optimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling limit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency approaches the heat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois in Phys. Rew. Lett. 2, 262 (1959).

abstract: Understanding the non-Markovian mechanisms underlying the revivals of quantum entanglement in the presence of classical environments is central in the theory of quantum information. Tentative interpretations have been given by either the role of the environment as a control device or the concept of hidden entanglement. We address this issue from an information-theoretic point of view. To this aim, we consider a paradigmatic tripartite system, already realized in the laboratory, made of two independent qubits and a random classical field locally interacting with one qubit alone. We study the dynamical relationship between the two-qubit entanglement and the genuine tripartite correlations of the overall system, finding that collapse and revivals of entanglement correspond, respectively, to raise and fall of the overall tripartite correlations. Interestingly, entanglement dark periods can enable plateaux of nonzero tripartite correlations. We then explain this behavior in terms of information flows among the different parties of the system. Besides showcasing the phenomenon of the freezing of overall correlations, our results provide new insights on the origin of retrieval of entanglement within a hybrid quantum-classical system.

abstract: Finding efficient descriptions of how an environment affects a collection of discrete quantum systems would lead to new insights into many areas of modern physics. Markovian, or time-local, methods work well for individual systems, but for groups a question arises: does system-bath or inter-system coupling dominate the dissipative dynamics? The answer has profound consequences for the long-time quantum correlations within the system. We consider two bosonic modes coupled to a bath. By comparing an exact solution to different Markovian master equations, we find that a smooth crossover of the equations-of-motion between dominant inter-system and system-bath coupling exists -- but requires a non-secular master equation. We predict a singular behaviour of the dynamics, and show that the ultimate failure of non-secular equations of motion is essentially a failure of the Markov approximation. Our findings justify the use of time-local theories throughout the crossover between system-bath dominated and inter-system-coupling dominated dynamics.

abstract: By performing quantum-noise-limited optical heterodyne detection, we observe polarization noise in light after propagation through a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF). We compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and find an increase of noise even though the light is mainly transmitted in air in a hollow-core PCF. Combined with our simulation of the acoustic vibrational modes in the hollow-core PCF, we are offering an explanation for the polarization noise with a variation of guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS). Here, instead of modulating the strain in the fiber core as in a solid core fiber, the acoustic vibrations in hollow-core PCF influence the effective refractive index by modulating the geometry of the photonic crystal structure. This induces polarization noise in the light guided by the photonic crystal structure.

abstract: We apply the $AdS/CFT$ holography to the simplest possible eternal time machine solution in $AdS_3$ based on two conical defects moving around their center of mass along a circular orbit. Closed timelike curves in this space-time extend all the way to the boundary of $AdS_3$, violating causality of the boundary field theory. By use of the geodesic approximation we address the "grandfather paradox" in the dual $1+1$ dimensional field theory and calculate the two-point retarded Green function. It has a non-trivial analytical structure both at negative and positive times, providing us with an intuition on how an interacting quantum field could behave once causality is broken. In contrast with the previous considerations our calculations reveal the possibility of a consistent and controllable evolution of a quantum system without any need to impose additional consistency constraints.

abstract: The problem of two Aharonov-Bohm (AB) vortices for the Helmholtz equation is examined in detail. It is demonstrated that the method proposed in [J. M. Myers, J. Math. Phys. \textbf{6}, 1839 (1963)] for diffraction on a slit can be generalized to get an explicit solution for AB vortices. Due to singular nature of AB interaction the Green function and the scattering amplitude for two AB vortices obey a series of partial differential equations. Coefficients entering these equations, in their turn, fulfill ordinary non-linear differential equations whose solutions can be obtained from a solution of the Painleve V (or III) equation. The asymptotics of necessary functions for very large and very small distances between two vortices are calculated explicitly. Taken together, it means that the problem of two AB vortices is integrable.

abstract: Dzhafarov, Zhang, and Kujala (arXiv:1504.07422) reviewed several behavioral data sets imitating the formal design of the quantum-mechanical contextuality experiments (such as EPR-Bell or Leggett-Garg ones), the conclusion was that contextuality was not present in any of these data sets. Aerts and Sozzo recently announced a new experiment (arXiv:1508.00434) whose results, they claimed, prove the presence of contextuality of the EPR-Bell type (entanglement) in conceptual combinations. We show that their experimental data exhibit no contextuality in the sense of the general definition of contextuality proposed in Dzhafarov, Kujala, and Larsson (Foundation of Physics 7, 762-782, 2015), while the traditional, narrow definition of contextuality does not apply to their data because they violate the condition of consistent connectedness (also known as marginal selectivity, no-signaling condition, no-disturbance principle, etc.). To circumvent the latter problem Aerts and Sozzo transform their experimental data using a computational procedure that makes all marginal probabilities equal to one half. We argue that this procedure is unjustifiable. It only works because it turns out to be a special version of the "depolarization" procedure described by Masanes, Acin, and Gisin (Physical Review A 73, 012112, 2006). Because this "correction" of probabilities is universally applicable, a definition of contextuality that would allow it would amount to simply ignoring marginal probabilities altogether. This would make the concept of contextuality trivial if not entirely empty.

abstract: An efficient numerical method is developed using the matrix product formalism for computing the properties at finite energy densities in one-dimensional (1D) many-body localized (MBL) systems. Arguing that any efficient (possibly quantum) algorithm can only have a polynomially small energy resolution, we propose a (rigorous) polynomial-time (classical) algorithm that outputs a diagonal density operator supported on a microcanonical ensemble of an inverse polynomial bandwidth. The proof uses no other conditions for MBL but assumes that the effect of any local perturbation (e.g., injecting conserved charges) is restricted to a region whose radius grows logarithmically with time. A non-optimal version of this algorithm efficiently simulates the quantum phase estimation algorithm in 1D MBL systems; a heuristic version of the algorithm can be easily coded and used to, e.g., detect energy-tuned dynamical quantum phase transitions between MBL phases. We extend the algorithm to two and higher spatial dimensions using the projected entangled pair formalism.
