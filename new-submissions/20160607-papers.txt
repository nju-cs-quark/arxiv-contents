abstract: Tripartite entangled states, such as GHZ and W states, are typically generated by manipulating two pairs of polarization-entangled photons in bulk optics. Here we propose a scheme to generate W states that are entangled in the energy degree of freedom in an integrated optical circuit. Our approach employs photon pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a micro- ring resonator. We also present a feasible procedure for demonstrating the generation of such a state, and we compare polarization-entangled and energy-entangled schemes for the preparation of W states.

abstract: A model cluster, with a central resonant electron spin surrounded with identical nuclear spins distributed over the sites of a rigid lattice, and with dipolar coupling between the spins, is used for a theoretical investigation of the transient nutations induced by a strong oscillating field but disturbed by these local dipolar fields. An effective Hamiltonian valid at the time scale of the nutations is first established. An analytical expression for the Dipolar Coherence time tDC is derived by adapting Van Vleck's perturbative approach to the present situation, with weak rather than intermediate dipolar coupling. It is found that the dipolar coupling does not affect tDC at exact ESR resonance (Delta=0), a result reminiscent of a behaviour found in transient NMR in liquids, in an inhomogeneous static field. The expression for tDC also presents a qualitative similarity with a time introduced in that liquid-state NMR context. Introducing a collection of independent clusters, a bridge is built between tDC and the half-width delta of the usual steady state unsaturated ESR line. Assuming a simple cubic lattice, numerical values for (tDC)Delta=delta are given, for both undiluted and dilute samples. It is shown that the TN do not obey the Bloch equations. Precautions to be taken when trying a qualitative comparison between the present results and existing experimental data, and some thermodynamic aspects, are discussed.

abstract: Diamond is a promising material for the development of emerging applications in quantum optics, quantum information and quantum sensing. The fabrication and characterization of novel luminescent defects with suitable opto-physical properties is therefore of primary importance for further advances in these research fields. In this work we report on the investigation in the formation of photoluminescent (PL) defects upon MeV He implantation in diamond. Such color centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and cathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between the PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He implantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL emission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were either unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover, the PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the graphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to optically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities. The intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a function of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission was observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\deg}C, at the expenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission intensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates from the formation of a stable lattice defect. Finally, the emission was investigated under different laser excitations wavelengths (i.e. 532 nm and 405 nm) with the purpose of gaining a preliminary insight about the position of the related levels in the energy gap of diamond.

abstract: We investigate the determination of a Hamiltonian parameter in a quantum system undergoing continuous measurement. We demonstrate a computationally rapid yet statistically optimal method to estimate an unknown and possibly time-dependent parameter, where we maximize the likelihood of the observed stochastic readout. By dealing directly with the raw measurement record rather than the quantum state trajectories, the estimation can be performed while the data is being acquired, permitting continuous tracking of the parameter during slow drifts in real time. Furthermore, we incorporate realistic nonidealities, such as decoherence processes and measurement inefficiency. As an example, we focus on estimating the value of the Rabi frequency of a continuously measured qubit, and compare maximum likelihood estimation to a simpler fast Fourier transform. Using this example, we discuss how the quality of the estimation depends on both the strength and duration of the measurement; we also discuss the trade-off between the accuracy of the estimate and the sensitivity to drift as the estimation duration is varied.

abstract: The Casimir force, originating from vacuum zero-point energy, is one of the most intriguing purely quantum effects. It has attracted renewed interests in current field of nanomechanics, due to the rapid size decrease of on-chip devices. Here we study the optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) with a tunable Casimir force. We find that the optical output rate can be significantly altered by the vacuum force, even terminated and then restored, indicating a highly-controlled optical switch. Our result addresses the possibility of designing exotic optical nano-devices by harnessing the power of vacuum.

abstract: Projective measurement can increase the entropy of a state $\rho$, the increased entropy is not only up to the basis of projective measurement, but also has something to do with the properties of the state itself. In this paper we define this increased entropy as basis entropy. And then we discuss the usefulness of this new concept by showing its application in explaining the success probability of Grover's algorithm and the existence of quantum discord. And as shown in the paper, this new concept can also be used to describe decoherence.

abstract: A dimension witness is a criterion that sets a lower bound on the dimension needed to reproduce the observed data. Three types of dimension witnesses can be found in the literature: device-dependent ones, in which the bound is obtained assuming some knowledge on the state and the measurements; device-independent prepare-and-measure ones, that can be applied to any system including classical ones; and device-independent Bell-based ones, that certify the minimal dimension of some entangled systems. Here we consider the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell-type inequality for four outcomes. We show that a sufficiently high violation of this inequality witnesses $d \geq 4$ and present a proof-of-principle experimental observation of such a violation. This presents a first experimental violation of the third type of dimension witness beyond qutrits.

abstract: We investigate duality in entanglement of a bipartite multi-photon system generated from a coherent state of light. The system can exhibit polarization entanglement if the two parts are distinguished by their parity, or parity entanglement if the parts are distinguished by polarization. It was shown in [PRL 110, 140404 (2013)] that this phenomenon can be exploited as a method to test indistinguishability of two particles and it was conjectured that one can also test indistinguishability of macroscopic systems. We propose a setup to test this conjecture. Contrary to the previous studies using two-particle interference effect as in Hong-Ou- Mandel setup, our setup neither assumes that the tested state is composed of single particles nor requires that the total number of particles be fixed. Consequently the notion of entanglement duality is shown to be compatible with a broader class of physical systems. Moreover, by observing duality in entanglement in the above system one can confirm that macroscopic systems exhibit quantum behaviour. As a practical side, entanglement duality is a useful concept that enables adaptive conversion of entanglement of one degree of freedom (DOF) to that of another DOF according to varying quantum protocols.

abstract: Dynamical reduction models propose a solution to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: the collapse of the wave function becomes a physical process. We consider the two most promising collapse models, the QMUPL (Quantum Mechanics with Universal Position Localization) model and the mass-proportional CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization) model, and derive their effect onto flavour oscillations of neutral mesons. We find that the dynamics of neutral mesons depends on the very assumptions of the noise field underlying any collapse model, thus the physics of the noise field becomes investigatable for these particular systems. Secondly, we find that the decay property of the mass eigenstates can be dynamically generated by the spontaneous collapse in space. Taking collapse models seriously we conclude that accelerator facilities have measured the absolute masses of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian giving raise to decay; this in turn is at the same footings as the mass difference giving raise to the flavour oscillations (predicted also by standard quantum mechanics). Thus dynamical reduction models can cover the full dynamics, oscillation and decay, of neutral mesons.

abstract: We consider two non-interacting infinite quantum spin chains immersed in a common thermal environment and undergoing a local dissipative dynamics of Lindblad type. We study the time evolution of collective mesoscopic quantum spin fluctuations that, unlike macroscopic mean-field observables, retain a quantum character in the thermodynamical limit. We show that the microscopic dissipative dynamics is able to entangle these mesoscopic degrees of freedom, through a purely mixing mechanism. Further, the behaviour of the dissipatively generated quantum correlations between the two chains is studied as a function of temperature and dissipation strength.

Based on recent improvements in scalability, controllability, and measurement, superconducting circuits can be considered as a promising quantum platform for building scalable digital and analog quantum simulators, enjoying unique and distinctive properties when compared to other advanced platforms as trapped ions, quantum photonics and optical lattices.

abstract: The concept of weak invariant is introduced. Then, the weak invariants associated with time-dependent quantum dissipative systems are discussed in the context of master equations of the Lindblad type. In particular, with the help of the su(1,1) Lie-algebraic structure, the weak invariant is explicitly constructed for the quantum damped harmonic oscillator with the time-dependent frequency and friction coefficient. This generalizes the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant to the case of nonunitary dynamics in the Markovian approximation.

Finally, in order to illustrate the potential of this proposal, the implementation of the basic quantum array operations through this encoding system is presented.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The outcomes of a series of measurements, made on a quantum system, form a sequence of random events which occur in a particular order. The system, together with a meter or meters, can be seen as following the paths of a stochastic network connecting all possible outcomes. The paths are shaped from the virtual paths of the system, and the corresponding probabilities are determined by the measuring devices employed. If the measurements are highly accurate, the virtual paths become "real", and the mean values of a quantity (a functional) is directly related to the frequencies with which the paths are travelled. If the measurements are highly inaccurate, the mean (weak) values are expressed in terms of the relative probabilities amplitudes. For pre- and post-selected systems they are bound to take arbitrary values, depending on the chosen transition. This is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle, which forbids one to distinguish between interfering alternatives, while leaving the interference between them intact.

This contrasts with the case of Kochen-Specker sets, where the smallest set occurs in dimension four.

abstract: We experimentally study the optical- and terahertz- induced rotational dynamics of asymmetric molecules in the gas phase. Terahertz and optical fields are identified as two distinct control handles over asymmetric molecules, as they couple to the rotational degrees of freedom via the molecular- dipole and polarizability selectively. The distinction between those two rotational handles is highlighted by different types of quantum revivals observed in long duration (>100ps) field-free rotational evolution. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with Random Phase Wave Function simulations [Phys. Rev. A 91, 063420 (2015)] and provide verification of the RPWF as an efficient method for calculating asymmetric molecular dynamics at ambient temperatures, where exact calculation methods are practically not feasible. Our observations and analysis pave the way for orchestrated excitations by both optical and THz fields as complementary rotational handles, that enable a plethora of new possibilities in three-dimensional rotational control of asymmetric molecules.

abstract: The EM algorithm is a novel numerical method to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and is often used for practical calculations. However, many of maximum likelihood estimation problems are nonconvex, and it is known that the EM algorithm fails to give the optimal estimate by being trapped by local optima. In order to deal with this difficulty, we propose a deterministic quantum annealing EM algorithm by introducing the mathematical mechanism of quantum fluctuations into the conventional EM algorithm because quantum fluctuations induce the tunnel effect and are expected to relax the difficulty of nonconvex optimization problems in the maximum likelihood estimation problems. We show a theorem that guarantees its convergence and give numerical experiments to verify its efficiency.

abstract: Single photon-level quantum frequency conversion has recently been demonstrated using silicon nitride microring resonators. The resonance enhancement offered by such systems enables high-efficiency translation of quantum states of light across wide frequency ranges at sub-watt pump powers. Using a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian formalism, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the conversion dynamics in these systems, and show that they are capable of converting single- and multi-photon quantum states. Analytic formulas for the conversion efficiency, spectral conversion probability density, and pump power requirements are derived which are in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. We show that with only modest improvement to the state of the art, efficiencies exceeding 95% are achievable using less than 100 mW of pump power. At the critical driving strength that yields maximum conversion efficiency, the spectral conversion probability density is shown to exhibit a flat-topped peak, indicating a range of insensitivity to the spectrum of a single photon input. Two alternate theoretical approaches are presented to study the conversion dynamics: a dressed mode approach that yields a better intuitive picture of the conversion process, and a study of the temporal dynamics of the participating modes in the resonator, which uncovers a regime of Rabi-like coherent oscillations of single photons between two different frequency modes. This oscillatory regime arises from the strong coupling of distinct frequency modes mediated by coherent pumps.

We report the observation of a remarkable similarity in between the dynamics of a freely expanding turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate and the propagation of an optical speckle pattern. Both follow very similar basic propagation characteristics. The second-order correlation is calculated and the typical correlation length of the two phenomena is used to substantiate the observations. The analogy between an expanding turbulent atomic condensate and a traveling optical speckle creates exciting prospects to investigate disordered quantum matter including the possibilities of a 3D speckle matter field.

abstract: The superfluid mixture of interacting Bose and Fermi species is a remarkable many-body quantum system. Dilute degenerate atomic gases, especially for two species of distinct masses, are excellent candidates for exploring fundamental features of superfluid mixture. However, producing a mass-imbalance Bose-Fermi superfluid mixture, providing an unambiguous visual proof of two-species superfluidity and probing inter-species interaction effects remain challenging. Here, we report the realization of a two-species superfluid of lithium-6 and potassium-41. By rotating the dilute gases, we observe the simultaneous existence of vortex lattices in both species, and thus present a definitive visual evidence for the simultaneous superfluidity of the two species. Pronounced effects of the inter-species interaction are demonstrated through a series of precision measurements on the formation and decay of two-species vortices. Our system provides a new platform for studying novel macroscopic quantum phenomena in vortex matter of interacting species.

abstract: Spatial modes of light can potentially carry a vast amount of information, making them promising candidates for both classical and quantum communication. However, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult. Intermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, while free-space transmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. Here we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a distance of 143 kilometers between two Canary Islands, which is 50 times greater than the maximum distance achieved previously. As a demonstration of the transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a short message. At the receiver, an artificial neural network is used for distinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions. The algorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of more than 80% up to the third mode order, and decode the transmitted message with an error rate of 8.33%. Using our data, we estimate that the distribution of orbital angular momentum entanglement over more than 100 kilometers of free space is feasible. Moreover, the quality of our free-space link can be further improved by the use of state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems.

abstract: Scaling beyond two-node quantum networks using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is limited by the low probability of collecting zero phonon line (ZPL) photons from single centers. Here, we demonstrate GaP-on-diamond disk resonators which resonantly couple ZPL photons from single NV centers to single-mode waveguides. In these devices, the probability of a single NV center emitting a ZPL photon into the guided waveguide mode after optical excitation can reach 9%, due to a combination of resonant enhancement of the ZPL emission and efficient coupling between the resonator and waveguide. We verify the single-photon nature of the emission and experimentally demonstrate both high in-waveguide photon numbers and substantial Purcell enhancement for a set of devices. These devices may enable scalable integrated quantum networks based on NV centers.

abstract: At present, our notion of space is a classical concept. Taking the point of view that quantum theory is more fundamental than classical physics, and that space should be given a purely quantum definition, we revisit the notion of Euclidean space from the point of view of quantum mechanics. Since space appears in physics in the form of labels on relativistic fields or Schrodinger wave functionals, we propose to define Euclidean quantum space as a choice of polarization for the Heisenberg algebra of quantum theory. We show, following Mackey, that generically, such polarizations contain a fundamental length scale and that contrary to what is implied by the Schrodinger polarization, they possess topologically distinct spectra. These are the modular spaces. We show that they naturally come equipped with additional geometrical structures usually encountered in the context of string theory or generalized geometry. Moreover, we show how modular space reconciles the presence of a fundamental scale with translation and rotation invariance. We also discuss how the usual classical notion of space comes out as a form of thermodynamical limit of modular space while the Schrodinger space is a singular limit.

One end of the cavity is formed by a multilayer Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As/GaAs stack supported by a microfabricated cantilever, with a natural mode frequency of $274$ Hz. The optical spring shifts the resonance to $21$ kHz, corresponding to a suppression of low frequency vibrations by a factor of more than $10^{4}$. The stable nature of the optical trap allows the cavity to be operated without any external feedback and with only a single optical field incident.

Each satellite contains an optical lattice atomic clock, which serves as a sensitive, narrowband detector of the local frequency of the shared laser light. A synchronized two-clock comparison between the satellites will be sensitive to the effective Doppler shifts induced by incident gravitational waves (GWs) at a level competitive with other proposed space-based GW detectors, while providing complementary features. The detected signal is a differential frequency shift of the shared laser light due to the relative velocity of the satellites, rather than a phase shift arising from the relative satellite positions, and the detection window can be tuned through the control sequence applied to the atoms' internal states. This scheme enables the detection of GWs from continuous, spectrally narrow sources, such as compact binary inspirals, with frequencies ranging from ~3 mHz - 10 Hz without loss of sensitivity, thereby bridging the detection gap between space-based and terrestrial GW detectors. Our proposed GW detector employs just two satellites, is compatible with integration with an optical interferometric detector, and requires only realistic improvements to existing ground-based clock and laser technologies.

abstract: We derive equations for the strongly coupled system of light and dense atomic ensembles. The formalism includes an arbitrary internal level structure for the atoms and is not restricted to weak excitation of atoms by light. In the low light intensity limit for atoms with a single electronic ground state, the full quantum field-theoretical representation of the model can be solved exactly by means of classical stochastic electrodynamics simulations for stationary atoms that represent cold atomic ensembles. Simulations for the optical response of atoms in a quantum degenerate regime require one to synthesize a stochastic ensemble of atomic positions that generates the corresponding quantum statistical position correlations between the atoms. In the case of multiple ground levels or at light intensities where saturation becomes important, the classical simulations require approximations that neglect quantum fluctuations between the levels. We show how the model is extended to incorporate corrections due to quantum fluctuations that result from virtual scattering processes. In the low light intensity limit we illustrate the simulations in a system of atoms in a Mott-insulator state in a 2D optical lattice, where recurrent scattering of light induces strong interatomic correlations. These correlations result in collective many-atom subradiant and superradiant states and a strong dependence of the response on the spatial confinement within the lattice sites.

comments: Hidden nonHermiticities even in problems you think you have a Hermitian Hamiltonian!-nonHermiticity originates from boundary contributions. No relation to all the nonHermitian fuss of the last 2 decades (Bender (98))!. One correction: reference to a supposed error in the book of David Snoke has been removed - it was a bad (irrelevant) example (apologies to Prof. Snoke). Nothing is affected
