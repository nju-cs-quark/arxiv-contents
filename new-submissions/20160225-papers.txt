abstract: We propose two improvements to the well-known power series method for confined one-dimensional quantum-mechanical problems. They consist of the addition of a variational step were the energy plays the role of a variational parameter. We compare the rate of convergence of the three methods on an exactly-solvable model. We also outline possible generalizations of the approaches to more complex problems.

abstract: We examine mathematical questions around angle (or phase) operator associated with a number operator through a short list of basic requirements. We implement three methods of construction of quantum angle. The first one is based on operator theory. The second one pertains to Weyl-Heisenberg integral quantization of the plane viewed as the phase space of the motion on the line. It depends on a family of "weight" functions on the plane. The third method rests upon coherent state quantization of the cylinder viewed as the phase space of the motion on the circle. The construction of these coherent states depends on a family of probability distributions on the line.

abstract: We suggest a multiatom cavity quantum electrodynamics system for the weak magnetic field detection based on Faraday rotation with intracavity electromagnetically induced transparency. The collective coupling between the cavity modes and the atomic ensemble can be used to improve the sensitivity. With single probe photon input, the sensitivity is inversely proportional to the number of atoms, and the sensitivity with 2.3(1)~nT/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ could be attained. With multiphoton measurement, the sensitivity can be approved to 4.7(9)~fT/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$.

abstract: The round-robin differential phase-shift quantum key distribution protocol provides a secure way to exchange private information without monitoring conventional disturbances and still maintains a high tolerance of noise, making it desirable for practical implementations of quantum key distribution. However, photon number resolving detectors are required to ensure that the detected signals are single photons in the original protocol. Here, we adopt the detector-decoy method and give the bounds to the fraction of detected events from single photons. Utilizing the advantages of the protocol, we provide a practical method of performing the protocol with desirable performances requiring only threshold single-photon detectors.

abstract: By pulsed s-shell resonant excitation of a single quantum dot-micropillar system, we generate long streams of a thousand of near transform-limited single photons with high mutual indistinguishability. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two photons are measured as a function of their emission time separation varying from 13 ns to 14.7 {\mu}s, where the visibility slightly drops from 95.9(2)% to a plateau of 92.1(5)% through a slow dephasing process occurring at time scale of 0.7 {\mu}s. Temporal and spectral analysis reveal the pulsed resonance fluorescence single photons are close to transform limit, which are readily useful for multi-photon entanglement and interferometry experiments.

abstract: In light of a recent reformulation of Bell's theorem from causal principles by Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum theory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision of our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a quantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but highlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have satisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly) agent-centric notions such as "controllables" and "uncontrollables", or "observed" and "unobserved". Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's theorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep conceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than rejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem to be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between quantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus causal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a resolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a solution to the measurement problem.

abstract: Stimulated emission is the process fundamental to laser operation, thereby producing coherent photon output. Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's, there have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from ensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the short excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the neutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both theoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$ states using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave pump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the phononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated in the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the transition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser wavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon line is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamond lasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadens the applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to a new generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit the contrast and signal amplification of a lasing system.

abstract: The transfer of quantum entanglement (or quantum coherence) is not only fundamental in quantum mechanics but also important in quantum information processing. We here propose a way to achieve the coherent transfer of $W$-class entangled states of qubits among different cavities. Because no photon is excited in each cavity, decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed during the transfer. In addition, only one coupler qubit and one operational step are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal, thus the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified. We further give a numerical analysis, showing that high-fidelity transfer of a three-qubit $W$ state is feasible within the present circuit QED technique. The proposal can be applied to a wide range of physical implementation with various qubits such as quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers, atoms, and superconducting qubits.

abstract: Some critical open problems of epistemic logics can be investigated in the framework of a quantum computational approach. The basic idea is to interpret sentences - like Alice knows that Bob does not understand that Pi is irrational - as pieces of quantum information (generally represented by density operators of convenient Hilbert spaces). Logical epistemic operators (to understand, to know ...) are dealt with as (generally irreversible) quantum operations, which are, in a sense, similar to measurement-procedures. This approach permits us to model some characteristic epistemic processes, that concern both human and artificial intelligence. For instance, the operation of \memorizing and retrieving information" can be formally represented, in this framework, by using a quantum teleportation phenomenon.

abstract: Quantum information has suggested new forms of quantum logic, called quantum computational logics, where meanings of sentences are represented by pieces of quantum information (generally, density operators of some Hilbert spaces), which can be stored and transmitted by means of quantum particles. This approach can be applied to a semantic characterization of epistemic logical operations, which may occur in sentences like "At time t0 Bob knows that at time t Alice knows that the spin-value is up". Each epistemic agent (say, Alice, Bob,...) has a characteristic truth-perspective, corresponding to a particular orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C^2. From a physical point of view, a truth-perspective can be associated to an apparatus that allows one to measure a given observable. An important feature that characterizes the knowledge of any agent is the amount of information that is accessible to him/her (technically, a special set of density operators, which also represents the internal memory of the agent in question). One can prove that interesting epistemic operations are special examples of quantum channels, which generally are not unitary. The act of knowing may involve some intrinsic irreversibility due to possible measurement procedures or to a loss of information about the environment. We also illustrate some relativistic-like effects that arise in the behavior of epistemic agents.

abstract: Quantum computational logics represent a logical abstraction from the circuit-theory in quantum computation. In these logics formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information (qubits, quregisters or mixtures of quregisters), while logical connectives correspond to (quantum logical) gates that transform quantum information in a reversible way. The characteristic holistic features of the quantum theoretic formalism (which play an essential role in entanglement-phenomena) can be used in order to develop a holistic version of the quantum computational semantics. In contrast with the compositional character of most standard semantic approaches, meanings of formulas are here dealt with as global abstract objects that determine the contextual meanings of the formulas' components (from the whole to the parts). We present a survey of the most significant logical arguments that are valid or that are possibly violated in the framework of this semantics. Some logical features that may appear prima facie strange seem to reflect pretty well informal arguments that are currently used in our rational activity.

abstract: By using the abstract structures investigated in the first Part of this article, we develop a semantics for an epistemic language, which expresses sentences like "Alice knows that Bob does not understand that PI is irrational". One is dealing with a holistic form of quantum computational semantics, where entanglement plays a fundamental role, thus, the meaning of a global expression determines the contextual meanings of its parts, but generally not the other way around. The epistemic situations represented in this semantics seem to reflect some characteristic limitations of the real processes of acquiring information. Since knowledge is not generally closed under logical consequence, the unpleasant phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided.

abstract: Understanding the fundamental limits on precision measurements of optical phase is of key interest for many investigative techniques utilized within science and technology. We compare measurement strategies using classical and non-classical optical input states, where the number of passes through the unknown phase can be freely controlled. We find that, for a given number of incident photons upon the unknown phase, non-classical techniques provide less than a 20% reduction in root-mean-square-error (RMSE) in comparison with classical techniques in multi-pass optical setups. Using classical techniques in a new optical setup we devise, the achievable reduction in RMSE afforded by non-classical techniques falls to only ~4%.

Our approach allows to follow important density correction to the quasi-energy structure caused by static interaction and radiation losses associated with incoherent scattering in the case of near resonance excitation.

abstract: Matter-wave interferometry has become an essential tool in studies on the foundations of quantum physics and for precision measurements. Mechanical gratings have played an important role as coherent beamsplitters for atoms, molecules and clusters since the basic diffraction mechanism is the same for all particles. However, polarizable objects may experience van der Waals shifts when they pass the grating walls and the undesired dephasing may prevent interferometry with massive objects. Here we explore how to minimize this perturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate physical limit, i.e. the thickness of a single atom. We have fabricated diffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in 1 nm thin carbonaceous biphenyl membrane. We identify conditions to transform an array of single layer graphene nanoribbons into a grating of carbon nanoscrolls. We show that all these ultra-thin nanomasks can be used for high-contrast quantum diffraction of massive molecules. They can be seen as a nanomechanical answer to the question debated by Bohr and Einstein whether a softly suspended double slit would destroy quantum interference. In agreement with Bohr's reasoning we show that quantum coherence prevails even in the limit of atomically thin gratings.

abstract: We explore the coherent control of nonlinear absorption of intense laser fields in a four-level ladder system. In the absence of control field, a coupling field creates electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with Aulter-Townes doublet for the probe field. A large absorption peak appears at resonance as the control field is switched on. We show how such a large absorption leads to photon switching. Further, this large absorption gets diminished and complete transparency appear due to saturation effects as the strength of the probe field is increased. The effect of the control field on saturable absorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA) are also highlighted in the context of nonlinear absorption of the probe field. We achieve RSA and SA in a simple atomic system just by applying a control field. We further demonstrate that the threshold of the optical bistability can be modified by suitable choices of the coupling and the control fields.

abstract: The security issues facing quantum key distribution (QKD) are explained, herein focusing on those issues that are cryptographic and information theoretic in nature and not those based on physics. The problem of security criteria is addressed. It is demonstrated that an attacker's success probabilities are the fundamental criteria of security that any theoretic security criterion must relate to in order to have operational significance. The errors committed in the prevalent interpretation of the trace distance criterion are analyzed. The security proofs of QKD protocols are discussed and assessed in regard to three main features: their validity, completeness, and adequacy of the achieved numerical security level. Problems are identified in all these features. It appears that the QKD security situation is quite different from the common perception that a QKD-generated key is nearly perfectly secure. Built into our discussion is a simple but complete quantitative description of the information theoretic security of classical key distribution that is also applicable to the quantum situation. In the appendices, we provide a brief outline of the history of some major QKD security proofs, a rather unfavorable comparison of current QKD proven security with that of conventional symmetric key ciphers, and a list of objections and answers concerning some major points of the paper.

abstract: Each step in a quantum random walk is typically understood to have two basic components; a `coin-toss' which produces a random superposition of two states, and a displacement which moves each component of the superposition by different amounts. Here we suggest the realization of a walk in momentum space with a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate subject to a quantum ratchet realized with a pulsed, off-resonant optical lattice. By an appropriate choice of the lattice detuning, we show how the atomic momentum can be entangled with the internal spin states of the atoms. For the coin-toss, we propose to use a microwave pulse to mix these internal states. We present experimental results showing an optimized quantum ratchet, and through a series of simulations, demonstrate how our proposal gives extraordinary control of the quantum walk. This should allow for the investigation of possible biases, and classical-to-quantum dynamics in the presence of natural and engineered noise.

abstract: We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that estimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is improved in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of precision may be substantial for short interaction time, i.e. for media of moderate size, e.g. biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the QFI as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the non-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.07674
abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing quantum supremacy.

abstract: We investigate the behavior of entanglement entropy at finite temperature and chemical potential for strongly coupled large-N gauge theories in $d$-dimensions ($d\ge 3$) that are dual to Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrom geometries in $(d+1)-$dimensions, in the context of gauge-gravity duality. We develop systematic expansions based on the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription that enable us to derive analytic expressions for entanglement entropy and mutual information in different regimes of interest. Consequently, we identify the specific regions of the bulk geometry that contribute most significantly to the entanglement entropy of the boundary theory at different limits. We define a scale, dubbed as the effective temperature, which determines the behavior of entanglement in different regimes. At high effective temperature, entanglement entropy is dominated by the thermodynamic entropy, however, mutual information subtracts out this contribution and measures the actual quantum entanglement. Finally, we study the entanglement/disentanglement transition of mutual information in the presence of chemical potential which shows that the quantum entanglement between two sub-regions decreases with the increase of chemical potential.

abstract: Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) provides a dispersion-canceled axial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the light source and by artifacts in the images. A recent study using chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) has demonstrated dispersion-canceled and artifact-free OCT with a classical system; however, unwanted background signals still remain after removing the artifacts. Here, we propose a classical optical method that realizes dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free OCT. We employ a time-reversed system for Q-OCT with transform-limited input laser pulses to achieve dispersion-canceled OCT with a classical system. We have also introduced a subtraction method to remove artifacts and background signals. With these methods, we experimentally demonstrated dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free axial imaging of a coverglass and cross-sectional imaging of the surface of a coin.

The trace of the unitary evolution operator for $N$ spins at time $T$ is related to one of a non-unitary evolution operator for $T$ spins at time $N$. Using this duality relation we obtain the oscillating part of the density of states for a large number of spins. Furthermore, the duality relation explains the anomalous short-time behavior of the spectral form factor previously observed in the literature.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a non-linear detection scheme exploiting time-reversal dynamics which disentangles continuous variable entangled states for feasible read-out. Spin exchange dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates is used as the non-linear mechanism which not only generates entangled states but can also be time reversed by controlled phase imprinting. For demonstration of a quantum-enhanced measurement we construct an active atom SU(1,1) interferometer, where entangled state preparation and non-linear read-out both consist of parametric amplification. This scheme is capable of exhausting the full quantum resource up to the fundamental Heisenberg limit by detecting solely mean atom numbers. Controlled non-linear transformations widen the spectrum of useful entangled states for applied quantum technologies.

abstract: High level of dissipation in normal metals makes challenging development of active and passive plasmonic devices. One possible solution to this problem is to use alternative materials. Graphene is a good candidate for plasmonics in near infrared (IR) region. In this paper we develop quantum theory of a graphene plasmon generator. We account for the first time quantum correlations and dissipation effects that allows describing such regimes of quantum plasmonic amplifier as surface plasmon emitting diode and surface plasmon amplifier by stimulated emission of radiation. Switching between these generation types is possible in situ with variance of graphene Fermi-level or gain transition frequency. We provide explicit expressions for dissipation and interaction constants through material parameters and find the generation spectrum and correlation function of second order which predicts laser statistics.

In particular, we show how interaction between systems in quantum theory naturally carries over to modelling how word meanings interact in natural language. Since meaning in natural language, depending on the subject domain, encompasses discussions within any scientific discipline, we obtain a template for theories such as social interaction, animal behaviour, and many others.

abstract: We use quantum detector tomography to investigate the detection mechanism in WSi nanowire superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs). To this purpose, we fabricated a 250nm wide and 250nm long WSi nanowire and measured its response to impinging photons with wavelengths ranging from $\lambda$ = 900 nm to $\lambda$ = 1650 nm. Tomographic measurements show that the detector response depends on the total excitation energy only. Moreover, for energies Et > 0.8eV the current energy relation is linear, similar to what was observed in NbN nanowires, whereas the current-energy relation deviates from linear behaviour for total energies below 0.8eV.
