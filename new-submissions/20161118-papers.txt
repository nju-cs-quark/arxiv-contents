abstract: We describe a quantum limit to measurement of classical spacetimes. Specifically, we formulate a quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound for estimating the single parameter in any one-parameter family of spacetime metrics. We employ the locally covariant formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which allows for a manifestly background-independent derivation. The result is an uncertainty relation that applies to all globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Among other examples, we apply our method to detection of gravitational waves using the electromagnetic field as a probe, as in laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Other applications are discussed, from terrestrial gravimetry to cosmology.

abstract: We address the question of whether symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order can persist at nonzero temperature, with a focus on understanding the thermal stability of several models studied in the theory of quantum computation. We present three results in this direction. First, we prove that nontrivial SPT order protected by a global on-site symmetry cannot persist at nonzero temperature, demonstrating that several quantum computational structures protected by such on-site symmetries are not thermally stable. Second, we prove that the 3D cluster state model used in the formulation of topological measurement-based quantum computation possesses a nontrivial SPT-ordered thermal phase when protected by a global generalized (1-form) symmetry. The SPT order in this model is detected by long-range localizable entanglement in the thermal state, which compares with related results characterizing SPT order at zero temperature in spin chains using localizable entanglement as an order parameter. Our third result is to demonstrate that the high error tolerance of this 3D cluster state model for quantum computation, even without a protecting symmetry, can be understood as an application of quantum error correction to effectively enforce a 1-form symmetry.

abstract: An algorithm that initializes a quantum register to a state with a specified energy range is given, corresponding to a quantum implementation of the celebrated Feit-Fleck method. This is performed by introducing a non-deterministic quantum implementation of a standard spectral filtering procedure combined with an apodization technique. It is shown that the implementation requires only two ancilla qubits. A lower bound for the total probability of success of this algorithm is derived, showing that this scheme can be realized using a finite, relatively low number of trials. Assuming the time evolution can be performed efficiently and using a trial state polynomially close to the desired states, it is demonstrated that the number of operations required scales polynomially with the number of qubits. This algorithm would be useful for the initialization phase of the simulation of quantum systems on digital quantum computer.

abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics have been extensively developed, but there has been much less work on quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. We give the first efficient quantum algorithms for simulating Markovian quantum dynamics generated by Lindbladians that are not necessarily local. We introduce two approaches to simulating sparse Lindbladians. First, we show how to simulate Lindbladians that act within small invariant subspaces using a quantum algorithm to implement sparse Stinespring isometries. Second, we develop a method for simulating sparse Lindblad operators by concatenating a sequence of short-time evolutions. We also show limitations on Lindbladian simulation by proving a no-fast-forwarding theorem for simulating sparse Lindbladians in a black-box model.

abstract: The relation between Bell-CHSH violation and factorization of Hilbert space is considered here. That is, a state which is local in the sense of the Bell-CHSH inequality under a certain factorization of the underlying Hilbert space can be Bell-CHSH non-local under a different factorization. While this question has been addressed with respect to separability , the relation of the factorization with Bell-CHSH violation has remained hitherto unexplored. We find here, that there is a set containing density matrices which do not exhibit Bell-CHSH violation under any factorization of the Hilbert space brought about by global unitary operations. We characterize the set in terms of a necessary and sufficient criterion based on the spectrum of density matrices. Sufficient conditions are obtained to characterize such density matrices based on their bloch representations. For some classes of density matrices, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of bloch parameters. Furthermore, a tight estimation of the volume of such density matrices is achieved in terms of purity. Illustrations with some well known states are provided.

abstract: Hybrid spin-mechanical systems have great potentials in sensing, macroscopic quantum mechanics, and quantum information science. In order to induce strong coupling between an electron spin and the center-of-mass motion of a mechanical oscillator, a large magnetic gradient is usually required, which is difficult to achieve. Here we show that strong coupling between the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and the torsional vibration of an optically levitated nanodiamond can be achieved in a uniform magnetic field. Thanks to the uniform magnetic field, multiple spins can strongly couple to the torsional vibration at the same time. We propose to utilize this new coupling mechanism to realize the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model by an ensemble of NV centers in a levitated nanodiamond. The quantum phase transition in the LMG model and finite number effects can be observed with this system. We also propose to generate torsional superposition states and realize torsional matter-wave interferometry with spin-torsional coupling.

abstract: We show that the computational power of the non-causal circuit model, i.e., the circuit model where the assumption of a global causal order is replaced by the assumption of logical consistency, is completely characterized by the complexity class $\operatorname{\mathsf{UP}}\cap\operatorname{\mathsf{coUP}}$. An example of a problem in that class is factorization. Our result implies that the non-causal model of classical closed timelike curves (CTCs) cannot solve problems that lie outside of that class. Thus, in stark contrast to other CTC models, these CTCs cannot solve $\operatorname{\mathsf{NP-complete}}$ problems, unless $\operatorname{\mathsf{NP}}=\operatorname{\mathsf{UP}}\cap\operatorname{\mathsf{coUP}}$, which lets their existence in nature appear less implausible. This result gives a new characterization of $\operatorname{\mathsf{UP}}\cap\operatorname{\mathsf{coUP}}$ in terms of fixed points.

abstract: The ultimate precision of any measurement of the temperature of a quantum system is the inverse of the local quantum thermal susceptibility [De Pasquale et al., Nature Communications 7, 12782 (2016)] of the subsystem with whom the thermometer interacts. If we have access to the global system, in a thermal (Gibbs) state, such quantity reduces to the variance of the system Hamiltonian, endowed with clear thermodynamical interpretation: it corresponds to the heat capacity of the system. In this work we explicitly extend such correspondence to a generic subpart of a locally interacting quantum system. We prove that the local quantum thermal susceptibility is close to the variance of its local Hamiltonian, provided the volume to surface ratio of the subsystem is much larger than the correlation length. This result greatly simplifies the determination of the ultimate precision of any local estimate of the temperature, and rigorously determines the regime where interactions can affect this precision.

abstract: One of the best lower bound methods for the quantum communication complexity of a function H (with or without shared entanglement) is the logarithm of the approximate rank of the communication matrix of H. This measure is essentially equivalent to the approximate gamma_2 norm and generalized discrepancy, and subsumes several other lower bounds. All known lower bounds on quantum communication complexity in the general unbounded-round model can be shown via the logarithm of approximate rank, and it was an open problem to give any separation at all between quantum communication complexity and the logarithm of the approximate rank. In this work we provide the first such separation: We exhibit a total function H with quantum communication complexity almost quadratically larger than the logarithm of its approximate rank. We construct H using the communication lookup function framework of Anshu et al. (FOCS 2016) based on the cheat sheet framework of Aaronson et al. (STOC 2016). From a starting function F, this framework defines a new function H=F_G. Our main technical result is a lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of F_G in terms of the discrepancy of F, which we do via quantum information theoretic arguments. We show the upper bound on the approximate rank of F_G by relating it to the Boolean circuit size of the starting function F.

abstract: Fundamentally binary theories are nonsignaling theories in which measurements of many outcomes are constructed by selecting from binary measurements. They constitute a sensible alternative to quantum theory and have never been directly falsified by any experiment. Here we solve two open problems related to them raised in Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 150401 (2016). We first show that fundamentally binary theories are experimentally testable with current technology. For that, we identify a feasible Bell inequality-like experiment on pairs of entangled qutrits. In addition, we prove that, for any n, quantum n-ary correlations are not fundamentally (n-1)-ary. For that, we introduce a family of inequalities that hold for fundamentally (n-1)-ary theories but are violated by quantum n-ary correlations.

abstract: Organic microcavities can be engineered to reach exotic quantum regimes of strong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling. However, the microscopic interpretation of their spectroscopic signals can be challenging due to the competition between coherent and dissipative processes involving electrons, vibrations and cavity photons. We develop here a theoretical framework based on the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model and a Markovian treatment of dissipation to account for previously unexplained spectroscopic features of organic microcavities consistently. We identify conditions for the formation of dark vibronic polaritons, a new class of light-matter excitations that are not visible in absorption but lead to strong photoluminescence lines. We show that photon leakage from dark vibronic polaritons can be responsible for enhancing photoluminescence at the lower polariton frequency, and also explain the apparent breakdown of reciprocity between absorption and emission in the vicinity of the bare molecular transition frequency. Successful comparison with experimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory.

abstract: We present a detailed study of the lifetime of optical spectral holes due to population storage in Zeeman sublevels of Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. The lifetime is measured as a function of magnetic field strength and orientation, temperature and Nd$^{3+}$ doping concentration. At the lowest temperature of 3 K we find a general trend where the lifetime is short at low field strengths, then increases to a maximum lifetime at a few hundreds of mT, and then finally decays rapidly for high field strengths. This behaviour can be modelled with a relaxation rate dominated by Nd$^{3+}$-Nd$^{3+}$ cross relaxation at low fields and spin lattice relaxation at high magnetic fields. The maximum lifetime depends strongly on both the field strength and orientation, due to the competition between these processes and their different angular dependencies. The cross relaxation limits the maximum lifetime for concentrations as low as 30 ppm of Nd$^{3+}$ ions. By decreasing the concentration to less than 1 ppm we could completely eliminate the cross relaxation, reaching a lifetime of 3.8 s at 3~K. At higher temperatures the spectral hole lifetime is limited by the magnetic-field independent Raman and Orbach processes. In addition we show that the cross relaxation rate can be strongly reduced by creating spectrally large holes of the order of the optical inhomogeneous broadening. Our results are important for the development and design of new rare-earth-ion doped crystals for quantum information processing and narrow-band spectral filtering for biological tissue imaging.

abstract: We consider quantum scattering of particles in media exhibiting strong dispersion degeneracy. In particular, we study flat-banded lattices and linearly dispersed energy bands. The former constitute a prime example of single-particle frustration while the latter show degeneracy at the few- and many-particle level. We investigate both impurity and two-body scattering and show that, quite generally, scattering does not occur, which we relate to the fact that transition matrices vanish on the energy shell. We prove that scattering is instead replaced by projections onto band-projected eigenstates of the interaction potential. We then use the general results to obtain localised flat band states that are eigenstates of impurity potentials with vanishing eigenvalues in one-dimensional flat bands and study the particular case of a sawtooth lattice. We also uncover the relation between certain solutions of one-dimensional systems that have been categorised as "strange", and the scattering states in linearly dispersed continuum systems.

abstract: We consider Chern-Simons theory for gauge group $G$ at level $k$ on 3-manifolds $M_n$ with boundary consisting of $n$ topologically linked tori. The Euclidean path integral on $M_n$ defines a quantum state on the boundary, in the $n$-fold tensor product of the torus Hilbert space. We focus on the case where $M_n$ is the link-complement of some $n$-component link inside the three-sphere $S^3$. The entanglement entropies of the resulting states define new, framing-independent link invariants which are sensitive to the topology of the chosen link. For the Abelian theory at level $k$ ($G= U(1)_k$) we give a general formula for the entanglement entropy associated to an arbitrary $(m|n-m)$ partition of a generic $n$-component link into sub-links. The formula involves the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations with coefficients related to the Gauss linking numbers (mod $k$) between the two sublinks. This formula connects simple concepts in quantum information theory, knot theory, and number theory, and shows that entanglement entropy between sublinks vanishes if and only if they have zero Gauss linking (mod $k$). For $G = SU(2)_k$, we study various two and three component links. We show that the 2-component Hopf link is maximally entangled, and hence analogous to a Bell pair, and that the Whitehead link, which has zero Gauss linking, nevertheless has entanglement entropy. Finally, we show that the Borromean rings have a "W-like" entanglement structure (i.e., tracing out one torus does not lead to a separable state), and give examples of other 3-component links which have "GHZ-like" entanglement (i.e., tracing out one torus does lead to a separable state).

abstract: The dynamics of autoionizing Rydberg states of oxygen are studied using attosecond transient absorption technique, where extreme ultraviolet (XUV) initiates molecular polarization and near infrared (NIR) pulse perturbs its evolution. Transient absorption spectra show positive optical density (OD) change in the case of $ns\sigma_g$ and $nd\pi_g$ autoionizing states of oxygen and negative OD change for $nd\sigma_g$ states. Multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) calculation are used to simulate the transient absorption spectra and their results agree with experimental observations. The time evolution of superexcited states is probed in electronically and vibrationally resolved fashion and we observe the dependence of decay lifetimes on effective quantum number of the Rydberg series. We model the effect of near-infrared (NIR) perturbation on molecular polarization and find that the laser induced phase shift model agrees with the experimental and MCTDHF results, while the laser induced attenuation model does not. We relate the electron state symmetry dependent sign of the OD change to the Fano parameters of the static absorption lineshapes.

By setting up a multi-channel model with field-dressed states we demonstrate that the reaction rate coefficient can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude with laser intensities of $10^6$ W/cm$^2$ or larger. In addition, depending on laser frequency one can induce a significant enhancement or suppression of the charge-exchange rate coefficient. For our intensities multi-photon processes are not important.

abstract: We show how to construct pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) that remain secure even if the adversary can query the permutation on a quantum superposition of inputs. Such PRPs are called \emph{quantum-secure}. Our construction combines a quantum-secure pseudorandom \emph{function} together with constructions of \emph{classical} format preserving encryption. By combining known results, we obtain the first quantum-secure PRP in this model whose security relies only on the existence of one-way functions. Previously, to the best of the author's knowledge, quantum security of PRPs had to be assumed, and there were no prior security reductions to simpler primitives, let alone one-way functions.

This result is extended to other related Schr\"odinger equations, e.g. projective ones, and their properties are studied through Poisson, presymplectic and K\"ahler structures. This leads to derive nonlinear superposition rules for them depending in a lower (or equal) number of solutions than standard linear ones. Special attention is paid to applications in $n$-qubit systems.

abstract: These notes describe some links between the group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, the Heisenberg group and hypercomplex numbers---complex, dual and double numbers. Relations between quantum and classical mechanics are clarified in this framework. In particular, classical mechanics can be obtained as a theory with noncommutative observables and a non-zero Planck constant if we replace complex numbers in quantum mechanics by dual numbers. Our consideration is based on induced representations which are build from complex-/dual-/double-valued characters. Dynamic equations, rules of additions of probabilities, ladder operators and uncertainty relations are discussed. Finally, we prove a Calder\'on--Vaillancourt-type norm estimation for relative convolutions.

abstract: Even after decades of research the problem of first passage time statistics for quantum dynamics remains a challenging topic of fundamental and practical importance. Using a projective measurement approach, with a sampling time $\tau$, we obtain the statistics of first detection events for quantum dynamics on a lattice, with the detector located at the origin. A quantum renewal equation for a first detection wave function, in terms of which the first detection probability can be calculated, is derived. This formula gives the relation between first detection statistics and the solution of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation in the absence of measurement. We demonstrate our results with tight binding quantum walk models. We examine a closed system, i.e. a ring, and reveal the intricate influence of the sampling time $\tau$ on the statistics of detection, discussing the quantum Zeno effect, half dark states, revivals and optimal detection. The initial condition modifies the statistics of a quantum walk on a finite ring in surprising ways. In some cases the average detection time is independent of the sampling time while in others the average exhibits multiple divergences as the sampling time is modified. For an unbounded one dimensional quantum walk the probability of first detection decays like $(\mbox{time})^{(-3)}$ with superimposed oscillations, with exceptional behavior when the sampling period $\tau$ times the tunnelling rate $\gamma$ is a multiple of $\pi/2$. The amplitude of the power law decay is suppressed as $\tau\to 0$ due to the Zeno effect. Our work presented here, is an extended version of Friedman et al. arXiv:1603.02046 [cond-mat.stat-mech], and it predicts rich physical behaviors compared with classical Brownian motion, for which the first passage probability density decays monotonically like $(\mbox{time})^{-3/2}$, as elucidated by Schr\"odinger in $1915$.

abstract: We show that, in a many-body system, all particles can be strongly confined to the initially occupied sites for a time that scales as a high power of the ratio of the bandwidth of site energies to the hopping amplitude. Such time-domain formulation is complementary to the formulation of the many-body localization of all stationary states with a large localization length. The long localization lifetime is achieved by constructing a periodic sequence of site energies with a large period in a one-dimensional chain. The scaling of the localization lifetime is independent of the number of particles for a broad range of the coupling strength. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations.

It is shown that, if particle A's meandering path is monitored by successive non-detections, particle B will loosely adhere to a similar trajectory without violating momentum conservation. The discussion relates this apparent telekinetic influence, which is a standard quantum mechanical result, to supposedly real telekinesis and to Stapp's hypothesis on intention in quantum physics.

abstract: While a wealth of results has been obtained for chaos in single-particle quantum systems, much less is known about chaos in quantum many-body systems. We contribute to recent efforts to make a semiclassical analysis of such systems feasible, which is nontrivial due to the exponential proliferation of orbits with increasing particle number. Employing a recently discovered duality relation, we focus on the collective, coherent motion that together with the also present incoherent one typically leads to a mixture of regular and chaotic dynamics. We investigate a kicked spin chain as an example of a presently experimentally and theoretically much studied class of systems.

abstract: In this paper, we treat quantum walks on $2$-dimensional lattice with the cutting edge at $x=0$ introduced by Asboth and Edge (2014) in order to study one-dimensional edge states originating from topological phases and to see a collateral evidence how a quantum walker reacts such a graph deformation making the boundary. First, we connect this model to the CMV matrix which provides the $5$-term recursion relation of the Laurent polynomial associated with spectral measure on the unit circle. Secondly, we obtain the dispersion relation of the energy of the quantum walk explicitly by using the spectral analysis of the CMV matrix. We confirm that the dispersion relation for edge states are consistent with the prediction from the topological phases originating from not only two-dimensional bulk states but also one-dimensional ones in a certain condition. Finally, we show how the edge states contribute the asymptotic behavior of the quantum walk through limit theorems of the finding probability. Conversely, we also propose a differential equation using this limit distribution whose solution is the underlying edge state.

The bound does not depend on the size or mass of the emitting and receiving systems, nor on the nature of the signal. No restrictions on preparing and processing the signal are imposed. As an example, I consider the encoding of information in the transverse or angular position of a signal emitted and received by systems of arbitrarily large cross-section. In the limit of a large message space, quantum effects become important even if individual signals are classical, and the bound is upheld.

abstract: We generalize the Pastawski-Yoshida-Harlow-Preskill (HaPPY) holographic quantum error-correcting code to provide a toy model for bulk gauge fields or linearized gravitons. The key new elements are the introduction of degrees of freedom on the links (edges) of the associated tensor network and their connection to further copies of the HaPPY code by an appropriate isometry. The result is a model in which boundary regions allow the reconstruction of bulk algebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy) entanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed from complementary boundary regions. In addition, the entropy of boundary regions receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections that model the $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena. Comparison with Yang-Mills theory then suggests that this $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term can be reinterpreted as a part of the bulk entropy of gravitons under an appropriate extension of the physical bulk Hilbert space.

comments: 4.5 pages, 2 figures. This work provides a new short proof of the main result of arXiv:1511.08506 [quant-ph]. Our new approach bypasses Wigner functions and focuses on contextuality alone. The paper takes the former title of arXiv:1511.08506 (Version 1). We added a reference and corrected a typo in version 2
