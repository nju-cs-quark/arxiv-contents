abstract: The bound state solutions of the $D$-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation for new mixed class of potential, $V(r)=\frac{V_1}{r^2}+\frac{V_2e^{-\alpha r}}{r}+V_3coth\alpha r+V_4\,,$ are studied within the framework of the Pekeris approximation for any arbitrary $\ell$-state. Asymptotic iteration method (AIM) is used for the work. The energy spectrum are obtained as well as their corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are derived in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions $\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b,c;z)$. It is shown that using the Pekeris approximation, present potential model is very much capable of deriving other well known potentials quite easily and corresponding solutions are in excellent agreement with the previous work carried out in literature.

abstract: We present an algorithm for error correction in topological codes that exploits modern machine learning techniques. Our decoder is constructed from a stochastic neural network called a Boltzmann machine, of the type extensively used in deep learning. We provide a general prescription for the training of the network and a decoding strategy that is applicable to a wide variety of stabilizer codes with very little specialization. We demonstrate the neural decoder numerically on the well-known two dimensional toric code with phase-flip errors.

abstract: Entanglement witnesses are invaluable for efficient quantum entanglement certification without the need for expensive quantum state tomography. Yet, standard entanglement witnessing requires multiple measurements and its bounds can be elusive as a result of experimental imperfections. Here we introduce and demonstrate a novel procedure for entanglement detection which seamlessly and easily improves any standard witnessing procedure by using additional available information to tighten the witnessing bounds. Moreover, by relaxing the requirements on the witness operators, our method removes the general need for the difficult task of witness decomposition into local observables. We experimentally demonstrate entanglement detection with our approach using a separable test operator and a simple fixed measurement-device for each agent. Finally we show that the method can be generalized to higher-dimensional and multipartite cases with a complexity that scales linearly with the number of parties.

abstract: One of the main goals of any resource theory such as entanglement theory, quantum thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and the resource theory of asymmetry, is to find necessary and sufficient conditions (NSC) that determine whether one resource can be converted to another by the set of free operations. Here we find such NSC, expressed in terms of the conditional min entropy, for a large class of quantum resource theories which we call \emph{affine} resource theories (ART). ARTs include the resource theories of athermality, asymmetry, and coherence, but not entanglement. The set of free operations is taken to be (1) the maximal set (i.e. consists of all resource non-generating (RNG) quantum channels) or (2) the self-dual set of free operations (i.e. consists of all RNG maps for which the dual map is also RNG). Particularly, we apply our results to quantum thermodynamics with Gibbs preserving operations, and quantum coherence with either maximally incoherent operations or dephasing covariant operations. We show that in all such ARTs, the problem can be formulated as a feasibility problem of semi-definite programming (SDP), and by applying the strong-duality, particularly a SDP version of the Farkas lemma, we are able to express the set of NSC in terms of resource monotones. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to other types of resource theories, and along the way, provide the NSC that a quantum resource theory consists of a resource destroying map.

abstract: Organic microcavities are photonic nanostructures that strongly confine the electromagnetic field, allowing exotic quantum regimes of light-matter interaction with disordered organic semiconductors. The unambiguous interpretation of the spectra of organic microcavities has been a long-standing challenge due to several competing effects involving electrons, vibrations and cavity photons. Here we present a theoretical framework that is able to describe the main spectroscopic features of organic microcavities consistently. We introduce a class of light-matter excitations called dark vibronic polaritons, which strongly emit but only weakly absorb light in the same frequency region of the bare electronic transition. Successful comparison with experimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory. The proposed microscopic understanding of organic microcavities paves the way for the development of optoelectronic devices enhanced by quantum optics.

abstract: A central topic in the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is the definition of thermodynamic work in the quantum regime. One widely used solution is to define work for a closed system undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics according to the two-point energy measurement scheme. However, due to the invasive nature of measurement the two-point quantum work probability distribution leads to inconsistencies with two pillars of thermodynamics: it breaks the first law and the time-reversal symmetry expected for closed dynamics. We here introduce the quantum histories framework as a method to characterise the thermodynamic properties of the unmeasured, closed dynamics. Extending the classical phase space trajectories to continuous power operator trajectories allows us to derive an alternative quantum work distribution for closed quantum dynamics that fulfils the first law and is time-reversal symmetric. We find that the work distribution of the unmeasured dynamics leads to deviations from the classical Jarzynski equality and can have negative values highlighting distinctly non-classical features of quantum work.

abstract: Entangled history theory is based on the framework of consistent histories theory, which is considered to be a way to reformulate quantum mechanics without the postulation of collapsing of states. Since it was proposed in 2015, the entangled history was verified experimentally with $3$ time nodes GHZ-like entangled histories in 2016. Here we extend previous results of entangled histories to arbitrary number of time nodes. For even number time nodes, we define a Bell-type inequality to distinguish quantum entangled histories and the classical histories and prove the inequality for arbitrary even time nodes histories. For odd time nodes cases, we propose a GHZ type experiment and define a function to distinguish quantum entangled and classical histories. We prove a minimal formula for the function of classical histories, which is larger than the function outcome of entangled histories.

abstract: We show that it is possible to generate a novel single-photon fringe pattern by using two spatially separated identical bi-photon sources. The fringes are similar to the ones observed in a Michelson interferometer and possess certain remarkable properties with potential applications. A striking feature of the fringes is that although the pattern is obtained by detecting only one photon of each photon pair, the fringes shift due to a change in the optical path traversed by the undetected photon. The fringe shift is characterized by a combination of wavelengths of both photons, which implies that the wavelength of a photon can be measured without detecting it. Furthermore, the visibility of the fringes diminishes as the correlation between the transverse momenta of twin photons decreases: visibility is unity for maximum momentum correlation and zero for no momentum correlation. We also show that the momentum correlation between the two photons of a pair can be determined from the single-photon interference pattern. We thus for the first time propose a method of measuring a two-photon correlation without coincidence or heralded detection.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the decoy-state Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) with four intensities. The average value of successful events and bit errors among the pulse pair set be used to investigate the successful events of different pulses under the statistical fluctuation caused by the finite condition. We demonstrate that the lower bound of successful events number n11estimated by our method can be more tight than the result in [28]. Numerical simulations show that our estimation method can achieve a higher key rate than existing methods with a relatively weak constraints of experimental devices, such as high dark count rate and low detection efficiency of detectors when data size is N = 109.

abstract: There are some computational problems that admit a quantum solution more efficient than the fastest known classical alternatives. One explanation for this efficiency is that quantum theories allow us to enter every possible input of a function as a coherent superposition, and perform a calculation by way of interference: an interferometric computation. There has been recent foundational interest in theories of reality that go beyond quantum theory. Here, we present a generalized formulation of interferometric computation, and explore how theories can differ from quantum theory and still perform distributed calculations in this set-up. We shall see that quaternionic quantum theory proves a suitable candidate, whereas box-world does not. We also find that a classical hidden variable model first presented by Spekkens [Phys. Rev. A, 75:3:32100, 2007] can only be used for this type of computation when the system is subject to an epistemic restriction.

This work experimentally demonstrates transmission of spatial qudits through multi-core optical fibers and measurement of the entanglement between two fibers with quantum state analyzers, each composed of a spatial light modulator and a single-mode fiber. Quantum state tomography reconstructs the four-dimension entangled state that verifies the non-locality through concurrences in two-dimensional subspaces and a high-dimensional Bell-type CGLMP inequality.

abstract: The fact that not all quantum observables are jointly measurable is one of the major differences between quantum and classical theory. In the former, non-commuting observables can only be simultaneously measured with limited precision. We report on an experimental implementation of such a simultaneous measurement of two non-commuting observables based on the framework of weak von Neumann measurements. We use a photonic setup where the polarisation degree of freedom acts as the system and the two components of the transversal position correspond to the pointers of the measurement apparatuses. In addition, the theory shows that these weak measurements demonstrate a counter-intuitive non-monotonicity: weaker measurements can potentially reveal more information than stronger ones.

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) generates symmetric keys between two remote parties, and guarantees the keys not accessible to any third party. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) between QKD and classical optical communications by sharing the existing fibre optics infrastructure is highly desired in order to reduce the cost of QKD applications. However, quantum signals are extremely weak and thus easily affected by the spontaneous Raman scattering effect from intensive classical light. Here, by means of wavelength selecting and spectral and temporal filtering, we realize the multiplexing and long distance co-propagation of QKD and Terabit classical coherent optical communication system up to 80km. The data capacity is two orders of magnitude larger than the previous results. Our demonstration verifies the feasibility of QKD and classical communication to share the resources of backbone fibre links, and thus taking the utility of QKD a great step forward.

abstract: We propose a simple setup for the conversion of multipartite entangled states in a quantum network with restricted access. The scheme uses nonlocal operations to enable the preparation of states that are inequivalent under local operations and classical communication, but most importantly does not require full access to the states. It is based on a flexible linear optical conversion gate that uses photons, which are ideally suited for distributed quantum computation and quantum communication in extended networks. In order to show the basic working principles of the gate, we focus on converting a four-qubit entangled cluster state to other locally inequivalent four-qubit states, such as the GHZ and symmetric Dicke state. We also show how the gate can be incorporated into extended graph state networks, and can be used to generate variable entanglement and quantum correlations without entanglement but nonvanishing quantum discord.

abstract: We experimentally characterize a quantum photonic gate that is capable of converting multiqubit entangled states while acting only on two qubits. It is an important tool in large quantum networks, where it can be used for re-wiring of multipartite entangled states or for generating various entangled states required for specific tasks. The gate can be also used to generate quantum information processing resources, such as entanglement and discord. In our experimental demonstration, we converted a linear four-qubit cluster state into different entangled states, including GHZ and Dicke states. The high quality of the experimental results show that the gate has the potential of being a flexible component in distributed quantum photonic networks.

abstract: Quantum systems driven by strong oscillating fields are the source of many interesting physical phenomena. In this work, we experimentally study the dynamics of a two-level system of a single spin driven in the strong-driving regime where the rotating-wave approximation is not valid. This two-level system is a subsystem of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy center coupled to a first-shell $^{13}$C nuclear spin in diamond at a level anti-crossing point that occurs in the $m_{s}=\pm1$ manifold when the energy level splitting between the $m_{s}$ = $+1$ and $-1$ spin states due to the static magnetic field is $\approx$ 127 MHz, which is roughly equal to the spectral splitting due to the $^{13}$C hyperfine interaction. The transition frequency of this electron spin two-level system in a static magnetic field of 28.9 G is 1.7 MHz and it can be driven only by the $z$-component of the RF field. Electron spin Rabi frequencies in this system can reach tens of MHz even for moderate RF powers. The simple sinusoidal Rabi oscillations that occur when the amplitude of the driving field is much smaller than the transition frequency become complex when the driving field strength is comparable or greater than the energy level splitting. We observe that the system oscillates faster than the amplitude of the driving field and the response of the system shows multiple frequencies.

abstract: We present an in-depth analysis regarding the error resistance and optimization of our all-optical Bell measurement and ultrafast long-distance quantum communication scheme proposed in [arXiv:1503.06777]. In order to promote our previous proposal from loss- to fault-tolerance, we introduce a general and compact formalism that can also be applied to other related schemes (including non-all-optical ones such as [PRL 112, 250501]). With the help of this new representation we show that our communication protocol does not only counteract the inevitable photon loss during channel transmission, but is also able to resist common experimental errors such as Pauli-type errors (bit- and phase-flips) and detector inefficiencies (losses and dark counts). Furthermore, we demonstrate that on the physical level of photonic qubits the choice of the standard linear optical Bell measurement with its limited efficiency is optimal for our setting in the sense that, apart from their potential use in state preparation, more advanced Bell measurements yield only a small decrease in resource consumption. We devise two state generation schemes that provide the required ancillary encoded Bell states (quasi-)on-demand at every station. The schemes are either based on nonlinear optics or on linear optics with multiplexing and exhibit resource costs that scale linearly or less than quadratic with the number of photons per encoded qubit, respectively. Finally, we show that it is possible to operate our communication scheme with on-off detectors instead of employing photon-number-resolving detectors.

abstract: In this paper, we study theoretically the optomechanical interaction of an almost pure condensate of photons with an oscillating mechanical membrane in a micro-cavity. We show that in the Bogoliubov approximation, due to the large number of photons in the condensate phase, there is a linear strong effective coupling between the Bogoliubov mode of the photonic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and the mechanical motion of the membrane which depends on the nonlinear photon-photon scattering potential. This coupling leads to the cooling of the mechanical motion, the normal mode splitting (NMS), the squeezing of the output field and the entanglement between the excited mode of the cavity and the mechanical mode. We show that, in one hand, the nonlinearity of the photon gas increases the degree of the squeezing of the output field of the micro-cavity and the efficiency of the cooling process at high temperatures. In the other hand, it reduces NMS in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating membrane and the degree of the optomechanical entanglement. In addition, the temperature of the photonic BEC can be used to control the above-mentioned phenomena.

abstract: Chained correlation inequalities involving pairwise correlations of qubit observables in the equatorial plane are constructed based on the positivity of a sequence of moment matrices. When a jointly measurable set of fuzzy POVMs is employed, the chained pairwise correlations do not violate the classical bound imposed by the moment matrix positivity. We identify that incompatibility of measurements is only necessary, but not sufficient, in general, for the violation of the inequality. On the other hand, there exists a one-to-one equivalence between the degree of incompatibility (which quantifies the joint measurability) of the equatorial qubit observables and the optimal violation of a non-local steering inequality, proposed by Jones and Wiseman (Phys. Rev. A, 84, 012110 (2011)). To this end, we construct a local analogue of this steering inequality in a single qubit system and show that its violation is a mere reflection of measurement incompatibility.

abstract: This thesis discusses the possibility of uncertainty relations for space and energy given a state of fixed entropy. In particular, it discusses the results in the paper of Dam/Nguyen. There, the authors propose a lower bound for the mixed cost in energy and space required for physically storing information in a quantum mechanical system. We first critically examine the justifications for the bound given in the paper.This is done from a mathematical point of view, in contrast to the more physically motivated original paper.Then we give two examples that illustrate the limitations of this inequality. We also present numerical results to find an alternative energy-space bound in the finite dimensional version of this problem. They indicate a slightly different version of the inequality. In the end we describe a promising ansatz to find a lower energy-space bound that depends on the amount stored information. Unfortunately that did not result in a satisfactory result.

abstract: Single electron sources enable electron quantum optics experiments where single electrons emitted in a ballistic electronic interferometer plays the role of a single photons emitted in an optical medium in Quantum Optics. A qualitative step has been made with the recent generation of single charge levitons obtained by applying Lorentzian voltage pulse on the contact of the quantum conductor. Simple to realize and operate, the source emits electrons in the form of striking minimal excitation states called levitons. We review the striking properties of levitons and their possible applications in quantum physics to electron interferometry and entanglement. W Schematic generation of time resolved single charges called levitons using Lorentzian voltage pulses applied on a contact. A Quantum Point Contact is used to partition the levitons for further analysis. Injecting levitons on opposite contacts with a delay $\\tau$ enables to probe electronic like Hong Ou Mandel correlations. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Single electron sources In this introduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single electrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where the goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a conductor with good accuracy to realize a quantized current source whose current I = ef shows metrological accuracy. The latter, the coherent single electrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose wave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron coherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic beam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic Mach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the injected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The frequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current accuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron transfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for current standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the early 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a submicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers.

abstract: Periodic Anderson model (PAM), where local electron orbital interplays with itinerant electronic carriers, plays an essential role in our understanding on heavy fermion materials. Motivated by recent proposal of simulating Kondo lattice model (KLM) in terms of alkaline-earth metal atoms, we make a further step toward simulation of PAM, which includes crucial charge/valence fluctuation of local f-electron beyond purely low-energy spin fluctuation in KLM. To realize PAM, transition induced by suitable laser between electronic excited and ground state of alkaline-earth metal atoms ($^{1}S_{0}$$\rightleftharpoons$$^{3}P_{0}$) is introduced, and it leads to effective hybridization between local electron and conduction electron in PAM. Generally, the $SU(N)$ version of PAM can be realized by our proposal, which gives a unique opportunity to detect large-$N$ physics without complexity in realistic materials. In the present work, high temperature physical feature of standard ($SU(2)$) PAM with harmonic trapping potential is detailed analyzed by quantum Monte Carlo and dynamic mean-field theory. Indications for near-future experiments are provided. We expect our theoretical proposal and (hopefully) forthcoming experiment will deepen our understanding on heavy fermion systems and at the same time triggers further studies on related Mott physics, quantum criticality and non-trivial topology in both inhomogeneous and nonequilibrium realm.
