abstract: We determine the ultimate classical information capacity of a linear time-invariant bosonic channel with additive phase-insensitive Gaussian noise. This channel can model fiber-optic communication at power levels below the threshold for significant nonlinear effects. We provide a general continuous-time result that gives the ultimate capacity for such a channel operating in the quasimonochromatic regime under an average power constraint. This ultimate capacity is compared with corresponding results for heterodyne and homodyne detection over the same channel.

abstract: It is still an outstanding challenge to characterize and understand the topological features of strongly correlated states such as bound-states in interacting multi-particle quantum systems. Recently, bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in quantum magnets have been experimentally observed in quantum Heisenberg chains comprising ultracold Bose atoms in optical lattices. Here, we explore an unprecedented topological state called topological magnon bound-state in the quantum Heisenberg chain under cotranslational symmetry. We find that the cotranslational symmetry allows us to formulate a direct topological invariant for the multi-particle quantum states, which can be used to characterize the topological features of multi-magnon excitations. We calculate energy spectra, density distributions, correlations and topological invariants of the two-magnon bound-states and show the existence of topological magnon bound-states. Our study not only opens a new prospect to pursue topological bound-states, but also gives insights into the characterization and understanding of strongly interacting topological states.

abstract: We introduce an alternative approach to the polarization theory of light. This is based on a set of quantum operators, constructed from two independent bosons, being three of them the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators, and the other one, the Casimir operator of this algebra. By taking the expectation value of these generators in a two-mode coherent state, their classical limit is obtained. We use these classical quantities to define the new Stokes-like parameters. We show that the light polarization ellipse can be written in terms of the Stokes-like parameters. Also, we write these parameters in terms of other two quantities, and show that they define a one-sheet (Poincar\'e hyperboloid) of a two-sheet hyperboloid. Our study is restricted to the case of a monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave which propagates along the $z$ axis.

abstract: We present an experimental realization of resonance fluorescence in squeezed vacuum. We strongly couple microwave-frequency squeezed light to a superconducting artificial atom and detect the resulting fluorescence with high resolution enabled by a broadband traveling-wave parametric amplifier. We investigate the fluorescence spectra in the weak and strong driving regimes, observing up to 3.1 dB of reduction of the fluorescence linewidth below the ordinary vacuum level and a dramatic dependence of the Mollow triplet spectrum on the relative phase of the driving and squeezed vacuum fields. Our results are in excellent agreement with predictions for spectra produced by a two-level atom in squeezed vacuum [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{58}, 2539-2542 (1987)], demonstrating that resonance fluorescence offers a resource-efficient means to characterize squeezing in cryogenic environments.

abstract: Coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy techniques are broadly applied across the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from NMR to the UV. These reveal properties of matter through correlation plots of signal fields generated in response to sequences of short pulses with variable delays. Here we discuss a new class of multidimensional techniques obtained by time-and-frequency resolved photon coincidence counting measurements of N photons which constitutes a 2N dimensional spectrum. A compact description of these signals is developed based on time ordered superoperators rather than the normally ordered ordinary operators used in Glauber's photon counting formalism. The independent control of the time and frequency gate parameters reveals details of matter dynamics not available otherwise. Application to an anharmonic oscillator model with fluctuating energy and anharmonicity demonstrates the power of these signals.

abstract: One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.

abstract: We introduce and theoretically demonstrate a quantum metamaterial made of dense ultracold neutral atoms loaded into an inherently defect-free artificial crystal of light, immune to well-known critical chal- lenges inevitable in conventional solid-state platforms. We demonstrate an all-optical control on ultrafast time scales over the photonic topological transition of the isofrequency contour from an open to close topology at the same frequency. This atomic lattice quantum metamaterial enables a dynamic manipula- tion of the decay rate of a probe quantum emitter by more than an order of magnitude. This proposal may lead to practically lossless, tunable and topologically-reconfigurable quantum metamaterials, for single- or few-photon-level applications as varied as quantum sensing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulations using metamaterials.

abstract: The auxiliary function of a classical channel appears in two fundamental quantities that upper and lower bound the error probability, respectively. A crucial property of the auxiliary function is its concavity, which leads to several important results in finite block length analysis. In this paper, we prove that the auxiliary function of a classical-quantum channel also enjoys the same concave property, extending an earlier partial result to its full generality. The key component in our proof is a beautiful result of geometric means of operators.

By considering a solvable two-field model generating bipartite correlations, we show explicitly how the modewise free-field quantum entanglement experiences gravitational enhancement generated by the interaction. Moreover, we verify that this enhancement is increased for stronger coupling between the two fields.

abstract: We analyze in detail an open cavity array using mean-field description, where each cavity field is coupled to a number of three-level atoms. Such system is highly tunable and can be described by a Jaynes-Cummings like Hamiltonian with additional non-linear terms. In the single cavity case we provide simple analytic solutions and show, that the system features a bistable region. The extra non-linear term gives rise to a rich dynamical behaviour including occurrence of limit cycles through Hopf bifurcations. In the limit of large non-linearity, the system exhibits an Ising like phase transition as the coupling between light and matter is varied. We then discuss how these results extend to the two-dimensional case.

abstract: A new quantum ontology of quantum mechanics has been proposed recently. This ontology is based on impossible to realize measurements which need to be performed repeatedly on the same single physical system or on the same pair of physical systems. We agree that quantum mechanics is a contextual theory and that the experimental contexts have to be a part of any description of quantum phenomena but in our opinion this new ontology is neither convincing nor useful. In particular the authors claim that their ontology explains the peaceful coexistence between quantum mechanics and relativity in spin polarization correlation experiments. We show that, contrary to their claim, the authors are unable to explain why strong correlations, between the outcomes of distant local measurements, do exist and why they preserve a condition of parameter independence (non-signaling). Strangely enough the authors ignore that these strong but imperfect correlations can be explained in a local and causal way using statistical contextual interpretation of quantum mechanics what was demonstrated in several articles.

abstract: We present a way of measuring the anharmonicity of a quantum oscillator coupled to an optical field via radiation pressure. Through a sequence of pulsed interactions we perform a loop in the phase space of the mechanical oscillator initially prepared in a thermal state and we show how the optical field acquires a phase depending on the anharmonicity that can be measured with high precision. Remarkably, one only needs small initial cooling of the mechanical motion to probe even small anharmonicities. Finally, by applying tools from quantum estimation theory, we calculate the ultimate bound on the estimation precision posed by quantum mechanics and compare it with the precision obtainable with feasible measurements such as homodyne and heterodyne detection on the cavity field. In particular we demonstrate that homodyne detection is nearly optimal in the limit of a large number of photons of the field, and we discuss the estimation precision of small anharmonicities in terms of its signal-to-noise ratio.

The model of point charges that are polarized in the self-consistent electromagnetic field in a dielectric environment is used. The standard dispersion laws for both branches of phonon-polaritons and longitudinal optical phonons are obtained. The transversal optical phonon frequency is found from the electrostatic equilibrium condition. It is proved by comparison with tabular data that the found frequency coincides with the ion plasma frequency multiplied on the relation $\sqrt{(\varepsilon_{\infty}+2)/(3(\varepsilon_0-\varepsilon_\infty))},$ where $\varepsilon_{\infty}$ and $\varepsilon_0$ are the high-frequency dielectric constant and the static one respectively.

abstract: In this paper we present an extensive and detailed experimental assessment of the performance of homodyne detection vs direct detection for determining the flux of an incoherent light source. The intensity of a laser reference signal is measured, before and after contamination by photon bunching noise (transimpedance gain of 20k), simultaneously. Moreover, the measurement containing photon bunching noise was done using two schemes: direct and homodyne detection, also with no appreciable time delay. The sampling rate of all measurements is the same, and is always higher than the frequency limit of the bunching noise. By carefully comparing the resulting three time series, it is found, surprisingly, that the homodyne detection of the incoherent signal resembles more closely the variance and variability pattern of the original coherent signal, and the effect is most prominent at the highest sampling frequency. It therefore appears flux estimates made using the shot noise of the field were able to overcome the Nyquist theorem, viz. by combining the homodyne technique with sampling at a rate faster than the bunching noise fluctuations it is possible to surpass the sensitivity limit of the radiometer equation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a detailed analysis of shot noise fluctuations has been investigated experimentally. Although a full theoretical understanding is still lacking, the experiments appear to show an unambiguous effect that requires further investigation.

abstract: Coherent spatial transport or shuttling of a single electron spin through semiconductor nanostructures is an important ingredient in many spintronic and quantum computing applications. In this work we analyze the possible errors in solid-state quantum computation due to leakage in transporting a single-spin qubit through a semiconductor double quantum dot. In particular, we consider three possible sources of leakage errors associated with such transport: finite ramping times, spin-dependent tunneling rates between quantum dots induced by finite spin-orbit couplings, and the presence of multiple valley states. In each case we present quantitative estimates of the leakage errors, and discuss how they can be minimized. Moreover, we show that in order to minimize leakage errors induced by spin-dependent tunnelings, it is necessary to apply pulses to perform certain carefully designed spin rotations. We further develop a formalism that allows one to systematically derive constraints on the pulse shapes and present a few examples to highlight the advantage of such an approach.

abstract: Full general relativity is almost certainly non-integrable and likely chaotic and therefore almost certainly possesses neither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows that the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include non-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot carry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization. This has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we investigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that fails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on standard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any solutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is to refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes continuous. In the toy model it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type topology, as e.g. used in loop quantum cosmology, is sufficient. Basing quantization of the toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac observables and a suitable semiclassical limit.

abstract: We simulate the dissipative evolution of a vortex in a trapped finite-temperature dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensate using first-principles open-systems theory. Simulations of the complete stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a partially condensed Bose gas containing a single quantum vortex show that the transfer of condensate energy to the incoherent thermal component without population transfer provides an important channel for vortex decay. For the lower temperatures considered, this effect is significantly larger that the population transfer process underpinning the standard theory of vortex decay, and is the dominant determinant of the vortex lifetime. A comparison with the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin kinetic (two-fluid) theory further elucidates the role of the particle transfer interaction, and suggests the need for experimental testing of reservoir interaction theory. The dominance of this particular energetic decay mechanism for this open quantum system should be testable with current experimental setups, and its observation would have broad implications for the dynamics of atomic matter waves and experimental studies of dissipative phenomena.

abstract: By driving a 3D transmon with microwave fields, we generate an effective avoided energy-level crossing. Then we chirp microwave frequency, which is equivalent to driving the system through the avoided energy-level crossing by sweeping the avoided crossing. A double-passage chirp produces Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana interference that agree well with the numerical results. Our method is fully applicable to other quantum systems that contain no intrinsic avoided level crossing, providing an alternative approach for quantum control and quantum simulation.

abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) hosting optically active defects are an important technical material for applications in quantum sensing, biological imaging, and quantum optics. The negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) defect is known to fluoresce in molecular sized NDs (1 to 6 nm) and its spectral properties depend on the quality of the surrounding host lattice. This defect is therefore a good probe to investigate the material properties of small NDs. Here we report unprecedented narrow optical transitions for SiV colour centers hosted in nanodiamonds produced using a novel high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique. The SiV zero-phonon lines were measured to have an inhomogeneous distribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K across a sample of numerous NDs. Individual spectral lines as narrow as 354 MHz were measured for SiV centres in nanodiamonds smaller than 200 nm, which is four times narrower than the best SiV line previously reported for nanodiamonds. Correcting for apparent spectral diffusion yielded a homogeneous linewith of about 200 MHz, which is close to the width limit imposed by the radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate that the direct HPHT synthesis technique is capable of producing nanodiamonds with high crystal lattice quality, which are therefore a valuable technical material.

abstract: One of the major computational bottlenecks in one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional theory is the evaluation of approximate 1RDM functionals and their derivatives. The reason is that more advanced approximate functionals are almost exclusively defined in the natural orbital basis, so a 4-index transformation of the two-electron integrals appears to be unavoidable. I will show that this is not the case and that so-called separable functionals can be evaluated much more efficiently, i.e. only at cubic cost in the basis size. Since most approximate functionals are actually separable, this new algorithm is an important development to make 1RDM functional theory calculations feasible for large electronic systems.
