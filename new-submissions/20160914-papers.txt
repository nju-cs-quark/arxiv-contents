abstract: We calculate Berry's phase when the driving field, to which a spin-1/2 is coupled adiabatically, rather than the familiar classical magnetic field, is a quantum vector operator, of noncommuting, in general, components, e.g., the angular momentum of another particle, or another spin. The geometric phase of the entire system, spin plus "quantum driving field", is first computed, and is then subdivided into the two subsystems, using the Schmidt decomposition of the total wave function -the resulting expression shows a marked, purely quantum effect, involving the commutator of the field components. We also compute the corresponding mean "classical" phase, involving a precessing magnetic field in the presence of noise, up to terms quadratic in the noise amplitude -the results are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations in the literature. Subtleties in the relation between the quantum and classical case are pointed out, while three concrete examples illustrate the scope and internal consistency of our treatment.

abstract: Fixed-point quantum search algorithms succeed at finding one of $M$ target items among $N$ total items even when the run time of the algorithm is longer than necessary. While the famous Grover's algorithm can search quadratically faster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the fraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the algorithm. Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search algorithm with the fixed-point property. Meanwhile, it is known that an adiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian, can reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. We ask, can an adiabatic algorithm also reproduce the fixed-point property? We show that the answer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model, there are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search, only some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. Guided by geometric intuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an explicit upper bound on the error in the adiabatic approximation. We also show that the fixed-point adiabatic search algorithm can be simulated in the gate model with neither loss of the quadratic Grover speedup nor of the fixed-point property. Finally, we discuss natural uses of fixed-point algorithms such as preparation of a relatively prime state and oblivious amplitude amplification.

abstract: Classical stochastic processes can be generated by quantum simulators instead of the more standard classical ones, such as hidden Markov models. One reason for using quantum simulators is that they generally require less memory than their classical counterparts. Here, we examine this quantum advantage for strongly coupled spin systems---the Dyson-like one-dimensional Ising spin chain with variable interaction length. We find that the advantage scales with both interaction range and temperature, growing without bound as interaction increases. Thus, quantum systems can very efficiently simulate strongly coupled classical systems.

title: Subsystems and time in quantum mechanics

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.03654
abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between subsystems and time in a closed nonrelativistic system of interacting bosons and fermions. It is possible to write any state vector in such a system as an unentangled tensor product of subsystem vectors, and to do so in infinitely many ways. This requires the superposition of different numbers of particles, but the theory can describe in full the equivalence relation that leads to a particle-number superselection rule in conventionally defined subsystems. Time is defined as a functional of subsystem changes, thus eliminating the need for any reference to an external time variable. The dynamics of the unentangled subsystem decomposition is derived from a variational principle of dynamical stability, which requires the decomposition to change as little as possible in any given infinitesimal time interval, subject to the constraint that the state of the total system satisfy the Schroedinger equation. The resulting subsystem dynamics is deterministic. This determinism is regarded as a conceptual tool that observers can use to make inferences about the outside world, not as a law of nature. The experiences of each observer define some properties of that observer's subsystem during an infinitesimal interval of time (i.e., the present moment); everything else must be inferred from this information. The overall structure of the theory has some features in common with quantum Bayesianism, the Everett interpretation, and dynamical reduction models, but it differs significantly from all of these. The theory of information described here is largely qualitative, as the most important equations have not yet been solved. The quantitative level of agreement between theory and experiment thus remains an open question.

abstract: Device-independent self-testing allows a verifier to certify that potentially malicious parties hold on to a specific quantum state, based only on the observed correlations. Parallel self-testing has recently been explored, aiming to self-test many copies (i.e. a tensor product) of the target state concurrently. In this work, we show that $n$ EPR pairs can be self-tested in parallel through $n$ copies of the well known CHSH game. We generalise this result further to a parallel self-test of $n$ tilted EPR pairs with arbitrary angles, and finally we show how our results and calculations can also be applied to obtain a parallel self-test of $2n$ EPR pairs via $n$ copies of the Mermin-Peres magic square game.

abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity are alternative fast processes that reproduce the same final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process in a finite, shorter time. Many of the existing approaches to design shortcuts, and even new ones have been used throughout this Thesis in the double well potential. These techniques have allowed us to obtain a great benefit in processes as varied as matter-wave splitting, multiplexing/ demultiplexing, beam splitters, cotunneling, population inversion, waveguide optimization, Tonks-Girardeau gas manipulation and bias inversion.

abstract: Two-level systems are one of the most important quantum systems and they form the basis of quantum computers. We briefly look at the traditional approach to two-level systems with an external driving field as well as those subjected to noise. This project is aimed at studying two specific methods for obtaining analytic solutions for two-level systems. One of the methods enables us to obtain analytic solutions for driven time-dependent two-level systems while the other attempts to give exact solution of qubit decoherence using a transfer matrix method. A thorough study of both papers is done and results are reproduced. The latter method is generalized for a qutrit system as well as a two qubit system subjected to noise. A general method is formally derived for an N-dimensional quantum system and the difficulties in applying the method in real life systems is discussed.

abstract: The general Weyl -- Wigner formalism in finite dimensional phase spaces is investigated. Then this formalism is specified to the case of symmetric ordering of operators in an odd -- dimensional Hilbert space. A respective Wigner function on the discrete phase space is found and the limit, when the dimension of Hilbert space tends to infinity, is considered. It is shown that this limit gives the number -- phase Wigner function in quantum optics. Analogous results for the `almost' symmetric ordering in an even -- dimensional Hilbert space are obtained. Relations between the discrete Wigner functions introduced in our paper and some other discrete Wigner functions appearing in literature are studied.

abstract: We consider the statistical problem of `compressive' estimation of low rank states with random basis measurements, where the estimation error is expressed terms of two metrics - the Frobenius norm and quantum infidelity. It is known that unlike the case of general full state tomography, low rank states can be identified from a reduced number of observables' expectations. Here we investigate whether for a fixed sample size $N$, the estimation error associated to a `compressive' measurement setup is `close' to that of the setting where a large number of bases are measured. In terms of the Frobenius norm, we demonstrate that for all states the error attains the optimal rate $rd/N$ with only $O(r \log{d})$ random basis measurements. We provide an illustrative example of a single qubit and demonstrate a concentration in the Frobenius error about its optimal for all qubit states. In terms of the quantum infidelity, we show that such a concentration does not exist uniformly over all states. Specifically, we show that for states that are nearly pure and close to the surface of the Bloch sphere, the mean infidelity scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$ but the constant converges to zero as the number of settings is increased. This demonstrates a lack of `compressive' recovery for nearly pure states in this metric.

abstract: In 2013, Boneh and Zhandry introduced the notion of indistinguishability (IND) in chosen plaintext (CPA) and chosen ciphertext (CCA) attacks by a quantum adversary which is given superposition access to an oracle for encryption and decryption queries but is restricted to classical queries in the challenge phase. In this paper we define IND-CPA and IND-CCA notions for symmetric encryption schemes where the adversary has full quantum superposition access to the oracle, and give constructions that achieve these security notions. Our results are formulated in the concrete security framework.

abstract: Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. We review our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random and random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown that non-stoquastic terms, of the type of multi-body transverse interactions like XX and XXX with positive coefficients, appended to the stoquastic Hamiltonian reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field Ising model to a second-order transition. This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented here are the first instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems.

abstract: We calculate the emission spectra, the Glauber $g^{(2)}$ function, and the entanglement of formation for a few two-level emitters coupled to a single cavity mode and subject to an external laser-excitation. To evaluate these quantities we couple the system to environmental degrees of freedom which leads to dissipative dynamics. Because of the periodic time-dependence of the system Hamiltonian, the coefficients of the (Markovian) master equation are constant if Floquet states are used as the computational basis. Studying the emission spectra we show that the dynamic Stark effect, i.e., the shift of spectral lines, first appears in the second order of the laser intensity. For the Glauber function, we find clearly distinguished parameter regimes of super- and sub-Poissonian light emission and explain the additional features appearing for finite laser intensity in terms of the quasienergy spectrum of the driven emitter-cavity system. Finally, we analyze the temperature and emitter-cavity coupling regimes where entanglement among the emitters is generated, and show that the laser-excitation leads to a decrease of entanglement.

abstract: We outline the general construction of three-players games with incomplete information which fulfil the following conditions: (i) symmetry with respect to the exchange of the players; (ii) the existence of the upper bound for total payoff resulting from Bell inequalities; (iii) the existence of both fair and unfair Nash equilibria saturating this bound. Conditions ((i)$\div$(iii)) imply that we are dealing with conflicting interest games. An explicit example of such a game is given. A quantum counterpart of this game is considered which is obtained by keeping the same utilities but replacing classical advisor by a quantum one. It is shown that the quantum game possesses only fair equilibria with strictly higher payoffs than in the classical case. This implies that quantum nonlocality can be used to resolve a conflict between players.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.03866
abstract: The Bohm/de Broglie theory of deterministic non-relativistic quantum mechanics is broadened to accommodate the free-particle Dirac equation. As with the spin-0 theory, an effective particle rest-mass scalar field in the presence of the spin-1/2 pilot wave is allowed, together with the assumption that the convective current component describes ensemble dynamics. Non-positive excursions of the ensemble density for extreme cases of positive-energy solutions of the Dirac equation are interpreted in terms of virtual-like pair creation and annihilation beneath the Compton wavelength. A specific second-rank tensor is defined in terms of the Dirac spinors for generalizing from simply a quantum potential to a stress tensor required to account for the force of pilot wave on particle. A simple dependence of the stress tensor on a two-component spin pseudovector field is determined. Consistency is found with an earlier non-relativistic theory of objects with spin.

abstract: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction has been proven to excite entanglement of spin systems, enhancing the capability of realizing various quantum tasks such as teleportation. In this work, we consider the DM interaction -to the best of our knowledge, for the first time in quantum game theory. We study the winning probability of magic square game played with the thermal entangled state of spin models under external magnetic fields and DM interaction. We analytically show that although DM interaction excites the entanglement of the system as expected, it surprizingly reduces the winning probability of the game, acting like temperature or magnetic fields, and also show that the effects of DM interaction and inhomogeneous magnetic field on the winning probability are identical. In addition, we show that XXZ model is considerably more robust than XX model against destructive effects. Our results can open new insights for quantum information processing with spin systems.

abstract: In this work, we provide an overview of how well-established concepts in the fields of quantum chemistry and material sciences have to be adapted when the quantum nature of light becomes important in correlated matter-photon problems. Therefore, we analyze model systems in optical cavities, where the matter-photon interaction is considered from the weak- to the strong coupling limit and for individual photon modes as well as for the multi-mode case. We identify fundamental changes in Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, spectroscopic quantities, conical intersections and efficiency for quantum control. We conclude by applying our novel recently developed quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory to single-photon emission and show how a straightforward approximation accurately describes the correlated electron-photon dynamics. This paves the road to describe matter-photon interactions from first-principles and addresses the emergence of new states of matter in chemistry and material science.

abstract: The security analysis of quantum key distribution (QKD) is difficult to perform when there is efficiency mismatch between various threshold detectors involved in an experimental setup. Even the verification that the device actually performs in the quantum domain, referred to as the task of entanglement verification, is hard to perform. In this article we provide such an entanglement-verification method for characterized detection-efficiency mismatch. Our method does not rely on cut-off of photon numbers in the optical signal. It can be applied independently of the degrees of freedom involved, thus covering, for example, efficiency mismatch in polarization and time-bin modes, but also in spatial modes. The evaluation of typical experimental scenarios suggests that an increase of detection-efficiency mismatch will drive the performance of a given setup out of the quantum domain.

Here the role of the two-level system in the JC model is played by the presence or absence of a collective Rydberg excitation, and the bosonic mode manifests as the number $n$ of single atom spin flips, symmetrically distributed between the atoms. We measure the normal-mode splitting and $\sqrt{n}$ nonlinearity as a function of detuning and Rabi frequency, thereby experimentally establishing the isomorphism with the JC model.

abstract: The ability to distribute entanglement over complex quantum networks is an important step towards a quantum Internet. Recently, there has been significant theoretical effort by mainly focusing on the distribution of bipartite entanglement via a simple quantum network composed only of bipartite quantum channels. There are, however, a number of quantum information processing protocols based on multipartite entanglement, rather than bipartite one, which should be served more naturally by a quantum broadcast network, rather than such a simple network. In this work, we present a general framework for deriving upper bounds on the rates at which GHZ states or multipartite private states can be distributed among a number of different parties over any quantum broadcast network. We also discuss how lower bounds can be obtained by combining generalisation of an aggregated quantum repeater protocol with graph theoretic concepts.

abstract: In this work, we introduce classical holographic codes. These can be understood as concatenated probabilistic codes and can be represented as networks uniformly covering hyperbolic space. In particular, classical holographic codes can be interpreted as maps from bulk degrees of freedom to boundary degrees of freedom. Interestingly, they are shown to exhibit features similar to those expected from the AdS/CFT correspondence. Among these are a version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and intriguing properties regarding bulk reconstruction and boundary representations of bulk operations. We discuss the relation of our findings with expectations from AdS/CFT and, in particular, with recent results from quantum error correction.

abstract: Quantum technology based on cold-atom interferometers is showing great promise for fields such as inertial sensing and fundamental physics. However, the best precision achievable on Earth is limited by the free-fall time of the atoms, and their full potential can only be realized in Space where interrogation times of many seconds will lead to unprecedented sensitivity. Various mission scenarios are presently being pursued which plan to implement matter-wave inertial sensors. Toward this goal, we realize the first onboard operation of simultaneous $^{87}$Rb $-$ $^{39}$K interferometers in the weightless environment produced during parabolic flight. The large vibration levels ($10^{-2}~g/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$), acceleration range ($0-1.8~g$) and rotation rates ($5$ deg/s) during flight present significant challenges. We demonstrate the capability of our dual-quantum sensor by measuring the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter with systematic-limited uncertainties of $1.1 \times 10^{-3}$ and $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$ during standard- and micro-gravity, respectively. This constitutes the first test of the equivalence principle in a free-falling vehicle with quantum sensors. Our results are applicable to inertial navigation, and can be extended to the trajectory of a satellite for future Space missions.

abstract: We examine the efficiency of an effective two-terminal thermoelectric device under broken time-reversal symmetry. The setup is derived from a three-terminal thermoelectric device comprising a thermal terminal and two electronic contacts, under a magnetic field. We find that breaking time-reversal symmetry in the presence of the inelastic electron-phonon processes can significantly enhance the figure of merit for delivering electric power by supplying heat from a phonon bath, beyond the one for producing the electric power by investing thermal power from the electronic heat current. The efficiency of such a device is bounded by the non-negativity of the entropy production of the original three-terminal junction. The efficiency at maximal power can be quite close to the Carnot efficiency, but then the electric power vanishes.

abstract: We study the effect of an external harmonic trapping potential on an outcome of the non-adiabatic quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a phase-separated state in a spin-1 atomic condensate. Previously, we demonstrated that the dynamics of an untrapped system exhibits double universality with two different scaling laws appearing due to conservation of magnetization. We show that in the presence of a trap double universality persists. However, the corresponding scaling exponents are strongly modified by transfer of local magnetization across the system. The values of these exponents cannot be explained by the effect of causality alone, as in the spinless case. We derive the appropriate scaling laws based on a slow diffusive-drift relaxation process in the local density approximation.

abstract: We consider the ground-state properties of an extended one-dimensional Bose gas with pointwise attractive interactions. We take the limit where the interaction strength goes to zero as the system size increases at fixed particle density. In this limit the gas exhibits a quantum phase transition. We compute local correlation functions at zero temperature, both at finite and infinite size. We provide analytic formulas for the experimentally relevant one-point functions $g_2$, $g_3$ and analyze their finite-size corrections. Our results are compared to the mean-field approach based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which yields the exact results in the infinite system size limit, but not for finite systems.

abstract: Point defects in silicon carbide are rapidly becoming a platform of great interest for single photon generation, quantum sensing, and quantum information science. Photonic crystal cavities (PCC) can serve as an efficient light-matter interface both to augment the defect emission and to aid in studying the defects' properties. In this work, we fabricate 1D nanobeam PCCs in 4H-silicon carbide with embedded silicon vacancy centers. These cavities are used to achieve Purcell enhancement of two closely spaced defect zero-phonon lines (ZPL). Enhancements of >80-fold are measured using multiple techniques. Additionally, the nature of the cavity coupling to the different ZPLs is examined.

abstract: The simultaneous presence of two competing inter-particle interactions can lead to the emergence of new phenomena in a many-body system. Among others, such effects are expected in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, subject to dipole-dipole interaction and short-range repulsion. Magnetic quantum gases and in particular Dysprosium gases, offering a comparable short-range contact and a long-range dipolar interaction energy, remarkably exhibit such emergent phenomena. In addition an effective cancellation of mean-field effects of the two interactions results in a pronounced importance of quantum-mechanical beyond mean-field effects. For a weakly-dominant dipolar interaction the striking consequence is the existence of a new state of matter equilibrated by the balance between weak mean-field attraction and beyond mean-field repulsion. Though exemplified here in the case of dipolar Bose gases, this state of matter should appear also with other microscopic interactions types, provided a competition results in an effective cancellation of the total mean-field. The macroscopic state takes the form of so-called quantum droplets. We present the effects of a long-range dipolar interaction between these droplets.
