abstract: We describe how quantum dot semiconductor cavity systems can be engineered to exploit anisotropy-induced dipole-dipole coupling between orthogonal dipole states in a single quantum dot. Quantum dots in single-mode cavity structures with spin exciton states, as well as photonic crystal waveguides coupled to spin states or linearly polarized excitons are considered, where the latter can be coupled to chiral points in the Bloch mode. We demonstrate pronounced, almost perfect, dipole-dipole coupling and dipole entanglement effects and study the quantum dynamics of both field-free entanglement evolution and coherently pumped entanglement regimes. In a Mollow triplet regime, where one of the dipoles is pumped, we also explore the incoherent spectra emitted from the orthogonal dipoles and show how the non-pumped dipole can take on the form of a spectral singlet or triplet.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, measurement restores a classical notion of reality via collapse of the wavefunction, which yields a precisely defined outcome. On the other hand, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that incompatible observables, such as position and momentum, cannot both take on arbitrarily precise values. But how does a wavefunction evolve when two such quantities are probed simultaneously, and how does the uncertainty principle dynamically inhibit precise measurement outcomes? To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two continuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables on a superconducting qubit. We achieve this capability by developing a novel measurement scheme that allows us to control the axes of multiple readout channels. We show that the uncertainty principle directly governs the dynamics of the state, and consequently standard wavefunction collapse is replaced by a persistent diffusion that exhibits several distinct regimes. Although evolution of the state now differs drastically from that of a conventional measurement, information about both non-commuting observables is extracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement record, enabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our work creates new capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state purification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and continuous quantum error correction. As physical quantum systems interact with their environments via non-commuting degrees of freedom, our work offers a new, more natural approach to experimentally study contemporary quantum foundations.

abstract: A two-level atom interacting with an electromagnetic mode in a cavity experiences population collapses and revivals. They are an indirect signature of the field quantization, and also hold infor- mation about the mode. Thus, they may be harnessed for quantum-state reconstruction. In this work, we study the revival structures with the characteristic function approach. The characteristic function is essentially a spectral decomposition of the photon-number probability distribution. Ex- ploiting the characteristic function periodicity, we find that the atomic population inversion can be understood as the result of interference between a set of structures akin to a free quantum-mechanical wave packet, each structure corresponding to snapshots of this packet for different degrees of disper- sion. When these structures do not overlap, each of which can be identified to one of the inversion revivals, in which case we may also retrieve the photon-number distribution.

abstract: We analyze uncertainty relations on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces expressed in terms of classical fidelity, which are stronger then metric uncertainty relations introduced by Fawzi, Hayden and Sen. We establish validity of fidelity uncertainty relations for random unitary matrices with optimal parameters (up to universal constants) which improves upon known results for the weaker notion of metric uncertainty. This result is then applied to locking classical information in quantum states and allows to obtain optimal locking in Hellinger distance, improving upon previous results on locking in the total variation distance, both by strengthening the metric used and by improving the dependence on parameters. We also show that general probabilistic estimates behind the main theorem can be used to prove existence of data hiding schemes with Bayesian type guarantees. As a byproduct of our approach we obtain existence of almost Euclidean subspaces of the matrix spaces $\ell_1^n(\ell_2^m)$ with a better dimension/distortion dependence than allowed in previously known constructions.

abstract: We study the possibility of using single rare-earth ions coupled to a photonic cavity with high cooperativity for performing non-destructive measurements of photons, which would be useful for global quantum networks and photonic quantum computing. We calculate the achievable fidelity as a function of the parameters of the rare-earth ion and photonic cavity, which include the ion's optical and spin dephasing rates, the cavity linewidth, the single photon coupling to the cavity, and the detection efficiency. We suggest a promising experimental realization using current state of the art technology in Nd:YVO$_4$.

abstract: Recently, magnetic field sensors based on an electron spin of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond have been studied both from an experimental and theoretical point of view. This system provides a nanoscale magnetometer, and it is possible to detect a precession of a single spin. In this paper, we propose a sensor consisting of an electron spin and a nuclear spin in diamond. Although the electron spin has a reasonable interaction strength with magnetic field, the coherence time of the spin is relatively short. On the other hand, the nuclear spin has a longer life time while the spin has a negligible interaction with magnetic fields. We show that, through the combination of such two different spins via the hyperfine interaction, it is possible to construct a magnetic field sensor with the sensitivity far beyond that of previous sensors using just a single electron spin.

abstract: A new quantum eraser setup exploiting for the first time the time-energy complementarity relation in the x-ray regime is investigated theoretically. Starting point is the interference process between x-ray quanta driving two nuclear hyperfine transitions in a nuclear forward scattering setup. We show that which-way information can be obtained by marking the scattering paths with orthogonal polarization states, thus leading to the disappearance of the interference pattern. In turn, erasure of the which-way information leads to the reappearance of the interference fringes. We put forward two schemes using resonant scattering off nuclear targets and design which-way marking procedures to realize the quantum eraser setup for x-ray quanta.

abstract: We address the statistics of continuous weak linear measurement on a few-state quantum system that is subject to a conditioned quantum evolution. For a conditioned evolution, both the initial and final states of the system are fixed: the latter is achieved by the post-selection in the end of the evolution. The statistics may drastically differ from the non-conditioned case, and the interference between initial and final states can be observed in the probability distributions of measurement outcomes as well as in the average values exceeding the conventional range of non-conditioned averages. We develop a proper formalism to compute the distributions of measurement outcomes, evaluate and discuss the distributions in experimentally relevant setups. We demonstrate the manifestations of the interference between initial and final states in various regimes. We consider analytically simple examples of non-trivial probability distributions. We reveal peaks (or dips) at half-quantized values of the measurement outputs. We discuss in detail the case of zero overlap between initial and final states demonstrating anomalously big average outputs and sudden jump in time-integrated output. We present and discuss the numerical evaluation of the probability distribution aiming at extend- ing the analytic results and describing a realistic experimental situation of a qubit in the regime of resonant fluorescence.

abstract: The monogamy relation for quantum correlations is not satisfied by all measures for all multiparty quantum states. We prove that an arbitrary quantum state which is nonmonogamous for negativity will become monogamous if a finite number of copies of the same state is provided. We refer this as activation of nonmonogamous states. We also show that multiple copies of a state satisfy monogamy for negativity if it does so for a single copy. The results are true for all quantum states of an arbitrary number of parties. Moreover, we find that two different three-qubit pure states which individually violate monogamy relation for negativity, taken together can satisfy the three-party monogamy relation. This holds for almost all three-qubit pure states while it is true for all three-qubit pure states when a four-party monogamy relation is used to check for their activation. We finally connect monogamy of negativity with genuine multipartite entanglement.

We introduce a position-dependent photon scattering rate for a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in the direction perpendicular to the trap surface using a standing wave of retroreflected light off the mirror surface directly below the trap. Using this setup, we demonstrate the capability of fine-tuning the RF trap location with nanometer scale precision and characterize the charging effects of the dielectric mirror surface upon exposure to ultra-violet light.

abstract: We study a non-autonomous, non-linear evolution equation on the space of operators on a complex Hilbert space. We specify assumptions that ensure the global existence of its solutions and allow us to derive its asymptotics at temporal infinity. We demonstrate that these assumptions are optimal in a suitable sense and more general than those used before. The evolution equation derives from the Brocket-Wegner flow that was proposed to diagonalize matrices and operators by a strongly continuous unitary flow. In fact, the solution of the non-linear flow equation leads to a diagonalization of Hamiltonian operators in boson quantum field theory which are quadratic in the field.

abstract: In this article we exploit the geometric structure of statistical manifolds to compare vis-a-vis quantum and classical dynamics. We show that the fixed points of geodesic dynamics in a classical setting coincide with the distributions that minimise the Shannon's entropy. Whereas in a quantum setting this happens only for particular initial conditions, which correspond to classical submanifolds. This result can be interpreted as a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. Other differences put forward concern the (in)stability of geodesic dynamics. The classical scenario results in an isotropic manifold where the geodesic flow is stable. Conversely, on the quantum setting the instability of geodesic dynamics matches the spread out of geodesic ball volumes described by negative constant scalar curvature. spread out of geodesic ball volumes described by negative constant scalar curvature.

abstract: We propose a protocol of quantum energy teleportation (QET) for holographic conformal field theory (CFT) in 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with or without black hole. A generic QET protocol contains two steps: (i) Alice injects the energy into ground state by performing local measurement; (ii) the distant Bob extracts energy by performing local operation according to Alice's measurement outcome. In our holographic protocol, we mimic the step (i) by local projection of an interval of CFT ground state into an excited state described by Banados geometry. For the step (ii) we adopt the surface/state duality to evaluate the energy extraction by local deformation of UV surface as the holographic dual of Bob's local unitary operations. Our results show that this protocol always gains energy extraction. Moreover, the ratio of Bob's extraction energy density to the energy density of the excited state after Alice's local projection is a positive semi-definite and bounded function of the UV surface deformation profile, and is independent of temperature and Alice's local projections.

abstract: We study static and dynamical properties of isolated many-body quantum systems and compare them with the results for full random matrices. In doing so, we link concepts from quantum information theory with those from quantum chaos. In particular, we relate the von Neumann entanglement entropy with the Shannon information entropy and discuss their relevance for the analysis of the degree of complexity of the eigenstates, the behavior of the system at different time scales, and the conditions for thermalization. A main advantage of full random matrices is that they enable the derivation of analytical expressions that agree extremely well with the numerics and provide bounds for realistic many-body quantum systems.

abstract: We have observed short-range photoassociation of LiRb to the two lowest vibrational states of the $d\,^3\Pi$ potential. These $d\,^3\Pi$ molecules then spontaneously decay to vibrational levels of the $a^3\,\Sigma^+$ state with generation rates of $\sim10^3$ molecules per second. This is the first observation of many of these $a\,^3\Sigma^+$ levels. We observe an alternation of the peak heights in the rotational photoassociation spectrum that suggests a $p$-wave shape resonance in the scattering state. Franck-Condon overlap calculations predict that photoassociation to higher vibrational levels of the $d\,^3\Pi$, in particular the sixth vibrational level, should populate the lowest vibrational level of the $a\,^3\Sigma^+$ state with a rate as high as $10^4$ molecules per second. These results encourage further work to explain our observed LiRb collisional physics using PECs. This work also motivates an experimental search for short-range photoassociation to other bound molecules, such as the $c\,^3\Sigma^+$ or $b\,^3\Pi$, as prospects for preparing ground-state molecules.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1608.06659
abstract: Quantum critical states exhibit strong quantum fluctuations and are therefore highly susceptible to perturbations. In this work we study the dynamical stability of such states against a sudden coupling to these strong fluctuations by quenching the order parameter of the underlying transition. We find that such a quench can generate superextensive energy fluctuations. As we show for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and the infinitely-connected Ising model, this leads to a dynamical quantum phase transition in the resulting decay of the initial state. At the corresponding critical time the dynamically-evolved state becomes orthogonal to the initial one making both states optimally distinguishable which is the defining property of quantum speed limits. Due to the superextensive energy fluctuations the critical time of orthogonality exhibits an unconventional system-size dependence yielding a yet unrecognized quantum speed limit. An outlook is given onto the implications of the superextensive energy fluctuations on potential restricted thermalization despite of nonintegrability.

abstract: We present a method designed to efficiently extract optical signals from InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operated in gated mode. In particular, our method permits an estimation of the fraction of counts which actually results from the signal being measured, as opposed to being produced by noise mechanisms, specifically by afterpulsing. Our method in principle allows the use of InGaAs APDs at high detection efficiencies, with the full operation bandwidth, either with or without resorting to the application of a dead time. As we show below, our method can be used in configurations where afterpulsing exceeds the genuine signal by orders of magnitude, even near saturation. The algorithms which we have developed are suitable to be used either in real-time processing of raw detection probabilities or in post-processing applications, after a calibration step has been performed. The algorithms which we propose here can complement technologies designed for the reduction of afterpulsing.

The apparatus is described in detail and the first observations of strong coupling with potassium atoms are presented. Collective strong coupling of atoms and light is demonstrated via the splitting of the cavity transmission spectrum and the avoided crossing of the normal modes.

abstract: We demonstrate that a dispersive imaging technique based on the Faraday effect can measure the atom number in a large, ultracold atom cloud with a precision below the atom shot noise level. The minimally destructive character of the technique allows us to take multiple images of the same cloud, which enables sub-atom shot noise measurement precision of the atom number and allows for an in situ determination of the measurement precision. We have developed a noise model that quantitatively describes the noise contributions due to photon shot noise in the detected light and the noise associated with single atom loss. This model contains no free parameters and is calculated through an analysis of the fluctuations in the acquired images. For clouds containing $N \sim 5 \times 10^6$ atoms, we achieve a precision more than a factor of two below the atom shot noise level.

However, we demonstrate that the approach allows us to perform angular reduction thereby considerably simplifying the spectral analysis.

abstract: From quantum mechanical first principles only, we rigorously study the time-evolution of a $N$-level atom (impurity) interacting with an external monochromatic light source within an infinite system of free electrons at thermal equilibrium (reservoir). In particular, we establish the relation between the full dynamics of the compound system and the effective dynamics for the $N$-level atom, which is studied in detail in [Bru-de Siqueira Pedra-Westrich, Annales Henri Poincar\'e, 13(6):1305-1370, 2012]. Together with [Bru-de Siqueira Pedra-Westrich, Annales Henri Poincar\'e, 13(6):1305-1370, 2012] the present paper yields a purely microscopic theory of optical pumping in laser physics. The model we consider is general enough to describe gauge invariant atom-reservoir interactions.

abstract: A bacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex PLHC absorbs a photon and transfers this energy almost perfectly at room temperature RT to a Reaction Center RC, where charge separation occurs. While there are a number of possible light absorbers involved in this process, our focus is the B850 and B875 complexes. We propose that the dominant feature of the ground states in the B850 ring and the B875 open chain are pseudo one dimensional metals due to each bacteriochlorophyll a BChl containing a coordinated magnesium ion Mg2+. The Mg ion structure undergoes a static Peierls distortion that results in symmetry breaking that changes the even spacing of the Mg/BChl molecules comprising the chains to the experimentally observed Mg/BChl dimers. The results are charge density waves CDW, one for each type of the two complexes that result in an energy gap in the single particle electronic spectrum and coherent phonon s spanning the entire rings. The ground state CDWs seem to have two functions the first is to form a stable optical platform and the second is to suppress radical formation and energy dissipation of the coherent excited state by creating single particle energy gaps. After excitation by a photon, the B850 exciton delocalizes on the ring a second photon can form a two-level exciton polariton that could be an alternative explanation for the splitting of the B850 exciton band. The coherent polariton formed could actively participate in uphill electronic energy transfer EET. Additionally we suggest other possible energy storage mechanisms and entanglement possibilities. We suggest experimental studies to clarify these proposals.

abstract: Microscopic imaging of local magnetic fields provides a window into the organizing principles of complex and technologically relevant condensed matter materials. However, a wide variety of intriguing strongly correlated and topologically nontrivial materials exhibit poorly understood phenomena outside the detection capability of state-of-the-art high-sensitivity, high-resolution scanning probe magnetometers. We introduce a quantum-noise-limited scanning probe magnetometer that can operate from room-to-cryogenic temperatures with unprecedented DC-field sensitivity and micron-scale resolution. The Scanning Quantum Cryogenic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) employs a magnetically levitated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), thereby providing immunity to conductive and blackbody radiative heating. The SQCRAMscope has a noise floor of 300 pT and provides a 100x improvement in magnetic flux sensitivity over previous atomic scanning probe magnetometers. These capabilities are carefully benchmarked by imaging magnetic fields arising from microfabricated wire patterns. We anticipate the SQCRAMscope will provide charge transport images at temperatures from room-to-4 K in unconventional superconductors and topologically nontrivial materials.

Conversely, a quantum simulator, often regarded as a quantum computing device for special purposes, also offers a way of characterizing topological orders. Here, we show how to identify distinct topological orders via measuring their modular $S$ and $T$ matrices. In particular, we employ a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator to study the properties of three topologically ordered matter phases described by the string-net model with two string types, including the $\Z_2$ toric code, doubled semion, and doubled Fibonacci order. The third one, non-Abelian Fibonacci order is notably expected to be the simplest candidate for universal topological quantum computing. Our experiment serves as the basic module, built on which one can simulate braiding of non-Abelian anyons and ultimately topological quantum computation via the braiding, and thus provides a new approach of investigating topological orders using quantum computers.
