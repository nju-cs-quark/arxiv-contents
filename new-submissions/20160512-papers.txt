abstract: It has recently been shown that a parametrically driven oscillator with Kerr nonlinearity yields a Schr\"odinger cat state via quantum adiabatic evolution through its bifurcation point and a network of such nonlinear oscillators can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems by bifurcation-based adiabatic quantum computation [H. Goto, Sci. Rep. \textbf{6}, 21686 (2016)]. Here we theoretically show that such a nonlinear oscillator network with controllable parameters can also be used for universal quantum computation. The initialization is achieved by a quantum-mechanical bifurcation based on quantum adiabatic evolution, which yields a Schr\"odinger cat state. All the elementary quantum gates are also achieved by quantum adiabatic evolution, in which dynamical phases accompanying the adiabatic evolutions are controlled by the system parameters. Numerical simulation results indicate that high gate fidelities can be achieved, where no dissipation is assumed.

abstract: We consider quantum algorithms for the unique sink orientation problem on cubes. This problem is widely considered to be of intermediate computational complexity. This is because there no known polynomial algorithm (classical or quantum) from the problem and yet it arrises as part of a series of problems for which it being intractable would imply complexity theoretic collapses. We give a reduction which proves that if one can efficiently evaluate the kth power of the unique sink orientation outmap, then there exists a polynomial time quantum algorithm for the unique sink orientation problem on cubes.

abstract: Solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation by spanning the wave function is a complete basis is a common practice is many-body interacting systems. We shall study the case of a two-dimensional quantum system composed by two interacting spin-less electrons and see that the correctness of the matrix approach depends inexplicably on the type of interaction existing between particles.

comments: 9 pages, 2 figures; Part of this work was contained in an earlier version of an arXiv manuscript, arXiv:1407.5318v1, which included two conceptually different topics. One has been published in Phys. Rev. A (Doi: 10.1103/PhysRevA.91.032314, see also arXiv:1407.5318v2), and the other one, extended and refined, is the object of the present manuscript

abstract: In this work we introduce a general scheme for measurement based quantum computation in continuous variables. Our approach does not necessarily rely on the use of ancillary cluster states to achieve its aim, but rather on the detection of a resource state in a suitable mode basis followed by digital post-processing, and involves an optimization of the adjustable experimental parameters. After introducing the general method, we present some examples of application to simple specific computations.

abstract: The distribution of Gaussian entanglement can be used to generate a mathematically-proven secure key for quantum cryptography. The distributed secret key rate is limited by the bandwidth of the nonlinear resonators used for entanglement generation, which is less than 100 MHz for current state-of-the-art setups. The development of an entanglement source with a higher bandwidth promises an increased measurement speed and a linear boost in the secure data rate. Here, we present the experimental realization of a continuous-variable entanglement source with a bandwidth of more than 1.25 GHz. The measured entanglement spectrum was quantified via the inseparability criterion introduced by Duan and coworkers with a critical value of 4 below which entanglement is certified. The measurements yielded an inseparability value of about 1.8 at a frequency of 300 MHz to about 2.8 at 1.2 GHz extending further to about 3.1 at 1.48 GHz. In the experiment we used two 2.6 mm long monolithic PPKTP crystal resonators to generate two squeezed fields at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. The experimentally achieved entanglement strength was mainly limited by the total optical detection efficiency of 59% in the set-up as well as by the injected pump power of the nonlinear process for the entanglement generation.

abstract: We propose a new point of view regarding the problem of time in quantum mechanics, based on the idea of replacing the usual time operator $\mathbf{T}$ with a suitable real-valued function $T$ on the space of physical states. The proper characterization of the function $T$ relies on a particular relation with the dynamical evolution of the system rather than with the infinitesimal generator of the dynamics (Hamiltonian). We first consider the case of classical Hamiltonian mechanics, where observables are functions on phase space and the tools of differential geometry can be applied. The idea is then extended to the case of the unitary evolution of pure states of finite-level quantum systems by means of the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. It is found that $T$ is a function on the space of pure states which is not associated to any self-adjoint operator. The link between $T$ and the dynamical evolution is interpreted as defining a simultaneity relation for the states of the system with respect to the dynamical evolution itself. It turns out that different dynamical evolutions lead to different notions of simultaneity, i.e., the notion of simultaneity is a dynamical notion.

abstract: Lattice models with non-hermitian, parity and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric Hamiltonians, realized most readily in coupled optical systems, have been intensely studied in the past few years. A $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dimer lattice consists of dimers with intra-dimer coupling $\nu$, inter-dimer coupling $\nu'$, and balanced gain and loss potentials $\pm i\gamma$ within each dimer. This model undergoes two independent transitions, namely a $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking transition and a topological transition. We numerically and analytically investigate the signatures of these transitions in the time-evolution of states that are initially localized on the gain-site or the loss-site.

abstract: We present new combinatorial objects, which we call grid-labelled graphs, and show how these can be used to represent the quantum states arising in a scenario which we refer to as the faulty emitter scenario: we have a machine designed to emit a particular quantum state on demand, but which can make an error and emit a different one. The device is able to produce a list of candidate states which can be used as a kind of debugging information for testing entanglement. By reformulating the Peres-Horodecki and matrix realignment criteria we are able to capture some characteristic features of entanglement: we construct new bound entangled states, and demonstrate the limitations of matrix realignment. We show how the notion of LOCC is related to a generalisation of the graph isomorphism problem. We give a simple proof that asymptotically almost surely, grid-labelled graphs associated to very sparse density matrices are entangled. We develop tools for enumerating grid-labelled graphs that satisfy the Peres-Horodecki criterion up to a fixed number of vertices, and propose various computational problems for these objects, whose complexity remains an open problem. The proposed mathematical framework also suggests new combinatorial and algebraic ways for describing the structure of graphs.

abstract: We present a scalable architecture for the exploration of interacting topological phases of photons in arrays of microwave cavities, using established techniques from cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. A time-reversal symmetry breaking (non-reciprocal) flux is induced by coupling the microwave cavities to ferrites, allowing for the production of a variety of topological band structures including the $\alpha=1/4$ Hofstadter model. Effective photon-photon interactions are included by coupling the cavities to superconducting qubits, and are sufficient to produce a $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin puddle. We demonstrate by exact diagonalization that this architecture is robust to experimentally achievable levels of disorder. These advances provide an exciting opportunity to employ the quantum circuit toolkit for the exploration of strongly interacting topological materials.

abstract: In this paper we construct a path integral formulation of quantum mechanics on noncommutative phase-space. We first map the system to an equivalent system on the noncommutative plane. Then by applying the formalism of representing a quantum system in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on noncommutative configuration space, the path integral action of a particle is derived. It is observed that the action has a similar form to that of a particle in a magnetic field in the noncommutative plane. From this action the energy spectrum is obtained for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator potential. We also show that the nonlocal nature (in time) of the action yields a second class constrained system from which the noncommutative Heisenberg algebra can be recovered.

abstract: We study the problem to infer the ground state of a spin-glass Hamiltonian using data from a Hamiltonian with interactions disturbed by noise, motivated by the ground-state inference in quantum annealing on a noisy device. It is shown that the ground state is best inferred when the temperature of the noisy system is kept at a finite value, and not at zero temperature. We present a spin-glass generalization of a well-established result that the ground state of a purely ferromagnetic Hamiltonian is best inferred at a finite temperature when the original ferromagnetic interactions are disturbed by noise. We use the numerical transfer-matrix method to establish the existence of an optimal finite temperature in one- and two-dimensional systems. Our numerical results are supported by mean-field calculations, which give an explicit expression of the optimal temperature to infer the spin-glass ground state as a function of variances of the distributions of the original interactions and the noise. The mean-field prediction is in qualitative agreement with numerical data. Implications on post-processing of quantum annealing on a noisy device are discussed.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of carriers bound to helical tube surfaces is investigated in a thin-layer quantization scheme. By numerically solving the open-boundary Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation in curvilinear coordinates, geometric effect on the coherent transmission spectra is analysed in the case of single propagating mode as well as multimode. It is shown that, the coiling endows the helical nanotube with different transport properties from a bent cylindrical surface. Fano resonance appears as a purely geometric effect in the conductance, the corresponding energy of quasibound state is obviously influenced by the torsion and length of the nanotube. We also find new plateaus in the conductance. The transport of double-degenerate mode in this geometry is reminiscent of the Zeeman coupling between the magnetic field and spin angular momentum in quasi-one-dimensional structure.

abstract: We analyze the creation and emission of pairs of highly nonclassical microwave photons in a setup where a voltage-biased Josephson junction is connected in series to two electromagnetic oscillators. Tuning the external voltage such that the Josephson frequency equals the sum of the two mode frequencies, each tunneling Cooper pair creates one additional photon in both of the two oscillators. The time-resolved statistics of photon emission events from the two oscillators is investigated by means of single-oscillator and cross-oscillator variants of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and the waiting-time distribution $w(\tau)$. They provide insight into the strongly correlated quantum dynamics of the two oscillator subsystems and reveal a rich variety of quantum features of light including strong antibunching and the presence of negative values in the Wigner function.

We show that pseudo PT symmetry guarantees the reality of the quasi energy spectrum in our system.
