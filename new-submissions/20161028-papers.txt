abstract: Quantum mechanics admits correlations that cannot be explained by local realistic models. Those most studied are the standard local hidden variable models, which satisfy the well-known Bell inequalities. To date, most works have focused on bipartite entangled systems. Here, we consider correlations between three parties connected via two independent entangled states. We investigate the new type of so-called "bilocal" models, which correspondingly involve two independent hidden variables. Such models describe scenarios that naturally arise in quantum networks, where several independent entanglement sources are employed. Using photonic qubits, we build such a linear three-node quantum network and demonstrate non-bilocal correlations by violating a Bell-like inequality tailored for bilocal models. Furthermore, we show that the demonstration of non-bilocality is more noise-tolerant than that of standard Bell non-locality in our three-party quantum network.

abstract: A central question in quantum computation is to identify the resources that are responsible for quantum speed-up. Quantum contextuality has been recently shown to be a resource for quantum computation with magic states for odd-prime dimensional qudits and two-dimensional systems with real wavefunctions.The phenomenon of state-independent contextuality poses a priori an obstruction to characterizing the case of regular qubits, the fundamental building block of quantum computation. Here, we establish contextuality of magic states as a necessary resource for a large class of quantum computation schemes on qubits. We illustrate our result with a concrete scheme related to measurement-based quantum computation.

abstract: In this work we construct relativistic Lagrangian density for the AC and HMW topological phases by induced electric and magnetic dipoles and clarify some of the conditions for producing topological phases which have not been properly discussed in previous studies. We also found that in both cases, the topological phases are induced by the cross product of electric and magnetic fields in the form $\bm{B} \times \bm{E}$ which reinforces the dual nature of these two topological phases.

abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum theory based on incompatibility. Apart from the incompatible relation of quantum states, mutually exclusiveness is another remarkable phenomenon in the information-theoretic foundation of quantum theory. We investigate the role of mutual exclusive physical states in the recent work of stronger uncertainty relations for all incompatible observables by Mccone and Pati and generalize the weighted uncertainty relation to the product form as well as their multi-observable analogues. The new bounds capture both incompatibility and mutually exclusiveness, and are tighter compared with the existing bounds.

abstract: Quantum metrology with entangled states in realistic noisy environments always suffers from decoherence. Therefore, the measurement precision is greatly reduced. Here we applied the dynamical decoupling method to protect the $N$-qubit quantum metrology protocol and successfully revived the scaling of the measurement precision as ${N^{-k}}$ with $k\in \left[{5/6,11/12}\right]$. The degree of the precision revival, as determined by the noise spectrum distribution, indicates that the performance of the protected protocol can be further improved by controlling the noise spectrum. Such a protected protocol is proved to be universal for entanglement-based quantum metrology in the pure dephasing and relaxation noise, which should stimulate the development of practical quantum metrology for weak signal detection of microscopic physics.

abstract: The validity of the superposition principle and of Born's rule are well-accepted tenants of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, it has recently been predicted that the intensity pattern formed in a three-slit experiment is seemingly in contradiction with the predictions of the most conventional form of the superposition principle when exotic looped trajectories are taken into account. However, the probability of observing such paths is typically very small and thus rendering them extremely difficult to measure. In this work, we confirm the validity of Born's rule and present the first experimental observation of these exotic trajectories as additional paths for the light by directly measuring their contribution to the formation of optical interference fringes. We accomplish this by enhancing the electromagnetic near-fields in the vicinity of the slits through the excitation of surface plasmons. This process effectively increases the probability of occurrence of these exotic trajectories, demonstrating that they are related to the near-field component of the photon's wavefunction.

abstract: The no-cloning theorem states that an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned exactly and deterministically due to the linearity of quantum mechanics. Associated with this theorem is the quantitative no-cloning limit that sets an upper bound to the quality of the generated clones. However, this limit can be circumvented by abandoning determinism and using probabilistic methods. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of probabilistic cloning of arbitrary coherent states that clearly surpasses the no-cloning limit. Our scheme is based on a hybrid linear amplifier that combines an ideal deterministic linear amplifier with a heralded measurement-based noiseless amplifier. We demonstrate the production of up to five clones with the fidelity of each clone clearly exceeding the corresponding no-cloning limit. Moreover, since successful cloning events are heralded, our scheme has the potential to be adopted in quantum repeater, teleportation and computing applications.

abstract: We study the Ising Hamiltonian with a transverse field term to simulate the quantum annealing. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design the time dependence of the Hamiltonian. The dynamical invariant is obtained by the mean-field ansatz and the Hamiltonian is designed by the inverse engineering. We show that the time dependence of physical quantities such as the magnetization is independent of the speed of the Hamiltonian variation in the infinite-range model. We also show that rotating transverse magnetic fields are useful to achieve the ideal time evolution.

abstract: We investigate the role of coherence in the Grover search algorithm by using several typical measures of quantum coherence and quantum correlations. By using the relative entropy of coherence measure, we show that the success probability depends on the depletion of coherence. Explicitly, in the limit case of few searcher items j/N<<1 in large database N>>1, the cost performance about coherence in enhancing the success probability of Grover search is related to the ratio j/N. The same phenomenon can also be found by using the l1 norm of coherence, cost performance of coherence is inversely proportional to the scale of database N. In comparison, the behavior of quantum correlation measures, such as entanglement and discord, generally start from zero then reach the maximum and decrease to almost zero in the whole process of Grover search, the optimal success probability cannot be directly related with quantification of quantum correlation. Additionally, we find that quantum nonlocality does not appear in the Grover search since any two-qubit state does not violate CHSH type Bell inequality. Therefore, it is believed that the coherence can be viewed as a key resource for increasing the success probability in Grover search algorithm.

abstract: Many photonic quantum information processing applications would benefit from a high brightness, fiber-coupled source of triggered single photons. Here, we present a fiber-coupled photonic-crystal waveguide single-photon source relying on evanescent coupling of the light field from a tapered out-coupler to an optical fiber. A two-step approach is taken where the performance of the tapered out-coupler is recorded first on an independent device containing an on-chip reflector. Reflection measurements establish that the chip-to-fiber coupling efficiency exceeds 80 %. The detailed characterization of a high-efficiency photonic-crystal waveguide extended with a tapered out-coupling section is then performed. The corresponding overall single-photon source efficiency is 10.9 % $\pm$ 2.3 %, which quantifies the success probability to prepare an exciton in the quantum dot, couple it out as a photon in the waveguide, and subsequently transfer it to the fiber. The applied out-coupling method is robust, stable over time, and broadband over several tens of nanometers, which makes it a highly promising pathway to increase the efficiency and reliability of planar chip-based single-photon sources.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.08695
abstract: We propose a realistic scheme of generating a traveling odd Schr$\"o$dinger cat state and a generalized entangled coherent state in circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit-QED). A squeezed vacuum state is used as initial resource of nonclassical states, which can be created through a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier, and travels through a transmission line. Because a single-photon subtraction from the squeezed vacuum gives with very high fidelity an odd Schr$\"o$dinger cat state, we consider a specific circuit-QED setup consisting of the Josephson amplifier creating the traveling resource in a line, a beam-splitter coupling two transmission lines, and a single photon detector located at the end of the other line. When a single microwave photon is detected by measuring the excited state of a superconducting qubit in the detector, a heralded cat state is generated with high fidelity in the opposite line. For example, we show that the high fidelity of the outcome with the ideal cat state can be achieved with appropriate squeezing parameters theoretically. As its extended setup, we suggest that generalized entangled coherent states can be also built probabilistically and useful for microwave quantum information processing for error-correctable qudits in circuit-QED.

abstract: Rayleigh criterion has been continuously broken through with modern detecting instruments, many methods on resolving two emitters below the classical diffraction limit has been developed, one of these methods is detecting high order correlation functions of the emitters. We propose a method to resolve the single-photon emitters with only detecting the highest order correlation functions. We find that the variables that characterize the emitters are contained in the highest order correlation functions. Especially when there are more than two emitters, the spatial distribution of the emitters can be deduced only from the highest order correlation functions, which gives a new vision and a new method on beating classical diffraction limit using high order correlation functions.

abstract: The theory of quantum optomechanics is reconstructed from first principles by finding a Lagrangian from light's equation of motion and then proceeding to the Hamiltonian. The nonlinear terms, including the quadratic and higher-order interactions, do not vanish under any possible choice of canonical parameters, and lead to coupling of momentum and field. The existence of quadratic mechanical parametric interaction is then demonstrated rigorously, which has been so far assumed phenomenologically in previous studies. Corrections to the quadratic terms are particularly significant when the mechanical frequency is of the same order or larger than the electromagnetic frequency. Further discussions on the squeezing as well as relativistic corrections are presented.

As a byproduct a novel quantitative inequality between compatible observable and channel is presented.

Knowledge of $\chi(\eta)$ allows only the determination of the time development of arbitrary functions of equal-time products of creation and annihilation photon operators. We calculate, in particular, the fluctuations in photon number, quadrature operators, and quadrature variance. We contrast the very important difference between the nonclassicality criteria based on the one-time characteristic function $\chi(\eta)$ versus nonclassicality criteria based on the two-time, second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and show numerically that the nonclassicality criteria based on $\chi(\eta)$ does not determine the classical/nonclassical behavior of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.

In particular, we contrast criteria that involve only one-time functions of the dynamical system, for instance, the quasiprobability distribution $P(\beta)$ of the Glauber-Sudarshan coherent or P-representation of the density of state and the Mandel $Q_{M}(\tau)$ parameter, versus the criteria associated with the two-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.

abstract: Entanglement criteria for a bipartite quantum system with continuous variables are formulated in terms of R\'{e}nyi entropies. R\'{e}nyi entropies are widely used as a good information measure due to many nice properties. Derived entanglement criteria are based on several mathematical results such as the Hausdorff-Young inequality, Young's inequality for convolution and its converse. From the historical viewpoint, the formulations of these results with sharp constants were obtained comparatively recently. Using the position and momentum observables of subsystems, one can build two total-system measurements with the following property. For product states, the final density in each global measurement appears as a convolution of local densities. Hence, restrictions in terms of two R\'{e}nyi entropies with constrained entropic indices are formulated for separable states. Experimental results are typically sampled into bins between prescribed discrete points. For these aims, we give appropriate reformulations of the derived entanglement criteria.

abstract: Quantum Hamiltonian identification is important for characterizing the dynamics of quantum systems, calibrating quantum devices and achieving precise quantum control. In this paper, an effective two-step optimization (TSO) quantum Hamiltonian identification algorithm is developed within the framework of quantum process tomography. In the identification method, different probe states are inputted into quantum systems and the output states are estimated using the quantum state tomography protocol via linear regression estimation. The time-independent system Hamiltonian is reconstructed based on the experimental data for the output states. The Hamiltonian identification method has computational complexity O(d^6) where d is the dimension of the system Hamiltonian. An error upper bound O(d^3/N^(1/2))$ is also established, where N is the resource number for the tomography of each output state, and several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TSO Hamiltonian identification method.

abstract: We obtain continuity bounds for basic information characteristics of quantum channels depending on their input dimension (when it is finite) and on the maximal level of input energy (when the input dimension is infinite). First we prove continuity bounds for the output conditional mutual information for a single channel and for $n$ copies of a channel. Then we obtain estimates for variation of the output Holevo quantity with respect to simultaneous variations of a channel and of an input ensemble. As a result tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for basic capacities of quantum channels depending on the input dimension are obtained. They complement the Leung-Smith continuity bounds depending on the output dimension. Finally, continuity bounds for basic capacities of infinite-dimensional channels with the input energy constraints are proved. They show uniform continuity of these capacities on the set of all channels with respect to the norm of complete boundedness.

abstract: The work distribution is a fundamental quantity in nonequilibrium thermodynamics mainly due to its connection with fluctuations theorems. Here we develop a semiclassical approximation to the work distribution for a quench process in chaotic systems. The approach is based on the dephasing representation of the quantum Loschmidt echo and on the quantum ergodic conjecture, which states that the Wigner function of a typical eigenstate of a classically chaotic Hamiltonian is equidistributed on the energy shell. We show that our semiclassical approximation is accurate in describing the quantum distribution as we increase the temperature. Moreover, we also show that this semiclassical approximation provides a link between the quantum and classical work distributions.

abstract: Dynamical polarization of nuclear spin ensembles is of central importance for magnetic resonance studies, precision sensing and for applications in quantum information theory. Here we propose a scheme to generate long-lived singlet pairs in an unpolarized nuclear spin ensemble which is dipolar coupled to the electron spins of a Nitrogen Vacancy center in diamond. The quantum mechanical back-action induced by frequent spin-selective readout of the NV centers allows the nuclear spins to pair up into maximally entangled singlet pairs. Counterintuitively, the robustness of the pair formation to dephasing noise improves with increasing size of the spin ensemble. We also show how the paired nuclear spin state allows for enhanced sensing capabilities of NV centers in diamond.

By employing this fidelity, we derive an improved bound for quantum speed limit time in open quantum systems in which the initial states can be chosen as either pure or mixed. This bound leads to the well-known Mandelstamm-Tamm type bound for nonunitary dynamics in the case of initial pure states. However, in the case of initial mixed states, the bound provided by the introduced fidelity is tighter and sharper than the obtained bounds in the previous works.

abstract: The derivation of path integrals is reconsidered. It is shown that the expression for the discretized action is not unique, and the path integration domain can be deformed so that at least Gaussian path integrals become probabillistic. This leads to a practical algorithm of sign-problem-free Monte Carlo sampling from the Gaussian path integrals. Moreover, the dynamical influence of Gaussian quantum system (the bath) on any other quantum system can be exactly represented as interaction with classical non-Markovian noise. We discuss the relation of these findings to the Bell's theorem and the Feynman's conjecture on the exponential complexity of the classical simulation of quantum systems. In Feynman's path integral we have quasiprobability distributions for trajectories, and in analitycally continued path integrals we have probability distributions for quasitrajectories.

abstract: Area laws were first discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, who found that the entropy of a black hole grows proportional to its surface area, and not its volume. Entropy area laws have since become a fundamental part of modern physics, from the holographic principle in quantum gravity to ground state wavefunctions of quantum matter, where entanglement entropy is generically found to obey area law scaling. As no experiments are currently capable of directly probing the entanglement area law in naturally occurring many-body systems, evidence of its existence is based on studies of simplified theories. Using new exact microscopic numerical simulations of superfluid $^4$He, we demonstrate for the first time an area law scaling of entanglement entropy in a real quantum liquid in three dimensions. We validate the fundamental principles underlying its physical origin, and present an "entanglement equation of state" showing how it depends on the density of the superfluid.

Numerical results for the particle number density as a function of chemical potential are presented.

abstract: A solid state emitter coupled to a photonic crystal cavity exhibits increased photon emission into a single frequency mode. However, current designs for photonic crystal cavities coupled to quantum emitters have three main problems: emitters are placed near surfaces that can degrade their optical properties, the cavity fluorescence cannot be collected into a single useful mode for further routing, and post-fabrication tuning is not currently possible in a stable and reversible manner for each node individually. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid cavity design with minimal fabrication of the host material that keeps the emitter $\geq100\,$nm from all surfaces. This cavity has an unloaded quality factor ($Q$) larger than $1\times10^6$ and a loaded $Q$ of $5.5\times10^4$ with more than 75% of the emission coupled directly into an underlying photonic integrated circuit built from a convenient material that provides low loss waveguides. Finally this design can be actively and reversibly tuned onto resonance with the emitter, allowing tuning over more than 10 times the cavity linewidth while maintaining $\geq50$% of the $Q$ factor with no effects to other cavities on the same chip.
