abstract: A major challenge in optical quantum processing is implementing large, stable interferometers. Here we propose a virtual, measurement-based interferometer that is programmed on the fly solely by the choice of homodyne measurement angles. The effects of finite squeezing are captured as uniform amplitude damping. We compare our proposal to existing (physical) interferometers and consider its performance for BosonSampling, which could demonstrate post-classical computational power in the near future. We prove its efficiency in time and squeezing (energy) in this setting.

abstract: We propose a new method to create two-photon states in a controllable way using interaction between the Rydberg atoms during the storage and retrieval of slow light. A distinctive feature of the suggested procedure is that the slow light is stored into a superposition of two atomic coherences under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Interaction between the atoms during the storage period creates entangled pairs of atoms in a superposition state that is orthogonal to the initially stored state. Restoring the slow light from this new atomic state one can produce a two photon state with a second-order correlation function determined by the atom-atom interaction and the storage time. Therefore the measurement of the restored light allows one to probe the atom-atom coupling by optical means with a sensitivity that can be increased by extending the storage time. As a realization of this idea we consider a many-body Ramsey-type technique which involves pi/2 pulses creating a superposition of Rydberg states at the beginning and the end of the storage period. In that case the regenerated light is due to the resonance dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms in the Rydberg states.

abstract: We obtain the multiple-parameter quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for estimating the Cartesian components of the centroid and separation of two incoherent optical point sources using an imaging system with finite spatial bandwidth. Under quite general and realistic assumptions on the point-spread function of the imaging system, and for weak source strengths, we show that the Cram\'er-Rao bounds for the x and y components of the separation are independent of the values of those components, which may be well-below the conventional Rayleigh resolution limit. We also propose two linear optics-based measurement methods that approach the quantum bound for the estimation of the Cartesian components of the separation once the centroid has been located. One of the methods is an interferometric scheme that approaches the quantum bound for sub-Rayleigh separations. The other method uses fiber coupling to attain the bound regardless of the distance between the two sources.

abstract: We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density operators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization procedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the tensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states possessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For mixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and characterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like finite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the main result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated to the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the bulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011.

abstract: We investigate the effect of spatial disorder on the edge states localized at the interface between two topologically different regions. Rotation disorder can localize the quantum walk if it is strong enough to change the topology, otherwise the edge state is protected. Nonlinear spatial disorder, dependent on the walker's state, attracts the walk to the interface even for very large coupling, preserving the ballistic transport characteristic of the clean regime.

abstract: The resonator-induced phase (RIP) gate is a multi-qubit entangling gate that allows a high degree of flexibility in qubit frequencies, making it attractive for quantum operations in large-scale architectures. We experimentally realize the RIP gate with four superconducting qubits in a three-dimensional (3D) circuit-quantum electrodynamics architecture, demonstrating high-fidelity controlled-Z (CZ) gates between all possible pairs of qubits from two different 4-qubit devices in pair subspaces. These qubits are arranged within a wide range of frequency detunings, up to as large as 1.8 GHz. We further show a dynamical multi-qubit refocusing scheme in order to isolate out 2-qubit interactions, and combine them to generate a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.

abstract: We measure multi-time correlation functions of a set of Pauli operators on a two-level system, which can be used to retrieve its associated linear response functions. The two-level system is an effective spin constructed from the nuclear spins of $^{1}$H atoms in a solution of $^{13}$C-labeled chloroform. Response functions characterize the linear response of the system to a family of perturbations, allowing us to compute physical quantities such as the magnetic susceptibility of the effective spin. We use techniques exported from quantum information to measure time correlations on the two-level system. This approach requires the use of an ancillary qubit encoded in the nuclear spins of the $^{13}$C atoms and a sequence of controlled operations. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of such a quantum platform to compute time-correlation functions of arbitrary order, which relate to higher-order corrections of perturbative methods. Particularly, we show three-time correlation functions for arbitrary times, and we also measure time correlation functions at fixed times up to tenth order.

abstract: Intense spatio-spectral twin beams generated in the regime with pump depletion are analyzed applying a suggested quantum model that treats the signal, idler and pump fields in the same way. The model assumes the signal and idler fields in the form of the generalized superposition of signal and noise and reveals nonzero signal coherent components in both fields, contrary to the models developed earlier. The influence of coherent components on the properties of intense twin beams is elucidated. The interference pattern formed in the process of sum-frequency generation and that of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer are shown to be able to experimentally confirm the presence of coherent components.

By increasing the size of the sample of event-ready detections, one can exhibit in the experimental data a violation of the no-signaling principle with a statistical significance at least similar to that of the reported violation of the CHSH inequality, if not stronger.

abstract: There are two general requirements to harness the computational power of quantum mechanics: the ability to manipulate the evolution of an isolated system and the ability to faithfully extract information from it. Quantum error correction and simulation often make a more exacting demand: the ability to perform non-destructive measurements of specific correlations within that system. We realize such measurements by employing a protocol adapted from [S. Nigg and S. M. Girvin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 243604 (2013)], enabling real-time selection of arbitrary register-wide Pauli operators. Our implementation consists of a simple circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) module of four highly-coherent 3D transmon qubits, collectively coupled to a high-Q superconducting microwave cavity. As a demonstration, we enact all seven nontrivial subset-parity measurements on our three-qubit register. For each we fully characterize the realized measurement by analyzing the detector (observable operators) via quantum detector tomography and by analyzing the quantum back-action via conditioned process tomography. No single quantity completely encapsulates the performance of a measurement, and standard figures of merit have not yet emerged. Accordingly, we consider several new fidelity measures for both the detector and the complete measurement process. We measure all of these quantities and report high fidelities, indicating that we are measuring the desired quantities precisely and that the measurements are highly non-demolition. We further show that both results are improved significantly by an additional error-heralding measurement. The analyses presented here form a useful basis for the future characterization and validation of quantum measurements, anticipating the demands of emerging quantum technologies.

title: Generalized gradient expansion for inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory: Application to ultracold atoms in a harmonic trap

abstract: We develop a generalized gradient expansion of the inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory method for determining properties of ultracold atoms in a trap. This approach goes beyond the well-known local density approximation and at higher temperatures, in the normal phase, it shows why the local density approximation works so well, since the local density and generalized gradient approximations are essentially indistinguishable from each other (and from the exact solution within full inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory). But because the generalized gradient expansion only involves nearest-neighbor corrections, it does not work as well at low temperatures, when the systems enter into ordered phases. This is primarily due to the problem that ordered phases often satisfy some global constraints which determine the spatial ordering pattern, and the local density and generalized gradient approximations are not able to impose those kinds of constraints; they also overestimate the tendency to order. The theory is applied to phase separation of different mass fermionic mixtures represented by the Falicov-Kimball model and to determining the entropy per particle of a fermionic system represented by the Hubbard model. The generalized gradient approximation is a useful diagnostic for the accuracy of the local density approximation---when both methods agree, they are likely accurate, when they disagree, neither is likely to be correct.

abstract: In this paper we study the recently proposed tensor networks/AdS correspondence. We found that the Coxeter group is a useful tool to describe tensor networks in a negatively curved space. Study- ing generic tensor network populated by perfect tensors, we find that the physical wave function generically do not admit any connected correlation functions of local operators. To remedy the problem, we assume that wavefunctions admitting such semi-classical gravitational interpretation are composed of tensors close to, but not exactly perfect tensors. Computing corrections to the connected two point correlation functions, the leading contribution is given by structures related to geodesics connecting the operators inserted at the boundary physical dofs. Such considerations admits generalizations at least to three point functions. This is highly suggestive of the emergence of the analogues of Witten diagrams in the tensor network. The perturbations alone however do not give the right entanglement spectrum. Using the Coxeter construction, we also constructed the tensor network counterpart of the BTZ black hole, by orbifolding the discrete lattice on which the network resides. We found that the construction naturally reproduces some of the salient features of the BTZ black hole, such as the appearance of RT surfaces that could wrap the horizon, depending on the size of the entanglement region A.

abstract: In this work we present a general construction of integrable models for boson tunneling in multi-well systems. We show how the models may be derived through the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and solved by algebraic Bethe ansatz means. From the transfer matrix we find only two conserved operators. However, we construct additional conserved operators through a different method. As a consequence the models admit multiple pseudovacua, each associated to a set of Bethe ansatz equations. We show that all sets of Bethe ansatz equations are needed to obtain a complete set of eigenstates.
