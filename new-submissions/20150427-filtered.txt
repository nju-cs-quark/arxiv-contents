abstract: The present paper treats the period T_N of the Hadamard walk on a cycle C_N with N vertices. Dukes (2014) considered the periodicity of more general quantum walks on C_N and showed T_2 =2, T_4=8, T_8=24 for the Hadamard walk case. We prove that the Hadamard walk does not have any period except for his case, i.e., N=2, 4, 8. Our method is based on a path counting and cyclotomic polynomials which is different from his approach based on the property of eigenvalues for unitary matrix that determines the evolution of the walk.

abstract: We give an explicit entropy production formula for a class of quantum Markov semigroups, arising in the weak coupling limit of a system coupled with reservoirs, whose generators $\mathcal{L}$ are sums of other generators $\mathcal{L}_\omega$ associated with positive Bohr frequencies $\omega$ of the system. As a consequence, we show that any such semigroup satisfies the quantum detailed balance condition with respect to an invariant state if and only if all semigroups generated by each $\mathcal{L}_\omega$ so do with respect to the same invariant state.

abstract: We establish a connection between non-Markovian memory effects and thermodynamical quantities such as work. We show how memory effects can be interpreted as revivals of work that can be extracted from a quantum system. We prove that non-Markovianity may allow an increase in the extractable work even when the entropy of the system is increasing. Our results have important implications both in quantum thermodynamics and in quantum information theory. In the former context they pave the way to the understanding of concepts like work in a non-Markovian open system scenario. In the latter context they lead to interesting consequences for quantum state merging protocols in presence of noise.

abstract: We introduce a density matrix decomposition of a multipartite quantum system of a finite dimension into two density matrices: a separable one and an essentially entangled one, which contains no product states components. This convex decomposition can be achieved in practice with the help of an algorithm based on linear programming, which in the general case scales polynomially with the dimension of the system. We prove that the rank of the essentially entangled component is always lower than that of the initial density matrix and we give an upper bound for this rank. We illustrate the algorithm at an example of a composed system of total dimension 12 undergoing loss of coherence due to classical noise and we trace the time evolution of its essentially entangled component. We suggest a geometric description of entanglement dynamics and show how it explains the well-known phenomena of sudden death and revival of multipartite entanglement. Interestingly, while we observe a weight loss of the essentially entangled component with time, its average entanglement content is not affected by the coherence loss.
