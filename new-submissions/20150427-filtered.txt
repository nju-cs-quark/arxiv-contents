abstract: The present paper treats the period T_N of the Hadamard walk on a cycle C_N with N vertices. Dukes (2014) considered the periodicity of more general quantum walks on C_N and showed T_2 =2, T_4=8, T_8=24 for the Hadamard walk case. We prove that the Hadamard walk does not have any period except for his case, i.e., N=2, 4, 8. Our method is based on a path counting and cyclotomic polynomials which is different from his approach based on the property of eigenvalues for unitary matrix that determines the evolution of the walk.
