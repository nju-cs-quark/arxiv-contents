abstract: The factorization method is used to construct two different spectrum generating algebras for the radial oscillator. The states are classified in hierarchies according to either the orbital angular momentum or the energy. It is shown that the Lie groups SU(1,1) and SU(2) are the dynamical groups of the definite orbital angular momentum and definite energy hierarchies respectively. Different representation spaces of finite dimension are constructed in the latter case. The generators of the Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2) are expressed in the Schwinger representation and the corresponding generalized coherent states are constructed. It is shown that squeezing occurs in terms of the complex parameter that labels the coherent states.

abstract: We present a source of polarization entangled photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric downconversion engineered for frequency uncorrelated telecom photon generation. Our source provides photon pairs that display, simultaneously, the key properties for high-performance quantum information and fundamental quantum science tasks. Specifically, the source provides for high heralding efficiency, high quantum state purity and high entangled state fidelity at the same time. Among different tests we apply to our source we observe almost perfect non-classical interference between photons from independent sources with a visibility of $(100\pm5)\%$.

abstract: Suppose a quantum system starts to evolve under a Hamiltonian from some initial state. When for the first time, will an observable attain a preassigned value? To answer this question, one method often adopted is to make instantaneous measurements periodically and note down the serial number for which the desired result is obtained for the first time. We apply this protocol to an interacting spin system at zero temperature and show analytically that the response of this system shows a non-analyticity as a function of the parameter of the Hamiltonian and the time interval of measurement. In contrast to quantum phase transitions, this new type of phase transition is not a property of the ground state and arises from the Hamiltonian dynamics and quantum mechanical nature of the measurement. The specific system studied is transverse Ising chain and the measurement performed is, whether the total transverse magnetic moment (per site) is not equal to 1. The results for some other types of measurement is also discussed.

abstract: We demonstrate the violation of an EPR steering inequality developed for single photon path entanglement with displacement-based detection. We use a high-rate source of heralded single-photon path-entangled states, combined with high-efficiency superconducting-based detectors, in a scheme that is free of any post-selection and thus immune to the detection loophole. This result conclusively demonstrates single-photon entanglement in a one-sided device-independent scenario, and opens the way towards implementations of device-independent quantum technologies within the paradigm of path entanglement.

abstract: Enhanced Raman scattering can be obtained by injecting a seeded light field which is correlated with the initially prepared collective atomic excitation. This Raman amplification process can be used to realize atom-light hybrid interferometer. We numerically calculate the phase sensitivities and the signal-to-noise ratios of this interferometer with the method of homodyne detection and intensity detection, and give their differences between this two methods. In the presence of loss of light field and atomic decoherence the measure precision will be reduced which can be explained by the break of the intermode decorrelation conditions of output modes

abstract: We investigate the resonant quantum dynamics of a multi-qubit ensemble in a microcavity. Both the quantum-dot subsystem and the microcavity mode are pumped coherently. We found that the microcavity photon statistics depends on the phase difference of the driving lasers which is not the case for the photon intensity at resonant driving. This way, one can manipulate the two-photon correlations. In particular, higher degrees of photon correlations and, eventually, stronger intensities are obtained. Furthermore, the microcavity photon statistics exhibits steady-state oscillatory behaviors as well as asymmetries.

abstract: Memory-assisted measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MA-MDI-QKD) has recently been proposed as a possible intermediate step towards the realization of quantum repeaters. Despite its relaxing some of the requirements on quantum memories, the choice of memory in relation to the layout of the setup and the protocol has a stark e?ect on our ability to beat existing no-memory systems. Here, a variant of MA-MDI-QKD that relies on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers as its quantum memories is proposed. We particularly focus on the cavity-enhanced NV centers and show that, in terms of the secret key rate per transmitted pulse, we can beat the existing no-memory QKD systems by up to three orders of magnitude. Using system parameters achievable by the today's state of the art, we then anticipate some total key rate advantage in the distance range between 300 km and 500 km. Our analysis accounts for major sources of error including the dark current, the channel loss, and the decoherence of the quantum memories.

abstract: We report on the measurement of the time required for a wave packet to tunnel through the potential barriers of an optical lattice. The experiment is carried out by loading adiabatically a Bose-Einstein condensate into a 1D optical lattice. A sudden displacement of the lattice by a few tens of nm excites the micromotion of the dipole mode. We then directly observe in momentum space the splitting of the wave packet at the turning points and measure the delay between the reflected and the tunneled packets for various initial displacements. Using this atomic beam splitter twice, we realize a chain of coherent micron-size Mach-Zehnder interferometers at the exit of which we get essentially a wave packet with a negative momentum, a result opposite to the prediction of classical physics.

abstract: In this work we study the entanglement entropy of a uniform quantum Ising chain in transverse field undergoing a periodic driving of period $\tau$. By means of Floquet theory we show that, for any subchain, the entanglement entropy tends asymptotically to a value $\tau$-periodic in time. We provide a semi-analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic value: It is constant in time and obeys a volume law. The asymptotic value is always smaller than the thermal one. Because of integrability the system does not thermalize locally, but relaxes to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Remarkably, the asymptotic entropy shows marked features in correspondence to some non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions undergone by a Floquet state analog of the ground state.

abstract: We introduce a general class of su$(1|1)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interactions which includes as particular cases the su$(1|1)$ Inozemtsev (elliptic) and Haldane-Shastry chains, as well as the XX model. We show that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of the algebraic properties of the su$(1|1)$ permutation operator, and take advantage of this fact to analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential term is present in the Hamiltonian. We first study the low energy excitations and the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$ when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\mathcal E(\pi))$, $\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation. We also analyze the von Neumann and R\'enyi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that they exhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins characteristic of a one-boson $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show that the models under study are quantum critical when the chemical potential belongs to the critical interval, with central charge $c=1$. From the analysis of the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a quantum phase transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further confirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which is studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the su$(1|1)$ elliptic chain.

abstract: We provide a new method for estimating spectral gaps in low-dimensional systems. Unlike traditional phase estimation, our approach does not require ancillary qubits nor does it require well characterised gates. Instead, it only requires the ability to perform approximate Haar-random unitary operations, applying the unitary whose eigenspectrum is sought out and performing measurements in the computational basis. We discuss application of these ideas to in-place amplitude estimation and quantum device calibration.

abstract: Quantum walks are a promising framework that can be used to both understand and implement quantum information processing tasks. The quantum stochastic walk is a recently developed framework that combines the concept of a quantum walk with that of a classical random walk, through open system evolution of a quantum system. Quantum stochastic walks have been shown to have applications in as far reaching fields as artificial intelligence. However, there are significant constraints on the kind of open system evolutions that can be realized in a physical experiment. In this work, we discuss the restrictions on the allowed open system evolution, and the physical assumptions underpinning them. We show that general implementations would require the complete solution of the underlying unitary dynamics, and sophisticated reservoir engineering, thus weakening the benefits of experimental investigations.

abstract: The quantum max-flow min-cut conjecture relates the rank of a tensor network to the minimum cut in the case that all tensors in the network are identical\cite{mfmc1}. This conjecture was shown to be false in Ref. \onlinecite{mfmc2} by an explicit counter-example. Here, we show that the conjecture is almost true, in that the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut converges to $1$ as the dimension $N$ of the degrees of freedom on the edges of the network tends to infinity. The proof is based on estimating moments of the singular values of the network. We introduce a generalization of "rainbow diagrams"\cite{rainbow} to tensor networks to estimate the dominant diagrams. A direct comparison of second and fourth moments lower bounds the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut by a constant. To show the tighter bound that the ratio tends to $1$, we consider higher moments. In addition, we show that the limiting moments as $N \rightarrow \infty$ agree with that in a different ensemble where tensors in the network are chosen independently, this is used to show that the distributions of singular values in the two different ensembles weakly converge to the same limiting distribution. We present also a numerical study of one particular tensor network, which shows a surprising dependence of the rank deficit on $N \mod 4$ and suggests further conjecture on the limiting behavior of the rank.

abstract: Quantum photonic chips, which integrate quantum light sources alongside active and passive optical elements, as well as single photon detectors, show great potential for photonic quantum information processing and quantum technology. Mature semiconductor nanofabrication processes allow for scaling such photonic integrated circuits to on-chip networks of increasing complexity. Second order nonlinear materials are the method of choice for generating photonic quantum states in the overwhelming part of linear optic experiments using bulk components but integration with waveguide circuitry on a nanophotonic chip proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate such an on-chip parametric down-conversion source of photon pairs based on second order nonlinearity in an Aluminum nitride microring resonator. We show the potential of our source for quantum information processing by measuring high-visibility antibunching of heralded single photons with nearly ideal state purity. Our down conversion source operates with high brightness and low noise, yielding pairs of correlated photons at MHz-rates with high coincidence-to-accidental ratio. The generated photon pairs are spectrally far separated from the pump field, providing good potential for realizing sufficient on-chip filtering and monolithic integration of quantum light sources, waveguide circuits and single photon detectors.

abstract: Entangling two remote quantum systems which never interact directly is an essential primitive in quantum information science. In quantum optics, remote entanglement experiments provides one approach for loophole-free tests of quantum non-locality and form the basis for the modular architecture of quantum computing. In these experiments, the two qubits, Alice and Bob, are each first entangled with a traveling photon. Subsequently, the two photons paths interfere on a beam-splitter before being directed to single-photon detectors. Such concurrent remote entanglement protocols using discrete Fock states can be made robust to photon losses, unlike schemes that rely on continuous variable states. This robustness arises from heralding the entanglement on the detection of events which can be selected for their unambiguity. However, efficiently detecting single photons is challenging in the domain of superconducting quantum circuits because of the low energy of microwave quanta. Here, we report the realization of a novel microwave photon detector implemented in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) framework of superconducting quantum information, and the demonstration, with this detector, of a robust form of concurrent remote entanglement. Our experiment opens the way for the implementation of the modular architecture of quantum computation with superconducting qubits.

abstract: Quantum annealing aims to exploit quantum mechanics to speed up the solution to optimization problems. Most problems exhibit complete connectivity between the logical spin variables after they are mapped to the Ising spin Hamiltonian of quantum annealing. To account for hardware constraints of current and future physical quantum annealers, methods enabling the embedding of fully connected graphs of logical spins into a constant-degree graph of physical spins are therefore essential. Here, we compare the recently proposed embedding scheme for quantum annealing with all-to-all connectivity due to Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) [Science Advances 1 (2015)] to the commonly used minor embedding (ME) scheme. Using both simulated quantum annealing and parallel tempering simulations, we find that for a set of instances randomly chosen from a class of fully connected, random Ising problems, the ME scheme outperforms the LHZ scheme when using identical simulation parameters, despite the fault tolerance of the latter to weakly correlated spin-flip noise. This result persists even after we introduce several decoding strategies for the LHZ scheme, including a minimum-weight decoding algorithm that results in substantially improved performance over the original LHZ scheme. We explain the better performance of the ME scheme in terms of more efficient spin updates, which allows it to better tolerate the correlated spin-flip errors that arise in our model of quantum annealing. Our results leave open the question of whether the performance of the two embedding schemes can be improved using scheme-specific parameters and new error correction approaches.

abstract: We study nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with a quantum generalization of broadcasts. We show that, with number-in-hand classical inputs, the communication complexity of a Boolean function in this communication model equals the logarithm of the support rank of the corresponding tensor, whereas the approximation complexity in this model equals the logarithm of the border support rank. This characterisation allows us to prove a log-rank conjecture posed by Villagra et al. for nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with message-passing. The support rank characterization of the communication model connects quantum communication complexity intimately to the theory of asymptotic entanglement transformation and algebraic complexity theory. In this context, we introduce the graphwise equality problem. For a cycle graph, the complexity of this communication problem is closely related to the complexity of the computational problem of multiplying matrices, or more precisely, it equals the logarithm of the asymptotic support rank of the iterated matrix multiplication tensor. We employ Strassen's laser method to show that asymptotically there exist nontrivial protocols for every odd-player cyclic equality problem. We exhibit an efficient protocol for the 5-player problem for small inputs, and we show how Young flattenings yield nontrivial complexity lower bounds.

abstract: To exploit a given physical system for quantum information processing, it is critical to understand the different types of noise affecting quantum control. The ability to distinguish coherent and incoherent error is extremely useful, as these errors contribute differently to the fault tolerance threshold, but coherent error is generally easier to reduce at the hardware level. In this work, we characterize the quantum control of a single (ensemble) qubit via solid-state pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR). We use randomized benchmarking (RB) together with purity benchmarking (PB) to quantify the total error and the incoherent error in a set of Clifford gates. The lowest error rates are achieved when the transfer function of the pulsed ESR control system is carefully accounted for, and we find that incoherent errors make up the majority of the total error. The robustness of RB to gate-dependent noise is investigated by using gate-set tomography and numerical simulations, where it is found that RB and PB are surprisingly robust.

abstract: The role of Coulomb disorder is analysed in the Anderson-Falicov-Kimball model. Phase diagrams of correlated and disordered electron systems are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory applied to the Bethe lattice, in which metal-insulator transitions led by structural and Coulomb disorders and correlation can be identified. Metallic, Mott insulator, and Anderson insulator phases, as well as the crossover between them are studied in this perspective. We show that Coulomb disorder has a relevant role in the phase-transition behavior as the system is led towards the insulator regime.

abstract: Focused MeV ion microbeams are suitable tools for the direct writing of conductive graphitic channels buried in an insulating diamond bulk, as demonstrated in previous works with the fabrication of multi-electrode ionizing radiation detectors and cellular biosensors. In this work we investigate the suitability of the fabrication method for the electrical excitation of colour centres in diamond. Differently from photoluminescence, electroluminescence requires an electrical current flowing through the diamond sub-gap states for the excitation of the colour centres. With this purpose, buried graphitic electrodes with a spacing of 10 micrometers were fabricated in the bulk of a detector-grade CVD single-crystal diamond sample using a scanning 1.8 MeV He micro-beam. The current flowing in the gap region between the electrodes upon the application of a 250 V bias voltage was exploited as the excitation pump for the electroluminescence of different types of colour centres localized in the above-mentioned gap. The bright light emission was spatially mapped using a confocal optical microscopy setup. The spectral analysis of electroluminescence revealed the emission from neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centres ($NV^0$, $\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 575 nm), as well as from cluster crystal dislocations (A-band, {\lambda} = 400-500 nm). Moreover, an electroluminescence signal with appealing spectral features (sharp emission at room temperature, low phonon sidebands) from He-related defects was detected ($\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 536.3 nm, $\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 560.5 nm); a low and broad peak around {\lambda} = 740 nm was also observed and tentatively ascribed to Si-V or GR1 centres. These results pose interesting future perspectives for the fabrication of electrically-stimulated single-photon emitters in diamond for applications in quantum optics and quantum cryptography.

abstract: Focused MeV ion beams with micrometric resolution are suitable tools for the direct writing of conductive graphitic channels buried in an insulating diamond bulk. Their effectiveness has been shown for the fabrication of multi-electrode ionizing radiation detectors and cellular biosensors. In this work we investigate such fabrication method for the electrical excitation of color centers in diamond. Differently from optically-stimulated light emission from color centers in diamond, electroluminescence (EL) requires a high current flowing in the diamond subgap states between the electrodes. With this purpose, buried graphitic electrode pairs with a spacing of 10 $\mu$m were fabricated in the bulk of a single-crystal diamond sample using a 6 MeV C microbeam. The electrical characterization of the structure showed a significant current above an effective voltage threshold of 150V, which was interpreted according to the theory of Space Charge Limited Current. The EL imaging allowed to identify the electroluminescent regions and the residual vacancy distribution associated with the fabrication technique. Measurements evidenced bright electroluminescent emission from native neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centers ($NV^0$); the acquired spectra highlighted the absence of EL associated with radiation damage.

abstract: We report on the fabrication and characterization of a single-crystal diamond device for the electrical stimula- tion of light emission from nitrogen-vacancy (NV0) and other defect-related centers. Pairs of sub-superficial graphitic micro-electrodes embedded in insulating diamond were fabricated by a 6 MeV C3+ micro-beam irra- diation followed by thermal annealing. A photoluminescence (PL) characterization evidenced a low radiation damage concentration in the inter-electrode gap region, which did not significantly affect the PL features domi- nated by NV centers. The operation of the device in electroluminescence (EL) regime was investigated by ap- plying a bias voltage at the graphitic electrodes, resulting in the injection of a high excitation current above a threshold voltage (~300V), which effectively stimulated an intense EL emission from NV0 centers. In addition, we report on the new observation of two additional sharp EL emission lines (at 563 nm and 580 nm) related to interstitial defects formed during MeV ion beam fabrication.

abstract: A new, so called odd Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible covariant tensor representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n). The related Gel'fand-Zetlin patterns are based upon the decomposition according to a particular chain of subalgebras of gl(n|n). This chain contains only genuine Lie superalgebras of type gl(k|l) with k and l nonzero (apart from the final element of the chain which is gl(1|0)=gl(1)). Explicit expressions for a set of generators of the algebra on this Gel'fand-Zetlin basis are determined. The results are extended to an explicit construction of a class of irreducible highest weight modules of the general linear Lie superalgebra gl(\infty|\infty).

abstract: Hysteresis can be found in driven many-body systems such as magnets and superfluids. Rate-dependent hysteresis arises when a system is driven periodically while relaxing towards equilibrium. A two-state paramagnet driven by an oscillating magnetic field in the relaxation approximation clearly demonstrates rate-dependent hysteresis. A noninteracting atomic Fermi gas in an optical ring potential, when driven by a periodic artificial gauge field and subjected to dissipation, is shown to exhibit hysteresis loops of atomic current due to a competition of the driving time and the relaxation time. This is in contrast to electronic systems exhibiting equilibrium persistent current driven by magnetic flux due to rapid relaxation. Universal behavior of the dissipated energy in one hysteresis loop is observed in both the magnetic and atomic systems, showing linear and inverse-linear dependence on the relaxation time in the strong and weak dissipation regimes. While interactions in general invalidate the framework for rate-dependent hysteresis, an atomic Fermi gas with artificial spin-orbit coupling exhibits hysteresis loops of atomic currents. Cold-atoms in ring-shape potentials are thus promising in demonstrating rate-dependent hysteresis and its associated phenomena.

abstract: We critically discuss the measure of very short time intervals. By means of a Gedankenexperiment, we describe an ideal clock based on the occurrence of completely random events. Many previous thought experiments have suggested fundamental Planck-scale limits on measurements of distance and time. Here we present a new type of thought experiment, based on a different type of clock, that provide further support for the existence of such limits. We show that the minimum time interval $\Delta t$ that this clock can measure scales as the inverse of its size $\Delta r$. This implies an uncertainty relation between space and time: $\Delta r$ $\Delta t$ $> G \hbar / c^4$; where G, $\hbar$ and c are the gravitational constant, the reduced Planck constant, and the speed of light, respectively. We outline and briefly discuss the implications of this uncertainty conjecture.
