abstract: A cornerstone of the theory of phase transitions is the observation that many-body systems exhibiting a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit generally show extensive fluctuations of an order parameter in large but finite systems. In this work, we introduce the dynamical analogue of such a theory. Specifically, we consider local dissipative dynamics preparing a steady-state of quantum spins on a lattice exhibiting a discrete or continuous symmetry but with extensive fluctuations in a local order parameter. We show that for all such processes satisfying detailed balance, there exist metastable symmetry-breaking states, i.e., states that become stationary in the thermodynamic limit and give a finite value to the order parameter. We give results both for discrete and continuous symmetries and explicitly show how to construct the symmetry-breaking states. Our results show in a simple way that, in large systems, local dissipative dynamics satisfying detailed balance cannot uniquely and efficiently prepare states with extensive fluctuations with respect to local operators. We discuss the implications of our results for quantum simulators and dissipative state preparation.

abstract: It seems that non-local correlations stronger than quantum correlations between two non-signaling systems cannot exist for the simple reason that the property of non-signaling implies that the CHSH correlation factor must satisfy the Tsirelson bound. This result is obtained after translating the fashionable language of boxes into the language of observables, which is used to compute the CHSH correlation factor. A recently proposed toy-model of such non-signaling, super-quantum correlations is then considered and it is shown that it suffers from logical inconsistency.

abstract: The detectability lemma is a useful tool for probing the structure of gapped ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians of lattice spin models. The lemma provides an estimate on the error incurred by approximating the ground space projector with a product of local projectors. We provide a new, simpler proof for the detectability lemma which is tighter and more general, applying to an arbitrary ordering of the local projectors. In addition, we prove a converse to the detectability lemma. As an application we show how the lemma and its converse can be combined to obtain local spectral gap amplification: we show that by coarse-graining a local frustration-free Hamiltonian with a spectral gap $\gamma>0$ to a length scale $O(\gamma^{-1/2})$, one gets an Hamiltonian with an $\Omega(1)$ spectral gap.

abstract: We study the coexistence of the quantum Zeno effect and non-Markovianity for a system decaying in a structured bosonic environment and subject to a control field. The interaction with the environment induces decay from the excited to the ground level, which, in turn, is coherently coupled to another meta-stable state. The control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable levels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory effects, without modifying neither the system-reservoir interaction, nor environmental properties. We use this framework in two different parameter regimes corresponding to fast (bad cavity limit) and slow dissipation (good cavity limit) in the original, un-controlled qubit system. Our results show a non-monotonic behavior of memory effects when increasing the effectiveness of the Zeno-like freezing. Moreover, we identify a new source of memory effects which allows the persistence of non-Markovianity for long times while the excited state has already been depleted.

abstract: Optomechanics of nanoparticles purports to reach the quantum regime, but experimental evidence suggests otherwise. We believe that the discrepancy is due to the omission of the deleterious effects of the EM field levitating the particle. This letter focuses on quantum fluctuations in the levitating field. In a cavity-assisted system, they lead to fluctuations in the gradient force, and encourage escape of the particle. In a feedback system, they lead to the detector shot noise besides fluctuations in the gradient force and radiation pressure, and render the system very vulnerable to the thermal noise of the feedback circuit.

abstract: Single organic molecules offer great promise as bright, reliable sources of identical single photons on demand, capable of integration into solid-state devices. It has been proposed that such molecules in a crystalline organic matrix might be placed close to an optical waveguide for this purpose, but so far there have been no demonstrations of sufficiently thin crystals, with a controlled concentration of suitable dopant molecules. Here we present a method for growing very thin anthracene crystals from super-saturated vapour, which produces crystals of extreme flatness and controlled thickness. We show how this crystal can be doped with a widely adjustable concentration of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules and we examine the optical properties of these molecules to demonstrate their suitability as quantum emitters in nanophotonic devices. Our measurements show that the molecules are available in the crystal as single quantum emitters, with a well-defined polarisation relative to the crystal axes, making them amenable to alignment with optical nanostructures. We find that the radiative lifetime and saturation intensity vary little within the crystal and are not in any way compromised by the unusual matrix environment. We show that a large fraction of these emitters are able to deliver more than $10^{12}$ photons without photo-bleaching, making them suitable for real applications.

abstract: We introduce quantum optical dipole radiation fields defined in terms of photon creation and annihilation operators. These fields are identified through their spatial dependence, as the components of the total fields that survive infinitely far from the dipole source. We use these radiation fields to perturbatively evaluate the electromagnetic radiated energy-flux of the excited dipole. Our results indicate that the standard interpretation of a bare atom surrounded by a localised virtual photon cloud, is difficult to sustain, because the radiated energy-flux surviving infinitely far from the source contains virtual contributions. It follows that there is a clear distinction to be made between a radiative photon defined in terms of the radiation fields, and a real photon, whose identification depends on whether or not a given process conserves the free energy. This free energy is represented by the difference between the total dipole-field Hamiltonian and its interaction component.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.01314
abstract: In the presence of strong dephasing noise the dynamics of Rydberg gases becomes effectively classical, due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions between atomic levels. Recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to the stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several interesting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour, self-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics of these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative processes contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To explore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master equation. We find indications that the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when the dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the dynamically relevant time scales. These features include a power law growth of the density of excitations and the existence of a time-dependent Rydberg blockade radius. Our results indicate that the power-law growth of density of excitations is characterised by an exponent which decreases as the dissipation becomes weaker.

abstract: We propose a method to study the thermodynamic behaviour of small systems beyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation. This method -- based on a reaction coordinate mapping -- is general in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. This supersystem is then treated within the weak coupling and Markovian approximations, ensuring that we obtain a consistent thermodynamic picture. We demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can significantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show for a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows one to justify the widely used polaron transformation.

abstract: Quantum Cryptography is a rapidly developing field of research that benefits from the properties of Quantum Mechanics in performing cryptographic tasks. Quantum walks are a powerful model for quantum computation and very promising for quantum information processing. In this paper, we present a quantum public-key cryptographic system based on quantum walks. In particular, in the proposed protocol the public key is given by a quantum state generated by performing a quantum walk. We show that the protocol is secure and analyze the complexity of public-key generation and encryption/decryption procedures.

abstract: We present a bidirectional modification of the standard one-qubit teleportation protocol, where both Alice and Bob try to transfer their quantum states to each other using single Bell state and auxiliary (trigger) qubits. Three schemes are under consideration: the first, where action of parties are governed by two independent quantum random triggers, the second with single random trigger, and the third one as a mixture of these schemes. We calculate the fidelity of teleportation for all schemes and find the minimal amount of correlation between trigger qubits to overcome the critical value. An amount of symmetrically transmitted entanglement between parties is also analysed. The suggested scheme of bidirectional teleportation can be realized using current experimental tools.

abstract: We present quantum algorithms to realize geometric transformations (two-point swappings, symmetric flips, local flips, orthogonal rotations, and translations) based on an $n$-qubit normal arbitrary superposition state (NASS). These transformations are implemented using quantum circuits consisting of basic quantum gates, which are constructed with polynomial numbers of single-qubit and two-qubit gates. Complexity analysis shows that the global operators (symmetric flips, local flips, orthogonal rotations) can be implemented with $O(n)$ gates. The proposed geometric transformations are used to facilitate applications of quantum images with low complexity.

abstract: Quantum-mechanical devices have the potential to transform cryptography. Most research in this area has focused either on the information-theoretic advantages of quantum protocols or on the security of classical cryptographic schemes against quantum attacks. In this work, we initiate the study of another relevant topic: the encryption of quantum data in the computational setting. In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental classical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and public-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical work of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent. Finally, we construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In particular, we show that quantum-secure one-way functions imply IND-CCA1-secure symmetric-key quantum encryption, and that quantum-secure trapdoor one-way permutations imply semantically-secure public-key quantum encryption.

abstract: In strongly correlated systems, numerical algorithms taking parity quantum numbers into account are used not only for accelerating computation by reducing the Hilbert space but also for particular manipulations such as the Level Spectroscopy (LS) method. By comparing energy difference between different parity quantum numbers, the LS method is a crucial technique used in identifying quantum critical points of Gaussian and Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type quantum phase transitions. These transitions that occur in many one-dimensional systems are usually difficult to study numerically. Although the LS method is an effective strategy to locate critical points, it has been lacked an algorithm that can manage large systems with parity quantum numbers. Here a new parity Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm is discussed. The LS method is the first time performed by DMRG in the S=2 XXZ spin chain with uniaxial anisotropy. Quantum critical points of BKT and Gaussian transitions can be located well. Thus, the LS method becomes a very powerful tool for BKT and Gaussian transitions. In addition, Oshikawa's conjecture in 1992 on the presence of an intermediate phase in the present model is the first time supported by DMRG.

abstract: We determine the exact time evolution of an initial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state of ultra-cold atoms in a hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical evolution is triggered by ramping the lattice potential up, such that the interaction strength $U_f$ is much larger than the hopping amplitude $J_f$. The quench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\pi)$ in the momentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same frequency on the order parameter $\Delta$. The latter is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory. The momentum density-density or noise correlation functions oscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\pi$ as well as its second harmonic. For a very deep lattice, with negligible tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum occupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to dephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the oscillations. This occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS state, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. We therefore propose to use this dephasing to detect a BCS state. Finally, we predict that the noise correlation functions in a honeycomb lattice will develop strong anti-correlations near the Dirac point.

abstract: The ground state subspace of a topological phase of matter forms a representation of the mapping class group of the space on which the state is defined. We show that elements of the mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ can be obtained through a sequence of topological charge projections along at least three mutually intersecting non-contractible cycles. We demonstrate this both through the algebraic theory of anyons and also through an analysis of the topology of the space-time manifold. We combine this result with two observations: (i) that surfaces of genus $g$ can be effectively simulated in planar geometries by using bilayer, or doubled, versions of the topological phase of interest, and inducing the appropriate types of gapped boundaries; and (ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as adiabatic unitary transformations by locally tuning microscopic parameters of the system, such as the energy gap. These observations suggest a possible path towards effectively implementing modular transformations in physical systems. In particular, they also show how the $\text{Ising} \otimes \overline{\text{Ising}}$ state, in the presence of disconnected gapped boundaries, can support universal topological quantum computation.

abstract: We consider the propagation of several entangled photons through an elastically scattering medium and study statistical properties of their speckle patterns. We find the spatial correlations of multiphoton speckles and their sensitivity to changes of system parameters. Our analysis covers both the directed-wave regime, where rays propagate almost ballistically while experiencing small-angle diffusion, and the real-space diffusive regime. We demonstrate that long-range correlations of the speckle patterns dominate experimental signatures for large-aperture photon detectors. We also show that speckle sensitivity depends strongly on the number of photons $N$ in the incoming beam, increasing as $\sqrt{N}$ in the directed-wave regime and as $N$ in the diffusive regime.

abstract: Different from the spin-1 Haldane gapped phase, we propose a novel SO(3) spin-1 matrix product state (MPS), whose parent Hamiltonian includes three-site spin interactions. From the entanglement spectrum of a single block with $l$ sites, an enlarged SU(3) symmetry is identified in the edge states, which are conjugate to each other for the $l=even$ block but identical for the $l=odd$ block. By blocking this novel state, the blocked MPS explicitly displays the SU(3) symmetry with two distinct structures. Under a symmetric bulk bipartition with a sufficient large block length $% l=even$, the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) of the reduced system characterizes a spontaneous dimerized phase with two-fold degeneracy. However, for the block length $l=odd$, the corresponding EH represents an SU(3) quantum critical point with delocalized edge quasiparticles, and the critical field theory is described by the SU(3) level-1 Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory.

abstract: We mainly study real Klein-Gordon theory on Anti de Sitter spacetimes, and apply the General Boundary Formulation (GBF) of Quantum Theory in order to compute a radial S-matrix. We consider first the classical theory, giving a complete list of Klein-Gordon solutions and the actions of the isometries of AdS on them. We study two symplectic structures on spaces of such solutions, and show that they are invariant under all isometries' actions. We also calculate the flat limits of the involved quantities, and find that it reproduces the respective counterparts of the theory on Minkowski spacetime. We proceed applying Holomorphic Quantization, whose amplitudes are determined by an inner product which is induced by the symplectic structure together with a complex structure on the space of classical solutions. We construct this complex structure such that the inner product becomes positive-definite, and its induced amplitudes are invariant under time-translations and spatial rotations. Further, our complex structure makes these radial amplitudes agree with the amplitudes of states on equal-time hypersurfaces, and also reproduce the amplitudes of the theory on Minkowski spacetime in the flat limit. (There is also a more detailed summary at the beginning of the document.)

abstract: We analyze the properties of entangled random pure states of a quantum system partitioned into two smaller subsystems of dimensions $N$ and $M$. Framing the problem in terms of random matrices with a fixed-trace constraint, we establish, for arbitrary $N \leq M$, a general relation between the $n$-point densities and the cross-moments of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, i.e. the so-called Schmidt eigenvalues, and the analogous functionals of the eigenvalues of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of the random matrix theory. This allows us to derive explicit expressions for two-level densities, and also an exact expression for the variance of von Neumann entropy at finite $N,M$. Then we focus on the moments $\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ of the Schmidt number $K$, the reciprocal of the purity. This is a random variable supported on $[1,N]$, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom effectively contributing to the entanglement. We derive a wealth of analytical results for $\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ for $N = 2$ and $N=3$ and arbitrary $M$, and also for square $N = M$ systems by spotting for the latter a connection with the probability $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ that the smallest eigenvalue $x_{min}^{GUE}$ of a $N\times N$ matrix belonging to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble is larger than $\sqrt{2N}\xi$. As a byproduct, we present an exact asymptotic expansion for $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ for finite $N$ as $\xi \to \infty$. Our results are corroborated by numerical simulations whenever possible, with excellent agreement.

abstract: A metamaterial formed by superconducting circuits or quantum dots can serve as active lasing medium when coupled to a microwave resonator. For these artificial atoms, in contrast to real atoms, variations in their parameters cannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such a multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a self-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The reason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to resonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms. Not only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the width of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are found for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual coupling. We present relations how the allowed disorder scales with the number of atoms and confirm it by a numerical analysis. We also provide estimates for the sample-to-sample variations to be expected for setups with moderate numbers of atoms.
