abstract: We study the dark exciton's behavior as a coherent physical two-level spin system (qubit) using an external magnetic field in the Faraday configuration. Our studies are based on polarization-sensitive intensity autocorrelation measurements of the optical transition resulting from the recombination of a spin-blockaded biexciton state, which heralds the dark exciton and its spin state. We demonstrate control over the dark exciton eigenstates without degrading its decoherence time. Our observations agree well with computational predictions based on a master equation model.

abstract: A solvable molecular collision model that predicts Aharonov-Bohm (AB) like scattering in the adiabatic approximation is introduced. For it, we propagate coupled channel wave packets without resorting to a Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. In those, exact, solutions we find evidence of topological phase dislocation lines that are independent of the collision energy and provide definitive signatures of AB-like scattering. The results of these simulations contrast with the conclusions of a recent study that suggests survival of the molecular Aharonov-Bohm (MAB) effect only in the adiabatic limit in which the nuclear reduced mass $\mu \rightarrow \infty$. We discuss generalizations of this model and consider possible screening of the Mead-Truhlar vector potential by the presence of multiple conical intersections (CI). We demonstrate that the Wilson loop phase integral has the value $-1$ if it encloses an odd-number of CI's, and takes the value $+1$ for an even number. Within the scope of this model, we investigate the ultra-cold limit of scattering solutions in the presence of a conical intersection and comment on the relevance of Wigner threshold behavior for s-wave scattering.

abstract: Boson sampling is the problem of generating a quantum bit stream whose average is the permanent of a $n\times n$ matrix. The bitstream is created as the output of a prototype quantum computing device with $n$ input photons. It is a fundamental challenge to verify boson sampling, and the question of how output count rates scale with matrix size $n$ is crucial. Here we apply results from random matrix theory to establish scaling laws for average count rates in boson sampling experiments with arbitrary inputs and losses. The results show that, even with losses included, verification of nonclassical behaviour at large $n$ values is indeed possible.

abstract: The nonlocal properties of the W states are investigated under particle loss. By removing all but two particles from an $N$-qubit W state, the resulting two-qubit state is still entangled. Hence, the W state has high persistency of entanglement. We ask an analogous question regarding the persistency of nonlocality introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 86, 042113]. Namely, we inquire what is the minimal number of particles that must be removed from the W state so that the resulting state becomes local. We bound this value in function of $N$ qubits by considering Bell nonlocality tests with two alternative settings per site. In particular, we find that this value is between $2N/5$ and $N/2$ for large $N$. We also develop a framework to establish bounds for more than two settings per site.

abstract: In quantum mechanics students are taught to practice that eigenfunction of a physical bound state must be continuous and vanishing asymptotically so that it is normalizable in $x\in (-\infty, \infty)$. Here we caution that such states may also give rise to infinite uncertainty in position $(\Delta x=\infty)$, whereas $\Delta p$ remains finite. Such states may be called loosely bound and spatially extended states that may be avoided by an additional condition that the eigenfunction vanishes asymptotically faster than $|x|^{-3/2}$.

abstract: The scientific methodology based on two descriptive levels, ontic (reality as it is ) and epistemic (observational), is briefly presented. Following Schr\"odinger, we point to the possible gap between these two descriptions. Our main aim is to show that, although ontic entities may be inaccessible for observations, they can be useful for clarification of the physical nature of operational epistemic entities. We illustrate this thesis by the concrete example: starting with the concrete ontic model preceding quantum mechanics (the latter is treated as an epistemic model), namely, prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT), we propose the natural physical interpretation for the basic quantum mechanical entity - the quantum state ("wave function"). The correspondence PCSFT to QM is not straightforward, it couples the covariance operators of classical (prequantum) random fields with the quantum density operators. We use this correspondence to clarify the physical meaning of the pure quantum state and the superposition principle - by using the formalism of classical field correlations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.05908
abstract: For finite-dimensional quantum systems, such as qubits, a well established strategy to protect such systems from decoherence is dynamical decoupling. However many promising quantum devices, such as oscillators, are infinite dimensional, for which the question if dynamical decoupling could be applied remained open. Here we first show that not every infinite-dimensional system can be protected from decoherence through dynamical decoupling. Then we develop dynamical decoupling for continuous variable systems which are described by quadratic Hamiltonians. We identify a condition and a set of operations that allow us to map a set of interacting harmonic oscillators onto a set of non-interacting oscillators rotating with an averaged frequency, a procedure we call homogenization. Furthermore we show that every quadratic system-environment interaction can be suppressed with two simple operations acting only on the system. Using a random dynamical decoupling or homogenization scheme, we develop bounds that characterize how fast we have to work in order to achieve the desired uncoupled dynamics. This allows us to identify how well homogenization can be achieved and decoherence can be suppressed in continuous variable systems.

abstract: Feasible setup for pulsed quantum non-demolition interaction between two distant mechanical oscillators through optical or microwave mediator is proposed. The proposal uses homodyne measurement of the mediator and feedforward control of the mechanical oscillators to reach the interaction. To verify quantum nature of the interaction, we investigate the Gaussian entanglement generated in the mechanical modes. We evaluate it under influence of mechanical bath and propagation loss for the mediator and propose ways to optimize the interaction. Finally, both currently available optomechanical and electromechanical platforms are numerically analyzed. The analysis shows that implementation is already feasible with current technology.

abstract: In addition to being a workhorse for modern quantum technologies, entanglement plays a key role in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. The entanglement of photons in multiple levels, or dimensions, explores the limits of how large an entangled state can be, while also greatly expanding its applications in quantum information. Here we show how a high-dimensional quantum state of two photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum can be split into two entangled states with a smaller dimensionality structure. Our work demonstrates that entanglement is a quantum property that can be subdivided into spatially separated parts. In addition, our technique has vast potential applications in quantum as well as classical communication systems.

abstract: Laser cooling is a fundamental technique used in primary atomic frequency standards, quantum computers, quantum condensed matter physics and tests of fundamental physics, among other areas. It has been known since the early 1990s that laser cooling can, in principle, be improved by using squeezed light as an electromagnetic reservoir; while quantum feedback control using a squeezed light probe is also predicted to allow improved cooling. Here, we implement quantum feedback control of a micro-mechanical oscillator for the first time with a squeezed probe field. This allows quantum-enhanced feedback cooling with a measurement rate greater than it is possible with classical light, and a consequent reduction in the final oscillator temperature. Our results have significance for future applications in areas ranging from quantum information networks, to quantum-enhanced force and displacement measurements and fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics.

abstract: We introduce the concept of macroscopic quantum measurement, that is, a quantum formalism describing the measurements we perform continuously in our everyday life; for example, when looking at a magnet. We idealize the problem by considering parallel spins whose direction has to be estimated. We present a physical measurement model weak enough to almost not disturb the quantum state, but strong enough to provide almost the maximal amount of information in a single shot. Interestingly an intermediate coupling strength between spin system and measurement apparatus achieves better results than a strong coupling.

abstract: A many-body atomic system coupled to quantized light is subject to weak measurement. Instead of coupling light to the on-site density, we consider the quantum backaction due to the measurement of matter-phase-related variables such as global phase coherence. We show how this unconventional approach opens up new opportunities to affect system evolution and demonstrate how this can lead to a new class of measurement projections, thus extending the measurement postulate for the case of strong competition with the system's own evolution.

abstract: The basic question is addressed, how the space dimension $d$ is encoded in the Hilbert space of $N$ identical fermions. There appears a finite number $N!^{d-1}$ of many-body wave functions, called shapes, which cannot be generated by trivial combinatorial extension of the one-dimensional ones. A general algorithm is given to list them all in terms of standard Slater determinants. Conversely, excitations which can be induced from the one-dimensional case are bosonised into a system of distinguishable bosons, called Euler bosons, much like the electromagnetic field is quantized in terms of photons distinguishable by their wave numbers. Their wave functions are given explicitly in terms of elementary symmetric functions, reflecting the fact that the fermion sign problem is trivial in one dimension. The shapes act as vacua for the Euler bosons. They are the natural generalization of the single-Slater-determinant form for the ground state to more than one dimension. In terms of algebraic invariant theory, the shapes are antisymmetric invariants which finitely generate the $N$-fermion Hilbert space as a graded algebra over the ring of symmetric polynomials. Analogous results hold for identical bosons.

abstract: We calculate the Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate for an atom in front of a nonreciprocal medium by using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The results are a generalization of the respective quantities for matter with broken time-reversal symmetry which does not fulfill the Lorentz reciprocity principle. As examples, we contrast the decay rates, the resonant and nonresonant frequency shifts of a perfectly conducting (reciprocal) mirror to those of a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror. We find different power laws for the distance dependence of all quantities in the retarded and nonretarded limits. As an example of a more realistic nonreciprocal medium, we investigate a topological insulator subject to a time-symmetry breaking perturbation.

abstract: Interactions of quantum systems with their environment play a crucial role in resource-theoretic approaches to thermodynamics in the microscopic regime. Here, we analyze the possible state transitions in the presence of "small" heat baths of bounded dimension and energy. We show that for operations on quantum systems with fully degenerate Hamiltonian (noisy operations), all possible state transitions can be realized exactly with a bath that is of the same size as the system or smaller, which proves a quantum version of Horn's lemma as conjectured by Bengtsson and Zyczkowski. On the other hand, if the system's Hamiltonian is not fully degenerate (thermal operations), we show that some possible transitions can only be performed with a heat bath that is unbounded in size and energy, which is an instance of the third law of thermodynamics. In both cases, we prove that quantum operations yield an advantage over classical ones for any given finite heat bath, by allowing a larger and more physically realistic set of state transitions.

abstract: Entanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix contains information beyond the von Neumann entropy and provides unique insights into exotic orders or critical behavior of electronic and quantum spin systems. Here we show that strongly-disordered systems in the many-body localized phase have universal power-law entanglement spectra, arising from the presence of extensively many local integrals of motion. The power-law entanglement spectrum distinguishes many-body localized systems from ergodic systems, as well as from ground states of gapped integrable models or systems in the vicinity of scale-invariant critical points. We confirm our results using large-scale exact diagonalization. In addition, we develop a matrix-product state algorithm which allows us to access the eigenstates of large systems close to the localization transition, and discuss general implications of our results for variational studies of highly excited eigenstates in many-body localized systems.

abstract: We study the transverse-field Ising model with interactions that are modulated in time. In a rotating frame, the system is described by a time-independent Hamiltonian with many-body interactions, similar to the cluster Hamiltonians of measurement-based quantum computing. In one dimension, there is a three-body interaction, which leads to string order instead of conventional magnetic order. We show that the string order is robust to power-law interactions that decay with the cube of distance. In two and three dimensions, there are five- and seven-body interactions. We discuss adiabatic preparation of the ground state as well as experimental implementation with trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and dipolar molecules.

abstract: We theoretically study electro-optic light modulation based on the quantum model where the linear electro-optic effect and the externally applied microwave field result in the interaction between optical cavity modes. The model assumes that the number of interacting modes is finite and effects of the mode overlapping coefficient on the strength of the intermode interaction can be taken into account through dependence of the coupling coefficient on the mode characteristics. We show that, under certain conditions, the model is exactly solvable and, in the semiclassical approximation where the microwave field is treated as a classical mode, can be analyzed using the technique of the Jordan mappings for the su(2) Lie algebra. Analytical results are applied to study effects of light modulation on the frequency dependence of the photon counting rate. We also establish the conditions of validity of the semiclassical approximation by applying the methods of polynomially deformed Lie algebras for analysis of the model with quantized microwave field.

abstract: An eigenfunction method was applied to reduce the regular projective representations (Reps) of finite groups, especially anti-unitary groups, into direct sum of their irreducible projective Reps. In this approach, there is no need to refer to the covering group. The Rep theory for anti-unitary groups are very different from that of unitary groups, for instance, the character is no longer a good quantity, the Schur's lemma should be modified and consequently the number of irreducible (projective or linear) Reps of the same class is not always the same as the number of linearly independent class operators. Physical applications of irreducible projective Reps are discussed.

This voltage can be used to actively cool well below the lattice temperature one of the superconducting electrodes forming the interferometer. The achievable cooling performance combined with the simplicity and scalability intrinsic to the structure pave the way to a number of applications in quantum technology.

abstract: In this paper we abandon the idea that even a "quantum" black hole, of Planck size, can still be described as a classical, more or less complicated, geometry. Rather, we consider a genuine quantum mechanical approach where a Planckian black hole is, by all means, just another "particle", even if with a distinguishing property: its linear size increases with the energy. The horizon dynamics is equivalently described in terms of a particle moving in gravitational potential derived from the horizon equation itself in a self-consistent manner. The particle turning-points match the radius of the inner and outer horizons of a charged black hole. This classical model pave the way towards the wave equation for a truly quantum black hole. We compute the exact form of the wave function and determine the energy spectrum. Finally, we describe the classical limit in which the quantum picture correctly approaches the classical geometric formulation. We find that the quantum-to-classical transition occurs far above the Planck scale.

abstract: Quantum state tomography, an important task in quantum information processing, aims at reconstructing a state from prepared measurement data. Bayesian methods are recognized to be one of the good and reliable choice in estimating quantum states~\cite{blume2010optimal}. Several numerical works showed that Bayesian estimations are comparable to, and even better than other methods in the problem of $1$-qubit state recovery. However, the problem of choosing prior distribution in the general case of $n$ qubits is not straightforward. More importantly, the statistical performance of Bayesian type estimators have not been studied from a theoretical perspective yet. In this paper, we propose a novel prior for quantum states (density matrices), and we define pseudo-Bayesian estimators of the density matrix. Then, using PAC-Bayesian theorems, we derive rates of convergence for the posterior mean. The numerical performance of these estimators are tested on simulated and real datasets.

abstract: Strongly interacting atom-cavity systems within a network with many nodes constitute a possible realization for a quantum internet which allows for quantum communication and computation on the same platform. To implement such large-scale quantum networks, nanophotonic resonators are promising candidates because they can be scalably fabricated and interconnected with waveguides and optical fibers. By integrating arrays of ring resonators into a vapor cell we show that thermal rubidium atoms above room temperature can be coupled to photonic cavities as building blocks for chip-scale hybrid circuits. Although strong coupling is not yet achieved in this first realization, our approach provides a key step towards miniaturization and scalability of atom-cavity systems.

abstract: Much effort has been devoted into understanding the quantum mechanical properties of gravitational interactions. Here we explore the recent suggestion that gravitational interactions are a fundamental classical channel that is described by continuous quantum measurements and feedforward (CQMF). Specifically, we investigate the possibility that some properties of our universe, modeled using a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, can emerge from CQMF by introducing an underlying quantum system for the dynamical variables, avoiding well known difficulties in trying to quantize the spacetime itself. We show that the quantum decoherence necessary in such a measurement model manifests itself as a dark energy fluid that fills the spacetime and whose equation of state asymptotically oscillates around the value $w=-1/3$, regardless of the spatial curvature, which provides the bound between accelerating and decelerating expanding FRW cosmologies.

abstract: Quantum non-local correlations and the acausal, spooky action at a distance suggest a discord between quantum theory and special relativity. We propose a resolution for this discord by first observing that there is a problem of time in quantum theory. There should exist a reformulation of quantum theory which does not refer to classical time. Such a reformulation is obtained by suggesting that space-time is fundamentally non-commutative. Quantum theory without classical time is the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of the underlying non-commutative relativity. Stochastic fluctuations about equilibrium give rise to the classical limit and ordinary space-time geometry. However, measurement on an entangled state can be correctly described only in the underlying non-commutative space-time, where there is no causality violation, nor a spooky action at a distance.
