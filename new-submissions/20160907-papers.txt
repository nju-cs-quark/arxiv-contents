abstract: We show that the no-signaling principle can be violated with classical inseparable beams in the presence of a parity-time (PT) symmetric subsystem. Thus, the problems associated to PT-symmetric quantum theories recently discovered by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130404 (2014)] are not exclusive to quantum mechanics, but already exist in the classical case. The possibility to implement local optical PT-symmetric subsystems via light-matter interactions enables the experimental exploration of local PT symmetry and subtle quantum concepts via classical analogues.

abstract: The stabilizer group of an n-qubit state \psi is the set of all matrices of the form g=g_1\otimes\cdots\otimes g_n, with g_1,...,g_n being any 2x2 invertible complex matrices, that satisfy g\psi=\psi. We show that for 5 or more qubits, except for a set of states of zero measure, the stabilizer group of multipartite entangled states is trivial; that is, containing only the identity element. We use this result to show that for 5 or more qubits, the action of deterministic local operations and classical communication (LOCC) can almost always be simulated simply by local unitary (LU) operations. This proves that almost all n-qubit states with n>4 are isolated, that is they can neither be reached nor converted into any other (n-partite entangled), LU-inequivalent state via deterministic LOCC. We also find a simple and elegant expression for the maximal probability to convert one multi-qubit entangled state to another for this generic set of states.

We conclude that, up to local phases, all single excitation quantum states with support on every site of the chain can be created. We pay particular attention to the generation of W-states that are superposed over every site of the chain.

abstract: From the high vibrational dipolar strength offered by molecular liquids, we demonstrate that a molecular vibration can be ultra-strongly coupled to multiple IR cavity modes, with Rabi splittings reaching $24\%$ of the vibration frequencies. As a proof of the ultra-strong coupling regime, our experimental data unambiguously reveal the contributions to the polaritonic dynamics coming from the anti-resonant terms in the interaction energy and from the dipolar self-energy of the molecular vibrations themselves. In particular, we measure the opening of a genuine vibrational polaritonic bandgap of ca. $60$ meV. We also demonstrate that the multimode splitting effect defines a whole vibrational ladder of heavy polaritonic states perfectly resolved. These findings reveal the broad possibilities in the vibrational ultra-strong coupling regime which impact both the optical and the molecular properties of such coupled systems, in particular in the context of mode-selective chemistry.

abstract: We present a scheme for joint remote state preparation (JRSP) of three-particle state via three tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states as the quantum channel linking the parties. We use eight-qubit mutually orthogonal basis vector as measurement point of departure. The likelihood of success for this scheme has been found to be $1/8$. However, by putting some special cases into consideration, the chances can be ameliorated to $1/4$ and $1$. The effects of amplitude-damping noise, phase-damping noise and depolarizing noise on this scheme have been scrutinized and the analytical derivations of fidelities for the quantum noisy channels have been presented. We found that for $0.55\leq\eta\leq1$, the states conveyed through depolarizing channel lose more information than phase-damping channel while the information loss through amplitude damping channel is most minimal.

abstract: The Barrett-Cavalcanti-Lal-Maroney (BCLM) argument stands as the most effective means of demonstrating the reality of the quantum state. Its advantages include being derived from very few assumptions, and a robustness to experimental error. I show that techniques from convex optimization theory can be leveraged to numerically search for experiments that implement BCLM's argument and that allow for the strongest statements about the ontology of the wavefunction to be made. The optimization approach presented is versatile, efficient and can take account of the finite precision present in any real experiment. I find significantly improved low-cardinality sets of states (and measurements) of low Hilbert space dimension which are guaranteed partially-optimal for a BCLM test. I further show that mixed states can be more optimal than pure states.

abstract: Entanglement between two separate systems is a necessary resource to violate a Bell inequality in a test of local realism. We demonstrate that to overcome the Bell bound, this correlation must be accompanied by the entanglement between the constituent particles. This happens whenever a super-selection rule imposes a constraint on feasible local operations. As we show in an example, the necessary particle entanglement might solely result from their indistinguishability. Our result reveals a fundamental relation between the non-locality and the particle entanglement.

abstract: A classical thermometer typically works by exchanging energy with the system being measured until it comes to equilibrium, at which point the readout is related to the final energy state of the thermometer. A recent paper noted that different-temperature baths lead not only to different equilibrium states but also to different equilibration rates. In some cases this means that temperature discrimination is better achieved by comparing the rates than the asymptotic states -- and should therefore be carried out at finite times rather than once equilibration is essentially complete. The theory work also noted that for a \emph{quantum} thermometer, the difference between the relaxation rates for populations and coherences means that for intermediate time regimes (before full equilibration but after some characteristic time that depends on the temperatures of the baths), optimal discrimination is achieved not by probing energy only but by using quantum coherence as well. In this work, we study these effects experimentally. Implementing a recent proposal for efficiently emulating an arbitrary quantum channel, we use the quantum polarisation state of individual photons as models of "single-qubit thermometers" which evolve for a certain time in contact with a thermal bath. We investigate the optimal thermometer states for temperature discrimination, and the optimal interaction times, confirming that there is a broad regime where quantum coherence provides a significant improvement. We also discuss the more practical question of thermometers composed of a finite number of spins/qubits (greater than one), and characterize the performance of an adaptive protocol for making optimal use of all the qubits.

abstract: Standard thermometry employs the thermalisation of a probe with the system of interest. This approach can be extended by incorporating the possibility of using the non-equilibrium states of the probe, and the presence of coherence. Here, we illustrate how these concepts apply to the single-qubit thermometer introduced by Jevtic et al. by performing a simulation of the qubit-environment interaction in a linear-optical device. We discuss the role of the coherence, and how this affects the usefulness of non-equilibrium conditions. The origin of the observed behaviour is traced back to the propensity to thermalisation, as captured by the Helmholtz free energy.

abstract: Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing, measurement, and communication. This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate successful theoretical proposals and experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.

abstract: The widely used quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a lower bound for the mean square error of unbiased estimators in quantum parameter estimation, however, in general QCRB is only tight in the asymptotical limit. With a limited number of measurements biased estimators can have a far better performance for which QCRB cannot calibrate. Here we introduce a valid lower bound for all estimators, either biased or unbiased, which can serve as standard of merit for all quantum parameter estimations.

abstract: We show that for any $\varepsilon>0$ there is an XOR game $G=G(\varepsilon)$ with $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ inputs for one player and $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2/5})$ inputs for the other player such that $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ ebits are required for any strategy achieving bias that is at least a multiplicative factor $(1-\varepsilon)$ from optimal. This gives an exponential improvement in both the number of inputs or outputs and the noise tolerance of any previously-known self-test for highly entangled states. Up to the exponent $-1/5$ the scaling of our bound with $\varepsilon$ is tight: for any XOR game there is an $\varepsilon$-optimal strategy using $\lceil \varepsilon^{-1} \rceil$ ebits, irrespective of the number of questions in the game.

abstract: We introduce a new Hamiltonian model which interpolates between the Jaynes-Cummings model and other types of such Hamiltonians. It works with two interpolating parameters, rather than one as traditional. Taking advantage of this greater degree of freedom, we can perform continuous interpolation between the various types of these Hamiltonians. As applications we discuss a paradox raised in literature and compare the time evolution of photon statistics obtained in the various interpolating models. The role played by the average excitation in these comparisons is also highlighted.

abstract: In this letter we study the weak-convergence properties of random variables generated by unsharp quantum measurements. More precisely, for a sequence of random variables generated by repeated unsharp quantum measurements, we study the limit distribution of relative frequency. We provide the de Finetti-type representation theorem for all separable states, showing that the distribution can be well approximated by mixture of normal distributions. No symmetry restrictions, such as permutational invariance were needed. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence rates and show that the relative frequency can stabilize to some constant at best at the rate of order $1/\sqrt N$ for all separable inputs. On the other hand, we provide an example of a strictly unsharp quantum measurement where the better rates are achieved by using entangled inputs. This means that in certain cases the noise generated by the measurement process can be suppressed by using entanglement. Based on this observation we provide a scheme for the probabilistic multipartite entanglement detection of certain states by using only a single-copy of the system. We deliver our result in the form of quantum information task where the player achieves the goal with certainty in the limiting case by using entangled inputs or fails with the certainty by using separable inputs.

abstract: Among the many facets of quantum correlations, bound entanglement has remained one the most enigmatic phenomena, despite the fact that it was discovered in the early days of quantum information. Even its detection has proven to be difficult, let alone its precise quantitative characterization. In this work, we present the exact quantification of entanglement for a two-parameter family of highly symmetric two-qutrit mixed states, which contains a sizable part of bound entangled states. We achieve this by explicitly calculating the convex-roof extensions of the linear entropy as well as the concurrence for every state within the family. Our results provide a benchmark for future quantitative studies of bipartite entanglement in higher-dimensional systems.

abstract: We propose a new method for creating far-field optical barrier potentials for ultracold atoms with widths that are narrower than the diffraction limit and can approach tens of nanometers. The reduced widths stem from the nonlinear atomic response to control fields that create spatially varying dark resonances. The subwavelenth barrier is the result of the geometric scalar potential experienced by an atom prepared in such a spatially varying dark state. The performance of this technique, as well as its applications to the study of many-body physics and to the implementation of quantum information protocols with ultracold atoms, are discussed, with a focus on the implementation of tunnel junctions.

abstract: We review the developments in the past decade on holographic entanglement entropy, a subject that has garnered much attention owing to its potential to teach us about the emergence of spacetime in holography. We provide an introduction to the concept of entanglement entropy in quantum field theories, review the holographic proposals for computing the same, providing some justification for where these proposals arise from in the first two parts. The final part addresses recent developments linking entanglement and geometry. We provide an overview of the various arguments and technical developments that teach us how to use field theory entanglement to detect geometry. Our discussion is by design eclectic; we have chosen to focus on developments that appear to us most promising for further insights into the holographic map. This is a preliminary draft of a few chapters of a book which will appear sometime in the near future, to be published by Springer. The book in addition contains a discussion of application of holographic ideas to computation of entanglement entropy in strongly coupled field theories, and discussion of tensor networks and holography, which we have chosen to exclude from the current manuscript.

abstract: We study one-dimensional spinless fermions with random interactions, but without any on-site disorder. We find that random interactions generically stabilize a many-body localized phase, in spite of the completely extended single-particle degrees of freedom. In the large randomness limit, we construct "bubble-neck" eigenstates having a universal area-law entanglement entropy on average, with the number of volume-law states being exponentially suppressed. We argue that this statistical localization is beyond the phenomenological local-integrals-of-motion description of many-body localization. With exact diagonalization, we confirm the robustness of the many-body localized phase at finite randomness by investigating eigenstate properties such as level statistics, entanglement/participation entropies, and nonergodic quantum dynamics. At weak random interactions, the system develops a thermalization transition when the single-particle hopping becomes dominant.

abstract: There has been recent interest in identifying entanglement as the fundamental concept from which space may emerge. We note that the particular way that a Hilbert space is decomposed into tensor factors is important in what the resulting geometry looks like. We then propose that time may be regarded as a variable that parameterizes a family of such decompositions, thus giving rise to a family of spatial geometries. As a proof of concept, this idea is demonstrated in two toy models based on Kitaev's toric code, which feature a dynamical change of dimension and topology.

abstract: Given a real-valued positive semidefinite matrix, Williamson proved that it can be diagonalised using symplectic matrices. The corresponding diagonal values are known as the symplectic spectrum. This paper is concerned with the stability of Williamson's decomposition under perturbations. We provide norm bounds for the stability of the symplectic eigenvalues and prove that if $S$ diagonalises a given matrix $M$ to Williamson form, then $S$ is stable if the symplectic spectrum is nondegenerate and $S^TS$ is always stable. Finally, we sketch a few applications of the results in quantum information theory.

abstract: It is understood that in free bosonic theories, the classical field theory accurately describes the full quantum theory when the occupancy numbers of systems are very large. However, the situation is less understood in interacting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical relaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory deviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if the occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the quantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The evidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the time evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the classical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences for many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs, dark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically examine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe the quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are large. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a single quantum micro-state are approximated by the corresponding classical ensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic theorem, the classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical translation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the correlation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single micro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems. Furthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when appropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a cutoff on low occupancy UV modes. We discuss applications of our results.

abstract: In this work, we calculate the thermal and magnetic properties for a single spinless particle in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields in a cylindrical geometry. To compute the canonical partition function the Schr\"odinger equation is solved analytically for the radial and angular coordinates, and by using a perturbational scheme the axial component is approximate at the first and second order in the perturbation. The energy spectrum, as well as the partition function, are calculated up to terms of order $\lambda^2$. The partition function is compared with the calculated by Gumber et. al. We show that there are discrepancies between their results and our ones, which are attributed to the axial solution given by mentioned authors, that propose in a wrong way a free particle state in the $z$-direction, neglecting the effect of the electric field. The expressions for specific heat, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are corrected. The results are in agreement with the diamagnetic properties of GaAs.

abstract: This work addresses the dynamical quantum problem of a driven discrete energy level coupled to a semi-infinite continuum whose density of states has a square-root-type singularity, such as states of a free particle in one dimension or quasiparticle states in a BCS superconductor. The system dynamics is strongly affected by the quantum-mechanical repulsion between the discrete level and the singularity, which gives rise to a bound state, suppresses the decay into the continuum, and can produce Stueckelberg oscillations. This quantum coherence effect may limit the performance of mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as quantum electron turnstile.

abstract: In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , Born's principle of localisation is as follows: For a single particle, if a wave function $\psi_K$ vanishes outside a spatial region $K$, it is said to be localised in $K$. In particular if a spatial region $K'$ is disjoint from $K$, a wave function $\psi_{K'}$ localised in $K'$ is orthogonal to $\psi_K$. Such a principle of localisation does not exist compatibly with relativity and causality in quantum field theory (Newton and Wigner) or interacting point particles (Currie,Jordan and Sudarshan).It is replaced by symplectic localisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and others. This localisation gives a simple derivation of the spin-statistics theorem and the Unruh effect, and shows how to construct quantum fields for anyons and for massless particles with `continuous' spin. This review outlines the basic principles underlying symplectic localisation and shows or mentions its deep implications. In particular, it has the potential to affect relativistic quantum information theory and black hole physics.

abstract: The D-CTC condition is a condition originally proposed by David Deutsch as a condition on states of a quantum communication network that contains "backward time-steps" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves (CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a construction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer spacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication networks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.

abstract: We consider localized qubits evolving around a black hole following a quantum adiabatic dynamics. We develop a geometric structure (based on fibre bundles) permitting to describe the quantum states of a qubit and the spacetime geometry in a single framework. The quantum decoherence induced by the black hole on the qubit is analysed in this framework (the role of the dynamical and geometric phases in this decoherence is treated), especially for the quantum teleportation protocol when one qubit falls to the event horizon. A simple formula to compute the fidelity of the teleportation is derived. The case of a Schwarzschild black hole is analysed.

abstract: We propose a tensor network approximating the set of all eigenstates of a fully many-body localized system in one dimension. Our construction, conceptually based on the ansatz introduced in Phys. Rev. B 94, 041116(R) (2016), is built from two layers of unitary matrices which act on blocks of $\ell$ contiguous sites. We optimize the unitaries by minimizing the magnitude of the commutator of the approximate integrals of motion and the Hamiltonian, which can be done in a local fashion. We argue that our approach yields an exponential reduction in computational time and memory requirement as compared to all previous approaches for obtaining the complete eigenspectrum of large many-body localized systems. We test the accuracy of our method by comparing the approximate energy spectrum to exact diagonalization results for the random field Heisenberg model on 12 sites. We find that the technique is highly accurate deep in the localized regime and maintains a surprising degree of accuracy in predicting certain local quantities even in the vicinity of the predicted dynamical phase transition. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we study a system of 60 sites and we are able to see clear signatures of the phase transition.

abstract: In the configuration in which two-level atoms with an initial thermal distribution of their states are sent in succession to a cavity sustaining a single mode of electromagnetic radiation, one atom leaving the cavity as the next one enters it (as in the one-atom maser), Jaynes and Cummings showed that the steady state of the field, when many atoms have traversed the cavity, is thermal with a temperature different than that of the atoms in the off-resonant situation. Having an interaction between two subsystems which maintains them at different temperatures was then understood as leading to an apparent violation of energy conservation. Here we show, by calculating the quantum entropy production in the system, that this difference of temperatures is allowed thermodynamically and understood has having the subsystems adiabatically insulated from each other as the steady state is approached. At resonance the insulation is removed and equilibration of the temperatures is achieved.

abstract: Generators of the Poincar\'e group, for a free massive scalar field, are usually expressed in the momentum space. In this work we perform a transformation of these generators into the coordinate space. This (spatial)-position space is spanned by eigenvectors of the Newton-Wigner-Pryce operator. The motivation is a deeper understanding of the commutative spatial coordinate space in QFT, in order to investigate the non-commutative version thereof.

abstract: Quantum information protected by the topology of the storage medium is expected to exhibit long coherence times. Another attractive feature are topologically protected gates generated through braiding of Majorana bound states. However, braiding requires branched structures which have inherent difficulties in the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures now believed to host Majorana bound states. Here, we construct quantum bits taking advantage of the topological protection and non-local properties of Majorana bound states in a network of parallel wires. The elementary unit is made from three topological wires, two wires coupled by a trivial superconductor and the third acting as an interference arm. Coulomb blockade of the combined wires spawns a fractionalized spin, non-locally addressable by quantum dots used for single-qubit readout, initialization, and manipulation. We describe how the same tools allow for measurement-based implementation of the Clifford gates, in total making the architecture universal. Proof-of-principle demonstration of topologically protected qubits using existing techniques is therefore within reach.

title: Lyapunov Exponent and Four-Point Correlator's Growth Rate in a Chaotic System

abstract: It was proposed recently that the out-of-time-ordered four-point correlator (OTOC) may serve as a useful characteristic of quantum-chaotic behavior, because in the semi-classical limit, $\hbar \to 0$, its rate of exponential growth resembles the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here, we calculate the four-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a textbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times with the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both quantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the Lyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the logarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and to the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference appears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength, where no classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, while the OTOC's growth rate may remain finite corresponding to disconnected local chaotic islands in the phase space. We also show that the quantum correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear singularity at the Ehrenfest time $t_E$: transitioning from a time-independent value of $t^{-1} \ln{C(t)}$ at $t < t_E$ to its monotonous decrease with time at $t>t_E$. We note that the underlying physics here is the same as in the theory of weak dynamical localization [Tian, Kamenev, and Larkin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 124101 (2004)] and is due to a delay in the onset of quantum interference effects, which occur sharply at the Ehrenfest time.
