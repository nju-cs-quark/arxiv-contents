abstract: We address the role of the phase-insensitive trusted preparation and detection noise in the security of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution, considering the Gaussian protocols on the basis of coherent and squeezed states and studying them in the conditions of Gaussian lossy and noisy channels. The influence of such a noise on the security of Gaussian quantum cryptography can be crucial, even despite the fact that a noise is trusted, due to a strongly nonlinear behavior of the quantum entropies involved in the security analysis. We recapitulate the known effect of the preparation noise in both direct and reverse-reconciliation protocols, as well as the detection noise in the reverse-reconciliation scenario. As a new result, we show the negative role of the trusted detection noise in the direct-reconciliation scheme. We also describe the role of the trusted preparation or detection noise added at the reference side of the protocols in improving the robustness of the protocols to the channel noise, confirming the positive effect for the coherent-state reverse-reconciliation protocol. Finally, we address the combined effect of trusted noise added both in the source and the detector.

title: Stability thresholds and calculation techniques for fast entangling gates on trapped ions

abstract: Fast entangling gates have been proposed for trapped ions that are orders of magnitude faster than current implementations. We present here a detailed analysis of the challenges involved in performing a successful fast gate. We show that the RWA is a stable approximation with respect to pulse numbers: the timescale on which we can neglect terms rotating at the atomic frequency is negligibly affected by the number of pulses in the fast gate. In contrast, we show that the laser pulse instability does give rise to a pulse-number dependent effect; the fast gate infidelity is compounded with the number of applied imperfect pulses. Using a dimensional reduction method presented here, we find bounds on the pulse stability required to achieve two-qubit gate fidelity thresholds.

title: Is Nonlocality of the Quantum Theory Definitively Confirmed by the Experiments ?

abstract: In a recent paper published last october 2015 by B.Hensen et al. [1] and in two companion papers published last december 2015 by B.Hensen et al. [2] and by L. Shalm et al. [3], the authors describe beautiful and complex experiments aimed at testing the theorem of J. Bell (1965) [4] with measurements free of the detection-loophole and the locality loophole that had never been closed unquestionably in a single experiment. According to their authors, each experiment, closing both loopholes, gives conclusive evidence in favor of nonlocality. Here I will argue that this claim may be questionable, and that such an evidence should be obtained by a different kind of experiments.

abstract: We prove that the log-determinant of the covariance matrix obeys the strong subadditivity inequality for arbitrary tripartite states of multimode continuous variable quantum systems. This establishes general limitations on the distribution of information encoded in the second moments of canonically conjugate operators. We show that such an inequality implies a strict monogamy-type relation for joint Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability of single modes by Gaussian measurements performed on multiple groups of modes.

abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum coherence under Unruh thermal noise and seek under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We find that the quantum coherence can not be frozen for any acceleration due to the effect of Unruh thermal noise. We also find that quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement under the effect of Unruh thermal noise and therefore the coherence type quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic quantum information processing tasks. Besides, the dynamic of quantum coherence is found to be more sensitive than entanglement to the preparation of the detectors' initial state and the atom-field coupling strength, while it is less sensitive than entanglement to the acceleration of the detector.

abstract: State conversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W state is an open challenging problem because they cannot be converted to each other only by local operations and classical communication. Here we propose a cavity quantum electrodynamics method based on interference of polarized photons emitted by the atoms trapped in spatially separated optical cavities that can convert a three-atom W state to a GHZ state. We calculate the success probability and fidelity of the converted GHZ state when the cavity decay, atomic spontaneous decay, and photon leakage of the cavities are taken into account for a practical system, which shows that the proposed scheme is feasible and within the reach of current experimental technology.

abstract: Magnetic fields generated by human and animal organs, such as the heart, brain and nervous system carry information useful for biological and medical purposes. These magnetic fields are most commonly detected using cryogenically-cooled superconducting magnetometers. Here we present the frst detection of action potentials from an animal nerve using an optical atomic magnetometer. Using an optimal design we are able to achieve the sensitivity dominated by the quantum shot noise of light and quantum projection noise of atomic spins. Such sensitivity allows us to measure the nerve impulse with a miniature room-temperature sensor which is a critical advantage for biomedical applications. Positioning the sensor at a distance of a few millimeters from the nerve, corresponding to the distance between the skin and nerves in biological studies, we detect the magnetic field generated by an action potential of a frog sciatic nerve. From the magnetic field measurements we determine the activity of the nerve and the temporal shape of the nerve impulse. This work opens new ways towards implementing optical magnetometers as practical devices for medical diagnostics.

abstract: We propose to increase the fidelity of two-qubit resonator-induced phase gates in circuit QED by the use of narrowband single-mode squeezed drive. We show that there exists an optimal squeezing angle and strength that erases qubit 'which-path' information leaking out of the cavity and thereby minimizes qubit dephasing during these gates. Our analytical results for the gate fidelity are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of a cascaded master equation that takes into account the dynamics of the source of squeezed radiation. With realistic parameters, we find that it is possible to realize a controlled-phase gate with a gate time of 200 ns and average infidelity of $10^{-5}$.

abstract: Training artificial neural networks requires a tedious empirical evaluation to determine a suitable neural network architecture. To avoid this empirical process several techniques have been proposed to automatise the architecture selection process. In this paper, we propose a method to perform parameter and architecture selection for a quantum weightless neural network (qWNN). The architecture selection is performed through the learning procedure of a qWNN with a learning algorithm that uses the principle of quantum superposition and a non-linear quantum operator. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it performs a global search in the space of qWNN architecture and parameters rather than a local search.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.03360
abstract: We show that there exist 35 choices for the coordinate transformation each leading to a separate eleven-parametric potential for which the stationary Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solvable in terms of the general Heun functions. Because of the symmetry of the Heun equation with respect to the transposition of its singularities only eleven of the potentials are independent. Four of these independent potentials are explicitly written in terms of elementary functions, one potential is given through the Jacobi elliptic sn-function, and the others are in general defined parametrically. Seven of the independent potentials possess exactly or conditionally integrable hypergeometric sub-potentials for which each of the fundamental solutions of the problem is written through a single hypergeometric function. Both these seven potentials and the remaining four that in general have solutions only in terms of irreducible general Heun functions possess conditionally integrable sub-potentials the general solution for which is written through fundamental solutions each of which is a linear combination of two or more hypergeometric functions.

abstract: Quantum fluctuations are the origin of genuine quantum many-body effects, and can be neglected in classical mean-field phenomena. Here we report on the observation of stable quantum droplets containing $\sim$ 800 atoms which are expected to collapse at the mean-field level due to the essentially attractive interaction. By systematic measurements on individual droplets we demonstrate quantitatively that quantum fluctuations stabilize them against the mean-field collapse. We observe in addition interference of several droplets indicating that this stable many-body state is phase coherent.

abstract: Ultrahigh enhancement of Stokes Raman scattering in plasmonic hotspots can create a considerable number of molecular vibration phonons at low laser powers. We show that this effect results in and is manifested by a heterogeneous dependence of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering intensity on laser power. By quantization of the molecular vibration coherent state into phonon number states, and by incorporating different Raman activities for different Stokes transitions, we theoretically predict a heterogeneous multi-stage phonon pumping phenomenon for resonant Raman molecules, which includes a saturation stage and a stimulated phonon emission stage. Experimental results are presented to prove the theory, by measuring gold nanosphere-plane antennas under radially polarized excitation, with a monolayer of malachite green isothiocyanate molecules in the junction gap. The theory and experiment on heterogeneous quantum phonon pumping are fundamental to the understanding of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering and its photobleaching behavior.
