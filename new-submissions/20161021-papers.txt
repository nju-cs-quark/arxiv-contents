abstract: We investigate a laser model for a resonant system of photons and ion-solvated water molecules that combines the mechanisms of Dicke superradiation and a wave-particle interaction. We find that the equations of motion of the system coincide with those of a conventional free electron laser system. This laser model is applicable to the system of an action potential mediated by local electric charge currents of sodium ions solvated by water in the neuronal axons of the human brain.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We develop a potentially practical proposal for robust quantum state transfer (QST) between two superconducting qubits coupled by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. We show that the partial measurement could drastically enhance the fidelity even when the dissipation of qubits and CPW is considered. Unlike many other schemes for QST, our proposal does not require the couplings between the qubits and the CPW resonator to be strong. In fact, our method works much more efficiently in the weak coupling regime. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the probabilistic nature of partial measurement.

abstract: The rigorous resource framework of quantum coherence has been set up recently and excited a wide variety of interests. Here we show that a quantum cavity optomechanical system, as an emerging platform, can behave with a certain value of quantum coherence at a macroscopic scale. We also find that the difference between the total optomechanical coherence and the sum of the optical and the mechanical coherence just equals their mutual information. Motivated by the detection of the optomechanical entanglement, an experimentally feasible scheme to probe the optomechanical coherence is proposed.

abstract: We report an experimental realisation of a quantum random number generator using a plasmonic beamsplitter. Free-space single photons are converted into propagating single surface plasmon polaritons on a gold stripe waveguide via a grating. The surface plasmons are then guided to a region where they are scattered into one of two possible outputs. The presence of a plasmonic excitation in a given output determines the value of a random bit generated from the quantum scattering process. Using a stream of single surface plasmons injected into the beamsplitter we achieve a quantum random number generation rate of 2.37 Mbits/s even in the presence of loss. We characterise the quality of the random number sequence generated, finding it to be comparable to sequences from other quantum photonic-based devices. The compact nature of our nanophotonic device makes it suitable for tight integration in on-chip applications, such as in quantum computing and communication schemes.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.06345
abstract: We present a family of quantum money schemes with classical verification which display a number of benefits over previous proposals. Our schemes are based on hidden matching quantum retrieval games and they tolerate noise up to 23%, which we conjecture reaches 25% asymptotically as the dimension of the underlying hidden matching states is increased. Furthermore, we prove that 25% is the maximum tolerable noise for a wide class of quantum money schemes with classical verification, meaning our schemes are almost optimally noise tolerant. We use methods in semi-definite programming to prove security in a substantially different manner to previous proposals, leading to two main advantages: first, coin verification involves only a constant number of states (with respect to coin size), thereby allowing for smaller coins; second, the re-usability of coins within our scheme grows linearly with the size of the coin, which is known to be optimal. Lastly, we suggest methods by which the coins in our protocol could be implemented using weak coherent states and verified using existing experimental techniques, even in the presence of detector inefficiencies.

abstract: We show a meaningful theory of classical communication over quantum channels when assisted by no-signalling (NS) and PPT-preserving (PPT) codes, for which both the optimal success probability of a given rate and one-shot $\epsilon$-error capacity are formalized as semidefinite programs (SDPs). Based on this, we obtain improved SDP finite blocklength converse bounds for quantum channels, which also reduce to the finite blocklength converse bound of Polyanskiy, Poor and Verd\'u for classical channels. Furthermore, we derive two SDP strong converse bounds for the classical capacity of a general quantum channel: for any code with a rate exceeding either of the two bounds of the channel, the success probability vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This provides efficiently computable upper bounds for the classical capacity of a general quantum channel for the first time. In particular, we show that the classical capacity of an amplitude damping channel with parameter $\gamma$ is upper bounded by $\log_2(1+\sqrt{1-\gamma})$. Remarkably, we also establish the strong converse property for the classical and private capacities of a new class of quantum channels. Finally, we study the zero-error setting and provide efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot zero-error capacity of a general quantum channel.

abstract: The double-slit experiment is used as the archetypal interference experiment to dramatically demonstrate the quantum weirdness of wave-particle duality. It is a long-held assumption that whether which-way detectors are placed at one slit or both will yield the same results, rendering the second detector redundant. Here we show that the presence of the second detector can have measurable effects on the interference pattern, violating this assumption. We show that this effect forms the basis for a new measure of Born rule violation which is correct to all orders. It opens new experimental opportunities for the accurate testing of the Born rule.

abstract: Several quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols employ iterative sifting. After each quantum transmission round, Alice and Bob disclose part of their setting information (including their basis choices) for the detected signals. The quantum phase of the protocol then ends when the numbers of detected signals per basis exceed certain pre-agreed threshold values. Recently, however, Pfister et al. [New J. Phys. 18 053001 (2016)] showed that iterative sifting makes QKD insecure, especially in the finite key regime, if the parameter estimation for privacy amplification uses the random sampling theory. This implies that a number of existing finite key security proofs could be flawed and cannot guarantee security. Here, we solve this serious problem by showing that the use of Azuma's inequality for parameter estimation makes QKD with iterative sifting secure again. This means that the existing protocols whose security proof employs this inequality remain secure even if they employ iterative sifting. Also, our results highlight a fundamental difference between the random sampling theorem and Azuma's inequality in proving security.

abstract: Given a Hermitian operator $\hat{H}=\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ that is the projection of an oracle $\hat{U}$ by state $|G\rangle$ created with oracle $\hat{G}$, the problem of Hamiltonian simulation is approximating the time evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ at time $t$ with error $\epsilon$. We show that this can be done with query complexity $\mathcal{O}(t+\log{(1/\epsilon))}$ to $\hat{G},\hat{U}$ that is optimal not just in asymptotic limits, but for all values $t,\epsilon$. Furthermore, only $2$ additional ancilla qubits are required in total, together with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional single and two-qubit gates per query. Our approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are $d$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space complexity, as well as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where $\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization' which uses controlled-$\hat{U}$ and controlled-$\hat{G}$ to embed $\hat{H}$ in an invariant $\text{SU}(2)$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of $\hat{H}$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ is a special case.

abstract: In this paper we discuss the scattering effect on entanglement propagation in RCFTs. In our setup, we consider the time evolution of excited states created by the insertion of many local operators. Our results show that because of the finiteness of quantum dimension, entanglement is not changed after the scattering in RCFTs. In this mean, entanglement is conserved after the scattering event in RCFTs, which reflects the integrability of the system. Our results are also consistent with the free quasiparticle picture after the global quenches.

abstract: Because global topological properties are robust against local perturbations, understanding and manipulating the topological properties of physical systems is essential in advancing quantum science and technology. For quantum computation, topologically protected qubit operations can increase computational robustness, and for metrology the quantized Hall effect directly defines the von Klitzing constant. Fundamentally, topological order is generated by singularities called topological defects in extended spaces, and is quantified in terms of Chern numbers, each of which measures different sorts of fields traversing surfaces enclosing these topological singularities. Here, inspired by high energy theories, we describe our synthesis and characterization of a singularity present in non-Abelian gauge theories - a Yang monopole - using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a five-dimensional space, and quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on enclosing manifolds. While the well-known 1st Chern number vanished, the 2nd Chern number, measured for the first time in any physical settings, did not. By displacing the manifold, we then observed a phase transition from "topological" to "trivial" as the monopole left the manifold.

abstract: Many studies of quantum-size heat engines assume that the dynamics of an internal system is unitary and that the extracted work is equal to the energy loss of the internal system. Both assumptions, however, should be under scrutiny. In the present paper, we analyze quantum-scale heat engines, employing the measurement-based formulation of the work extraction recently introduced by Hayashi and Tajima~[arXiv:1504.06150]. We first demonstrate the inappropriateness of the unitary time evolution of the internal system (namely the first assumption above) using a simple two-level system; we show that the variance of the energy transferred to an external system diverges when the dynamics of the internal system is approximated to a unitary time evolution. We second derive the quantum Jarzynski equality based on the formulation of Hayashi and Tajima as a relation for the work measured by an external macroscopic apparatus. The right-hand side of the equality reduces to unity for "natural" cyclic processes, but fluctuates wildly for non-cyclic ones, exceeding unity often. This fluctuation should be detectable in experiments and provide evidence for the present formulation.

abstract: Spintronics aims to exploit the spin degree of freedom in solid state devices for data storage and information processing technologies. The fundamental spintronic device concepts such as creation, manipulation and detection of spin polarization has been demonstrated in semiconductors and spin transistor structures using both the electrical and optical methods. However, an unsolved challenge in the field is the realization of all electrical methods to control the spin polarization and spin transistor operation at ambient temperature. For this purpose, two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform due to their remarkable and contrasting spintronic properties, such as weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene and strong SOC in molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). Here we combine graphene and MoS$_2$ in a van der Waals heterostructure to realize the electric control of the spin polarization and spin lifetime, and demonstrated a spin field-effect transistor (spin-FET) at room temperature in a non-local measurement geometry. We observe electrical gate control of the spin valve signal due to pure spin transport and Hanle spin precession signals in the graphene channel in proximity with MoS$_2$ at room temperature. We show that this unprecedented control over the spin polarization and lifetime stems from the gate-tuning of the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/graphene interface and MoS$_2$ channel conductivity leading to spin interaction with high SOC material. The all-electrical creation, transport and control of the spin polarization in a spin-FET device at room temperature is a substantial step in the field of spintronics. It opens a new platform for the interplay of spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom for testing a plethora of exotic physical phenomena, which can be key building blocks in future device architectures.

abstract: Single photon superradiance is a strong enhancement of spontaneous emission appearing when a single excitation is shared between a large number of two-level systems. This enhanced rate can be accompanied by a shift of the emission frequency, the cooperative Lamb shift, issued from the exchange of virtual photons between the emitters. In this work we present a semiconductor optoelectronic device allowing the observation of these two phenomena at room temperature. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that plasma oscillations in spatially separated quantum wells interact through real and virtual photon exchange. This gives rise to a superradiant mode displaying a large cooperative Lamb shift.
