abstract: The gate version of quantum computation exploits several quantum key resources as superposition and entanglement to reach an outstanding performance. In the way, this theory was constructed adopting certain supposed processes imitating classical computer gates. As for optical as well as magnetic systems, those gates are obtained as quantum evolutions. Despite, in certain cases they are attained as an asymptotic series of evolution effects. The current work exploits the direct sum of the evolution operator on a non-local basis for the driven bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model to construct a set of equivalent universal gates as straight evolutions for this interaction. The prescriptions to get these gates are reported as well as a general procedure to evaluate their performance.

abstract: The ability to measure every quantum observable is ensured by a fundamental result in quantum measurement theory. Nevertheless, additive conservation laws associated with physical symmetries, such as the angular momentum conservation, may lead to restrictions on the measurability of the observables. Such limitations are imposed by the theorem of Wigner, Araki and Yanase (WAY). In this paper a new formulation of the WAY-theorem is presented rephrasing the measurability limitations in terms of quantum incompatibility. This broader mathematical basis enables us to both capture and generalise the WAY-theorem by allowing to drop the assumptions of additivity and even conservation of the involved quantities. Moreover, we extend the WAY-theorem to the general level of positive operator valued measures.

abstract: Squeezed-state interferometry plays an important role in quantum-enhanced optical phase estimation, as it allows the estimation precision to be improved up to the Heisenberg limit by using ideal photon-number-resolving detectors at the output ports. Here we show that for each individual $N$% -photon component of the phase-matched coherent $\otimes $ squeezed vacuum input state, the classical Fisher information always saturates the quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the total Fisher information is the sum of the contributions from each individual $N$-photon components, where the largest $N$ is limited by the finite number resolution of available photon counters. Based on this observation, we provide approximate formula that quantifies the amount of lost information due to the finite photon number resolution, e.g., given the mean photon number $\bar{n}$ in the input state, $96$ percent of the Heisenberg limit can be achieved with the number resolution $\gtrsim 5\bar{n}$.

abstract: In the macroscopic reality of our daily live, quantum phenomena such as entanglement are not observable. However, the constituent parts of this classical realm, e.g., atoms or photons, are almost completely determined by the laws of quantum physics. Yet, theory and experiments cannot predict a sharp borderline between the classical and the quantum domain. So, at which point does one lose the information of the quantum correlations in many-particle systems? For addressing this question, we explore the theory of entangled quantum systems of harmonic oscillators consisting of an arbitrary number of interacting particles. We introduce the operational measure of the entanglement visibility to access the measurable entanglement, which will be applied especially to energy measurements. Moreover, the properties of the energy spectrum of entangled and separable states are compared. Our analytical analysis suggest that the entanglement visibility decays with the number of particles without the need of any decoherence process. To strengthen this claim, we also derive and apply a method to detect entanglement in systems without a fixed, but a fluctuating number of particles. In this context, we further study the thermal states of the given correlated system together with the temperature dependence of entanglement.

abstract: We study the symmetry properties in the dynamics of quantum correlations for two-qubit systems in one-sided noisy channels, with respect to a switch in the location of noise from one qubit to the other. We consider four different channel types, namely depolarizing, amplitude damping, bit-flip, and bit-phase-flip channel, and identify the classes of initial states leading to symmetric decay of entanglement, non-locality and discord. Our results show that the symmetric decay of quantum correlations is not directly linked to the presence or absence of symmetry in the initial state, while it does depend on the type of correlation considered as well as on the type noise. We prove that asymmetric decay can be used to infer, in certain cases, characteristic properties of the channel. We also show that the location of noise may lead to dramatic changes in the persistence of phenomena such as entanglement sudden death and time-invariant discord.

abstract: We introduce the concept of "absolutely classical" spin states, in analogy to absolutely separable states of bi-partite quantum systems. Absolutely classical states are states that remain classical under any unitary transformation applied to them. We investigate the maximum ball of absolutely classical states centered on the fully mixed state that can be inscribed into the set of classical states, and derive a lower bound for its radius as function of the total spin quantum number. The result is compared to the case of absolutely separable states.

abstract: We analyse a relativistic scalar particle with a position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation by showing that relativistic bound states solutions can be achieved. Further, we consider the presence of the Coulomb potential and analyse the relativistic position-dependent mass system subject to the Coulomb potential in the spacetime with a space-like dislocation. We also show that a new set of relativistic bound states solutions can be obtained, where there also exists the influence of torsion of the relativistic energy levels. Finally, we investigate an analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for bound states in this position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation.

abstract: We propose that measurements of time-of-arrival correlations in multi-partite systems can sharply distinguish between different approaches to the time-of-arrival problem. To show this, we construct a Positive-Operator-Valued measure for two distinct time-of-arrival measurements in a bipartite system, and we prove that the resulting probabilities differ strongly from ones defined in terms of probability currents. We also prove that time-of-arrival correlations are entanglement witnesses, a result suggesting the use of temporal observables for quantum information processing tasks. Finally, we construct the probabilities for sequential time-of-arrival measurements on a single particle. We derive the state-reduction rule for time-of-arrival measurements; it differs significantly from the standard one, because time-of-arrival measurements are not defined at a single predetermined moment of time.

abstract: In this work we analyze the simultaneous emergence of diffusive energy transport and local thermalization in a nonequilibrium one-dimensional quantum system, as a result of integrability breaking. Specifically, we discuss the local properties of the steady state induced by thermal boundary driving in a XXZ spin chain with staggered magnetic field. By means of efficient large-scale matrix product simulations of the equation of motion of the system, we calculate its steady state in the long-time limit.We start by discussing the energy transport supported by the system, finding it to be ballistic in the integrable limit and diffusive when the staggered field is finite. Subsequently, we examine the reduced density operators of neighboring sites and find that for large systems they are well approximated by local thermal states of the underlying Hamiltonian in the nonintegrable regime, even for weak staggered fields. In the integrable limit, on the other hand, this behavior is lost, and the identification of local temperatures is no longer possible. Our results agree with the intuitive connection between energy diffusion and thermalization.

abstract: We show that many-body localization, which exists in tight-binding models, is unstable in a continuum. Irrespective of the dimensionality of the system, many-body localization does not survive the unbounded growth of the single-particle localization length with increasing energy that is characteristic of the continuum limit. The system remains delocalized down to arbitrarily small temperature $T$, although its dynamics slows down as $T$ decreases. Remarkably, the conductivity vanishes with decreasing $T$ faster than in the Arrhenius law. The system can be characterized by an effective $T$-dependent single-particle mobility edge which diverges in the limit of $T\to 0$. Delocalization is driven by interactions between hot electrons above the mobility edge and the "bath" of thermal electrons in the vicinity of the Fermi level.

abstract: Narrow-band intensity-difference squeezing (IDS) beams have important applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. The best way to generate narrow-band IDS is to employ parametrically-amplified (PA) four-wave mixing (FWM) process in high-gain atomic media. Such IDS can be further enhanced by cascading multiple PA-FWM processes in separate atomic media. The complicated experimental setup, added losses and mechanical stability can limit the wide uses of such scheme in practical applications. Here, we show that by modulating/dressing the internal energy level(s) with additional laser(s), the degree of original IDS can be substantially increased. With an initial IDS of $-4.0\pm0.1$ dB using PA-non-degenerate-FWM process in a three-level $\Lambda$-type configuration, the degree of IDS can be enhanced to $-7.0\pm0.1$ dB/$-8.1\pm0.1$ dB when we use one/two laser beam(s) to modulate the involved ground/excited state(s). Our results show a low-loss, robust and efficient way to produce high degree of IDS and facilitate its potential applications.

abstract: Morse potential $V_M(x)= g^2\exp (2x)-g(2h+1)\exp(x)$ is defined on the full line, $-\infty<x<\infty$ and it defines an exactly solvable 1-d quantum mechanical system with finitely many discrete eigenstates. By taking its right half $0\le x<\infty$ and glueing it with the left half of its mirror image $V_M(-x)$, $-\infty<x\le0$, the symmetric Morse potential $V(x)= g^2\exp (2|x|)-g(2h+1)\exp(|x|)$ is obtained. The quantum mechanical system of this piecewise analytic potential has infinitely many discrete eigenstates with the corresponding eigenfunctions given by the Whittaker W function. The eigenvalues are the square of the zeros of the Whittaker function $W_{k,\nu}(x)$ and its linear combination with $W'_{k,\nu}(x)$ as a function of $\nu$ with fixed $k$ and $x$. This quantum mechanical system seems to offer an interesting example for discussing the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture on the pure imaginary zeros of Riemann zeta function on Re$(s)=\tfrac12$.

abstract: We present a matrix-product state (MPS)-based quadratically convergent density-matrix renormalization group self-consistent-field (DMRG-SCF) approach. Following a proposal by Werner and Knowles (JCP 82, 5053, (1985)), our DMRG-SCF algorithm is based on a direct minimization of an energy expression which is correct to second-order with respect to changes in the molecular orbital basis. We exploit a simultaneous optimization of the MPS wave function and molecular orbitals in order to achieve quadratic convergence. In contrast to previously reported (augmented Hessian) Newton-Raphson and super-configuration-interaction algorithms for DMRG-SCF, energy convergence beyond a quadratic scaling is possible in our ansatz. Discarding the set of redundant active-active orbital rotations, the DMRG-SCF energy converges typically within two to four cycles of the self-consistent procedure

abstract: We consider the computation of the Loschmidt echo after quantum quenches in the interacting $XXZ$ Heisenberg spin chain both for real and imaginary times. We study two-site product initial states, focusing in particular on the N\'eel and tilted N\'eel states. We apply the Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) approach to derive generalized TBA equations, which follow from the fusion hierarchy of the appropriate QTM's. Our formulas are valid for arbitrary imaginary time and for real times at least up to a time $t_0$, after which the integral equations have to be modified. In some regimes, $t_0$ is seen to be either very large or infinite, allowing to explore in detail the post-quench dynamics of the system. As an important part of our work, we show that for the N\'eel state our imaginary time results can be recovered by means of the quench action approach, unveiling a direct connection with the quantum transfer matrix formalism. In particular, we show that in the zero-time limit, the study of our TBA equations allows for a simple alternative derivation of the recently obtained Bethe ansatz distribution functions for the N\'eel, tilted N\'eel and tilted ferromagnet states.
