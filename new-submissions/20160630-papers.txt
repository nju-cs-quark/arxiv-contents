abstract: We provide a characterization of energy in the form of exchanged heat and work between two interacting constituents of a closed, bipartite, correlated quantum system. By defining a binding energy we derive a consistent quantum formulation of the first law of thermodynamics, in which the role of correlations becomes evident, and this formulation reduces to the standard classical picture in relevant systems. We next discuss the emergence of the second law of thermodynamics under certain---but fairly general---conditions such as the Markovian assumption. We illustrate the role of correlations and interactions in thermodynamics through two examples.

abstract: We propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical parametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly with the assistance of Coulomb interaction. We show that the Coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement. Due to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump driving the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field, the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly. We find that there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the Coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously. Therefore, the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with the assistance of Coulomb interaction. The results of numerical simulation show that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the stability of a two cascaded cavity optomechanical system with optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) inside the two coupled cavities, and study the steady-state entanglement between two distant mechanical resonators. We show that the parameter regime where the system is unstable without OPAs, such as relatively high laser intensity and blue detuning, can be exploited to build the steady-state mechanical entanglement by modulating the parametric gain. The application of OPAs is helpful to preserve the mechanical entanglement suffered from the dissipation at some finite temperature. The scheme provides an alternative way for improving and engineering the quantum entanglement of two distant mechanical oscillators.

abstract: We study the phase sensitivity in the conventional $SU(2)$ and nonconventional $SU(1,1)$ interferometers with the Gaussian input states via the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. We explicitly construct the measurement schemes that gives the optimal phase sensitivities. For practical cases, we show that in the presence of photon loss, both interferometers with proper homodyne measurements, are nearly optimal. We also find that unlike the coherent state, the effects of the imperfect detector on the phase sensitivity cannot be asymptotically removed for the squeezed state.

abstract: We introduce the driven discrete time quantum walk, where walkers are added during the walk instead of only at the beginning. This leads to interference in walker number and very different dynamics when compared to the original quantum walk. These dynamics have two regimes, which we illustrate using the one-dimensional line. Then, we explore a search application which has certain advantages over current search protocols, namely that it does not require a complicated initial state nor a specific measurement time to observe the marked state. Finally, we describe a potential experimental implementation using existing technology.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.09007
abstract: We develop a theory of optomechanical cooling with a squeezed input light field. We show that Stokes heating transitions can be \emph{fully} suppressed when the driving field is squeezed below the vacuum noise level at an appropriately selected squeezing phase and for a finite amount of squeezing. The quantum backaction limit to laser cooling is therefore moved down to zero and the resulting final temperature is eventually solely determined by the ratio between the thermal phonon number and the optomechanical cooperativity parameter independently of the actual values of the cavity linewidth and mechanical frequency. The cooling rate remains instead unchanged with respect to standard optomechanical cooling schemes.

abstract: Quantum discord in a bipartite system can be dynamically revealed and quantified through purely local operations on one of the two subsystems. To achieve this, the local detection method harnesses the influence of initial correlations on the reduced dynamics of an interacting bipartite system. This article's aim is to provide an accessible introduction to this method and to review recent theoretical and experimental progress.

abstract: We construct an exact map between a tight-binding model on any bipartite lattice in presence of dephasing noise and a Hubbard model with imaginary interaction strength. In one dimension, the exact many-body Liouvillian spectrum can be obtained by application of the Bethe ansatz method. We find that both the non-equilibrium steady state and the leading decay modes describing the relaxation at late times are related to the eta-pairing symmetry of the Hubbard model. We show that there is a remarkable relation between the time-evolution of an arbitrary k-point correlation function in the dissipative system and k-particle states of the corresponding Hubbard model.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We investigate the applicability of the two major approximations which are most commonly employed in the study of the quantum Rabi model, namely the description of a resonant cavity mode as a single-mode quantized field and the use of the rotating wave approximation. The canonical transformation of the operators of the multi-mode quantized field allows one to partition the Hamiltonian of the system into two parts, namely the interaction with a collective single field mode, which is usually associated with the resonant cavity mode, and the interaction with field fluctuations with respect to the latter. This division enables us to determine the applicability condition of the single-mode approximation. In addition we identify simple approximate relations for the description of the eigenstates, eigenfunctions and the time evolution of the quantum Rabi system beyond the rotating wave approximation.

abstract: A smooth function of the second moments of $N$ continuous variables gives rise to an uncertainty relation if it is bounded from below. We present a method to systematically derive such bounds by generalizing an approach applied previously to a single continuous variable. New uncertainty relations are obtained for multi-partite systems which allow one to distinguish entangled from separable states. We also investigate the geometry of the "uncertainty region" in the $N(2N+1)$-dimensional space of moments. It is shown to be a convex set for any number continuous variables, and the points on its boundary found to be in one-to-one correspondence with pure Gaussian states of minimal uncertainty. For a single degree of freedom, the boundary can be visualized as one sheet of a "Lorentz-invariant" hyperboloid in the three-dimensional pace of second moments.

abstract: Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past years. However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum Computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of computing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum computing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework.

abstract: In May 2016 IBM released access to its 5-qubit quantum computer to the scientific community, its "IBM Quantum Experience" since acquiring over 25,000 users from students, educators and researchers around the globe. In the short time since the "IBM Quantum Experience" became available, a flurry of research results on 5-qubit systems have been published derived from the platform hardware. Quintuple is an open-source object-oriented Python module implementing the simulation of the "IBM Quantum Experience" hardware. Quintuple quantum algorithms can be programmed and run via a custom language fully compatible with the "IBM Quantum Experience" or in pure Python. Over 40 example programs are provided with expected results, including Grover's Algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Quintuple contributes to the study of 5-qubit systems and the development and debugging of quantum algorithms for deployment on the "IBM Quantum Experience" hardware.

abstract: The constraints arising for a general set of causal relations, both classically and quantumly, are still poorly understood. As a step in exploring this question, we consider a coherently controlled superposition of "direct-cause" and "common-cause" relationships between two events. We propose an implementation involving the spatial superposition of a mass and general relativistic time dilation. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient method to distinguish such genuinely quantum causal structures from classical (incoherent) mixtures of causal structures and show how to design experimental verifications of the "quantumness" of a causal structure.

abstract: We present new solution of the the connection problem for local solutions to the general Heun equation. Our approach is based on the symmetric form of the Heun's differential equation \cite{Fiziev14,Fiziev16} with four different regular singular points $z_{1,2,3,4}$. The four special regular points in the complex plane: $Z_{123},Z_{234},Z_{341},Z_{412}$ are the centers of the circles, defined by the different triplets $\{z_k,z_l,z_m\}$ with corresponding different indexes and play fundamental role, since the coefficients of the connection matrix can be expressed using the values of local solutions of the general Heun's equation at these points. A special case when all coefficients can be calculated using only one of the points $Z_{klm}$ is also considered.

abstract: We report on the anisotropic expansion of ultracold bosonic dysprosium gases at temperatures above quantum degeneracy and develop a quantitative theory to describe this behavior. The theory expresses the post-expansion aspect ratio in terms of temperature and microscopic collisional properties by incorporating Hartree-Fock mean-field interactions, hydrodynamic effects, and Bose-enhancement factors. Our results extend the utility of expansion imaging by providing accurate thermometry for dipolar thermal Bose gases, reducing error in expansion thermometry from tens of percent to only a few percent. Furthermore, we present a simple method to determine scattering lengths in dipolar gases, including near a Feshbach resonance, through observation of thermal gas expansion.

abstract: We analyze theoretically the many-body dynamics of a dissipative Ising model in a transverse field using a variational approach. We find that the steady state phase diagram is substantially modified compared to its equilibrium counterpart, including the appearance of a multicritical point belonging to a different universality class. Building on our variational analysis, we establish a field-theoretical treatment corresponding to a dissipative variant of a Ginzburg-Landau theory, which allows us to compute the upper critical dimension of the system. Finally, we present a possible experimental realization of the dissipative Ising model using ultracold Rydberg gases.

journal: 
subjects: Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.09078
abstract: We report a theoretical study of ac response of superconducting quantum metamaterials (SQMs), i.e. an array of qubits (two-levels system) embedded in the low-dissipative resonator. By making use of a particular example of SQM, namely the array of charge qubits capacitively coupled to the resonator, we obtain a second-order phase transition between an incoherent (the high-temperature phase) and coherent (the low-temperatures phase) states of photons. This phase transition in many aspects resembles the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. The critical temperature of the phase transition, $T^\star$, is determined by the energy splitting of two-level systems $\delta$, number of qubits in the array $N$, and the strength of the interaction $\eta$ between qubits and photons in the cavity. We obtain that the photon states manifest themselves by resonant drops in the frequency dependent transmission $D(\omega)$ of electromagnetic waves propagating through a transmission line weakly coupled to the SQM. At high temperatures the $D(\omega)$ displays a single resonant drop, and at low temperatures a peculiar \emph{double resonance response} has to be observed. The physical origin of such a resonant splitting is the quantum oscillations between two coherent states of photons of different polarizations.

abstract: We present an apparatus that converts every pulse of a pulsed light source to a pulse train in which the intensities of the different pulses are samples of the spatial or temporal frequency spectrum of the original pulse. In this way, the spectrum of the incident light can be measured by following the temporal response of a single detector. The apparatus is based on multiple round-trips inside a 2f- cavity-like mirror arrangement in which the spectrum is spread on the back focal plane, where after each round-trip a small section of the spectrum is allowed to escape. The apparatus is fibre-free, offers easy wavelength range tunability, and a prototype built achieves over 10% average efficiency in the near infra red. We demonstrate the application of the prototype for the efficient measurement of the joint spectrum of a non-degenerate bi-photon source in which one of the photons is in the near infra red.

abstract: We present a conjugate-gradient method for the ground-state optimisation of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in the thermodynamic limit, as a direct implementation of the variational principle within the PEPS manifold. Our optimisation is based on an efficient and accurate evaluation of the gradient of the global energy functional by using effective corner environments, and is robust with respect to the initial starting points. It has the additional advantage that physical and virtual symmetries can be straightforwardly implemented. We provide the tools to compute static structure factors directly in momentum space, as well as the variance of the Hamiltonian. We benchmark our method on Ising and Heisenberg models, and show a significant improvement on the energies and order parameters as compared to algorithms based on imaginary-time evolution.
