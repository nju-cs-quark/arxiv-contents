abstract: We study a general double Dirac delta potential to show that this is the simplest yet versatile solvable potential to introduce double wells, avoided crossings, resonances and perfect transmission ($T=1$). Perfect transmission energies turn out to be the critical property of symmetric and anti-symmetric cases wherein these discrete energies are found to correspond to the eigenvalues of Dirac delta potential placed symmetrically between two rigid walls. For well(s) or barrier(s), perfect transmission [or zero reflectivity, $R(E)$] at energy $E=0$ is non-intuitive. However, earlier this has been found and called "threshold anomaly". Here we show that it is a critical phenomena and we can have $ 0 \le R(0)<1$ when the parameters of the double delta potential satisfy an interesting condition. We also invoke zero-energy and zero curvature eigenstate ($\psi(x)=Ax+B$) of delta well between two symmetric rigid walls for $R(0)=0$. We resolve that the resonant energies and the perfect transmission energies are different and they arise differently.

abstract: We study the set of no-signalling empirical models on a measurement scenario, and show that the combinatorial structure of the no-signalling polytope is completely determined by the possibilistic information given by the support of the models. This is a special case of a general result which applies to all polytopes presented in a standard form, given by linear equations together with non-negativity constraints on the variables.

abstract: In two recent papers (Phys. Rev. A90 (2014), 062121 and Phys. Rev. A91 (2015), 052110) an interesting method of analyzing the breaking of Bell inequalities has been proposed which is based on the theory of finite group representations. We apply here this method to more complicated example of $S_4$ symmetry. We show how the Bell inequality can be related to the symmetries of regular tetrahedron. By choosing the orbits of threedimensional representation of $S_4$ determined by the geometry of tetrahedron we find that the Bell inequality under consideration is broken in quantum theory. The corresponding nonlocal game is analyzed.

abstract: We discuss the energetic cost of superadiabatic models of quantum computation. Specifically, we investigate the energy-time complementarity in general transitionless controlled evolutions and in shortcuts to the adiabatic quantum search over an unstructured list. We show that the additional energy resources required by superadiabaticity for arbitrary controlled evolutions can be minimized by using probabilistic dynamics, so that the optimal success probability is fixed by the choice of the evolution time. In the case of analog quantum search, we show that the superadiabatic approach induces a non-oracular counter-diabatic Hamiltonian, with the same energy-time complexity as equivalent adiabatic implementations.

abstract: We examine two proposals for marginally self-correcting quantum memory, the cubic code by Haah and the welded code by Michnicki. In particular, we prove explicitly that they are absent of topological order above zero temperature, as their Gibbs ensembles can be prepared via a short-depth quantum circuit from classical ensembles. Our proof technique naturally gives rise to the notion of free energy associated with excitations. Further, we develop a framework for an ergodic decomposition of Davies generators in CSS codes which enables formal reduction to simpler classical memory problems. We then show that memory time in the welded code is doubly exponential in inverse temperature via the Peierls argument. These results introduce further connections between thermal topological order and self-correction from the viewpoint of free energy and quantum circuit depth.

abstract: A new scenario for energy distribution, security and shareability is presented that assumes the availability of quantum information heat engines and a thermal bath. It is based on the convertibility between entropy and work in the presence of a thermal reservoir. Our approach to the informational content of physical systems that are distributed between users is complementary to the conventional perspective of quantum communication. The latter places the value on the unpredictable content of the transmitted quantum states, while our interest focuses on their certainty. Some well-known results in quantum communication are reused in this context. Particularly, we describe a way to securely distribute quantum states to be used for unlocking energy from thermal sources. We also consider some multi-partite entangled and classically correlated states for a collaborative multi-user sharing of work extraction possibilities.

abstract: We provide examples where Simon's algorithm can be used to show insecurity of cryptographic symmetric-key primitives in a post-quantum setting. Specifically, these examples consist of a quantum distinguisher for the 3-round Feistel Network and a forgery attack on CBC-MAC which forges a tag for a chosen-prefix message querying only other messages (of the same length). We assume that an adversary has quantum-oracle access to the respective classical primitives. These results shed new light on the post-quantum security of commonly used cryptoschemes.

abstract: Quantum steering is a relatively simple test for quantumness of correlations, proving that the values of quantum-mechanical measurement outcomes come into being only in the act of measurement. By exploiting quantum correlations Alice can influence -- steer -- Bob's physical system in a way inaccessible in classical world, leading to violation of some inequalities. Demonstrating this and similar quantum effects for systems of increasing size, approaching even the classical limit, is a long-standing challenging problem. Here we provide experimentally feasible signature of unbounded violation of a steering inequality. We derive its universal form where tolerance for measurement-setting-errors is explicitly build-in by means of the Deutsch-Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation. Then, generalizing the mutual unbiasedness, we apply the inequality to the multi-singlet and multi-particle bipartite Bell-state. However, the method is general and opens the possibility of employing multi-particle bipartite steering for randomness certification and development of quantum technologies, e.g.\ random access codes.

abstract: We demonstrate a novel scheme to generate frequency-entangled qudits with dimension number higher than 10 and to distribute them over optical fibers of 15 km in total length. This scheme combines the technique of spectral engineering of biphotons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the technique of spectrally resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We characterized the comb-like spectral correlation structures of the qudits by time of arrival measurement and correlated spectral intensity measurement. The generation and distribution of the distinct entangled frequency modes may be useful for quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, quantum remote synchronization, as well as fundamental test of stronger violation of local realism.

abstract: Machine learning applications are limited by computational power. In this paper, we gain novel insights into the application of quantum annealing (QA) to machine learning (ML) through experiments in natural language processing (NLP), seizure prediction, and linear separability testing. These experiments are performed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared to an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an early implementation of a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer, via resampling and ensembling of predicted probabilities to produce a more robust class estimator. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, resampled QBoost (RQBoost) is tested across several datasets and compared to QBoost and traditional ML. We show and explain how QBoost in combination with a commercial QA device are unable to perfectly separate binary class data which is linearly separable via logistic regression with shrinkage. We further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure prediction and find QA-enabled ML using QBoost and RQBoost is outperformed by traditional techniques. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of algorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of this QA hardware. Through these experiments, we provide unique insights into the state of quantum ML via boosting and the use of quantum annealing hardware that are valuable to institutions interested in applying QA to problems in ML and beyond.

abstract: The Sagnac speed meter interferometer topology can potentially provide enhanced sensitivity to gravitational waves in the audio-band compared to equivalent Michelson interferometers. A challenge with the Sagnac speed meter interferometer arises from the intrinsic lack of sensitivity at low frequencies where the velocity-proportional signal is smaller than the noise associated with the sensing of the signal. Using as an example the on-going proof-of-concept Sagnac speed meter experiment in Glasgow, we quantify the problem and present a solution involving the extraction of a small displacement-proportional signal. This displacement signal can be combined with the existing velocity signal to enhance low frequency sensitivity, and we derive optimal filters to accomplish this for different signal strengths. We show that the extraction of the displacement signal for low frequency control purposes can be performed without reducing significantly the quantum non-demolition character of this type of interferometer.

abstract: We show that the second law of thermodynamics holds for isolated genuine quantum systems, where pure quantum states obey unitary dynamics, by a rigorous theoretical proof based on the Lieb-Robinson bound and numerical simulation. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem is shown connected to thermodynamic heat, highlighting the foundation of the information-thermodynamics link. Furthermore, we show that the nonequilibrium fluctuation theorem, characterizing the small probability of occasional entropy decrease, holds true for pure quantum states, which implies that thermal fluctuations emerge from purely quantum fluctuations in nonequilibrium dynamics. Our result establishes a scenario that thermodynamics emerges from quantum mechanics, and can experimentally be tested by ultracold atoms.

abstract: In a previous article [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 084108 (2013)], we showed that the transition-state-theory ($t\rightarrow 0_+$) limit of ring-polymer molecular dynamics rate-theory (RPMD-TST) is also the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a new type of quantum flux-side time-correlation function, in which the dividing surfaces are invariant to imaginary-time translation; in other words, that RPMD-TST is a $t\rightarrow 0_+$ quantum transition-state theory (QTST). Recently, Jang and Voth [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 084110 (2016)] rederived this quantum $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit, and claimed that it gives instead the centroid-density approximation. Here we show that the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit derived by Jang and Voth is in fact RPMD-TST.

The confinement is that of a harmonic trap with general anisotropy. Numerical work shows the high accuracy of our expressions. We draw attention to a subtlety involved in the consideration of experimental values of the critical temperature in connection with analytical expressions for the finite-size corrections.

abstract: Given two quantum states of $N$ q-bits we are interested to find the shortest quantum circuit consisting of only one- and two- q-bit gates that would transfer one state into another. We call it the quantum maze problem for the reasons described in the paper. We argue that in a large $N$ limit the quantum maze problem is equivalent to the problem of finding a semiclassical trajectory of some lattice field theory (the dual theory) on an $N+1$ dimensional space-time with geometrically flat, but topologically compact spatial slices. The spatial fundamental domain is an $N$ dimensional hyper-rhombohedron, and the temporal direction describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary target state. We first consider a complex Klein-Gordon field theory and argue that it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not involve generators composed of tensor products of multiple Pauli $Z$ matrices. Since such situation is not generic we call it the $Z$-problem. On the dual field theory side the $Z$-problem corresponds to massless excitations of the phase (Goldstone modes) that we attempt to fix using Higgs mechanism. The simplest dual theory which does not suffer from the massless excitation (or from the $Z$-problem) is the Abelian-Higgs model which we argue can be used for finding the shortest quantum circuits. Since every trajectory of the field theory is mapped directly to a quantum circuit, the shortest quantum circuits are identified with semiclassical trajectories. We also discuss the complexity of an actual algorithm that uses a dual theory prospective for solving the quantum maze problem and compare it with a geometric approach. We argue that it might be possible to solve the problem in sub-exponential time in $2^N$, but for that we must consider the Klein-Gordon theory on curved spatial geometry and/or more complicated (than $N$-torus) topology.
