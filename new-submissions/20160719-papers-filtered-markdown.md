**1.    The Complexity of Quantum States and Transformations: From Quantum Money to Black Holes**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1607.05256  
<blockquote>
<p>
These are lecture notes from a weeklong course in quantum complexity theory taught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016. The focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates needed to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary transformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent interest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and advice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against counterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information paradox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by Harlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience of theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and starts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in general.

**2.    Hamiltonian Tomography of Photonic Lattices**  
Ruichao Ma, Clai Owens, Aman LaChapelle, David I. Schuster, Jonathan Simon

<blockquote>
<p>
In this letter we introduce a novel approach to Hamiltonian tomography of non-interacting tight-binding photonic lattices. To begin with, we prove that the matrix element of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian between sites $i$ and $j$ may be obtained directly from $S_{ij}(\omega)$, the (suitably normalized) two-port measurement between sites $i$ and $j$ at frequency $\omega$. This general result enables complete characterization of both on-site energies and tunneling matrix elements in arbitrary lattice networks by spectroscopy, and suggests that coupling between lattice sites is actually a topological property of the two-port spectrum. We further provide extensions of this technique for measurement of band-projectors in finite, disordered systems with good flatness ratios, and apply the tool to direct real-space measurement of the Chern number. Our approach demonstrates the extraordinary potential of microwave quantum circuits for exploration of exotic synthetic materials, providing a clear path to characterization and control of single-particle properties of Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard lattices. More broadly, we provide a robust, unified method of spectroscopic characterization of linear networks from photonic crystals to microwave lattices and everything in-between.
