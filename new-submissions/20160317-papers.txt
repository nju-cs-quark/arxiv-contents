abstract: The idea that decoherence in a unitary-only quantum theory suffices to explain emergence of classical phenomena has been shown in the peer-reviewed literature to be seriously flawed due to circularity. However, claims continue to be made that this approach, also known as "Quantum Darwinism," is the correct way to understand classical emergence. This Letter reviews the basic problem and points out an additional logical flaw in the argument. It is concluded that the "Quantum Darwinism" program fails.

abstract: In contrast to strong projective measurement, which freezes the system evolution by quantum Zeno effect, weak measurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to nontrivial effects. Here we consider global weak measurement addressing several bosonic modes at the same time, thus preserving quantum superpositions due to the lack of which path information. While for certainty we focus on ultracold atoms, the idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems, including various quantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely photonic systems with multiple-path interferometers. We show that light scattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining macroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent dynamics. Even for constant external measurement, the quantum measurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi-periodically and induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms. We introduce an effective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an analytic solution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its stable point. We confirm our finding describing the atomic observables in terms of stochastic differential equations.

abstract: The vacuum state of a relativistic quantum field contains entanglement between regions separated by spacelike intervals. Such spatial entanglement can be revealed using an operational method introduced in Ann. Phys. 351, 112 (2014), Phys. Rev. D 91, 016005 (2014). In this approach, a cavity is instantaneously divided into halves by an introduction of an extra perfect mirror. Causal separation of the two regions of the cavity reveals nonlocal spatial correlations present in the field, which can be quantified by measuring particles generated in the process. We use this method to study spatial entanglement properties of nonvacuum Gaussian field states. In particular we show how to enhance the amount of harvested spatial entanglement by an appropriate choice of the initial state of the field in the cavity. We find a counterintuitive influence of the initial entanglement between cavity modes on the spatial entanglement which is revealed by dividing the cavity in half.

abstract: We examine non-Markovian effects in an open quantum system from the point of view of information flow. To this end, we consider the spin-boson model with a cold reservoir, accounting for the exact time-dependent correlations between the system and the bath to study the exchange of information and heat. We use an information theoretic measure of the relevant memory effects and demonstrate that the information backflow from the reservoir to the system does not necessarily correlate with the backflow of heat. We also examine the influence of temperature and coupling strength on the loss and gain of information between the system and the bath. Finally, we discuss how additional driving changes the backflow of information, giving rise to potential applications in reservoir engineering.

abstract: This paper extends previous results on constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a quantum harmonic oscillator system. In this case, we consider a complex linear quantum system plant consisting of a network of quantum harmonic oscillators. Conditions are given for which there exists a direct coupling observer which estimates a collection of variables in the quantum plant. It is shown that the order of the observer can be the same as the number of variables to be estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced order observer.

abstract: This paper surveys some recent results on the theory of quantum linear systems and presents them within a unified framework. Quantum linear systems are a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of quantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described or approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities, beam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical squeezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum technology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new challenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error correction, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom lasers, and superconducting quantum circuits. A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear systems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear system. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent quantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum information, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This paper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal controllers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An important issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems and in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of physical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given set of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of quantum mechanics.

abstract: In this contribution a geometric approach to describe a rotating fullerene molecule with Ih symmetry is developed. We analyze the quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in continuum limit considering a description of fullerene in a spherical solution of the G\"odel-type space-time with a topological defect. As a result, we study the molecule in a rotating frame. Also we combine the well know non-Abelian monopole approach with this geometric description, including the case of the presence of the external Aharonov-Bohm flux. The energy levels and the persistent current for this study are obtained, and we show that they depend on the geometrical and topological properties of the fullerene. Also, we verify recovering of the well known results for limiting cases.

abstract: Slowing/stopping the light travelling in free space with electromagnetically induced transparency to im- plement the optical quantum information processings and store information has been paid much attention in recent years. For the waveguide photons, here, we propose an approach to stop them with a controllable atomic cavity generated by a pair of atomic mirrors; one of them reflects the photon completely and an- other one with the adjustable reflected/transmitted probability of the photons. Based on the full quantum mechanical theory in real space, we show that the reflected/transmitted probability of the waveguide photon with a fixed frequency can be controlled by adjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e., atomic mirrors). As a consequence, the photon can be controllably transmitted/reflected along the waveguide by the aside atomic mirrors with the adjustable atomic energy levels. Ideally, the photons could be stopped in the atomic cavity. This provides a novel mechanism to stop/retravel the waveguide photon in a controllable ways. The feasibility of the proposal with the current integrated optical devices is also discussed.

abstract: The resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) technique is an important approach to increasing the detection efficiency (DE) of typical free-space coupling photons. Here, we show that such a technique can also be utilized to increase the detection probability (DP) of a single waveguide-coupled photon. Based on a fully quantum mechanical theory in real space, we exactly calculated the absorption probability of a single photon for a two-level detector next to the waveguide. We find that the DP of the waveguide photon for the detector in a waveguide-coupled ring cavity is significantly higher than that for the bare detector directly coupled to the photon. Physically, the DP of the photon for the bare detector next to the waveguide is always limited by the finite transmission and reflection probabilities of the photon. The cavity technique is used to store the photon and thus increase its DP. The feasibility of the proposal with current integrated optical devices is then discussed.

abstract: In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We analyze the asymptotic scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for quantum walks on a line. In contrast to the classical random walk there is no connection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay constant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering the initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse power-law behaviour.

abstract: We present an error correcting protocol that enhances the lifetime of stabilizer code based qubits which are susceptible to the creation of pairs of localized defects (due to string-like error operators) at finite temperature, such as the toric code. The primary tool employed is dynamic application of a local, unitary operator which exchanges defects and thereby translates localized excitations. Crucially, the protocol does not require any measurements of stabilizer operators, and therefore can be used to enhance the lifetime of a qubit in the absence of such experimental resources.

abstract: NOON states play the important roles in quantum information processings and quantum metrology, but the fidelities of these states generated previously are limited typically by the practically-unavoidable decoherence and operational imperfections. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to generate photonic NOON states alternatively by rapid population passage technique via shortcut to adiabaticity (STA), rather than the usual Rabi oscillations. Since the deterministic population passages based on the STAs are insensitive to details of the operations and can be implemented as fast as the Rabi oscillations, the fidelity of the generated NOON state could be satisfactorily high. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit QED systems by rapidly driving two artifical qutrits.

abstract: Any tripartite state which saturates the strong subadditivity relation for the quantum entropy is defined as the Markov state.A tripartite pure state describing an open system, its environment and their purifying system isa pure Markov state iff the bipartite marginal state of purifying system and environment is a product state. It has been shown that as long as the purification of the input system-environment state is a pure Markov state the reduced dynamics of the open system can be described, on the support of initial system state, by a quantum channel for every joint unitary evolution of the system-environment composite even in the presence of initial correlations. Entanglement, discord and classical correlations of the initial system-environment states implied by the pure Markov state are analyzed and it has been shown that all these correlations are entirely specified by the entropy of the environment. Some implications concerning perfect quantum error correction procedure and quantum Markovian dynamics are presented.

abstract: We report the dissemination of an ultrastable optical frequency signal to two distant users simultaneously using a branching network. The ultrastable signal is extracted along a main fibre link; it is optically tracked with a narrow-linewidth laser diode, which light is injected in a secondary link. The propagation noise of both links is actively compensated. We implement this scheme with two links of 50-km fibre spools, the extraction being setup at the mid-point of the main link. We show that the extracted signal at the end of the secondary link exhibits fractional frequency instability of 1.4x10-15 at 1-s measurement time, almost equal to the 1.3x10-15 instability of the main link output end. The long-term instabilities are also very similar, at a level of 3-5x10-20 at 3x104-s integration time. We also show that the setting up of this extraction device, or a simpler one, at the main link input, can test the proper functioning of the noise rejection on this main link. This work is a significant step towards a robust and flexible ultra-stable network for multi-users dissemination.

When we consider light as a quantum mechanical object, new ways of information processing become possible. In this review I give an overview how quantum information processing can be implemented with single photons, and what hurdles still need to be overcome to implement the various applications in practice. I will place special emphasis on the quantum mechanical properties of light that make it different from classical light, and how these properties relate to quantum information processing tasks.

abstract: Adiabatic evolution is a powerful technique in quantum information and computation. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different models to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The first model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation, introduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In addition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary $n$-qubit {\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\it state} teleportation. In the second model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show how we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this task can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. These two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the superadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time intervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost necessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.

abstract: Quantum steering is observed when performing appropriate local measurements on an entangled state. Here we discuss the possibility of simulating classically this effect, using classical communication instead of entanglement. We show that infinite communication is necessary for exactly simulating steering for any pure entangled state, as well as for a class of mixed entangled states. Moreover, we discuss the communication cost of steering for general entangled states, as well as approximate simulation. Our findings reveal striking differences between Bell nonlocality and steering, and provide a natural way of measuring the strength of the latter.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the communication cost of reproducing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering correlations arising from bipartite quantum systems. We characterize the set of bipartite quantum states which admits a local hidden state model augmented with $c$ bits of classical communication from an untrusted party (Alice) to a trusted party (Bob). In case of one bit of information ($c=1$), we show that this set has a nontrivial intersection with the sets admitting a local hidden state and a local hidden variables model for projective measurements. On the other hand, we find that an infinite amount of classical communication is required from an untrusted Alice to a trusted Bob to simulate the EPR steering correlations produced by a two-qubit maximally entangled state. It is conjectured that a state-of-the-art quantum experiment would be able to falsify two bits of communication this way.

abstract: We study the angular deflection of the circular polarized components of a linearly polarized probe field in a weakly birefringent atomic system in tripod configuration. A spatially inhomogeneous control field incident obliquely onto an atomic vapor cell facilitates a large angular divergence between circular components. We show that the angular resolution can be dynamically controlled by optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse profile of the control beam. For instance, by employing a Laguerre-Gaussian profile of the control field, one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular components close to the entry face of the atomic vapor cell. We further demonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the probe field, thereby acting as a convex or a concave lens with multiple foci. The absorption in the medium remains negligible at resonance as a cumulative effect of coherent population oscillations (CPO) and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).

abstract: We report on an optimal single-electron charge qubit for a solid-state double quantum dot (DQD) system and analyse its dynamics under a time-dependent linear detuning, using GPU accelerated numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The optimal qubit is found to have basis states defined as the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest energy bonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge qubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this choice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap with an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not localised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires a particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial fiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$. We determine this sequence using pulses that incorporate the expected experimental finite rise times. We also show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere using spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at most two single pulses. Measurement of the optimal qubits is achieved by determining the probability of finding the electron in one of the dots.

abstract: We theoretically studied the implementation of a quantum memory and an optical transistor in a system composed by a single atom trapped inside a high finesse cavity. In order to store and map the quantum state of an input pulse onto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out as an optical transistor) where the information can be transferred to the dark state of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a {\Lambda}-type configuration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the control field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and retrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was obtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by input-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and ii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and commonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best configuration for the optical transistor, the maximum quantum memory efficiency can not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50% for symmetric cavities. On the other hand, with single-sided cavity the quantum memory efficiency increases considerably and can reach values close to 100% in the strong atom-field coupling regime. However this specific setup is not favourable to observe the cavity-EIT effect in the transmission spectrum and then it is not appropriate to control the transmission of light pulses.

abstract: This work aims at understanding the interplay between the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), initial state independent equilibration and quantum chaos in systems that do not have a direct classical counterpart. It is based on numerical investigations of asymmetric Heisenberg spin ladders with varied interaction strengths between the legs, i.e., along the rungs. The relaxation of the energy difference between the legs is investigated. Two different parameters, both intended to quantify the degree of accordance with the ETH, are computed. Both indicate violation of the ETH at large interaction strengths but at different thresholds. Indeed the energy difference is found not to relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction strength which coincides with one of the thresholds. At the same point the level statistics shift from Poisson-type to Wigner-type. Hence the system may be considered to become integrable again in the strong interaction limit.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the decoherence patterns of a topological qubit made of two Majorana zero modes in the generic linear and circular motions in the Minkowski spacetime. We show that the reduced dynamics is exact without Markov approximation. Our results imply that the acceleration will cause thermalization as expected by Unruh effect. However, for the short-time scale, we find the rate of decoherence is anti-correlated with the acceleration, as kind of decoherence impedance. This is in fact related to the "anti-Unruh" phenomenon previously found by studying the transition probability of Unruh-DeWitt detector. We also obtain the information backflow by some time modulations of coupling constant or acceleration, which is a characteristic of the underlying non-Markovian reduced dynamics. Moreover, by exploiting the nonlocal nature of the topological qubit, we find that some incoherent accelerations of the constituent Majorana zero modes can preserve the coherence instead of thermalizing it.

abstract: Photons mediate long-range optomechanical forces between atoms in high finesse resonators, which can induce the formation of ordered spatial patterns. When a transverse laser drives the atoms, the system undergoes a second order phase transition, that separates a uniform spatial density from a Bragg grating maximizing scattering into the cavity and is controlled by the laser intensity. Starting from a Fokker-Planck equation describing the semiclassical dynamics of the $N$-atom distribution function, we systematically develop a mean-field model and analyse its predictions for the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The validity of the mean-field model is tested by comparison with the numerical simulations of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation and by means of a BBGKY hierarchy. The mean-field theory predictions well reproduce several results of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation for sufficiently short times, and are in good agreement with existing theoretical approaches based on field-theoretical models. Mean-field, on the other hand, predicts thermalization time scales which are at least one order of magnitude shorter than the ones predicted by the $N$-body dynamics. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the mean-field ansatz discards the effects of the long-range incoherent forces due to cavity losses.

While high-order spatial modes have been widely exploited for dense coding and high-dimensional quantum information processing, the properties of polarization preservation of high-order spatial beams propagating in turbulent atmosphere have not been comprehensively investigated yet. Here we focus on the properties of polarization preservation of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating along different atmospheric turbulence paths. The analytical expressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been derived. It is shown that the larger the coherence length is, and the larger the beam order m, n are, the less the polarization is changed. We find that the evolution properties of the polarization in slant-down paths through turbulent atmosphere are similar to the case in free space if the condition zenith angle {\xi}<{\pi}/4 is satisfied. While at a long propagation distance, evolution properties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs much from that in free space and in slant paths. The results may allow one to choose the optimal propagation path in terms of specific applications, which is helpful for future experimental implementation of multiple-degrees-of-freedom free-space communication.

abstract: Recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has instigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including near-field radiative heat transfer and many-body dynamics in trapped ultracold atoms and ions. Born-Markov and local thermal equilibrium are two of the most widely used approximations for describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems. The impact of these approximations on dispersion forces, e.g. Casimir-Polder interactions and quantum friction, has often been largely underestimated. Using general theoretical arguments and exactly solvable models, we show that these approximations can lead to erroneous predictions of fluctuation-induced interactions with regard to both strength and functional dependencies on system parameters.

abstract: Gauging is a ubiquitous tool in many-body physics. It allows one to construct highly entangled topological phases of matter from relatively simple phases and to relate certain characteristics of the two. Here we develop a gauging procedure for general submanifold symmetries of Pauli Hamiltonians, including symmetries of fractal type. We show a relation between the pre- and post- gauging models and use this to construct short range entangled phases with fractal like symmetries, one of which is mapped to the cubic code by the gauging.

abstract: Using a graphical presentation of the spin $S$ one dimensional Valence Bond Solid (VBS) state, based on the representation theory of the $SU(2)$ Lie-algebra of spins, we compute the spectrum of a mixed state reduced density matrix. This mixed state of two blocks of spins $A$ and $B$ is obtained by tracing out the spins outside $A$ and $B$, in the pure VBS state density matrix. We find in particular that the negativity of the mixed state is non-zero only for adjacent subsystems. The method introduced here can be generalized to the computation of entanglement properties in Levin-Wen models, that possess a similar algebraic structure to the VBS state in the groundstate.

abstract: A study of the $\lambda$- and $N$-atomic configurations under dipolar interaction with $2$ modes of electromagnetic radiation is presented. The corresponding quantum phase diagrams are obtained by means of a variational procedure. Both configurations exhibit normal and collective (super-radiant) regimes. While the latter in the $\lambda$-configuration divides itself into $2$ subregions, corresponding to each of the modes, that in the $N$-configuration may be divided into $2$ or $3$ subregions depending on whether the field modes divide the atomic system into $2$ separate subsystems or not. Our variational procedure compares well with the exact quantum solution. The properties of the relevant field and matter observables are obtained.

abstract: We present a first-principles CFT calculation corresponding to the spherical collapse of a shell of matter in three dimensional quantum gravity. In field theory terms, we describe the equilibration process, from early times to thermalization, of a CFT following a sudden injection of energy at time t=0. By formulating a continuum version of Zamolodchikov's monodromy method to calculate conformal blocks at large central charge c, we give a framework to compute a general class of probe observables in the collapse state, incorporating the full backreaction of matter fields on the dual geometry. This is illustrated by calculating a scalar field two-point function at time-like separation and the time-dependent entanglement entropy of an interval, both showing thermalization at late times. The results are in perfect agreement with previous gravity calculations in the AdS$_3$-Vaidya geometry. Information loss appears in the CFT as an explicit violation of unitarity in the 1/c expansion, restored by nonperturbative corrections.

abstract: In this paper, based on lectures by the authors at the May 2015 workshop {\it Resurgence, Physics and Numbers}, at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgio of the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, we explain the origin of resurgent trans-series in the Mathieu equation spectral problem, using uniform WKB and all-orders (exact) WKB. Exact quantization conditions naturally arise, and their expansion in the weak coupling regime produces resurgent trans-series expressions which exhibit precise relations between different instanton sectors. Indeed, the perturbative expansion encodes all orders of the multi-instanton expansion, an explicit realization of the general concept of "resurgence". We also discuss the transition from weak to strong coupling, an explicit realization of "instanton condensation".

abstract: Tensor network (TN) methods, in particular the Matrix Product States (MPS) ansatz, have proven to be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of lattice gauge theories. They allow for a very good precision, much better than standard Monte Carlo (MC) techniques for the models that have been studied so far, due to the possibility of reaching much smaller lattice spacings. The real reason for the interest in the TN approach, however, is its ability, shown so far in several condensed matter models, to deal with theories which exhibit the notorious sign problem in MC simulations. This makes it prospective for dealing with the non-zero chemical potential in QCD and other lattice gauge theories, as well as with real-time simulations. In this paper, using matrix product operators, we extend our analysis of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to show the feasibility of this approach also at finite temperature. This is an important step on the way to deal with the sign problem of QCD. We analyze in detail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases and show that the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of temperatures, essentially from zero to infinite temperature.

abstract: By modelling heat engines as driven multi-partite system we show that their dissipation can be expressed in terms of the lag (relative entropy) between the perturbed state of each partition and their equilibrium state, and the correlations that build up among the partitions. We illustrate the rich interplay between correlations and lags with a two-qubit device driven by a quantum gate.

abstract: We study the environment assisted local transitionless dynamics in closed spin systems driven through quantum critical points. In general shortcut to adaiabaticity (STA) in quantum critical systems requires highly non-local control Hamiltonians. In this work we develop an approach to achieve local shortcuts to adiabaticity (LSTA) in spin chains, using local control fields which scale polynomially with the system size, following universal critical exponents. We relate the control fields to reduced fidelity susceptibility and use transverse Ising model in one dimension to exemplify our generic results. We also extend our analysis to achieve LSTA in central spin models.

abstract: We study the excitonic coupling and homogeneous spectral line width of brick layer J-aggregate films. We begin by analysing the structural information revealed by the two-exciton states probed in two-dimensional spectra. Our first main result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the spectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for the same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure, which leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices. We next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population relaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in linear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure dephasing dominates the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover temperature, which explains the linear temperature dependence of the homogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased density of states at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the contribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are suggested to directly measure the lifetime of the bright state and can therefore support the proposed model.

abstract: We have investigated the one-way surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the interface of a magneto-plasma material and metal. It is shown that the TM mode supported by the biased magneto-plasma material has a band gap and non-trivial Chern number which can be calculated analytically. Due to bulk-edge correspondence, a back-scattering protected SPP propagates at the interface. Previous works considered 2D structures; here we consider the effects of 3D defects, and show that, although backward propagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take place. Several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of side-scattering, and we also consider the effects of metal loss.
