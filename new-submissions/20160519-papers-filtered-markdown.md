**1.    Resonant Transmission in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems with Two Parity-Invariant Point Interactions**  
Kohkichi Konno, Tomoaki Nagasawa, Rohta Takahashi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1605.05418  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss one-dimensional quantum systems with two parity-invariant point interactions within the framework of quantum mechanics. By investigating the conditions under which resonant transmission occurs, we show that an infinite number of resonant peaks appear only when (anti-)symmetric relations between the parameters which characterize the point interactions hold.

**2.    Adjacent vertices can be hard to find by quantum walks**  
Nikolajs Nahimovs, Raqueline A. M. Santos

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of classical random walks. They have been useful for designing quantum algorithms that outperform their classical versions for a variety of search problems. Most of the papers, however, consider a search space containing a single marked element only. We show that if the search space contains more than one marked element, their placement may drastically affect the performance of the search. More specifically, we study search by quantum walks on general graphs and show a wide class of configurations of marked vertices, for which search by quantum walk needs $\Omega(N)$ steps, that is, it has no speed-up over the classical exhaustive search. The demonstrated configurations occur for certain placements of two or more adjacent marked vertices. The analysis is done for the two-dimensional grid and hypercube, and then is generalized for any graph.
