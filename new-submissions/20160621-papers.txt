abstract: The classical or quantum nature of optical spectroscopy signals is a topic that has attracted great attention recently. Spectroscopic techniques have been classified as quantum or classical depending on the light-source used in their implementations. In this way, experiments performed with quantum light---such as entangled photon pairs---have been labeled as quantum spectroscopies, whereas those performed with coherent laser pulses are generally referred to as classical ones. In this work, we highlight the fact that typical laser-spectroscopy signals should sometimes be deemed quantum too, as they contain information about the quantum vacua of the modes that interact with the sample. Using a minimalistic model, namely frequency-integrated pump-probe spectroscopy, we demonstrate that vacuum contributions can be expressed as a correction term to the \emph{classical} pump-probe signals, which scales linearly with the intensity of the pump field. Remarkably, we show that these vacuum contributions may not be negligible and lead to the observation of superradiance in pump-probe experiments, provided that fields interacting with the medium are arranged in a collinear configuration.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize the structure of quantum linear systems. By means of a scattering representation, a relation between two systems $G$ and $\Sigma$ is established, by which we show that $G$ is lossless bounded real if and only if $\Sigma$ is lossless positive real. When $G$ is a quantum linear system, we show that its fundamental symplectic structure and physical realizability conditions can be expressed in a simpler way in terms of $\Sigma$. Furthermore, when $G$ is a passive quantum linear system, we show that its uncontrollable subspace and unobservable subspace are identical and they are spanned by the eigenvectors of the $A$ matrix of $G$, whose corresponding eigenvalues are all on the imaginary axis. For the nonpassive case, several sufficient conditions are given. Finally, in terms of controllability and observability, the problem of quantum linear system decomposition is investigated. In particular, a quantum Kalman decomposition is proposed. This canonical decomposition naturally exposes decoherence-free modes and quantum non-demolished modes, which are useful resources for quantum information science.

abstract: Many superconducting qubit systems use the dispersive interaction between the qubit and a coupled harmonic resonator to perform quantum state measurement. Previous works have found that such measurements can induce state transitions in the qubit if the number of photons in the resonator is too high. We investigate these transitions and find that they can push the qubit out of the two-level subspace. Furthermore, these transitions show resonant behavior as a function of photon number. We develop a theory for these observations based on level crossings within the Jaynes-Cummings ladder, with transitions mediated by terms in the Hamiltonian which are typically ignored by the rotating wave approximation. We confirm the theory by measuring the photon occupation of the resonator when transitions occur while varying the detuning between the qubit and resonator.

abstract: We are taught that gauge transformations in classical and quantum mechanics do not change the physics of the problem. Nevertheless here we discuss three broad scenarios where under gauge transformations: (i) conservation laws are not preserved in the usual manner; (ii) non-gauge-invariant quantities can be associated with physical observables; and (iii) there are changes in the physical boundary conditions of the wave function that render it non-single-valued. We give worked examples that illustrate these points, in contrast to general opinions from classic texts. We also give a historical perspective on the development of Abelian gauge theory in relation to our particular points. Our aim is to provide a discussion of these issues at the graduate level.

abstract: Using ladder operators for the non-linear oscillator with position-dependent effective mass, realization of the dynamic group SU(1,1) is presented. Keeping in view the algebraic structure of the non-linear oscillator, coherent states are constructed using Barut-Girardello formalism and their basic properties are discussed. Furthermore, the statistical properties of these states are investigated by means of Mandel parameter and second order correlation function. Moreover, it is shown that in the harmonic limit, all the results obtained for the non-linear oscillator with spatially varying mass reduce to corresponding results of the linear oscillator with constant mass.

abstract: We consider the quantum harmonic oscillator in contact with a finite temperature bath, modelled by the Caldeira-Leggett master equation. Applying periodic kicks to the oscillator, we study the system in different dynamical regimes between classical integrability and chaos on the one hand, and ballistic or diffusive energy absorption on the other. We then investigate the influence of the heat bath on the oscillator in each case. Phase space techniques allow us to simulate the evolution of the system efficiently. In this way, we calculate high resolution Wigner functions at long times, where the system approaches a quasi-stationary cyclic evolution. Thereby, we are able to perform an accurate study of the thermodynamic properties of a non-integrable, quantum chaotic system in contact with a heat bath.

abstract: Boson sampling, a specific quantum computation problem, is widely regarded to be one of the most achievable fields in which quantum machine will outperform the most powerful classical computer in the near term, although up to now no upper-bound of how fast the classical computers can compute matrix permanents, core problem of Boson sampling, has been reported. Here we test the computing of the matrix permanent on Tianhe-2, a supercomputer retaining its position as the world's No. 1 system for six times since June 2013. We arrived at the time (about 77.41~112.44 minutes) to compute the permanent of a $50\times 50$ matrix in an acceptable precision. In addition, we have found that Ryser's algorithm will produce an unacceptable error with the increase of problem scale, compared to Balasubramanian-Bax/Franklin-Glynn's algorithm in the same complexity. The precision issue suggests carefully check in future research of Boson sampling, and comprehensive comparison between quantum computer and classical computer.

abstract: We analytically study the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) in the $N$-cavity system with the \textit{N}th cavity driven by pump, probing laser fields and the \textit{1}st cavity coupled to mechanical oscillator. We also consider that one atom could be trapped in the \textit{i}th cavity. Instead of only illustrating the OMIT in such a system, we are interested in how the number of OMIT windows is influenced by the cavities and the atom and what roles the atom could play in different cavities. In the resolved sideband regime, we find that, the number of cavities precisely determines the maximal number of OMIT windows. It is interesting that, when the two-level atom is trapped in the even-labeled cavity, the central absorptive peak (odd $N$) or dip (even $N$) is split and forms an extra OMIT window, but if the atom is trapped in the odd-labeled cavity, the central absorptive peak (odd $N$) or dip (even $N$) is only broadened and thus changes the width of the OMIT windows rather than induces an extra window.

abstract: The uncertainty principle sets lower bound on the uncertainties of two incompatible observables measured on a particle. The uncertainty lower bound can be reduced by considering a particle as a quantum memory entangled with the measured particle. In this paper, we consider a tripartite scenario in which a quantum state has been shared between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The aim of Bob and Charlie is to minimize Charlie's lower bound about Alice's measurement outcomes. To this aim, they concentrate their correlation with Alice in Charlie's side via a cooperative strategy based on local operations and classical communication. We obtain lower bound for Charlie's uncertainty about Alice's measurement outcomes after concentrating information and compare it with the lower bound without concentrating information in some examples. We also provide a physical interpretation of the entropic uncertainty lower bound based on the dense coding capacity.

abstract: The experimental results of Kocsis et al., Mahler et al. and the proposed experiments of Morley et al. show that it is possible to construct "trajectories" in interference regions in a two-slit interferometer. These results call for a theoretical re-appraisal of the notion of a "quantum trajectory" first introduced by Dirac and in the present paper we re-examine this notion from the Bohm perspective based on Hamiltonian flows. In particular, we examine the short-time propagator and the role that the quantum potential plays in determining the form of these trajectories. These trajectories differ from those produced in a typical particle tracker and the key to this difference lies in the active suppression of the quantum potential necessary to produce Mott-type trajectories. We show, using a rigorous mathematical argument, how the active suppression of this potential arises. Finally we discuss in detail how this suppression also accounts for the quantum Zeno effect.

abstract: Resource consumption of the conventional surface code is expensive, in part due to the need to separate the defects that create the logical qubit far apart on the physical qubit lattice. We propose that instantiating the deformation-based surface code using superstabilizers makes it possible to detect short error chains connecting the superstabilizers, allowing us to place logical qubits close together. Additionally, we demonstrate the process of conversion from the defect-based surface code, which works as arbitrary state injection, and a lattice surgery-like CNOT gate implementation that requires fewer physical qubits than the braiding CNOT gate. Finally we propose a placement design for the deformation-based surface code and analyze its resource consumption; large scale quantum computation requires $\frac{25}{4}d^2 +5d + 1$ physical qubits per logical qubit where $d$ is the code distance, whereas the planar code requires $16d^2 -16d + 4$ physical qubits per logical qubit, for a reduction of about 55%.

abstract: Constructing a set of universal quantum gates is a fundamental task for quantum computation. The existence of noises, disturbances and fluctuations is unavoidable during the process of implementing quantum gates for most practical quantum systems. This paper employs a sampling-based learning method to find robust control pulses for generating a set of universal quantum gates. Numerical results show that the learned robust control fields are insensitive to disturbances, uncertainties and fluctuations during the process of realizing universal quantum gates.

We present a novel protocol which meets this requirement, with practical advantages when using technology feasible in the near term. Client tasks are realized as linear combinations of operations implemented by the server, where the linear coefficients are kept secret from the server. We report on an experimental demonstration of our protocol using linear optics, which realizes linear combination of two single-qubit operations.

abstract: In this Chapter, we present some interesting properties of quantum walks on the line. We concentrate our attention in the emergence of invariance and provide some insights into the ultimate origin of the observed behavior. In the first part of the Chapter, we review the building blocks of the quantum-mechanical version of the standard random walk in one dimension. The most distinctive difference between random and quantum walks is the replacement of the random coin in the former by the action of a unitary operator upon some internal property of the later. We provide explicit expressions for the solution to the problem when the most general form for the homogeneous unitary operator is considered, and we analyze several key features of the system as the presence of symmetries or stationary limits. After that, we analyze the consequences of letting the properties of the coin operator change from site to site, and from time step to time step. In spite of this lack of homogeneity, the probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker can remain unaltered if the coin variability is chosen adequately. Finally, we show how this invariance can be connected to the gauge freedom of electromagnetism.

abstract: We show that simulated relativistic motion can generate entanglement between artificial atoms and protect them from spontaneous emission. We consider a pair of superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator mode, where the modulation of the coupling strength can mimic the harmonic motion of the qubits at relativistic speeds, generating acceleration radiation. We find the optimal feasible conditions for generating a stationary entangled state between the qubits when they are initially prepared in their ground state. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of motion on the probability of spontaneous emission in the standard scenarios of single-atom and two-atom superradiance, where one or two excitations are initially present. Finally, we show that relativistic motion induces sub-radiance and can generate a Zeno-like effect, preserving the excitations from radiative decay.

abstract: We show that the quantification of entanglement of any rank-2 state with any polynomial entanglement measure can be recast as a geometric problem on the corresponding Bloch sphere. This approach provides novel insight into the properties of entanglement and allows us to relate different polynomial measures to each other, simplifying their quantification. In particular, unveiling and exploiting the geometric structure of the concurrence for two qubits, we show that the convex roof of any polynomial measure of entanglement can be quantified exactly for all rank-2 states of an arbitrary number of qubits which have only one or two unentangled states in their range. We give explicit examples by quantifying the three-tangle exactly for several representative classes of three-qubit states. We further show how our methods can be used to obtain analytical results for entanglement of more complex states if one can exploit symmetries in their geometric representation.

abstract: An orthogonal product basis (OPB) of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $H=H_1\otimes H_2\otimes\cdots\otimes H_n$ is an orthonormal basis of $H$ consisting of product vectors $x_1\otimes x_2\otimes\cdots\otimes x_n$. We show that the problem of classifying the OPBs of an $n$-qubit system can be reduced to a purely combinatorial problem. We solve this combinatorial problem in the case of four qubits and obtain 32 multiparameter families of OPBs. Each OPB of four qubits is equivalent, under local unitary operations and qubit permutations, to an OPB belonging to at least one of these families.

abstract: Eigenstates of Bose particles with repulsive contact interactions in one-dimensional space with periodic boundary conditions can be found with the help of the Bethe ansatz. The type~II excitation spectrum identified by E. H. Lieb, reproduces the dispersion relation of dark solitons in the mean-field approach. The corresponding eigenstates possess translational symmetry which can be broken in measurements of positions of particles. We analyze emergence of single and double solitons in the course of the measurements and investigate dynamics of the system. In the weak interaction limit, the system follows the mean-field prediction for a short period of time. Long time evolution reveals many-body effects that are related to an increasing uncertainty of soliton positions. In the strong interaction regime particles behave like impenetrable bosons. Then, the probability densities in the configuration space become identical to the probabilities of non-interacting fermions but the wave-functions themselves remember the original Bose statistics. Especially, the phase flips that are key signatures of the solitons in the weak interaction limit, {can be observed} in the time evolution of the strongly interacting bosons.

As a corollary, we consider the bulk-classification problem. We study Hamiltonians that1.are given by translation invariant finite range interactions, 2.are gapped in the bulk, 3.are frustration-free, 4.have uniformly bounded ground state degeneracy on finite intervals, and 5.have a unique bulk ground state. We show that for the bulk-classification, any such Hamiltonians are equivalent.

abstract: Driven tunneling between graphene Landau levels is theoretically linked to the process of pair creation from vacuum, a prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Landau levels are created by the presence of a strong, constant, quantizing magnetic field perpendicular to a graphene mono-layer. Following the formal analogy between QED and the description of low-energy excitations in graphene, solutions of the fully interacting Dirac equation are used to compute electron-hole pair creation driven by a circularly or linearly polarized field. This is achieved via the coupled channel method, a numerical scheme for the solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation in the presence of bound states. The case of a monochromatic driving field is first considered, followed by the more realistic case of a pulsed excitation. We show that the pulse duration yields an experimental control parameter over the maximal pair yield. Orders of magnitude of the pair yield are given for experimentally achievable magnetic fields and laser intensities weak enough to preserve the Landau level structure.

abstract: As Physics did in previous centuries, there is currently a common dream of extracting generic laws of nature in economics, sociology, neuroscience, by focalising the description of phenomena to a minimal set of variables and parameters, linked together by causal equations of evolution whose structure may reveal hidden principles. This requires a huge reduction of dimensionality (number of degrees of freedom) and a change in the level of description. Beyond the mere necessity of developing accurate techniques affording this reduction, there is the question of the correspondence between the initial system and the reduced one. In this paper, we offer a perspective towards a common framework for discussing and understanding multi-level systems exhibiting structures at various spatial and temporal levels. We propose a common foundation and illustrate it with examples from different fields. We also point out the difficulties in constructing such a general setting and its limitations.

abstract: We propose a method to obtain optimal protocols for adiabatic ground-state preparation near the adiabatic limit, extending earlier ideas from [D. A. Sivak and G. E. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 190602 (2012)] to quantum non-dissipative systems. The space of controllable parameters of isolated quantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric structure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically. Here, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to accomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of time. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize the average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on the Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic XY spin chain. In both cases we show that geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity. Moreover, this happens even if one crosses a critical point, where the adiabatic perturbation theory fails.

abstract: We present an alternative method for accurate treatment of strongly correlated systems which combines the coupled cluster (CC) theory with the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). The connection is done in the spirit of the tailored CC method [T. Kinoshita, O. Hino, and R. J. Bartlett, \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 123} (2005) 074106]. In the first step, the configuration interaction (CI) coefficients corresponding to single and double excitations within the DMRG active space are computed by contraction of the matrix product state (MPS) matrices. These coefficients are subsequently transformed into CC amplitudes. In the second step, the CC amplitudes are used to define a "tailored" single reference CCSD wavefunction. As a result, the DMRG method is responsible for the proper description of non-dynamic correlation, whereas the dynamic correlation is incorporated through the framework of the CC theory. We illustrate the potential of this method on prominent multireference model systems like N$_2$ or Cr$_2$ molecules.

abstract: The observation of the Stark-tuned F\"orster resonances between Rydberg atoms excited by narrowband cw laser radiation requires usage of a Stark-switching technique in order to excite the atoms first in a fixed electric field and then to induce the interactions in a varied electric field, which is scanned across the F\"orster resonance. In our experiments with a few cold Rb Rydberg atoms we have found that the transients at the edges of the electric pulses strongly affect the line shapes of the F\"orster resonances, since the resonances occur mainly on a time scale of ~100 ns, which is comparable with the duration of the transients. For example, a short-term ringing at a certain frequency causes additional radio-frequency-assisted F\"orster resonances, while non-sharp edges lead to asymmetry. The intentional application of the radio-frequency field induces transitions between collective states, whose line shape depends on the interaction strengths and time. Spatial averaging over the atom positions in a single interaction volume yields a cusped line shape of the F\"orster resonance. We present a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the line shape and time dynamics of the Stark-tuned F\"orster resonances $Rb(nP_{3/2})+ Rb(nP_{3/2}) \to Rb(nS_{1/2})+Rb([n+1]S_{1/2})$ for two Rb Rydberg atoms interacting in a time-varying electric field.

abstract: When a discrete state is coupled to a continuum, the dynamics can be described either by the Weisskopf-Wigner exponential decay or by the Rabi oscillation, depending on the relative magnitudes of the continuum width and of the Rabi frequency. A continuous transition between these two regimes exists, as demonstrated in 1977 by C. Cohen-Tannoudji and P. Avan. Here, we describe a fully analogous transition in classical mechanics, by studying the dynamics of two coupled mechanical oscillators in the presence of damping. By varying the relative magnitudes of the damping and coupling terms, we observe a continuous transition between a regime analogous to the Rabi oscillation and a regime analogous to the Weisskopf-Wigner exponential decay.

abstract: We consider Unruh-Wald qubit detector model adopted for the far future region of an exactly solvable 1+1 dimensional scalar field theory in a Robertson-Walker expanding spacetime. It is shown that the expansion of the universe in its history enhances the decoherence of the qubit coupled with a scalar field. Moreover, we consider two entangled qubits, each locally coupled a scalar field. The expansion of the universe in its history degrades the entanglement between the qubits, and can lead to entanglement sudden death if the initial entanglement is small enough. The details depend on the parameters characterizing the expansion of the universe. This work, albeit on a toy model, suggests that the history of the universe might be probed through the coherent and entanglement behavior of future detectors of quantum fields.
