**1.    Multi-fractal Geometry of Finite Networks of Spins**

<p>
Quantum spin networks overcome the challenges of traditional charge-based electronics by encoding the information into spin degrees of freedom. Although beneficial for transmitting information with minimal losses when compared to their charge-based counterparts, the mathematical formalization of the information propagation in a spin(tronic) network is challenging due to its complicated scaling properties. In this paper, we propose a geometric approach---specific to finite networks---for unraveling the information-theoretic phenomena of spin chains and rings by abstracting them as weighted graphs, where the vertices correspond to the spin excitation states and the edges represent the information theoretic distance between pair of nodes. The weighted graph representation of the quantum spin network dynamics exhibits a complex self-similar structure (where subgraphs repeat to some extent over various space scales). To quantify this complex behavior, we develop a new box counting inspired algorithm which assesses the mono-fractal versus multi-fractal properties of quantum spin networks. Besides specific to finite networks, multi-fractality is further compounded by "engineering" or "biasing" the network for selective transfer, as selectivity makes the network more heterogeneous. To demonstrate criticality in finite size systems, we define a thermodynamics inspired framework for describing information propagation and show evidence that some spin chains and rings exhibit an informational phase transition phenomenon, akin to the metal-to-insulator phase transition in Anderson localization in finite media.}

Advances with trapped ultracold atoms intensified interest in simulating complex physical phenomena, including quantum magnetism and transitions from itinerant to non-itinerant behavior. Here we show formation of antiferromagnetic ground states of few ultracold fermionic atoms in single and double well (DW) traps, through microscopic Hamiltonian exact diagonalization for two DW arrangements: (i) two linearly oriented one-dimensional, 1D, wells, and (ii) two coupled parallel wells, forming a trap of two-dimensional, 2D, nature. The spectra and spin-resolved conditional probabilities reveal for both cases, under strong repulsion, atomic spatial localization at extemporaneously created sites, forming quantum molecular magnetic structures with non-itinerant character. These findings usher future theoretical and experimental explorations into the highly-correlated behavior of ultracold strongly-repelling fermionic atoms in higher dimensions, beyond the fermionization physics that is strictly applicable only in the 1D case. The results for four atoms are well described with finite Heisenberg spin-chain and cluster models. The numerical simulations of three fermionic atoms in symmetric double wells reveal the emergent appearance of coupled resonating 2D Heisenberg clusters, whose emulation requires the use of a t-J-like model, akin to that used in investigations of high T$_c$ superconductivity. The highly entangled states discovered in the microscopic and model calculations of controllably detuned, asymmetric, double wells suggest three-cold-atom DW quantum computing qubits.
