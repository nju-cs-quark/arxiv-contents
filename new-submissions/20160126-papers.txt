abstract: Randomness is an indispensable resource in modern science and information technology. Fortunately, an experimentally simple procedure exists to generate randomness with well-characterized devices: measuring a quantum system in a basis complementary to its preparation. Towards realizing this goal one may consider using atoms or superconducting qubits, promising candidates for quantum information processing. However, their unavoidable interaction with the electromagnetic field affects their dynamics. At large time scales, this can result in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but may not be well analysed under the usual rotating wave and single-mode approximation (RWA and SMA) which break the relativistic nature of quantum field theory. Here, we use a fully relativistic analysis to quantify the information that an adversary with access to the field could get on the result of an atomic measurement. Surprisingly, we find that the adversary's guessing probability is not minimized for atoms initially prepared in the ground state (an intuition derived from the RWA and SMA model).

abstract: We report 100% duty cycle generation of sub-MHz single photon pairs at the Rubidium D$_1$ line using cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric downconversion. The temporal intensity crosscorrelation function exhibits a bandwidth of $666 \pm 16$ kHz for the single photons, an order of magnitude below the natural linewidth of the target transition. A half-wave plate inside our cavity helps to achieve triple resonance between pump, signal and idler photon, reducing the bandwidth and simplifying the locking scheme. Additionally, stabilisation of the cavity to the pump frequency enables the 100% duty cycle. These photons are well-suited for storage in quantum memory schemes with sub-natural linewidths, such as gradient echo memories.

abstract: We start a series of studies of the excitation of an optical target by quantum light. In this first part, we introduce the problematic and address the first case of interest, that of exciting the quantum harmonic oscillator, corresponding to, e.g., a single-mode passive cavity or a non-interacting boson field. We introduce a mapping of the Hilbert space that allows to chart usefully the accessible regions. We then consider the quantum excitation from single photon sources in the form of a two-level system under various regimes of (classical) pumping: incoherent, coherent and in the Mollow triplet regime. We close this first opus with an overview of the material to be covered in the subsequent papers.

abstract: We demonstrate cooling of ultrathin fiber tapers coupled with nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds to cryogenic temperatures. Nanodiamonds containing multiple NV centers are deposited on the subwavelength 480-nm-diameter nanofiber region of fiber tapers. The fiber tapers are successfully cooled to 9 K using our home-built mounting holder and an optimized cooling speed. The fluorescence from the nanodiamond NV centers is efficiently channeled into a single guided mode and shows characteristic sharp zero-phonon lines of both neutral and negatively charged NV centers. The present nanofiber/nanodiamond hybrid systems at cryogenic temperatures can be used as NV-based quantum information devices and for highly sensitive nanoscale magnetometry in a cryogenic environment.

abstract: Given a set of multipartite entangled states, can we find a common state to prepare them by local operations and classical communication? Such a state, if exists, will be a common resource for the given set of states. We completely solve this problem for bipartite pure states case by explicitly constructing a unique optimal common resource state for any given set of states. In the multipartite setting, the general problem becomes quite complicated, and we focus on finding nontrivial common resources for the whole multipartite state space of given dimensions. We show that GHZ_3 is a nontrivial common resource for three-qubit systems.

abstract: We propose an upper bound on the maximum correct probability of quantum measurements. The proposed bound is obtained by a suboptimal solution to the dual problem of the optimal state discrimination problems. We derive that a slightly modified version of the proposed bound is tighter than that proposed by Qiu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 81, 042329 (2010)]. We also propose an upper bound on the maximum correct probability with a fixed rate of inconclusive results. The performance of the proposed bounds are evaluated through numerical experiments.

abstract: Topologically ordered phase has emerged as one of most exciting concepts that not only broadens our understanding of phases of matter, but also has been found to have potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The direct measurement of topological properties, however, is still a challenge especially in interacting quantum system. Here we realize one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chains using nuclear magnetic resonance simulators and observe the interaction-induced topological transitions, where Berry curvature in the parameter space of Hamiltonian is probed by means of dynamical response and then the first Chern number is extracted by integrating the curvature over the closed surface. The utilized experimental method provides a powerful means to explore topological phenomena in quantum systems with many-body interactions.

abstract: In quantum information process, a single quantum particle can have various degrees of freedom and with coherent coupling among them. To control multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously is necessary to describe the particle fully and, therefore, to use it more efficiently. As for photons, polarization, frequency, time, orbital angular momentum, and even transverse mode have been used in free-space and fiber quantum systems. Compared with free space and fiber optics, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their small footprints, scalability, reduced power consumption, and enhanced processing stability, thus many quantum computation and quantum simulation protocols have been realized on quantum PICs (QPICs). It should be noted that, usually only one degree of freedom, for example, path or polarization, was used in those works. Here we demonstrate the coherent conversion of photonic quantum signals between different degrees of freedom on a single chip. By using mode multiplexers and mode converters, single photons in different optical paths or different polarizations can be converted to/back to different transverse waveguide modes in a single multi-mode waveguide, while the latter is an ideal platform for higher dimensional quantum information process. The preservation of quantum coherence in these conversion processes are proved by quantum interference using a fiber beam-splitter (BS) or a on-chip BS. These results provided us the ability to control and convert multiple degrees of freedom of photons for QPIC-based quantum information process.

abstract: In recent years, several measures have been proposed for characterizing the coherence of a given quantum state. We derive several results that illuminate how these measures behave when restricted to pure states. Notably, we present an explicit characterization of the closest incoherent state to a given pure state under the trace distance measure of coherence, and we affirm a recent conjecture that the $\ell_1$ measure of coherence of a pure state is never smaller than its relative entropy of coherence. We then use our result to show that the states maximizing the trace distance of coherence are exactly the maximally coherent states, and we derive a new inequality relating the negativity and distillable entanglement of pure states.

abstract: Superdense coding promises increased classical capacity and communication security but this advantage may be undermined by noise in the quantum channel. We present a numerical study of how forward error correction (FEC) applied to the encoded classical message can be used to mitigate against quantum channel noise. By studying the bit error rate under different FEC codes, we identify the unique role that burst errors play in superdense coding, and we show how these can be mitigated against by interleaving the FEC codewords prior to transmission. We conclude that classical FEC with interleaving is a useful method to improve the performance in near-term demonstrations of superdense coding.

abstract: Uncertainty relations describe the lower bound of product of standard deviations of observables. By revealing a connection between standard deviations of quantum observables and numerical radius of operators, we establish a universal uncertainty relation for any $k$ observables, of which the formulation depends on the even or odd quality of $k$. This universal uncertainty relation is tight at least for the cases $k=2n$ and $k=3$. For two observables, the uncertainty relation is exactly a simpler reformulation of Schr\"odinger's uncertainty principle.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.06364
abstract: We consider a problem of description of quantum correlations and dispersions of subsystems of complex open systems. Based on our previous results we proposed a method to evaluate pure quantum contributions from total statistical characteristics of two coupled oscillators interacting with thermal reservoirs. The natural way to extract pure quantum characteristic of the system under study is a calculation of difference between the total value and its pure classical part. A numerical study of temporal behavior of quantum variances and covariances from given initial states up to states in the infinite time limit is given using the proposed method. It is shown that at comparatively high temperatures the steady state total variances are almost classical, because their pure quantum parts tend to zero in this regime. Otherwise, at comparatively low temperatures, the pure quantum parts of variances are not zeroing in steady states manifesting a finite contribution to total values. The same is true for the covariance. The larger the temperature, the lower is the quantum contribution to the total covariance. As well as entanglement measures, quantum discord, the pure quantum contributions in the covariance matrix elements are important characteristics of the temporal dynamics of complex quantum systems.

abstract: For a pair of quantum channels with the same input space, we show that the possibility of approximation of one channel by post-processings of the other channel can be characterized by comparing the success probabilities for the two ensembles obtained as outputs for any ensemble on the input space coupled with an ancilla. This provides an operational interpretation to a natural extension of Le Cam's deficiency to quantum channels. In particular, we obtain a version of the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments. The proofs are based on some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of independent interest.

abstract: Round-robin differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution (RRDPS QKD) has been proposed to raise the noise tolerability of the channel. However, in practice, the measurement device in RRDPS QKD may be imperfect. Here, we show that, with these imperfections, the security of RRDPS may be damaged, by proposing two attacks for RRDPS systems with uncharacterized measurement devices. One is valid even for a system with unit total efficiency, while the other is valid even when a single photon state is sent. To prevent these attacks, either security arguments need to be fundamentally revised or further practical assumptions on the measurement device should be put.

abstract: We introduce a stability criterion for quantum statistical ensembles describing macroscopic systems. An ensemble is called "stable" when a small number of local measurements cannot significantly modify the probability distribution of the total energy of the system. We apply this criterion to lattices of spins-1/2, thereby showing that the canonical ensemble is nearly stable, whereas statistical ensembles with much broader energy distributions are not stable. In the context of the foundations of quantum statistical physics, this result justifies the use of statistical ensembles with narrow energy distributions such as canonical or microcanonical ensembles.

abstract: Quantum particle simulations have largely been based on time-independent, split-operator schemes in which kinetic and potential operators are interwoven to provide accurate approximations to system dynamics. These simulations can be very expensive in terms of the number of gates required, although individual cases, such as tunneling, have been found where prethreshold simulations are possible. By prethreshold, we mean a quantum computation or simulation with an existing architecture and not requiring error correction. In the case of molecular collisions, switching to a time-dependent formulation can reduce the system dimensionality significantly and provide an opportunity for pre-threshold simulation. Here, we study the efficiency of gate-based quantum simulation of a set of molecular collisions of increasing complexity. We show that prethreshold quantum simulation of such systems is feasible up to Hilbert space dimension 8, but beyond that error correction would be required.

abstract: The problem of device-independent randomness amplification against no-signaling adversaries has so far been studied under the assumption that the weak source of randomness is uncorrelated with the (quantum) devices used in the amplification procedure. In this work, we relax this assumption, and reconsider the original protocol of Colbeck and Renner, Nature Physics 8, 450-454 (2012), on randomness amplification using a Santha-Vazirani (SV) source. To do so, we introduce an SV-like condition for devices, namely that any string of SV source bits remains weakly random conditioned upon any other bit string from the same SV source and the outputs obtained when this further string is input into the devices. Assuming this condition, we show that a quantum device using a singlet state to violate the chained Bell inequalities leads to full randomness in the asymptotic scenario of a large number of settings, for a restricted set of SV sources (with $0 \leq \varepsilon < \frac{(2^{(1/12)} - 1)}{2(2^{(1/12)} + 1)} \approx 0.0144$). We also study a device-independent protocol that allows for correlations between the sequence of boxes used in the protocol and the SV source bits used to choose the particular box from whose output the randomness is obtained. Assuming the SV-like condition for devices, we show that the honest parties can achieve amplification of the weak source against this attack for the parameter range $0 \leq \varepsilon<0.0132$. We leave the case of a yet more general attack on the amplification protocol as an interesting open problem.

abstract: We develop an intuitive model of 2D microwave near-fields in the unusual regime of centimeter waves localized to tens of microns. Close to an intensity minimum, a simple effective description emerges with five parameters which characterize the strength and spatial orientation of the zero and first order terms of the near-field, as well as the field polarization. Such a field configuration is realized in a microfabricated planar structure with an integrated microwave conductor operating near 1 GHz. We use a single 9Be+ ion as a high-resolution quantum sensor to measure the field distribution through energy shifts in its hyperfine structure. We find agreement with simulations at the sub-micron and few-degree level. Our findings give a clear and general picture of the basic properties of oscillatory 2D near-fields with applications in quantum information processing, neutral atom trapping and manipulation, chip-scale atomic clocks, and integrated microwave circuits.

abstract: The quantum and classical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) alternative quantum walk (AQW) in the presence of decoherence have been discussed in detail. For any kinds of decoherence, the analytic expressions for the moments of position distribution of AQW have been obtained. Taking the broken line noise and coin-decoherence as examples of decoherence, we find that when the decoherence only emerges in one direction, the anisotropic position distribution pattern appears, and not all the motions of quantum walkers exhibit the transition from quantum to classical behaviors. The correlations between the walkers and the coin in 2D AQW have been discussed. The anisotropic correlations between walkers and coin have been revealed in the presence of decoherence.

abstract: Although the topological order is known as a quantum order in quantum many-body systems, it seems that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between topological phases and quantum phases. As a well-known example, it has been shown that all one-dimensional (1D) quantum phases are topologically trivial\cite{spt}. By such a fact, it seems a challenging task to understand when a quantum phase transition between different topological models necessarily reveals different topological classes of them. In this paper, we make an attempt to consider this problem by studying a phase transition between two different quantum phases which belong to a universal topological phase. We define a Hamiltonian which describes an interpolation between the toric code model with $Z_2$ topological order and the color code model with $Z_2 \times Z_2$ topological order on a hexagonal lattice. We show such a model is exactly mapped to many copies of 1D quantum Ising model in transverse field by rewriting the Hamiltonian in a new complete basis. Consequently, we show that the universal topological phase of the color code model and the toric code model reflects in the 1D nature of the phase transition. We also consider the expectation value of Wilson loops by a perturbative calculation and show that behavior of the Wilson loop captures the non-topological nature of the quantum phase transition. The result on the point of phase transition also show that the color code model is strongly robust against the toric code model.

abstract: Computation models such as circuits describe sequences of computation steps that are carried out one after the other. In other words, algorithm design is traditionally subject to the restriction imposed by a fixed causal order. We address a novel computing paradigm, replacing this assumption by mere logical consistency: We study non-causal circuits, where a fixed time structure within a gate is locally assumed whilst the global causal structure between the gates is dropped. We present examples of logically consistent non-causal circuits outperforming all causal ones; they imply that suppressing loops entirely is more restrictive than just avoiding the contradictions they can give rise to. That fact is already known for correlations as well as for communication, and we here extend it to computation.

Particular attention is given to its capabilities as an inertial sensor for particle and atomic beams, also in comparison with the classical moir\'e deflectometer. The present analysis is motivated by possible experimental applications in the context of antimatter wave interferometry, including the measurement of the gravitational acceleration of antimatter particles. To support our findings, we have performed numerical simulations of realistic particle beams with varying speed distributions.

Here we provide a summary of the principal features of quantum metamaterials and review the current state of research in this quickly developing field, which bridges quantum optics, quantum condensed matter theory and quantum information processing.

abstract: In the vein of the recent "pretty strong" converse for the quantum and private capacity of degradable quantum channels [Morgan/Winter, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60(1):317-333, 2014], we use the same techniques, in particular the calculus of min-entropies, to show a pretty strong converse for the private capacity of degraded classical-quantum-quantum (cqq-)wiretap channels, which generalize Wyner's model of the degraded classical wiretap channel. While the result is not completely tight, leaving some gap between the region of error and privacy parameters for which the converse bound holds, and a larger no-go region, it represents a further step towards an understanding of strong converses of wiretap channels [cf. Hayashi/Tyagi/Watanabe, arXiv:1410.0443 for the classical case].

abstract: The recently developed framework for quantum theory with no global causal order allows for quantum processes in which operations in local laboratories are neither causally ordered nor in a probabilistic mixture of definite causal orders. The causal relation between the laboratories is described by the process matrix. We show that, if the inputs of the laboratories are measured in a fixed basis, one can introduce an effective process matrix which is operationally indistinguishable from the original one. This effective process matrix can be obtained by applying the von Neumann- Lu\"ders update rule for nonselective measurements to the original process matrix and in the bipartite case it is compatible with a definite causal order. The latter extends the original Oreshkov et al. proof where one considers that both the measurement of the input and the re-preparation of the output are performed in a fixed basis.

abstract: Frequent observation of a quantum system leads to quantum Zeno physics, where the system evolution is constrained to states commensurate with the measurement outcome. We show that, more generally, the system can evolve between such states through higher-order virtual processes that pass through states outside the measurement subspace. We derive effective Hamiltonians to describe this evolution, and the dependence on the time between measurements. We demonstrate application of this phenomena to prototypical quantum many-body system examples, spin chains and atoms in optical lattices, where it facilitates correlated dynamical effects.

It enables fundamental studies on macroscopic quantum coherence and plays an important role in quantum teleportation protocols with continuous variables. In our experiments we have successfully implemented this operation for propagating squeezed microwave states. We demonstrate that, even for strong displacement amplitudes, there is no degradation of the squeezing level in the reconstructed quantum states. Furthermore, we confirm that path entanglement generated by using displaced squeezed states stays constant over a wide range of the displacement power.

title: Generalized Rabi models: diagonalization in the spin subspace and differential operators of Dunkl type

abstract: A discrete parity $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of a two parameter extension of the quantum Rabi model which smoothly interpolates between the latter and the Jaynes-Cummings model, and of the two-photon and the two-mode quantum Rabi models enables their diagonalization in the spin subspace. A more general statement is that the respective sets of $2\times 2$ hermitian operators of the Fulton-Gouterman type and those diagonal in the spin subspace are unitary equivalent. The diagonalized representation makes it transparent that any question about integrability and solvability can be addressed only at the level of ordinary differential operators of Dunkl type. Braak's definition of integrability is shown (i) to contradict earlier numerical studies and (ii) to imply that any physically reasonable differential operator of Dunkl type is integrable.

abstract: We analyze a general family of position-dependent mass quantum Hamiltonians which are not self-adjoint and include, as particular cases, some Hamiltonians obtained in phenomenological approaches to condensed matter physics. We build a general family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians which are quantum mechanically equivalent to the non self-adjoint proposed ones. Inspired in the probability density of the problem, we construct an ansatz for the solutions of the family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians. We use this ansatz to map the solutions of the time independent Schrodinger equations generated by the non self-adjoint Hamiltonians into the Hilbert space of the solutions of the respective dual self-adjoint Hamiltonians. This mapping depends on both the position-dependent mass and on a function of position satisfying a condition that assures the existence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint Hamiltonians here studied to a very general family of Hamiltonians proposed in a seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in different types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint Hamiltonians that correspond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article. We analyze three typical cases by choosing a physical position-dependent mass and a deformed harmonic oscillator potential . We completely solve the Schrodinger equations for the three cases; we also find and compare their respective energy levels.

abstract: The goal of two-party cryptography is to enable two parties, Alice and Bob, to solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks are private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum communication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage model by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time frame. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent protocols for two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a relatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known as weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the protocol are prepared by the dishonest party. Device-independent two-party cryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust each other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully analyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are optimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key ingredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit (and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against Bob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice's setting (guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that security is possible for arbitrarily small violation.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.06766
abstract: In the recent experimental and theoretical literature well-established nonclassicality criteria from the field of quantum optics have been directly applied to the case of excitations in matter-waves. Among these are violations of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, Glauber-Sudarshan P-nonclassicality, sub-Poissonian number-difference squeezing (also known as the two-mode variance) and the criterion of nonseparability. We review the strong connection of these criteria and their meaning in quantum optics, and point out differences in the interpretation between light and matter waves. We then calculate observables for a homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing an arbitrary modulation in the interaction parameter at finite initial temperature, within both the quantum theory as well as a classical reference. We conclude that to date in experiments relevant for analogue gravity, nonclassical effects have not conclusively been observed and conjecture that additional, noncommuting, observables have to be measured to this end.

abstract: We present a procedure for exactly diagonalizing finite-range quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians with arbitrary boundary conditions in one of D dimensions, and periodic in the remaining D-1. The key is a Hamiltonian-dependent separation of the bulk from the boundary. By combining information from the two, we identify a matrix function that completely characterizes the solutions, and allow to identify an indicator of bulk-boundary correspondence. As an illustration, we show how our method correctly describes the zero-energy Majorana modes of a time-reversal-invariant s-wave superconductor in a Josephson ring configuration, and predicts that a fractional 4 pi Josephson effect can only be observed in phases hosting an odd number of Majorana pairs.

Based on these relations, we define a unitary transformation leading to a simple alternative description of the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $su(2)$ and of their applications in the description of the quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In order to illustrate this kind of applications, we present two exactly solvable finite oscillators.

abstract: Theories of natural language and concepts have been unable to model the flexibility, creativity, context-dependence, and emergence, exhibited by words, concepts and their combinations. The mathematical formalism of quantum theory has instead been successful in capturing these phenomena such as graded membership, situational meaning, composition of categories, and also more complex decision making situations, which cannot be modeled in traditional probabilistic approaches. We show how a formal quantum approach to concepts and their combinations can provide a powerful extension of prototype theory. We explain how prototypes can interfere in conceptual combinations as a consequence of their contextual interactions, and provide an illustration of this using an intuitive wave-like diagram. This quantum-conceptual approach gives new life to original prototype theory, without however making it a privileged concept theory, as we explain at the end of our paper.

abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of measuring similarity among graphs that represent real objects with noisy data. To account for noise, we relax the definition of similarity using the maximum weighted co-$k$-plex relaxation method, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level. We then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem that can be solved by a quantum annealer. The context of our study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to regular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure and use it to predict the mutagenicity of a molecule. Our results indicate that the relaxed similarity measure, designed to accommodate the regular errors, yields a higher prediction accuracy than the measure that ignores the noise.

abstract: Trapping ions in Paul traps requires high radio-frequency voltages, which are generated using resonators. When operating traps in a cryogenic environment, an in-vacuum resonator showing low loss is crucial to limit the thermal load to the cryostat. In this study, we present a guide for the design and production of compact, shielded cryogenic resonators. We produced and characterized three different types of resonators and furthermore demonstrate efficient impedance matching of these resonators at cryogenic temperatures.

abstract: Placing a nanomechanical object in the evanescent near-field of a high-$Q$ optical microcavity gives access to strong gradient forces and quantum-noise-limited displacement readout, offering an attractive platform for precision sensing technology and basic quantum optics research. Robustly implementing this platform is challenging, however, as it requires separating optically smooth surfaces by $\lesssim\lambda/10$. Here we describe a fully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$ microdisk cavity. Employing a novel vertical integration technique based on planarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm while maintaining mechanical $Q\times f>10^{12}$ Hz and intrinsic optical $Q\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry result in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by radio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100 kHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency (displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\surd$Hz. In conjunction with the high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise, the transducer operates particularly well as a sensor. Deploying it in a 4 K cryostat, we recently demonstrated a displacement imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL) with an imprecision-back-action product $<5\cdot\hbar$. In this report we provide a comprehensive description of device design, fabrication, and characterization, with an emphasis on extending Heisenberg-limited readout to room temperature. Towards this end, we describe a room temperature experiment in which a displacement imprecision 30 dB below that at the SQL and an imprecision-back-action product $<75\cdot\hbar$ is achieved.
