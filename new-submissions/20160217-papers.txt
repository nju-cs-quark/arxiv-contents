abstract: In the present work the Rabi Problem, involving the response of a spin 1/2 particle subjected to a magnetic field, is considered in a field theory approach. In this concrete physical scenario, we show that the second quantization procedure can be applied directly in a non-covariant theory. The proposed development explicits not only the relation between the full quantum treatment of the problem and the semiclassical Rabi model, but also the connection of these approaches with the Jaynes-Cummings model. The treatment is then extended to the matter component of the Rabi problem so that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is directly quantized. The generalized theory is consistent, strictly quantum and non-relativistic.

abstract: We present a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the measurement of the collectibility, a nonlinear entanglement witness proposed by Rudnicki et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 150502 (2011)]. This entanglement witness works for both mixed and pure two-qubit states. In the later case it can be used to measure entanglement in terms of the negativity. We measured the collectibility for three distinct classes of photonic polarization-encoded two-qubit states, i.e., maximally entangled, separable and maximally mixed states. We demonstrate that the measurement procedure is feasible and robust against typical experimental shortcomings such as imperfect two-photon indistinguishability.

abstract: In this paper, the following scenario is considered: there are two qubits possessed by two parties at different locations. Qubits have been prepared in one of a maximum of four, mutually-orthogonal, entangled states and the parties wish to distinguish between the states by using local operations and classical communication. Although in general it is not possible to distinguish between four arbitrary states, the parties can spend some pre-shared entanglement to achieve perfect discrimination between four qubit states and can also preserve the entanglement of the states after discrimination. This is shown by employing the theory of majorization and the connections between entanglement transformations and state discrimination protocols.

abstract: We study the variety of ways in which nonlocality can be experimentally detected in N level systems, with conventional Bell inequality violation. By simple constructions, show that there are an exponentially large number of correlations that violate the inequality strongly, which remain robust at any N. We further formulate the concept of weak classical limit to get a better insight to the so called classical behaviour that quantum systems are expected to exhibit when N->infinity.

abstract: Various engine types are thermodynamically equivalent in the quantum limit of small 'engine action'. Our previous derivation of the equivalence is restricted to Markovian heat baths and to implicit classical work repository (e.g., laser light in the semi-classical approximation). In this paper all the components, baths, batteries, and engine, are explicitly taken into account. To neatly treat non-Markovian dynamics we use mediating particles that function as a heat exchanger. We find that on top of the previously observed equivalence there is a higher degree of equivalence that cannot be achieved in the Markovian regime. Next we focus on the energy transfer to the work repository. A condition for zero entropy increase in the work repository is given. Moreover, it is shown that in the strong coupling regime it is possible to charge a battery with energy while reducing its entropy at the same time.

abstract: We present our model of an Emergent Quantum Mechanics which can be characterized by "realism without pre-determination". This is illustrated by our analytic description and corresponding computer simulations of Bohmian-like "surreal" trajectories, which are obtained classically, i.e. without the use of any quantum mechanical tool such as wave functions. However, these trajectories do not necessarily represent ontological paths of particles but rather mappings of the probability density flux in a hydrodynamical sense. Modelling emergent quantum mechanics in a high-low intesity double slit scenario gives rise to the "quantum sweeper effect" with a characteristic intensity pattern. This phenomenon should be experimentally testable via weak measurement techniques.

abstract: Compact silicon integrated devices, such as micro-ring resonators, have recently been demonstrated as efficient sources of quantum correlated photon pairs. The mass production of integrated devices demands the implementation of fast and reliable techniques to monitor the device performances. In the case of time-energy correlations, this is particularly challenging, as it requires high spectral resolution that is not currently achievable in coincidence measurements. Here we reconstruct the joint spectral density of photons pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon ring resonator by studying the corresponding stimulated process, namely stimulated four wave mixing. We show that this approach, featuring high spectral resolution and short measurement times, allows one to discriminate between nearly-uncorrelated and highly-correlated photon pairs.

abstract: Inspired by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), which adds gravitational effects to the standard description of quantum uncertainty, we extend the exact uncertainty principle (EUP) approach by Hall and Reginatto [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. (2002) 35 3289], and obtain a (quasi)nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. This quantum evolution equation of unusual form, enjoys several desired properties like separation of non-interacting subsystems or planewave solutions for free particles. We show that the Gaussian solution for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator respects the gravitationally-induced minimal position uncertainty proportional to the Planck length. Quite surprisingly, our result successfully merges the core of classical physics with non-relativistic quantum mechanics in its extremal form.

abstract: We demonstrate the excitation of ions to the Rydberg state $22F$ by vacuum ultraviolet radiation at a wavelength of $123\,\text{nm}$ combined with the coherent manipulation of the optical qubit transition in $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$. With a tightly focused beam at $729\,\text{nm}$ wavelength we coherently excite a single ion from a linear string into the metastable $3D_{5/2}$ state before a VUV pulse excites it to the Rydberg state. In combination with ion shuttling in the trap, we extend this approach to the addressed excitation of multiple ions. The coherent initialization as well as the addressed Rydberg excitation are key prerequisites for more complex applications of Rydberg ions in quantum simulation or quantum information processing.

abstract: W state is a key resource in quantum communication. Fusion technology has been proven to be a good candidate for preparing a large-size W state from two or more small-size W states in linear optical system. It is of great importance to study how to fuse W states via light-matter interface. Here we show that it is possible to prepare large-size W-state networks using a fusion mechanism in cavity QED system. The detuned interaction between three atoms and a vacuum cavity mode constitute the main fusion mechanism, based on which two or three small-size atomic W states can be fused into a larger-size W state. If no excitation is detected from those three atoms, the remaining atoms are still in the product of two or three new W states, which can be re-fused. The complicated Fredkin gate used in the previous fusion schemes is avoided here. W states of size 2 can be fused as well. The feasibility analysis shows that our fusion processes maybe implementable with the current technology. Our results demonstrate how the light-matter interaction based fusion mechanism can be realized, and may become the starting point for the fusion of multipartite entanglement in cavity QED system.

abstract: Long-distance quantum channels capable of transferring quantum states faithfully for unconditionally secure quantum communication have been so far confirmed feasible in both fiber and free-space air. However, it remains unclear whether seawater, which covers more than 70% of the earth, can also be utilized, leaving global quantum communication incomplete. Here we experimentally demonstrate that polarization quantum states including general qubits and entangled states can well survive after travelling through seawater. We performed experiments in a 3.3-meter-long tube filled with seawater samples collected in a range of 36 kilometers in Yellow sea, which conforms to Jerlov water type I. For single photons at 405 nm in blue-green window, we obtained average process fidelity above 98%. For entangled photons at 810 nm, even with high loss, we observe violation of Bell inequality with 33 standard deviations. This work confirms feasibility of seawater quantum channel, representing the first step towards underwater quantum communication.

abstract: An interesting aspect of multipartite entanglement is that for perfect teleportation and superdense coding, not the maximally entangled W states but a special class of non-maximally entangled W-like states are required. Therefore, efficient preparation of such W-like states is of great importance in quantum communications, which has not been studied as much as the preparation of W states. In this letter, we propose a simple optical scheme for efficient preparation of large-scale polarization based entangled W-like states by fusing two W-like states or expanding a W-like state with an ancilla photon. Our scheme can also generate large-scale W states by fusing or expanding W or even W-like states. The cost analysis show that in generating large scale W states, the fusion mechanism achieves a higher efficiency with non-maximally entangled W-like states than maximally entangled W states. Our scheme can also start fusion or expansion with Bell states, and it is composed of a polarization dependent beam splitter, two polarizing beam splitters and photon detectors. Requiring no ancilla photons or controlled gates to operate, our scheme can be realized with the current photonics technology and we believe it enables advances in quantum teleportation and superdense coding in multipartite settings.

abstract: This work will incorporate a few related tools for addressing the conceptual difficulties arising from sewing together classical and quantum mechanics: deterministic operators, weak measurements and post-selection. Weak Measurement, based on a very weak von Neumann coupling, is a unique kind of quantum measurement with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In contrast to other measurement techniques, it allows to gather a small amount of information regarding the quantum system, with only a negligible probability of collapsing it. A single weak measurement yields an almost random outcome, but when performed repeatedly over a large ensemble, the averaged outcome becomes increasingly robust and accurate. Importantly, a long sequence of weak measurements can be thought of as a single projective measurement. I claim in this work that classical variables appearing in the macro-world, such as centre of mass, moment of inertia, pressure and average forces, result from a multitude of quantum weak measurements performed in the micro-world. Here again, the quantum outcomes are highly uncertain, but the law of large numbers obliges their convergence to the definite quantities we know from our everyday lives. By augmenting this description with a final boundary condition and employing the notion of "classical robustness under time-reversal" I will draw a quantitative borderline between the classical and quantum regimes. I will conclude by analyzing the role of macroscopic systems in amplifying and recording quantum outcomes.

abstract: Quantum state transfer into a memory, state shuttling over long distances via a quantum bus, and high-fidelity readout are important tasks for quantum technology. Realizing these tasks is challenging in the presence of realistic couplings to an environment. Here, we introduce and assess protocols that can be used in cavity QED to perform high-fidelity quantum state transfer and fast quantum nondemolition qubit readout through Hamiltonian engineering. We show that high-fidelity state transfer between a cavity and a single qubit or between a cavity and the collective mode of a qubit ensemble can be performed, even in the limit of strong dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening. Moreover, we show that large signal-to-noise and high single-shot fidelity can be achieved in a cavity-based qubit readout, even in the weak-coupling limit. These ideas may be important for novel systems coupling single spins to a microwave cavity.

abstract: We present the detailed quantum electrodynamical description of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic twisted electron in the transparent medium. Simple expressions for the spectral and spectral-angular distributions as well as for the polarization properties of the emitted radiation are obtained. Unlike the plane-wave case, the twisted electron produces radiation within the annular angular region, with enhancement towards its boundaries. Additionally, the emitted photons can have linear polarization not only in the scattering plane but also in the orthogonal direction. We find that the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by an electron in a superposition of two vortex states exhibits a strong azimuthal asymmetry. Thus, the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation offers itself as a convenient diagnostic tool of such electrons and complements the traditional microscopic imaging.

abstract: Gradient echo memory (GEM) stores and retrieves photon wave packet in forward direction with high efficiency and fidelity using photon-echo mechanism. It is an important technique for quantum memory applications. By breaking the continuity of the gradient absorption structure, the scheme becomes gradient frequency comb (GFC), which is a hybrid of GEM and atomic frequency comb (AFC). To elucidate the non-trivial field-atom evolution of gradient echo, we derive its exact analytical solution in a medium of arbitrary optical thickness subjecting to any linear gradient of transition frequency, and discuss its physical processes. Based on this solution, we further suggest and analysis two types of GFC, one with stepwise gradient and the other with discontinuous gradient.

abstract: Open quantum system theory is fundamental for a proper description of quantum systems in different contexts such as chemistry, condensed matter physics, bio-physics and opto-mechamics. Quantum brownian motion which is analytically described by the Hu-Paz-Zhang (HPZ) model represents one of the most important examples of an open quantum system. In this paper we propose a novel derivation of its master equation, based on the Heisenberg picture. We provide an exact and analytic equation both for the operators as well as for the states. The result, equivalent to the one derived originally by HPZ, is expressed in terms of the spectral density, regardless the strength of the coupling between the system and the environment and allows to compute the time evolution of physically relevant quantities in a much easier way. An example, of particular interest in bio-physics, is explicitly studied.

abstract: Dissipation can significantly affect the quantum behaviour of a system and even completely suppress it. Counterintuitively, engineered dissipation enables the preparation of quantum states as well as their stabilization. In cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical oscillators relies on a dissipation hierarchy in which the electromagnetic energy decay rate significantly exceeds that of the mechanical oscillator. In contrast, recent theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the mechanical oscillator dissipation dominates and provides a cold dissipative reservoir to the electromagnetic degree of freedom. This novel regime allows to manipulate the electromagnetic mode and enables a new class of dissipative interactions. Here, we report on the experimental realization of this reversed dissipation regime in a microwave cavity optomechanical system. We directly evidence the preparation of a quasi-instantaneous, cold reservoir for a microwave field by on-demand decreasing or increasing the damping rate of the microwave mode, that corresponds to amplification and de-amplification of the microwave field. Moreover, we observe the onset of parametric instability, i.e. stimulated emission of microwaves (masing). The dissipative interaction additionally enables to operate the system as a low-noise, large-gain phase-preserving amplifier. Realizing a dissipative reservoir for microwave light is a requirement for the dissipative coupling of multiple cavity modes, which in turn forms the basis of dissipative quantum phase transitions, microwave entanglement schemes, and electromechanical quantum-limited amplifiers. Equally importantly, this interaction underpins recently predicted non-reciprocal devices, which would extend the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave manipulation techniques.

abstract: We investigate the potential to probe physics beyond the Standard Model with isotope shift measurements of optical atomic clock transitions. We first derive the reach for generic new physics above the GeV scale at the effective field theory level, as well as estimate the limits on possible new spin-independent forces mediated by sub-GeV states coupled to electrons and neutrons. We also study the weak force and show that isotope shifts could provide strong constraints on the $Z^0$ couplings to valence quarks, which complement precision observables at LEP and atomic parity violation experiments. Finally, motivated by recent experimental hints of a new 750 GeV resonance in diphotons, we also consider the potential to probe its parity-preserving couplings to electrons, quarks and gluons with this method. In particular, combining the diphoton signal with indirect constraints from $g_e-2$ and isotope shifts in Ytterbium allows to probe the resonance coupling to electrons with unprecedented precision.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic-crystal nanostructures have been the subject of intense study. In this context, quantum dots are often considered to be simple two-level emitters, i.e., the complexities arising from the internal finestructure are neglected. We show that due to the intricate spatial variations of the electric field polarization found in photonic crystal, the two orthogonal finestructure states of quantum dots in general both couple significantly to a cavity mode, implying that the two-level description is not sufficient. As a consequence the emission dynamics and spectra, which are often recorded in experiments, are modified both in the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. The proposed effects are found to be significant for system parameters of current state-of-the-art photonic-crystal cavities.

In this work we answer the latter question affirmatively and present a partial function Shape, which can be computed by a protocol sending entangled simultaneous messages of poly-logarithmic size, and whose classical two-way complexity is lower bounded by a polynomial.

abstract: We study the late-time relaxation following a quench in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system. We consider the open Dicke model, describing the infinite-range interactions between $N$ atoms and a single, lossy electromagnetic mode. We show that the dynamical phase transition at a critical atom-light coupling is characterized by the interplay between reservoir-driven and intrinsic relaxation processes. Above the critical coupling, small fluctuations in the occupation of the dominant quasi-particle-mode start to grow in time while the quasi-particle lifetime remains finite due to losses. Near the critical interaction strength we observe a crossover between exponential and power-law $1/\tau$ relaxation, the latter driven by collisions between quasi-particles. For a quench exactly to the critical coupling, the power-law relaxation extends to infinite times, but the finite lifetime of quasi-particles prevents ageing to appear. We predict our results to be accessible to quench experiments with ultracold bosons in optical resonators.
