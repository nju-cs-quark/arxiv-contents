abstract: Active error correction of topological quantum codes - in particular the toric code - remains one of the most viable routes to large scale quantum information processing. In this work, we introduce the concept of a dynamical decoder as a promising route for achieving fault-tolerant quantum memories. We analyze a specific dynamical decoder based on a discrete time cellular automaton decoder and provide evidence of a threshold above 0.05% with measurement errors. Without measurement errors, the threshold increases by a factor of roughly 1.5. We stress that (asynchronous) dynamical decoding gives rise to a Markovian dissipative process, hence equating cellular automaton decoding to a fully dissipative topological quantum memory, which removes errors continuously. Finally, we analyze the required resources, and speculate about an ideal constant resource dynamical decoder.

abstract: Long-distance quantum communication relies on the ability to efficiently generate and prepare single photons at telecom wavelengths. In many applications these photons must also be indistinguishable such that they exhibit interference on a beamsplitter, which implements effective photon-photon interactions. However, deterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons with high brightness remains a challenging problem. We demonstrate a telecom wavelength source of indistinguishable single photons using an InAs/InP quantum dot in a nanophotonic cavity. The cavity enhances the quantum dot emission, resulting in a nearly Gaussian transverse mode profile with high out-coupling efficiency exceeding 46%, leading to detected photon count rates that would exceed 1.5 million counts per second. We also observe Purcell enhanced spontaneous emission rate as large as 4. Using this source, we generate linearly polarized, high purity single photons at telecom-wavelength and demonstrate the indistinguishable nature of the emission using a two-photon interference measurement. Our results provide a promising approach to generate on-demand indistinguishable single photons at telecom wavelength for applications in quantum networking and quantum communication.

abstract: A graph state and a graph code respectively are defined based on a mathematical simple graph. In this work, we examine a relation between a graph state and a graph code both obtained from the same graph, and show that a graph state is a superposition of logical qubits of the related graph code. By using the relation, we first discuss that a local complementation which has been used for a graph state can be useful for searching locally equivalent stabilizer codes, and second provide a method to find a stabilizer group of a graph code.

abstract: We present a scheme for universal quantum computing using XY Heisenberg spin chains. Information is encoded into packets propagating down these chains, and they interact with each other to perform universal quantum computation. A circuit using g gate blocks on m qubits can be encoded into chains of length $O(g^{3+\delta} m^{3+\delta})$ for all $\delta >0$ with vanishingly small error.

abstract: Can quantum information fundamentally change the way we perceive what is complex? Here, we study statistical complexity, a popular quantifier of complexity that captures the minimal memory required to model a process. We construct a quantum variant of this measure, and evaluate it analytically for a classical Ising spin chain. The resulting complexity measure - quantum statistical complexity - exhibits drastically different qualitative behaviour. Whereas the classical complexity of the spin chain grows monotonically with temperature, its quantum complexity rises to a maximum at some finite temperature then tends back towards zero for higher temperatures. This demonstrates that our notion of what is complex depends fundamentally on which information theory we employ.

abstract: We propose to demonstrate nonreciprocal conversion between microwave photons and optical photons in an electro-optomechanical system where a microwave mode and an optical mode are coupled indirectly via two non-degenerate mechanical modes. The nonreciprocal conversion is obtained in the broken time-reversal symmetry regime, where the conversion of photons from one frequency to the other is enhanced for constructive quantum interference while the conversion in the reversal direction is suppressed due to destructive quantum interference. It is interesting that the nonreciprocal response between the microwave and optical modes in the electro-optomechanical system appears at two different frequencies with opposite directions. The proposal can be used to realize nonreciprocal conversion between photons of any two distinctive modes with different frequencies. Moreover, the electro-optomechanical system can also be used to construct a three-port circulator for three optical modes with distinctively different frequencies by adding an auxiliary optical mode to couple with one of the mechanical modes.

abstract: We examine temperature cooling of optical chaotic light in a quantum dissipation channel with the damping parameter k.The way we do it is by introducing its thermal vacuum state which can expose entangling effect between the system and the reservoir. The temperature cooling formula is derived, which depends on the parameter k, by adjusting k one can control temperature.

abstract: Quantum communication with systems of dimension larger than two provides advantages in information processing tasks. Examples include higher rates of key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation between randomness certification and computational requirements of the postprocessing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still there. We show that for any given quantum violation, the amount of certified randomness can be increased by more computational postprocessing of the experimental data. Furthermore, we introduce a method that significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification. Our results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the hardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to follow.

abstract: In this work, we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of entanglement. In the first part of the work, we reconceptualize the idea of state dependent quantum cloning machine, and in that process we introduce different types of state dependent cloners like static and dynamic state dependent cloners. We derive the conditions under which we can make these cloners independent of the input state. In the broadcasting part, as our resource initial state, we start with general two qubit state and consider specific examples like, non maximally entangled state (NME), Werner like state (WS), and Bell diagonal state (BDS). We apply both state dependent/ state independent cloners, both locally and non-locally, in each of these cases. Incidentally, we find several instances where state dependent cloners outperform state independent cloners in broadcasting. This work gives us a holistic view on the broadcasting of entanglement in various two qubit states, when we have an almost exhaustive sets of cloning machines in our arsenal.

abstract: A quantum two-state system, weakly coupled to a heat bath, is traditionally studied in the Born-Markov regime under the secular approximation with completely positive linear master equations. Despite its success, this microscopic approach exclusively predicts exponential decays and Lorentzian susceptibility profiles, in disagreement with a number of experimental findings. To leave this limited paradigm, we use a phenomenological positive nonlinear master equation being both thermodynamically and statistically consistent. We find that, beyond a temperature-dependent threshold, a bifurcation in the decoherence time $T_2$ takes place; it gives rise to a biexponential decay and a susceptibility profile being neither Gaussian nor Lorentzian. This implies that, for suitable initial states, a major prolongation of the coherence can be obtained in agreement with recent experiments. Moreover, $T_2$ is no longer limited by the energy relaxation time $T_1$ offering novel perspectives to elaborate devices for quantum information processing.

abstract: Following our previous paper, Bergeron et al, Smooth quantum dynamics of the mixmaster universe Phys. Rev. D 92, 061302(R) (2015), concerning the quantization of the vacuum Bianchi IX model and the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer framework, we present a further analysis of the dynamical properties of the model. We apply the harmonic approximation of the anisotropy potential in order to obtain manageable dynamical equations. We study the quantum anisotropic oscillations during the bouncing phase of the universe. Neglecting the backreaction from transitions between quantum anisotropy states we obtain analytical results. In particular, we identify a parameter which is associated with dynamical properties of the quantum model and describes a sort of phase transition. Once the parameter exceeds its critical value, the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down. The application of the present result to a realistic model of the Universe indicates that the parameter indeed exceeds its critical value and that there should have taken place a huge production of anisotropy at the bounce. This in turn must have led to a sustained phase of accelerated expansion, an inflationary-like phase. However, the quantitative inclusion of backreaction is postponed until a follow-up paper based on the vibronic approach.

abstract: Shape dynamics is a theory first proposed by Julian Barbour which states that physics happen uniquely in the reduced configuration space of a theory. So far, studies in the area have focused on gravitational systems. Here we first contemplate on the implications of this idea on quantum mechanics. We summarize the idea of shape dynamics and then give physical configurations of multi qubit systems. It is observed that inclusion of the spacetime curvature introduces a new qubit degree of freedom. This is a novel effect of general relativity on a quantum system. Our aim in the grand picture, is to initiate a research program translating classical shape dynamics to quantum realm.
