abstract: The dynamic atomic polarizability describes the response of the atom to incoming electromagnetic radiation. The functional form of the imaginary part of the polarizability for small driving frequencies omega has been a matter of long-standing discussion, with both a linear dependence and an omega^3 dependence being presented as candidate formulas. The imaginary part of the polarizability enters the expressions of a number of fundamental physical processes which involve the thermal dissipation of energy, such as blackbody friction, and non-contact friction. Here, we solve the long-standing problem by calculating the imaginary part of the polarizability in both the length (d.E) as well as the velocity-gauge (p.A) form of the dipole interaction, verify the gauge invariance, and find general expressions applicable to atomic theory; the omega^3 form is obtained in both gauges. The seagull term in the velocity gauge is found to be crucial in establishing gauge invariance.

abstract: Non-contact friction forces are exerted on physical systems through dissipative processes, when the two systems are not in physical contact with each other, or, in quantum mechanical terms, when the overlap of their wave functions is negligible. Non-contact friction is mediated by the exchange of virtual quanta, with the additional requirement that the scattering process needs to have an inelastic component. For finite-temperature ion-surface interactions, the friction is essentially caused by Ohmic resistance due to the motion of the image charge moving in a dielectric material. A conceivable experiment is difficult because the friction force needs to be isolated from the interaction with the image charge, which significantly distorts the ion's flight path. We propose an experimental setup which is designed to minimize the influence of the image charge interaction though a compensation mechanism, and evaluate the energy loss due to non-contact friction for helium ions (He+) interacting with gold, vanadium, titanium and graphite surfaces. Interactions with the infinite series of mirror charges in the plates are summed in terms of the logarithmic derivatives of the Gamma function, and of the Hurwitz zeta function.

abstract: We introduce the notion of pseudo-stochastic matrices and consider their semigroup property. Unlike stochastic and bistochastic matrices, pseudo-stochastic matrices are permitted to have matrix elements which are negative while respecting the requirement that the sum of the elements of each column is one. They also allow for convex combinations, and carry a Lie group structure which permits the introduction of Lie algebra generators. The quantum analog of a pseudo-stochastic matrix exists and is called a pseudo-positive map. They have the property of transforming a subset of quantum states (characterized by maximal purity or minimal von Neumann entropy requirements) into quantum states. Examples of qubit dynamics connected with "diamond" sets of stochastic matrices and pseudo-positive maps are dealt with.

abstract: We study source compression with a helper in the fully quantum regime, extending our earlier result on classical source compression with a quantum helper [arXiv:1501.04366, 2015]. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem (QRST). This result demonstrates an unexpected connection between distributed source compression with the QRST protocol, a quantum protocol that consumes noiseless resources to simulate a noisy quantum channel.

abstract: General quantum correlations measures like quantum discord, one norm geometric quantum discord, exhibit freezing, sudden change, double sudden change behavior in their decay rates under different noisy channels. Therefore, one may attempt to investigate how the freezing behavior and other dynamical features are affected under application of local quantum operations. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of local filtering on the dynamical evolution of quantum correlations. We have found that using local filtering one may remove freezing depending upon the filtering parameter.

abstract: The influence of the initial preparation on dephasing in open quantum dynamics is studied using an exactly solvable model of a two-level system (qubit) interacting with a bosonic bath. It is found that for some classes of non-selective preparation measurements, qubit-bath correlations lead to a significant enhancement of coherence in the qubit at the initial stage of evolution. The time behavior of the qubit purity and entropy in the regime of enhancement of coherence is considered for different temperatures and coupling strengths.

abstract: Master equations are probably the most fundamental equations for anyone working in quantum optics in the presence of dissipation. In this context it is then incredibly useful to have efficient ways of coding and simulating such equations in the computer, and in this notes I try to introduce in a comprehensive way how do I do so, focusing on Matlab, but making it general enough so that it can be directly translated to any other language or software of choice. I inherited most of my methods from Juan Jos\'{e} Garc\'{\i}a-Ripoll (whose numerical abilities I cannot praise enough), changing them here and there to accommodate them to the way my (fairly limited) numerical brain works, and to connect them as much as possible to how I understand the theory behind them. At present, the notes focus on how to code master equations and find their steady state, but I hope soon I will be able to update them with time evolution methods, including how to deal with time-dependent master equations. During the last 4 years I've tested these methods in various different contexts, including circuit quantum electrodynamics, the laser problem, optical parametric oscillators, and optomechanical systems. Comments and (constructive) criticism are greatly welcome, and will be properly credited and acknowledged.

abstract: Quantum information is an emerging field which has attracted a lot of attention in the last fifteen years or so. It is a broad subject which covers from the most applied questions (e.g., how to build quantum computers or secure cryptographic systems), to the most theoretical problems concerning the formalism of quantum mechanics, its complexity, and its potential to go beyond classical physics. I have written these notes as an introduction to the formalism of quantum information, trying to show how it is a natural progression from an undergraduate course on quantum mechanics (just as I felt it was for me). Hence, these are mainly notes about the language of quantum information and the meaning of its terms, not about its applications. They do not intend to be an exhaustive review about the field, but just a logical sequence of ideas, concepts and definitions, building up towards the continuous variables formalism, which actually takes over most of the notes. In this way, most of the results are stated without proof, and I haven't been careful with references; this is a work in progress, and I intend to add such things in the future. In any case, most of the topics that I introduce have been thoroughly covered in previous books and reviews, and with this notes I only intend to give my point of view, as well as to introduce the different topics and objects in exactly the way I work with and think about them, hoping it will be useful, especially for the people who are starting in the field. These notes originated in 2010 as a way of studying for my close collaboration with Ra\'ul Garc\'ia-Patr\'on and Nicolas J. Cerf, to whom I am deeply grateful for guidance and incredibly clarifying discussions. They benefited greatly as well from the weeks I spent in Doha with Hyunchul Nha and his group in 2012, especially from discussions with him and Ho-Joon Kim.

abstract: The dynamics of the quantum Fisher information of the parameters of the initial atomic state and atomic transition frequency is studied, in the framework of open quantum systems, for a static polarizable two-level atom coupled in the multipolar scheme to a bath of fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields without and with the presence of a reflecting boundary. Our results show that in the case without a boundary, the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations always cause the quantum Fisher information of the initial parameters and thus the precision limit of parameter estimation to decrease. Remarkably, however, with the presence of a boundary, the quantum Fisher information becomes position and atomic polarization dependent, and as a result, it may be enhanced as compared to that in the case without a boundary and may even be shielded from the influence of the vacuum fluctuations in certain circumstances as if it were a closed system.

abstract: Free will has been studied to achieve loophole-free Bell's inequality test and to provide device-independent quantum key distribution security proofs. The required free will (or randomness) such that a local hidden variable model (LHVM) can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality has been studied, but a tight bound has not been proved for a practical case that i) the device settings of the two parties in the Bell test are independent; and ii) the device settings of each party can be correlated or biased across different runs. For a randomness measure related to min-entropy, we prove in this paper a tight bound of the required randomness for this case such that the CHSH inequality can be violated by certain LHVM. Our technique used in the proof is also of independent interest.

abstract: Randomized benchmarking is an important statistical tool for characterising the performance of high-fidelity quantum gates. Here we study randomized benchmarking in the presence of quasi-static (i.e. low-frequency) errors. We contrast the resulting fidelity with that under the conventional assumption of Markovian errors. We treat these limiting cases analytically by mapping the averaging process to a random walk in "Pauli space". In the quasi-static case, we find a broad, highly skewed distribution of fidelities, while Markovian errors produce a narrow, approximately Gaussian distribution of fidelities. We use the filter-transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these differences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in certain random sequences. Large skew in the distribution towards high-fidelity outcomes -- consistent with existing experimental data -- highlights potential finite-sampling pitfalls when deploying randomized benchmarking. Moreover, these results demonstrate general challenges in extracting useful single-gate fidelities from randomized benchmarking measurements with correlated errors.

This strategy combines the robustness against practical imperfections of classical light with the improvement provided by nonlinear detection. Regarding ultimate quantum limits, we stress that, as a difference with linear schemes, the nonlinearity introduces pulse duration as a new variable into play along with the energy resources.

abstract: In contrast to the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) defined conventionally, the inverse OMIT behaves as coherent absorption of the input lights in the optomechanical systems. We characterize a feasible inverse OMIT in a multi-channel fashion with a double-sided optomechanical cavity system coupled to a nearby charged nanomechanical resonator via Coulomb interaction, where two counter-propagating probe lights can be absorbed via one of the channels or even via three channels simultaneously with the assistance of a strong pump light. Under realistic conditions, we demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our model using two slightly different nanomechanical resonators and the possibility of detecting the energy dissipation of the system. In particular, we find that our model turns to be an unilateral inverse OMIT once the two probe lights are different with a relative phase, and in this case we show the possibility to measure the relative phase precisely.

abstract: We report a thorough investigation of finite-temperature effects on three-body recombination near a triatomic Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. Our measurements cover a wide range from a near-ideal realization of the zero-temperature limit to a strongly temperature-dominated regime. The experimental results are analyzed within a recently introduced theoretical model based on a universal zero-range theory. The temperature-induced shift of the resonance reveals a contribution that points to an energy-dependence of the three-body parameter. We interpret this contribution in terms of the finite range of the van der Waals interaction in real atomic systems and we quantify it in an empirical way based on length scale arguments. A universal character of the corresponding resonance shift is suggested by observations related to other Efimov resonances and the comparison with a theoretical finite-temperature approach that explicitly takes the van der Waals interaction into account. Our findings are of importance for the precise determination of Efimov resonance positions from experiments at finite temperatures.

abstract: We prove a one-shot "minimax" converse bound for quantum channel coding assisted by positive partial transpose channels between sender and receiver. The bound is similar in spirit to the converse by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu [IEEE Trans. Info. Theory 56, 2307-2359 (2010)] for classical channel coding, and also enjoys the saddle point property enabling the order of optimizations to be interchanged. Equivalently, the bound can be formulated as a semidefinite program satisfying strong duality. The convex nature of the bound implies channel symmetries can substantially simplify the optimization, enabling us to explicitly compute the finite blocklength behavior for several simple qubit channels. In particular, we find that finite blocklength converse statements for the classical erasure channel apply to the assisted quantum erasure channel, while bounds for the classical binary symmetric channel apply to both the assisted dephasing and depolarizing channels. This implies that these qubit channels inherit statements regarding the asymptotic limit of large blocklength, such as the strong converse or second-order converse rates, from their classical counterparts. Moreover, for the dephasing channel, the finite blocklength bounds are as tight as those for the classical binary symmetric channel, since coding for classical phase errors yields equivalently-performing unassisted quantum codes.

abstract: Motivated by a model presented by S. Gudder, we study a quantum generalization of Markov chains and discuss the relation between these maps and open quantum random walks, a class of quantum channels described by S. Attal et al. We consider processes which are nonhomogeneous in time, i.e., at each time step, a possibly distinct evolution kernel. Inspired by a spectral technique described by L. Saloff-Coste and J. Z\'u\~niga, we define a notion of ergodicity for nonhomogeneous quantum Markov chains and describe a criterion for ergodicity of such objects in terms of singular values. As a consequence we obtain a quantum version of the classical probability result concerning the behavior of the columns (or rows) of the iterates of a stochastic matrix induced by a finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain. We are also able to relate the ergodic property presented here with the notions of weak and uniform ergodicity known in the literature of noncommutative $L^1$-spaces.

abstract: Practical realizations of quantum-enhanced interferometry are vulnerable to imperfections such as the residual spectral distinguishability of interfering photons. We demonstrate experimentally that a careful design of the spatial structure of used photons, combined with position-resolved coincidence detection at the output, allows one to recover quantum enhancement for a two-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer operated in a regime that otherwise cannot even attain the shot-noise limit. This shows the potential of engineering the modal structure of physical systems in metrological applications.

abstract: Ultrashort non-resonant electromagnetic pulses applied to effective one-electron systems may operate on the electronic state as a position or momentum translation operator. As derived here, extension to many-body correlated systems exposes qualitatively new aspects. For instance, to the lowest order in the electric field intensity the action of the pulse is expressible in terms of the two-body reduced density matrix enabling thus to probe various facets of electronic correlations. As an experimental realization we propose a pump-probe scheme in which after a weak, swift "kick" by the non-resonant pulse the survival probability for remaining in the initial state is measured. This probability we correlate to the two-body reduced density matrix. Since the strength of electronic correlation is bond-length sensitive, measuring the survival probability may allow for a direct insight into the bond-dependent two-body correlation in the ground state. As an illustration, full numerical calculations for two molecular systems are provided and different measures of electronic correlations are analyzed.

abstract: Quantum walks are interesting simple models for describing various fundamental processes in nature ranging from chaos or photosynthesis to universal quantum computation. Their implementation usually comprises a single particle and $O(n^2)$ optical elements, where $n$ is the size of the quantum walk space. The question arises if this can be achieved with fewer or complementary resources. Here we show that this can be done using a multi-particle Hong--Ou--Mandel interference. It employs $O(n)$ indistinguishable bosons and a single beam splitter to achieve a similar quantum walk. In addition we show that a quantum-to-classical transition takes place if the particles become distinguishable. This approach establishes a link between the fundamental indistinguishability of quantum particles and the wavelike coherent nature of the walk.

abstract: We compare the explicitly covariant 4-dimensional formula, recently proposed by V.P.\ Makarov and S.A.\ Rukhadze [Phys. Usp. {\bf 52} 937 (2011)] for symmetric energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic field in a medium, and the energy-momentum tensor derived by Abraham in the 3-dimensional vector form. It is shown that these two objects coincide only on the physical configuration space $\overline \Gamma $, formed by the field vectors and the velocity of the medium, which satisfy the constitutive relations. It should be emphasized that the 3-dimensional vector formulae for the components of the energy-momentum tensor were obtained by Abraham only on $\overline \Gamma $, and the task of their extension to the whole unconditional configuration space $\Gamma$ was not posed. In order to accomplish the comparison noted above we derive the Makarov-Rukhadze formula a new by another method, namely, by generalizing the Abraham reasoning. The comparison conducted enables one to treat the Makarov-Rukhadze formula as a unique consistent extension of the Abraham formulae to the whole configuration space $\Gamma$. Thus the question concerning the relativistic covariance of the original 3-dimensional Abraham formulae defined on $\overline\Gamma$ is solved positively. We discuss in detail the relativistic covariance of the 3-dimensional vector formulae for individual components of the 4-dimensional tensors in electrodynamics which is manifested in the form-invariance of these formulae under Lorentz transformations.

abstract: We propose the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) method for multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). A multicarrier CVQKD protocol utilizes Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CV) for information transmission. The GQI framework provides a minimal error estimate of the quadratures of the CV quantum states from the discrete, measured noisy subcarrier variables. GQI utilizes the fundamentals of regularization theory and statistical information processing. We characterize GQI for multicarrier CVQKD, and define a method for the statistical modeling and processing of noisy Gaussian subcarrier quadratures. We demonstrate the results through the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division (AMQD) scheme. We define direct GQI (DGQI), and prove that it achieves a theoretical minimal magnitude error. We introduce the terms statistical secret key rate and statistical private classical information, which quantities are derived purely by the statistical functions of GQI. We prove the secret key rate formulas for a multiple access multicarrier CVQKD via the AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) scheme. The GQI and DGQI frameworks can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol and measurement setting, and are implementable by standard low-complexity statistical functions, which is particularly convenient for an experimental CVQKD scenario.

abstract: At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion. We justify our stronger definition by showing their equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we give a generic transformation to turn a big class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones.

abstract: We present and utilize a simple formalism for the smooth creation of boundary conditions within relativistic quantum field theory. We consider a massless scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions and imagine smoothly transitioning from there being no boundary condition to there being a two-sided Dirichlet mirror. The act of doing this, expectantly, generates a flux of real quanta that emanates from the mirror as it is being created. We show, surprisingly, that the local stress-energy tensor of this flux is finite only if an infrared cutoff is introduced, no matter how slowly the mirror is created. We then consider the limit of instantaneous mirror creation, a scenario of interest in regards to vacuum entanglement and black hole firewalls. While the total energy injected into the field is ultraviolet divergent in the instantaneous creation limit, we show that the response of an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector passing through the infinite burst of energy nevertheless remains finite, although dependent on the infrared cutoff.

More precisely, we consider the interaction between a cylinder parallel to a plate, between two parallel cylinders outside each other, and between a cylinder lying parallelly inside another cylinder. We derive the explicit formulas for the Casimir interaction energies and compute the leading and the next-to-leading order terms of the small separation asymptotic expansions. As expected, the leading order terms coincide with the proximity force approximations. We compare the results of the next-to-leading order terms of different quantum fields, and show that our results support the ansatz of derivative expansions.

abstract: We develop a theory to address the non-equilibrium dynamics of phonons in a one-dimensional trapped ion system. We elaborate our earlier results obtained in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 111}, 170406 (2013) to chart out the mechanism of dynamics-induced cooling and entanglement generation between phonons in these systems when subjected to a linear ramp protocol inducing site-specific tuning of on-site interactions between the phonons. We further extend these studies to non-linear ramps and periodic drive protocols and identify the optimal ramp protocol for minimal cooling and entanglement generation time. We qualitatively address the effect of noise arising out of fluctuation of the intensity of the laser used to generate entanglement and provide a detailed discussion of a realistic experimental setup which may serve as a test bed for our theory.

abstract: We study the corpuscular model of an evaporating black hole consisting of a specific quantum state for a large number $N$ of self-confined bosons. The single-particle spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$ (corresponding to toy gravitons forming the black hole), and a gapless continuous spectrum (to accommodate for the Hawking radiation with energy $\omega>m$). Each constituent is in a superposition of the ground state and a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature in the continuum. We first find that, assuming the Hawking radiation is the leading effect of the internal scatterings, the corresponding $N$-particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy $M=N\,m$ and a Planckian distribution for $E>M$ at the same Hawking temperature. From this collective state, we compute the partition function and obtain an entropy which reproduces the usual area law with a logarithmic correction precisely related with the Hawking component. By means of the horizon wave-function for the system, we finally show the backreaction of modes with $\omega>m$ reduces the Hawking flux. Both corrections, to the entropy and to the Hawking flux, suggest the evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass, if the black hole is in this particular quantum state.

abstract: In this paper we applied the no-signaling in time (NSIT) formalism discussed by Kofler and Brukner to investigate temporal entanglement between binary human behavioral unconscious choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2. NSIT consists of a set of inequalities and represents mathematical conditions for macro-realism which require only two measurements in time. The analyses of three independent experiments show a strong violation of NSIT in two out of three of them, supporting the hypothesis of a quantum-like temporal entanglement between human choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2

abstract: This article is a review of results on the nonlinear Schroedinger / Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLS / GP). Nonlinear bound states and aspects of their stability theory are discussed from variational and bifurcation perspectives. Nonlinear bound states, in the particular cases where the potential is a single-well, double-well potential and periodic potential, are discussed in detail. We then discuss particle-like dynamics of solitary wave solutions interacting with a potential over a large, but finite, time interval. Finally we turn to the very long time behavior of solutions. We focus on the important resonant radiation damping mechanism that drives the relaxation of the system to a nonlinear ground state and underlies the phenomena of {\it Ground State Selection} and {\it Energy Equipartition}. We also analyze linear and nonlinear "toy minimal models", which illustrate these mechanisms. Regarding the overall style of this article, we seek to emphasize the key ideas and therefore do not present all technical details, leaving that to the references.

abstract: Photosynthesis -- the conversion of sunlight to chemical energy -- is fundamental for supporting life on our planet. Despite its importance, the physical principles that underpin the primary steps of photosynthesis, from photon absorption to electronic charge separation, remain to be understood in full. Previously, electronic coherence within tightly-packed light-harvesting (LH) units or within individual reaction centers (RCs) has been recognized as an important ingredient for a complete understanding of the excitation energy transfer dynamics. However, the electronic coherence across RC and LH units has been consistently neglected as it does not play a significant role during these relatively slow transfer processes. Here, we turn our attention to the absorption process, which occurs on much shorter timescales. We demonstrate that the - often overlooked - spatially extended but short-lived excitonic delocalization across RC and LH units plays a relevant role in general photosynthetic systems, as it causes a redistribution of direct absorption towards the charge separation unit. Using the complete core complex of Rhodospirillum rubrum, we verify experimentally an 80 % increase in the direct optical absorption of the RC in situ as compared to isolated RCs. Numerical calculations reveal that similar enhancements can be expected for a wide variety of photosynthetic units in both plant and bacterial systems, suggesting that this mechanism is conserved across species and providing a clear new design principle for light-harvesting nanostructures

abstract: We explore the microwave radiation emitted from a biased double quantum dot due to the inelastic tunneling of single charges. Radiation is detected over a broad range of detuning configurations between the dot energy levels with pronounced maxima occurring in resonance with a capacitively coupled transmission line resonator. The power emitted for forward and reverse resonant detuning is found to be in good agreement with a rate equation model, which considers the hybridization of the individual dot charge states.

abstract: The shifted Tietz-Wei (sTW) oscillator is as good as traditional Morse potential in simulating the atomic interaction in diatomic molecules. By using the Pekeris-type approximation to deal with the centrifugal term, we obtain the bound-state solutions of the radial Schr\"odinger equation with this typical molecular model via the exact quantization rule (EQR). The energy spectrum for a set of diatomic molecules ($NO \left(a^4\Pi_i\right)$, $NO \left(B^2\Pi_r\right)$, $NO \left(L'^2\phi\right)$, $NO \left(b^4\Sigma^{-}\right)$, $ICl\left(X^1\Sigma_g^{+}\right)$, $ICl\left(A^3\Pi_1\right)$ and $ICl\left(A'^3\Pi_2\right)$ for arbitrary values of $n$ and $\ell$ quantum numbers are obtained. For the sake of completeness, we study the corresponding wavefunctions using the formula method.

abstract: We theoretically discuss an implementation of a Sagnac interferometer with cold atoms. In contrast to currently existing schemes our protocol does not rely on any free propagation of atoms. Instead it is based on superpositions of fully confined atoms and state-dependent transport along a closed path. Using Ramsey sequences for an atomic clock, the accumulated Sagnac phase is encoded in the resulting population imbalance between two internal (clock) states. Using minimal models for the above protocol we analytically quantify limitations arising from atomic dynamics and finite temperature. We discuss an actual implementation of the interferometer with adiabatic radio-frequency potentials that is inherently robust against common mode noise as well as phase noise from the reference oscillator.
