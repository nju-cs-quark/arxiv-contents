abstract: Wave function collapse models postulate a fundamental breakdown of the quantum superposition principle at the macroscale. Therefore, experimental tests of collapse models are also fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. Therefore, experimental tests of collapse models can be regarded as fundamental tests of the quantum superposition principle. Here, we compute the upper bounds on the collapse parameters, which can be inferred by the gravitational wave detectors AURIGA, LIGO and LISA Pathfinder. We consider the most widely used collapse model, the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model. We show that these experiments exclude a huge portion of the CSL parameter space, the strongest bound being set by the recently launched space mission LISA Pathfinder.

abstract: Multi-photon interference results in modulations of output probabilities with phase shift periods that are much shorter than 2 Pi. Here, we investigate the physics behind these statistical patterns in the case of well-defined photon numbers in the input and output modes of a two-path interferometer. We show that the periodicity of the multi-photon interference is related to the weak value of the unobserved intensity difference between the two arms of the interferometer. This means that the operator relations between the photon number differences in input, path, and output can be used to determine the periodicity of the experimentally observed quantum interference, establishing an important link between the classical causality of random phase interference and quantum effects that depend on the superposition of classically distinct possibilities.

abstract: We study the shift of rotational levels of a diatomic polar molecule due to its van der Waals (vdW) interaction with a gently curved dielectric surface at temperature $T$, and submicron separations. The molecule is assumed to be in its electronic and vibrational ground state, and the rotational degrees are described by a rigid rotor model. We show that under these conditions retardation effects and surface dispersion can be neglected. The level shifts are found to be independent of $T$, and given by the quantum state averaged classical electrostatic interaction of the dipole with its image on the surface. We use a derivative expansion for the static Green's function to express the shifts in terms of surface curvature. We argue that the curvature induced line splitting is experimentally observable, and not obscured by natural line widths and thermal broadening.

abstract: The standard method of "measuring" quantum wavefunction is the technique of {\it indirect} quantum state tomography. Owing to conceptual novelty and possible advantages, an alternative {\it direct} scheme was proposed and demonstrated recently in quantum optics system. In this work we present a study on the direct scheme of measuring qubit state in the circuit QED system, based on weak measurement and weak value concepts. To be applied to generic parameter conditions, our formulation and analysis are carried out for finite strength weak measurement, and in particular beyond the bad-cavity and weak-response limits. The proposed study is accessible to the present state-of-the-art circuit-QED experiments.

abstract: The behaviour of a neutral particle (atom, molecule) with an induced electric dipole moment in a region with a uniform effective magnetic field under the influence of the Kratzer potential [A. Kratzer, Z. Phys. 3, 289 (1920)] and rotating effects is analysed. It is shown that the degeneracy of the Landau-type levels is broken and the angular frequency of the system acquires a new contribution that stems from the rotation effects. Moreover, in the search for bound states solutions, then, it is shown that the possible values of this angular frequency of the system are determined by the quantum numbers associated with the radial modes and the angular momentum, the angular velocity of the rotating frame and by the parameters associated with the Kratzer potential.

abstract: The quest to have both which-path knowledge and interference fringes in a double-slit experiment dates back to the inception of quantum mechanics (QM) and to the famous Einstein-Bohr debates. In this paper we propose and discuss an experiment able to spy on one photon's path with another photon. We modify the quantum state inside the interferometer as opposed to the traditional physical modification of the "wave-like" or "particle-like" experimental setup. We are able to show that it is the ability to harvest or not which-path information that finally limits the visibility of the interference pattern and not the "wave-like" or "particle-like" experimental setups. Remarkably, a full "particle-like" experimental setup is able to show interference fringes with 100 % visibility if the quantum state is carefully engineered.

abstract: Young's classic double-slit experiment demonstrates the reality of interference when waves and particles travel simultaneously along two different spatial paths. Here, we propose a double-slit experiment in momentum space. We show that elastic scattering of vortex electrons proceeds via two paths in momentum space, which are well localized and well separated from each other. For such vortex beams, the (plane-wave) amplitudes along the two paths acquire adjustable phase shifts and produce interference fringes in the final angular distribution. We argue that this experiment can be realized with the present day technology. We show that it gives experimental access to the Coulomb phase, a quantity which plays an important role in all charged particle scattering but which usual scattering experiments are insensitive to.

abstract: We present Dirichlet spectra of the paradigm model of complex PT-symmetric potential: $V_{BB}(x,N)=-(ix)^N$ for $2 \le N<12$ (excepting $N=4, 8$), using both numerical integration of Schr{\"o}dinger equation with $\psi(x=\pm \infty)=0$ and the diagonalization of $H=p^2/2\mu+V_{BB}(x,N)$ in the harmonic oscillator basis. We show that these real discrete spectra are consistent with the most simple two-turning point CWKB method provided we choose the maximal turning points (MxTP) [$-a+ib,a+ib, a, b \in {\cal R}$] such that $|a|$ is the largest for a given energy among all (multiple) turning points. On the other hand, the real discrete spectra of $V_{BB}(x,2\le N \le 5)$ obtained earlier by the method of complex wedges is also known to be consistent with CWKB. We point out that then used pair of turning points were actually minimal (when $|a|$ is the least) and the same as MxTP only for $N \in [2,4]$.

abstract: Ever since Schrodinger, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation has been regarded as the fundamental physical law of the unitary-only quantum theory. However, while the origin of time for non-conservative systems can be traced back to the environmental influence, this procedure is inapplicable for the closed (conservative) quantum systems. Hence the question of the origin of time for closed systems. In addressing this issue, in order to avoid circularity of the standard universal (global) time as well as assumptions that could be additional to the standard postulates of quantum theory, we stick to the so-called quantum-mechanical local time. The problems that inevitably appear in such minimalist rejection of the standard role of time in physics are solved with mathematical rigor while leading to the emergent time for every, at least approximately, closed (conservative) system as well as to establishing the time-dependent Schrodinger law as the fundamental law of the unitary non-relativistic as well as relativistic-field quantum theory.

abstract: We present the possibility of steering the direction of correlations between the off-resonant Raman scattered photons from the angularly multimode atomic memory based on warm rubidium vapors. Using acusto-optical deflectors (AOD) driven by different modulation frequencies we experimentally change the angle of incidence of the laser beams on the atomic ensemble. Performing correlations measurements for various deflection angles we verify that we can choose the anti-Stokes light propagation direction independently of the correlated Stokes scattered light in the continuous way. As a result we can select the spatial mode of photons retrieved from the memory, which may be important for future development of quantum information processing.

abstract: Novel ion traps that provide either a static or a dynamic magnetic gradient field allow for the use of radio frequency (rf) radiation for coupling internal and motional states of ions, which is essential for conditional quantum logic. We show that the coupling mechanism in the presence of a dynamic gradient is the same, in a dressed state basis, as in the case of a static gradient. Then, it is shown how demanding experimental requirements arising when using a dynamic gradient could be overcome. Thus, using dressed states in a dynamic gradient field could decisively reduce experimental complexity on the route towards a scalable device for quantum information science based on rf-driven trapped ions.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1606.04826
abstract: We introduce the general parameter Q_PB that provides an experimentally accessible nonclassicality measure for light. The parameter is quantified by the click statistics obtained from on-off detectors in a general multiplexing detection setup. Sub-Poisson-binomial statistics, observed by Q_PB < 0, indicates that a given state of light is nonclassical. Our new parameter replaces the binomial parameter Q_B for more general cases, where any unbalance among the multiplexed modes is allowed. The significance of the parameter Q_PB is theoretically examined in a measurement setup that only consists of a ring resonator and a single on-off detector. The proposed setup exploits minimal experimental resources and is geared towards a fully integrated quantum nanophotonic circuit. The results show that nonclassical features remain noticeable even in the presence of significant losses.

abstract: We study a proof-of-principle example of the recently proposed hybrid quantum-classical simulation of strongly correlated fermion models in the thermodynamic limit. In a "two-site" dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach we reduce the Hubbard model to an effective impurity model subject to self-consistency conditions. The resulting minimal two-site representation of the non-linear hybrid setup involves four qubits implementing the impurity problem, plus an ancilla qubit on which all measurements are performed. We outline a possible implementation with superconducting circuits feasible with near-future technology.

abstract: Any imaging device such as a microscope or telescope has a resolution limit, a minimum separation it can resolve between two objects or sources; this limit is typically defined by "Rayleigh's criterion", although in recent years there have been a number of high-profile techniques demonstrating that Rayleigh's limit can be surpassed under particular sets of conditions. Quantum information and quantum metrology have given us new ways to approach measurement ; a new proposal inspired by these ideas has now re-examined the problem of trying to estimate the separation between two poorly resolved point sources. The "Fisher information" provides the inverse of the Cramer-Rao bound, the lowest variance achievable for an unbiased estimator. For a given imaging system and a fixed number of collected photons, Tsang, Nair and Lu observed that the Fisher information carried by the intensity of the light in the image-plane (the only information available to traditional techniques, including previous super-resolution approaches) falls to zero as the separation between the sources decreases; this is known as "Rayleigh's Curse." On the other hand, when they calculated the quantum Fisher information of the full electromagnetic field (including amplitude and phase information), they found it remains constant. In other words, there is infinitely more information available about the separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity alone. Here we implement a proof-of-principle system which makes use of the phase information, and demonstrate a greatly improved ability to estimate the distance between a pair of closely-separated sources, and immunity to Rayleigh's curse.

abstract: We consider the question of whether the leading contribution to the entanglement entropy in holographic CFTs is truly given by the expectation value of a linear operator as is suggested by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We investigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the replica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct geometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expectation value of the area operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the number of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the central charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the choice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density matrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the homology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology constraint is not a linear property in the CFT. We also discuss the existence of entropy operators in general systems with a large number of degrees of freedom.

abstract: The presence of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits emerges as an intrinsic constraint on their coherence. While it is difficult to prevent the generation of quasiparticles, keeping them away from active elements of the qubit provides a viable way of improving the device performance. Here we develop theoretically and validate experimentally a model for the effect of a single small trap on the dynamics of the excess quasiparticles injected in a transmon-type qubit. The model allows one to evaluate the time it takes to evacuate the injected quasiparticles from the transmon as a function of trap parameters. With the increase of the trap size, this time decreases monotonically, saturating at the level determined by the quasiparticles diffusion constant and the qubit geometry. We determine the characteristic trap size needed for the relaxation time to approach that saturation value.

abstract: Photoisomerization, i.e., a change of molecular structure after absorption of a photon, is one of the most fundamental photochemical processes. It can perform desirable functionality, e.g., as the primary photochemical event in human vision, where it stores electronic energy in the molecular structure, or for possible applications in solar energy storage and as memories, switches, and actuators; but it can also have detrimental effects, for example as an important damage pathway under solar irradiation of DNA, or as a limiting factor for the efficiency of organic solar cells. While photoisomerization can be avoided by shielding the system from light, this is of course not a viable pathway for approaches that rely on the interaction with external light (such as solar cells or solar energy storage). Here, we show that strong coupling of organic molecules to a confined light mode can be used to strongly suppress photoisomerization, and thus convert molecules that normally show fast photodegradation into photostable forms.

We find that the whole procedure is full of problematic points, on both physical relevancy and mathematical correctness. In particular, we illustrate the problems associated with the technical derivation of QRE, as well as its invalid physical implications. Thus, all claims concerning the inevitability of focusing and the formation of conjugate points, including the singularity evading, are, to us, not valid.

abstract: In quadrupole-bound anions, an extra electron is attached at a sufficiently large quadrupole moment of a neutral molecule, which is lacking a permanent dipole moment. The nature of the bound states and low-lying resonances of such anions is of interest for understanding the threshold behavior of open quantum systems in general. In this work, we investigate the properties of quadrupolar anions as extreme halo systems, the formation of rotational bands, and the transition from a subcritical to supercritical electric quadrupole moment. We solve the electron-plus-molecule problem using a non-adiabatic coupled-channel formalism by employing the Berggren ensemble, which explicitly contains bound states, narrow resonances, and the scattering continuum. We demonstrate that binding energies and radii of quadrupolar anions strictly follow the scaling laws for two-body halo systems. Contrary to the case of dipolar anions, ground-state band of quadrupolar anions smoothly extend into the continuum, and many rotational bands could be identified above the detachment threshold. We study the evolution of a bound state of an anion as to dives into the continuum at a critical quadrupole moment and we show that the associated critical exponent is consistent with the second-order phase transition. Everything considered, quadrupolar anions represent a perfect laboratory for the studies of marginally bound open quantum systems.

abstract: Kapitza-Dirac scattering of nonrelativistic electrons from counterpropagating bichromatic laser waves of linear polarization i s studied. The focus lies on the electronic spin dynamics in the Bragg regime when the laser fields possess a frequency ratio of two. To this end, the time-dependent Pauli equation is solved numerically, both in coordinate space and momentum space. Our numerical results are corroborated by analytical derivations. We demonstrate that, for certain incident electron momenta, the scattering crucially relies on the electron spin which undergo es characteristic Rabi-like oscillations. A parameter regime is identified where the Rabi oscillations reach maximum amplitude. We also briefly discuss spin-dependent Kapitza-Dirac scattering of protons.

abstract: The study of the fundamental properties of phonons is crucial to understand their role in applica- tions in quantum information science, where the active use of phonons is currently highly debated. A genuine quantum phenomenon associated with the fluctuation properties of phonons is squeezing, which is achieved when the fluctuations of a certain variable drop below their respective vacuum value. We consider a semiconductor quantum dot in which the exciton is coupled to phonons. We review the fluctuation properties of the phonons, which are generated by optical manipulation of the quantum dot, in the limiting case of ultra short pulses. Then we discuss the phonon properties for an excitation with finite pulses. Within a generating function formalism we calculate the corre- sponding fluctuation properties of the phonons and show that phonon squeezing can be achieved by the optical manipulation of the quantum dot exciton for certain conditions even for a single pulse excitation where neither for short nor for long pulses squeezing occurs. To explain the occurrence of squeezing we employ a Wigner function picture providing a detailed understanding of the induced quantum dynamics.

abstract: We consider a class of one-dimensional compass models with XYZ$-$YZX-type of three-site exchange interaction in an external magnetic field. We present the exact solution derived by means of Jordan-Wigner transformation, and study the excitation gap, spin correlations, and establish the phase diagram. Besides the canted antiferromagnetic and polarized phases, the three-site interactions induce two distinct chiral phases, corresponding to gapless spinless-fermion systems having two or four Fermi points. We find that the $z$ component of scalar chirality operator can act as an order parameter for these chiral phases. We also find that the thermodynamic quantities including the Wilson ratio can characterize the liquid phases. Finally, a nontrivial magnetoelectric effect is explored, and we show that the polarization can be manipulated by the magnetic field in the absence of electric field.
