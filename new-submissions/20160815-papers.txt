abstract: In this letter, we propose and experimentally test a quantumness criterion for individual single systems. The criterion is based on the violation of an already reported classical inequality which is found in deriving Bell and Legget-Garg inequalities. This inequality is expressed in terms of joint probabilities that we identify as realizations of preparation-and-measurement schemes. Our analysis points out that superposition is the key notion to grasp the quantum nature of physical systems.

abstract: Quantum mechanics dictates that a measurement without perturbation is not possible. A textbook example is the observation of the position of an object, which imposes a random back action perturbation on the momentum. This randomness translates with time into position uncertainty, thus leading to the well known uncertainty on the measurement of motion. Here we demonstrate that the back action on an oscillator measured in a reference frame of another oscillator with an effective negative mass can be evaded in both position and momentum variables simultaneously. The mechanical oscillator is a millimeter-sized membrane and the reference negative mass oscillator is the collective spin of an atomic ensemble precessing in a magnetic field. Laser light transmitted through the hybrid system of these two disparate oscillators serves as the meter. We first observe the quantum measurement back action on each oscillator. We then demonstrate that back action at the single noise photon level is efficiently suppressed or enhanced depending on the sign of the effective mass of the reference spin oscillator. The two oscillators are separated by one meter but can be placed at a much larger distance as they are interfaced by laser light. The reference spin oscillator is insensitive to gravity and acceleration which can be efficiently detected by the mechanical oscillator in the absence of the measurement back action. The novel hybrid quantum system presented here paves the road to generation of entanglement and distant quantum communication between mechanical and spin systems and to back action free sensing of acceleration and force.

abstract: We propose an effective and flexible scheme for reverse engineering of a Hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators to eliminate the terms of Hamiltonian which are hard to be realized in practice. Different from transitionless quantum driving (TQD) [31], the present scheme is focus on only one or parts of moving states in a D-dimension (D > 3) system. The numerical simulation shows that the present scheme not only contains the results of TQD, but also has more free parameters, which make this scheme more flexible. An example is given by using this scheme to realize the population transfer for a Rydberg atom. The influences of various decoherence processes are discussed by numerical simulation and the result shows that the scheme is fast and robust against the decoherence and operational imperfection. Therefore, this scheme may be used to construct a Hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments

abstract: A Hamiltonian operator H is constructed with the property that if the eigenfunctions are formally required to obey a suitable boundary condition, then the associated eigenvalues correspond to the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The classical limit of H is 2xp, which is consistent with the Berry-Keating conjecture. While H is not Hermitian, iH is symmetric under PT reflection. The PT symmetry appears to be maximally broken, which suggests that the eigenvalues of H are real and that the Riemann hypothesis is valid. Further heuristic analysis of H supports the conclusion that its eigenvalues are real.

abstract: This paper reviews the physics of quantum disorder in relation with a series of experiments using laser-cooled atoms exposed to "kicks" of a standing wave, realizing a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, the kicked rotor. This dynamical system can be mapped onto a tight-binding Hamiltonian with pseudo-disorder, formally equivalent to the Anderson model of quantum disorder, with quantum chaos playing the role of disorder. This provides a very good quantum simulator for the Anderson physics.

abstract: Optomechanical arrays made of structured flexible dielectrics are a promising system for exploring quantum and many-body optomechanical phenomena. We generalize investigations of the optomechanical properties of periodic arrays of one-dimensional scatterers in optical resonators to the case of vibrating membranes whose thickness is not necessarily small with respect to the optical wavelength of interest. The array optical transmission spectrum and its optomechanical coupling with a linear Fabry-Perot cavity field are investigated both analytically and numerically.

abstract: Boson Sampling represents a class of physical processes potentially intractable for classical devices to simulate. The Gaussian extension of Boson Sampling remains a computationally hard problem, where the input state is a product of uncorrelated Gaussian modes. Besides, motivated by molecular spectroscopy, Vibronic Boson Sampling involves operations that can generate Gaussian correlation among different Boson modes. Therefore, Gaussian Boson Sampling is a special case of Vibronic Boson Sampling. However, this does not necessarily mean that Vibronic Boson Sampling is more complex than Gaussian Boson Sampling. Here we develop a hierarchical structure to show how the initial correlation in Vibronic Boson Sampling can be absorbed in Gaussian Boson Sampling with ancillary modes and in a scattershot fashion. Since every Gaussian state is associated with a thermal state, our result implies that every sampling problem in molecular vibronic transitions, at any temperature, can be simulated by Gaussian Boson Sampling associated with a product of vacuum modes.

title: Scalable entanglement of remote material qubits produced by single photons via a no-energy-exchange process

abstract: We propose a proposal to generate scalable entanglement of remote material qubits via no-energy-exchange interactions with single photons. A strongly-coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system is arranged as a single-photon-level quantum router, which routes incoming photons to different outports based on the state of the involved material qubit. Two of the routers with qubits in their maximum superposition state are coupled together with a Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-like configuration. As a single photon transits through the system, we find the maximum entangled state between qubits is produced by finding a photon in the output mode. Remarkably, there is no energy exchanged between material qubits and photons. This ensures the possibility of purifying entangled states by using more photons in a physical situation, where loss and imperfections are inevitable. It also guarantees scalability in order to produce entanglement among multiple qubits without inducing incoherence caused by energy exchange. We analyzed the fidelity and probability of success for the proposed strongly-coupled CQED system. The expected maximum fidelity could reach over 0.9997 using only two photons in a technologically-feasible experiment. We also analyzed the scalability by providing examples for the generation of N-qubit entanglement and 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states based on the proposed technique. Our proposed method could be applied to create entanglement between multiple-node systems in a quantum network, or to generate special entangled state between remote material qubits, thereby testing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We consider quantum metrology with arbitrary prior knowledge of the parameter. We demonstrate that a single sensing two-level system can act as a virtual multi-level system that offers increased sensitivity in a Bayesian, single-shot, metrology scenario and that allows one to estimate (arbitrary) large parameter values by avoiding phase wraps. This is achieved by making use of additional degrees of freedom or auxiliary systems not participating in the sensing process. The joint system is manipulated by intermediate control operations in such a way that an effective Hamiltonian, with an arbitrary spectrum, is generated that mimics the spectrum of a multi-level system interacting with the field. We show how to use additional internal degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion to achieve a high-sensitivity magnetic field sensor for fields with arbitrary prior.

abstract: In this paper, we study relativistic bit commitment, which uses timing and location constraints to achieve information theoretic security. We consider the $F_Q$ multi-round bit commitment scheme introduced by Lunghi et al. [LKB+15]. This protocol was shown secure against classical adversaries as long as the number of rounds $m$ is small compared to $\sqrt{Q}$ where $Q$ is the size of the used field in the protocol [CCL15,FF16]. In this work, we study classical attacks on this scheme. We use classical strategies for the $CHSH_Q$ game described in [BS15] to derive cheating strategies for this protocol. In particular, our cheating strategy shows that if $Q$ is an even power of any prime, then the protocol is not secure when the number of rounds $m$ is of the order of $\sqrt{Q}$. For those values of $Q$, this means that the upper bound of [CCL15,FF16] is essentially optimal.

abstract: Synthetic magnetism has been used to control charge neutral excitations for applications ranging from classical beam steering to quantum simulation. In optomechanics, radiation-pressure-induced parametric coupling between optical (photon) and mechanical (phonon) excitations may be used to break time-reversal symmetry, providing the prerequisite for synthetic magnetism. Here we design and fabricate a silicon optomechanical circuit with both optical and mechanical connectivity between two optomechanical cavities. Driving the two cavities with phase-correlated laser light results in a synthetic magnetic flux, which in combination with dissipative coupling to the mechanical bath, leads to nonreciprocal transport of photons with 35dB of isolation. Additionally, optical pumping with blue-detuned light manifests as a particle non-conserving interaction between photons and phonons, resulting in directional optical amplification of 12dB in the isolator through direction. These results indicate the feasibility of utilizing optomechanical circuits to create a more general class of nonreciprocal optical devices, and further, to enable novel topological phases for both light and sound on a microchip.

abstract: Photoelectron spectra obtained from the ab initio solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation can be in striking disagreement with predictions by the strong-field approximation (SFA) not only at low energy but also around twice the ponderomotive energy where the transition from the direct to the rescattered electrons is expected. In fact, the relative enhancement of the ionization probability compared to the SFA in this regime can be several orders of magnitude. We show for which laser and target parameters such an enhancement occurs and for which the SFA prediction is reasonably good. The enhancement is analyzed in terms of the Coulomb-corrected action along analytic quantum orbits in the complex-time plane, taking branch cuts due to soft-recollisions properly into account.

abstract: Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold atom systems can aid in the study of novel synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena. Despite great advances, alkali atom SOC systems are hindered by heating from spontaneous emission, which limits the observation of many-body effects. Here we demonstrate the use of optical lattice clocks (OLCs) to engineer and study SOC with metrological precision and negligible heating. We show that clock spectroscopy of the ultra-narrow transition in fermionic 87Sr represents a momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probe of the SOC band structure and eigenstates, providing direct access to the SOC dynamics and control over lattice band populations, internal electronic states, and quasimomenta. We utilize these capabilities to study Bloch oscillations, spin-momentum locking, and van Hove singularities in the transition density of states. Our results lay the groundwork for the use of OLCs to probe novel SOC phases including magnetic crystals, helical liquids, and topological superfluids.
