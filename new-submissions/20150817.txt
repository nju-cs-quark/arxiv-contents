abstract: In quantum communication protocols the existence of a shared reference frame between two spatially separated parties is normally presumed. However, in many practical situations we are faced with the problem of misaligned reference frames. In this paper, we study communication between two inertial observers who have partial knowledge about the Lorentz transformation that relates their frames of reference. Since every Lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analysing the effects on communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation relating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or pure boost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an arbitrary Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, we show how the results of previous studies where reference frames are completely uncorrelated are recovered from our results in appropriate limits.

abstract: Frequency conversion is an enabling process in many quantum information protocols. In this letter we study fundamental limits to high efficiency frequency conversion imposed by time ordering corrections. Using the Magnus expansion, we argue that these corrections, which are usually considered detrimental, can be used to increase the efficiency of conversion under certain circumstances. The corrections induce a nonlinear behaviour in the probability of upconversion as a function of the pump intensity, significantly modifying the sinusoidal Rabi oscillations that are otherwise expected. Finally, by using a simple scaling argument, we explain why cascaded frequency conversion devices attenuate time ordering corrections, allowing the construction of near ideal quantum pulse gates.

abstract: Precision control over hybrid physical systems at the quantum level is important for the realization of many quantum-based technologies. For trapped-ions, a hybrid system formed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be exploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Here, we demonstrate an entangling gate between two atomic ions of different elements that can serve as an important building block of quantum information processing (QIP), quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum simulation. An entangling geometric phase gate between a $^9$Be$^+$ ion and a $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction generated by state-dependent forces. Combined with single-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element entangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for universal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and a SWAP gate. We also perform a CHSH-type Bell-inequality test on Bell states composed of different ion species.

abstract: It is a fundamental challenge in quantum optics to deterministically generate indistinguishable single photons through non-deterministic nonlinear optical processes, due to the intrinsic coupling of single- and multi-photon generation probabilities in these processes. Actively multiplexing photons generated in many temporal modes can decouple these probabilities, but key issues are to minimize resource requirements to allow scalability, and to ensure indistinguishability of the generated photons. We demonstrate the multiplexing of photons from four temporal modes solely using fiber-integrated optics and off-the-shelf electronic circuits. We show a 100% enhancement to the single photon output probability without introducing additional multi-photon noise. Photon indistinguishability is confirmed by a four-fold Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference with a 91% visibility. Our demonstration paves the way for scalable multiplexing of many non-deterministic photon sources to a single near-deterministic source, which will be of benefit to future quantum photonic technologies.

abstract: The effects of electric field polarizations on pair production from a vacuum are investigated numerically by employing the real-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. For few-cycle fields, it is found that the interference pattern in momentum spectra is absent and the circular distortion of momentum distribution becomes more apparent with the increase of polarization. For multi-cycle fields, it is found that the interference effects in momentum spectra are obvious. And as the polarization increases, the momentum distribution is split into two parts in the momentum $q_y$ direction first and then two separated parts are connected into a ring. The effects of polarizations on the number density of created particles exhibits two different characteristics. For a small laser frequency, the particle number density deceases with the polarization, while for a large laser frequency, the relation between them is sensitive to the field frequency nonlinearly. Some interpretations for the obtained results in this study, which is expected to be valuable to deepen the understanding of pair production in complex fields and also helpful for the study associated to strong-field ionization.

abstract: We investigate collisions of polar molecules in quasi-2D traps in the presence of an external electric field perpendicular to the collision plane. We use the quantum-defect model characterized by two dimensionless parameters: $y$ and $s$. The first of them is related to the probability of the reaction at short distances, whereas the latter one defines the wave function phase at short distances. For $y$ close to unity we obtain universal collision rates determined by the quantum reflection process from the long-range part of the interaction potential that depends only on the van der Waals coefficient, dipole-dipole interaction and the trap frequency. For small short-range reaction probabilities collision rates are highly nonuniversal and trap induced shape resonances are visible. For high dipole moments we observe the damping of reactive collisions, which can stabilize the ultracold gas of polar molecules. The calculations were performed with help of multichannel wave funcion propagation by imposing short-range boundary condition derived from the quantum-defect model.

abstract: The richness of quantum theory's reversible dynamics is one of its unique operational characteristics, with recent results suggesting deep links between the theory's reversible dynamics, its local state space and the degree of non-locality it permits. We explore the delicate interplay between these features, demonstrating that reversibility places strong constraints on both the local and global state space. Firstly, we show that reversible dynamics are trivial (composed of local transformations and permutations of subsytems) in maximally non-local theories whose local state spaces satisfy a dichotomy criterion; this applies to a range of operational models that have previously been studied, such as d-dimensional "hyperballs" and almost all regular polytope systems. By separately deriving a similar result for odd-sided polygons, we show that classical systems are the only regular polytope state spaces whose maximally non-local composites allow for non-trivial reversible dynamics. Secondly, we show that non-trivial reversible dynamics do exist in maximally non-local theories whose state spaces are reducible into two or more smaller spaces. We conjecture that this is a necessary condition for the existence of such dynamics, but that reversible entanglement generation remains impossible even in this scenario.

abstract: Polarization quasiprobability distribution defined in the Stokes space shares many important properties with the Wigner function for the position and momentum. Most notably, they both give correct one-dimensional marginal probability distributions and therefore represent the natural choice for the probability distributions in classical hidden-variable models. In this context, negativity of the Wigner function is considered as a proof of non-classicality for a quantum state. On the contrary, the polarization quasiprobability distribution demonstrates negativity for all quantum states. This feature comes from the discrete nature of the Stokes variables; however, it was not observed in previous experiments, because they were performed with photon-number averaging detectors. Here we reconstruct the polarization quasiprobability distribution of a coherent state with photon-number resolving detectors, which allows us to directly observe for the first time its negativity.

abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which is immune to all detector side-channel attacks, is the most promising solution to the security issues in practical quantum key distribution systems. Though several experimental demonstrations of MDI QKD have been reported, they all make one crucial but not yet verified assumption, that is there are no flaws in state preparation. Such an assumption is unrealistic and security loopholes remain in the source. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first MDI-QKD experiment with state preparation flaws taken into consideration. By applying a novel security proof by Tamaki \textit{et al} (Phys. Rev. A 90, 052314 (2014)), we distribute secure keys over fiber links up to 40 km with imperfect sources, which would not have been possible under previous security proofs. By closing loopholes in both the sources and the detectors, our work shows the feasibility of secure QKD with practical imperfect devices.

abstract: We establish a sufficient and tight condition for bipartite entanglement in an arbitrary system of qubits, namely $p_s > (1-m^2)/2$ where $p_s$ is the singlet fraction and $m$ is the magnetization of the state, by deriving an explicit expression for the lower bound of its concurrence as well as through geometric arguments. This entanglement witness can be used to investigate the possible existence of pairwise quantum spin correlations in partially polarized ensembles of ultracold atoms.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel mean-field model for polariton condensates with velocity dependence of the effective polariton mass due the photon and exciton components. The effective mass depends on the in-plane wave vector k, which at the inflection point of the lower polariton energy branch becomes infinite and above negative. The polariton condensate modes of the new mean-field theory are now sensitive to mass variations and for certain points of the energy dispersion the polariton condensate mode represents fractional quantum mechanics. The impact of the generalized kinetic energy term is elucidated by numerical studies in 1D and 2D showing significant differences for large velocities. Analytical expressions for plane wave solutions as well as a linear waves analysis show the significance of this new model.

abstract: We present simple lattice realizations of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with $q$-form global symmetries where charged excitations have $q$ spatial dimensions. Specifically, we construct $d$ space-dimensional models supported on a $(d+1)$-colorable graph by using a family of unitary phase gates, known as multi-qubit control-$Z$ gates in quantum information community. In our construction, charged excitations of different dimensionality may coexist and form a short-range entangled state which is protected by symmetry operators of different dimensionality. Non-triviality of proposed models, in a sense of quantum circuit complexity, is confirmed by studying protected boundary modes, gauged models and corresponding gapped domain walls. We also comment on applications of our construction to quantum error-correcting codes, and discuss corresponding fault-tolerant logical gates.

abstract: Correlations exhibited by neutrino oscillations are studied via quantum information theoretic quantities. We show that the strongest type of entanglement, genuine multipartite entanglement, is persistent in the flavour changing states. We prove the existence of Bell-type nonlocal features, in both its absolute and genuine avatars. Finally, we show that a measure of nonclassicality, dissension, which is a generalization of quantum discord to the tripartite case, is nonzero for almost the entire range of time in the evolution of an initial electron-neutrino. Via these quantum information theoretic quantities capturing different aspects of quantum correlations, we elucidate the differences between the flavour types, shedding light on the quantum-information theoretic aspects of the weak force.
