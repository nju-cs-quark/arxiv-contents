abstract: In the same manner that free-space propagation and curved glass lenses are used to shape the spatial properties of light, a combination of chromatic dispersion and devices known as time lenses may be used to reshape its temporal properties. These techniques have found extensive application in classical optical signal processing based on nonlinear optics. A new set of challenges presents itself when processing quantum signals, including noise suppression and high fidelity requirements. In this work, we construct a single-photon time lens based on dispersion and nonlinear sum-frequency generation to image the spectral waveform of half of an entangled photon pair. We find that the joint spectrum of the photon pair has strongly negative frequency correlations before the time lens and strongly positive correlations afterwards, verifying that the process has an overall negative spectro-temporal magnification. The temporal imaging of energy-time entangled systems opens up a host of new possible techniques for distinctly quantum tasks in the frequency domain, including state engineering, and our results demonstrate that the upconversion time lens is an essential part of the single-photon waveform manipulation toolkit.

abstract: With the aid of an improved short-range approximation, the bound state energies and the scattering phase shifts for a Hulth\'en- type potential plus Yukawa potential are calculated within the framework of Nikiforov-Uvarov and standard methods, respectively. Our numerical calculations show that the presence of Yukawa potential has a significant influence on bound state energies and the wave number-dependent phase shifts for any arbitrary values of the screening parameter {\alpha} and angular momentum l.

abstract: We study the generation of entanglement induced by a single-photon Gaussian wavepacket in multi-atom bi-directional waveguide QED. In particular, we investigate the effect of increasing the number of atoms on the average pairwise entanglement. We demonstrate by selecting smaller decay rates and in chiral waveguide settings, that both entanglement survival times and maximum generated entanglement can be increased by at least a factor of 3/2, independent of the number of atoms. In addition, we analyze the influence of detuning and delays on the robustness of the generated entanglement. There are potential applications of our results in entanglement based multi-qubit quantum networks

abstract: We study entanglement generation and control in bi-directional waveguide QED driven by a two photon Gaussian wavepacket. In particular, we focus on how increasing the number of qubits affects the overall average pairwise entanglement in the system. We also investigate how the presence of a second photon can introduce non-linearities, thereby manipulating the generated entanglement. In addition, we show that through the introduction of chirality and small decay rates, entanglement can be stored and enhanced up to factors of 2 and 3, respectively. Finally, we analyze the influence of finite detunnings and time-delays on the generated entanglement.

abstract: We have created a quantum three-level ladder system with the cavity dispersive energy level in a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics system consisting of a transmon qubit and a cavity, and have directly observed the Autler-Townes splitting eff?ect instead of representing it by the probability of the qubit being at each level. A coupler tone is applied on the transition between the second excited state of transmon and cavity dispersive level, while the cavity spectrum is probed. A doublet transmission and anormalous dispersion spectrum of the cavity level is clearly shown. The inverse Fourier transform of cavity spectrum indicates that there is a quantum coherence Rabi oscillation of the populations between cavity and qubit.

We prove that, under the conditions required to derive a master equation, this system evolves according to a bipartite XY spin model with local and collective dissipation terms. We prove that this model has a large number of exact and approximate dark states, whose structure and decay rates can be estimated analytically. We also show that this system can be used for the adiabatic preparation of boson sampling states.

abstract: Digital signatures guarantee the authorship of electronic communications. Currently used "classical" signature schemes rely on unproven computational assumptions for security, while quantum signatures rely only on the laws of quantum mechanics. Previous quantum signature schemes have used unambiguous quantum measurements. Such measurements, however, sometimes give no result, reducing the efficiency of the protocol. Here, we instead use heterodyne detection, which always gives a result, although there is always some uncertainty. We experimentally demonstrate feasibility in a real environment by distributing signature states through a noisy 1.6km free-space channel. Our results show that continuous-variable heterodyne detection improves the signature rate for this type of scheme and therefore represents an interesting direction in the search for practical quantum signature schemes.

abstract: A Langevin canonical framework for a chiral two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators is used within a coupling scheme different from the well-known spin-boson model. From this stochastic dynamics, within the Markovian regime and Ohmic friction, some standard quantum thermodynamics functions such as the energy average and heat capacity can be extracted. In particular, special emphasis is put on the so-called quantum stochastic resonance which is a cooperative effect of friction, noise and periodic driving occurring in a bistable system.

abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of open quantum spin-$1/2$ or hardcore boson systems on a spatial lattice, which are governed by a Markovian quantum master equation. We derive general conditions under which the hierarchy of correlation functions closes such that their time evolution can be computed semi-analytically. Expanding our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 93, 021602 (2016)] we demonstrate the universality of a purely dissipative quantum Markov process that drives the system of spin-$1/2$ particles into a totally symmetric superposition state, corresponding to a Bose-Einstein condensate of hardcore bosons. In particular, we show that the finite-size scaling behavior of the dissipative gap is independent of the chosen boundary conditions and the underlying lattice structure. In addition, we consider the effect of a uniform magnetic field as well as a coupling to a thermal bath to investigate the susceptibility of the engineered dissipative process to unitary and nonunitary perturbations. We establish the nonequilibrium steady-state phase diagram as a function of temperature and dissipative coupling strength. For a small number of particles $N$, we identify a parameter region in which the engineered symmetrizing dissipative process performs robustly, while in the thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, the coupling to the thermal bath destroys any long-range order.

abstract: We study a system of three photons in an atomic medium coupled to Rydberg states near the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency. Based on the analytical analysis of the microscopic set of equations in the far-detuned regime, the effective three-body interaction for these Rydberg polaritons is derived. For slow light polaritons, we find a strong three-body repulsion with the remarkable property that three polaritons can become essentially non-interacting at short distances. This analysis allows us to derive the influence of the three-body repulsion on bound states and correlation functions of photons propagating through a one-dimensional atomic cloud.

abstract: The amount of heat generated by computers is rapidly becoming one of the main problems for developing new generations of information technology. The thermodynamics of computation sets the ultimate physical bounds on heat generation. A lower bound is set by the Landauer Limit, at which computation becomes thermodynamically reversible. For classical computation there is no physical principle which prevents this limit being reached, and approaches to it are already being experimentally tested. In this paper we show that for quantum computation there is an unavoidable excess heat generation that renders it inherently thermodynamically irreversible. The Landauer Limit cannot, in general, be reached by quantum computers. We show the existence of a lower bound to the heat generated by quantum computing that exceeds that given by the Landauer Limit, give the special conditions where this excess cost may be avoided, and show how classical computing falls within these special conditions.

abstract: A new type of complex Hadamard matrices of order 9 are constructed. The studied matrices are symmetric, block circulant with circulant blocks ($BCCB$) and form an until now unknown non-reducible and non-affine two-parameter orbit. Several suborbits are identified, including a one-parameter intersection with the Fourier orbit $F_{9}^{(4)}$. The defect of this new type of Hadamard matrices is observed to vary, from a generic value 2 to the anomalous values 4 and 10 for some sub-orbits, and to 12 and 16 for some single matrices. The latter matrices are shown to be related to complete sets of MUBs in dimension 9.

abstract: Fully characterizing the steerability of a quantum state of a bipartite system has remained an open problem since the concept of steerability was defined. In this work, using our recent geometrical approach to steerability, we suggest a necessary and sufficient condition for a two-qubit state to be steerable with respect to projective measurements. To this end, we define the critical radius of local models and show that a state of two qubits is steerable with respect to projective measurements from Alice's side if and only if her critical radius of local models is less than $1$. As an example, we calculate the critical radius of local models for the so-called T-states by proving the optimality of a recently-suggested ansatz for Alice's local hidden state model.

We use the relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detector model to witness nonclassicality of the probed field state. It turns out that the witness based on the properties of the P-representation of the quantum state depends on the trajectory of the detector. Inertial and noninertial motion of the device have qualitatively different impact on the performance of the witness.

abstract: In this chapter a quantum communication protocol with use of repeaters is presented. The protocol is constructed for qudits i.e. the generalized quantum information units. One-dit teleportation is based on the generalized Pauli-Z (phase-flip) gate's correction. This approach avoids using Pauli-X and Hadamard gates unlike in other known protocols based on quantum repeaters which were constructed for qubits and qudits. It is also important to mention that the repeaters based on teleportation protocol, described in this chapter, allow a measurement in the standard base (what simplifies the measurement process) and the use of teleportation causes only Pauli-Z operational errors.

abstract: A cross-Kerr interaction produces a phase shift on two modes of light proportional to the number of photons in both modes, and is sometimes called cross-phase modulation. Cross-Kerr nonlinearities have many applications in classical and quantum nonlinear optics, including the possibility of a deterministic and all-optical controlled-phase gate. We calculate the one- and two-photon S-matrix for fields propagating in a medium where the cross-Kerr interaction is spatially distributed at discrete interaction sites comprised of atoms. For the interactions considered, we analyze the cases where the photons co-propagate and counter-propagate through the medium and give a physical interpretation to the differences between the two cases.

abstract: We explore the possibility of engineering quantum states of a charged mechanical oscillator by coupling it to a stream of atoms in superpositions of high-lying Rydberg states. Our scheme relies on the driving of a two-phonon resonance within the oscillator by coupling it to an atomic two-photon transition. This approach effectuates a controllable open system dynamics on the oscillator that permits the creation of squeezed and other non-classical states. We show that these features are robust to thermal noise arising from a coupling of the oscillator with the environment. The possibility to create non-trivial quantum states of mechanical systems, provided by the proposed setup, is central to applications such as sensing and metrology and moreover allows the exploration of fundamental questions concerning the boundary between classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of macroscopic objects.

abstract: We apply the principles of quantum mechanics and quantum cosmology to predict probabilities for our local observations of a universe undergoing false vacuum eternal inflation. At a sufficiently fine-grained level, histories of the universe describe a mosaic of bubble universes separated by inflationary regions. We show that predictions for local observations can be obtained directly from sets of much coarser grained histories which only follow a single bubble. These coarse-grained histories contain neither information about our unobservable location nor about the unobservable large-scale structure outside our own bubble. Applied to a landscape of false vacua in the no-boundary state we predict our local universe emerged from the dominant decay channel of the lowest energy false vacuum. We compare and contrast this framework for prediction based on quantum cosmology with traditional approaches to the measure problem in cosmology.

abstract: Chirality of materials in nature appears when there are asymmetries in their lattice structures or interactions in a certain environment. Recent development of quantum simulation technology has enabled the manipulation of qubits. Accordingly, chirality can be realized intentionally rather than passively observed. Here we theoretically provide simple methods to create a chiral spin state in a spin-1/2 qubit system on a square lattice. First, we show that switching ON/OFF the Heisenberg and $XY$ interactions produces the chiral interaction directly in the effective Hamiltonian without controlling local fields. Moreover, when initial states of spin-qubits are appropriately prepared, we prove that the chirality with desirable phase is dynamically obtained. Finally, even for the case where switching ON/OFF the interactions is infeasible and the interactions are always-on, we show that, by preparing an asymmetric initial qubit state, the chirality whose phase is $\pi/2$ is dynamically generated.

abstract: The chirped-pulse interaction in the adiabatic coupling regime induces cyclic permutations of the energy states of a three-level system in the $V$-type configuration, which process is known as the three-level chirped rapid adiabatic passage. Here we show that a spectral hole in a chirped pulse can turn on and off one of the two adiabatic crossing points of this process, reducing the system to an effective two-level system. The given hybrid adiabatic-nonadiabatic transition results in selective excitation of the three-level system, controlled by the laser intensity and spectral position of the hole as well as the sign of the chirp parameter. Experiments are performed with shaped femtosecond laser pulses and the three lowest energy-levels (5S$_{1/2}$, 5P$_{1/2}$, and 5P$_{3/2}$) of atomic rubidium ($^{85}$Rb), of which the result shows good agreement with the theoretically analyzed dynamics. The result indicates that our method, being combined with the ordinary chirped-RAP, implements an adiabatic transitions between the two excited states. Furthermore the laser intensity-dependent control may have applications including selective excitations of atoms or ions arranged in space when being used in conjunction with laser beam profile programming.

abstract: Combining the ability to prepare high-quality, intrinsic Bi$_2$Te$_3$ topological insulator thin films of low carrier density with in-situ protective capping, we demonstrate a pronounced, gate-tunable change in transport properties of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. Using a back-gate, the carrier density is tuned by a factor of $\sim 7$ in Al$_2$O$_3$ capped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ sample and by a factor of $\sim 2$ in Te capped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films. We achieve full depletion of bulk carriers, which allows us to access the topological transport regime dominated by surface state conduction. When the Fermi level is placed in the bulk band gap, we observe the presence of two coherent conduction channels associated with the two decoupled surfaces. Our magnetotransport results show that the combination of capping layers and electrostatic tuning of the Fermi level provide a technological platform to investigate the topological properties of surface states in transport experiments and pave the way towards the implementation of a variety of topological quantum devices.

abstract: We investigate the coherent dynamics of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a system consisting of two bosonic reservoirs coupled via a spatially localized mode. We describe this system by a two-terminal Fano-Anderson model and investigate analytically the time evolution of observables such as the bosonic Josephson current. In doing so, we find that the Josephson current sensitively depends on the on-site energy of the localized mode. This facilitates to use this setup as a transistor for a Bose-Einstein condensate. We identify two regimes. In one regime, the system exhibits well-behaved long-time dynamics with a slowly oscillating and undamped Josephson current. In a second regime, the Josephson current is a superposition of an extremely weakly damped slow oscillation and an undamped fast oscillation. Our results are confirmed by finite-size simulations.

abstract: We study a single-mode cavity weakly coupled to a voltage-biased quantum point contact. In a perturbative analysis, the lowest order predicts a thermal state for the cavity photons, driven by the emission noise of the conductor. The cavity is thus emptied as all transmission probabilities of the quantum point contact approach one or zero. Two-photon processes are identified at higher coupling, and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias voltages. As a result, the number of cavity photons, the cavity damping rate and the second order coherence $g^{(2)}$ are all reduced and exhibit less bunching than the thermal state. These results are obtained with a Keldysh path integral formulation and reproduced with rate equations. They can be seen as a backaction of the cavity measuring the electronic noise. Extending the standard $P(E)$ theory to a steady-state situation, we compute the modified noise properties of the conductor and find quantitative agreement with the perturbative calculation.
