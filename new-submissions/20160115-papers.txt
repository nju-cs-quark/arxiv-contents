abstract: Photon impingement is capable of liberating electrons in electronic devices and driving the electron flux from the lower chemical potential to higher chemical potential. Previous studies hinted that the thermodynamic efficiency of a nano-sized photoelectric converter at maximum power is bounded by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. In this study, we apply quantum effects to design a photoelectric converter based on a three-level quantum dot (QD) interacting with fermionic baths and photons. We show that, by adopting a pair of suitable degenerate states, quantum coherences induced by the couplings of quantum dots (QDs) to sunlight and fermion baths can coexist steadily in nano-electronic systems. Our analysis indicates that the efficiency at maximum power is no more limited to Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency through manipulation of carefully controlled quantum coherences.

abstract: We suggest a simple method to engineer a tight-binding quantum network based on proper coupling to an auxiliary non-Hermitian cluster. In particular, it is shown that effective complex non-Hermitian hopping rates can be realized with only complex on-site energies in the network. Three applications of the Hamiltonian engineering method are presented: the synthesis of a nearly transparent defect in an Hermitian linear lattice; the realization of the Fano-Anderson model with complex coupling; and the synthesis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric tight-binding lattice with a bound state in the continuum.

abstract: We report some nonsmooth dynamics of a Bloch state in a one-dimensional tight binding model. After a sudden change of the potential of some site, quantities like the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically. This phenomenon is a nonperturbative counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics observed previously (Zhang and Haque, arXiv:1404.4280) in the tight binding model. We explain it by exactly solving a truncated and linearized model.

abstract: Symmetry is conventionally described in a contrariety manner that the system is either completely symmetric or completely asymmetric. Using group theoretical approach to overcome this dichotomous problem, we introduce the degree of symmetry (DoS) as a non-negative continuous number ranging from zero to unity. DoS is defined through an average of the fidelity deviations of Hamiltonian or quantum state over its transformation group G, and thus is computable by making use of the completeness relations of the irreducible representations of G. The monotonicity of DoS can effectively probe the extended group for accidental degeneracy while its multi-valued natures characterize some (spontaneous) symmetry breaking.

abstract: The Heun operator has been cast, in terms of the elements of an underlying $su(1,1)$ algebra, under specific parametric conditions, for the purpose of spectrum generation. It is found that, the regular singularities at $0$ and $\infty$ of the general Heun equation, must be elementary under these parametric conditions. The spectrum generation has been demonstrated through a set of examples.

abstract: Although the quality of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates has been steadily improving, the available quantity of qubits has increased quite slowly. To address this important issue in quantum computing, we have demonstrated arbitrary single qubit gates based on targeted phase shifts, an approach that can be applied to atom, ion or other atom-like systems. These gates are highly insensitive to addressing beam imperfections and have little crosstalk, allowing for a dramatic scaling up of qubit number. We have performed gates in series on 48 individually targeted sites in a 40% full $5\times 5\times 5$ 3D array created by an optical lattice. Using randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate an average gate fidelity of 0.9962(16), with an average crosstalk fidelity of 0.9979(2).

abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is a direct test of the quantum superposition principle for massive systems, and of collapse models. This is in contrast to non-interferometric tests, which are currently able to test collapse models more efficiently. However these bounds are in general model-dependent. Here we show that the bounds placed by matter-wave interferometry do not depend significantly on the type of collapse model. We also compute the current bounds, provided by the KDTL 2013 experiment of Arndt's group.

abstract: Strong coupling of molecules to the vacuum field of micro cavities can modify the potential energy surfaces opening new photophysical and photochemical reaction pathways. While the influence of laser fields is usually described in terms of classical field, coupling to the vacuum state of a cavity has to be described in terms of dressed photon-matter states (polaritons) which require quantized fields. We present a derivation of the non-adiabatic couplings for single molecules in the strong coupling regime suitable for the calculation of the dressed state dynamics. The formalism allows to use quantities readily accessible from quantum chemistry codes like the adiabatic potential energy surfaces and dipole moments to carry out wave packet simulations in the dressed basis. The implications for photochemistry are demonstrated for a set of model systems representing typical situations found in molecules.

abstract: We consider the problem of computing, for a detector waiting for a quantum particle to arrive, the probability distribution of the time at which the detector clicks, from the initial wave function of the particle in the non-relativistic regime. Although the standard rules of quantum mechanics offer no operator for the time of arrival, quantum mechanics makes an unambiguous prediction for this distribution, defined by first solving the Schrodinger equation for the big quantum system formed by the particle of interest, the detector, a clock, and a device that records the time when the detector clicks, then making a quantum measurement of the record at a very late time, and finally using the distribution of the recorded time. This leads to question whether there is also a practical, simple rule for computing this distribution, at least approximately (i.e., for an idealized detector). We argue here in favor of a rule based on a 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain (absorbing) boundary condition at the ideal detecting surface, first considered by Werner in 1987. We present a novel derivation of this rule and describe how it arises as a limit of a "soft" detector represented by an imaginary potential.

abstract: We quantify and analyze the controller's power in controlled remote state preparation schemes. Our analysis provides a lower bound on the control power required for controlled remote preparation of arbitrary D-dimensional states. We evaluate several existing controlled remote state preparation protocols and show that some proposed non-maximally entangled channels are not suitable for perfect controlled remote preparation of arbitrary quantum states from the con- troller's point of view. We find that for remotely preparing D-dimensional states, the entropy of each controller should be no less than log_2 D bits. Our criteria are not only useful for evaluating controlled remote state preparation schemes but can also be used for other controlled quantum communication schemes.

abstract: Macroscopic realism is the name for a class of modifications to quantum theory that allow macroscopic objects to be described in a measurement-independent fashion, while largely preserving a fully quantum mechanical description of the microscopic world. Objective collapse theories are examples which attempt to provide a physical mechanism for wavefunction collapse, and thereby aim to solve the quantum measurement problem. Here we describe and implement an experimental protocol capable of constraining theories of this class, and show how it is related to the original Leggett-Garg test, yet more noise tolerant and conceptually transparent. By conducting a set of simple 'prepare, shuffle, measure' tests in a superconducting flux qubit, we rule out (by over 77 standard deviations) those theories which would deny coherent superpositions of 170 nA currents over a 9 ns timescale. Further, we address the 'clumsiness loophole' by determining classical disturbance in a set of control experiments.

abstract: Fundamental forces of Nature are described by field theories, also known as gauge theories, based on a local gauge invariance. The simplest of them is quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is an example of an Abelian gauge theory. Such theories describe the dynamics of massless photons and their coupling to matter. However, in two spatial dimension (2D) they are known to exhibit gapped phases at low temperature. In the realm of quantum spin systems, it remains a subject of considerable debate if their low energy physics can be described by emergent gauge degrees of freedom. Here we present a class of simple two-dimensional models that admit a low energy description in terms of an Abelian gauge theory. We find rich phase diagrams for these models comprising exotic deconfined phases and gapless phases - a rare example for 2D Abelian gauge theories. The counter-intuitive presence of gapless phases in 2D results from the emergence of additional symmetry in the models. Moreover, we propose schemes to realize our model with current experiments using ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: Average block entanglement in the 1D XX-model with uncorrelated random couplings is known to grow as the logarithm of the block size, in similarity to conformal systems. In this work we study random spin chains whose couplings present long range correlations, generated as gaussian fields with a power-law spectral function. Ground states are always planar valence bond states, and their statistical ensembles are characterized in terms of their block entropy and their bond-length distribution, which follow power-laws. We conjecture the existence of a critical value for the spectral exponent, below which the system behavior is identical to the case of uncorrelated couplings. Above that critical value, the entanglement entropy violates the area law and grows as a power law of the block size, with an exponent which increases from zero to one. Similar planar bond structures are also found in statistical models of RNA folding and kinetic roughening, and we trace an analogy between them and quantum valence bond states. Using an inverse renormalization procedure we determine the optimal spin-chain couplings which give rise to a given planar bond structure, and study the statistical properties of the couplings whose bond structures mimic those found in RNA folding.

abstract: We study the protection of subradiant states by the symmetry of the atomic distributions in the Dicke limit, in which collective Lamb shift cannot be neglected. We find that anti-symmetric states are subradiant states for distribution with reflection symmetry. These states can be prepared by anti-symmetric optical modes and converted to superradiant states by properly tailored 2\pipulses. Continuous symmetry can also be used to achieve subradiance. This study is relevant to the problem of robust quantum memory with long storage time and fast readout.

abstract: 852nm nano-second laser pulse chain with a high on/off ratio is generated via chopping a continuous-wave laser beam by using of a Mach-Zehnder-type electro-optic intensity modulator (MZ-EOIM). Detailed analysis and dependence of the on/off ratio on the splitting ratio, the co-splitting ratio, and the arms loss of MZ-EIOM are presented. By optimizing the polarization of incident laser beam and stabilizing MZ-EOIM temperature, the static on/off ratio of 12600:1 is achieved. Also the dynamic on/off ratios versus the pulse repetition rate and the pulse duty cycle are measured and discussed. This high on/off ratio ns pulsed laser system has served as the excitation pulse source for a triggered single-photon source based on trapped single cesium atom, which reveals a representative anti-bunching.

abstract: On the basis of general theoretical results developed previously in [JETP 112, 246 (2011)], we analyze the reflection of quasiresonant light from a plane surface of dense and disordered ensemble of motionless point scatters. Angle distribution of the scattered light is calculated both for s and p polarizations of the probe radiation. The ratio between coherent and incoherent (diffuse) components of scattered light is calculated. We analyze the contributions of scatters located at different distances from the surface and determine on this background the thickness of surface layer responsible for reflected beam generation. The inhomogeneity of dipole-dipole interaction near the surface is discussed.We study also dependence of total reflected light power on the incidence angle and compare the results of the microscopic approach with predictions of the Fresnel reflection theory. The calculations are performed for different densities of scatters and different frequencies of a probe radiation.

abstract: We investigate the quantum entanglement of systems of coupled harmonic oscillators on the basis of thermo-field dynamics (TFD). For coupled harmonic oscillators at equilibrium, the extended entanglement entropy is derived using the TFD method, and it is demonstrated to be controlled by temperature and coupling parameters. For non-equilibrium systems, in addition to temperature and coupling parameters, the time dependence of the extended entanglement entropy is calculated in accordance with the dissipative von Neumann equation, and the dissipative dynamics of the systems of coupled harmonic oscillators is discussed. Consequently, based on TFD, the physical parametrization of the entanglement entropies is confirmed in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases of harmonic oscillator systems by means of the laws of thermodynamics.

abstract: The energy-spectrum of two point-like particles interacting in a 3-D isotropic Harmonic Oscillator (H.O.) trap is related to the free scattering phase-shifts $\delta$ of the particles by a formula first published by Busch et al. It is here used to find an expression for the \it shift \rm of the energy levels, caused by the interaction, rather than the perturbed spectrum itself. In the limit of high energy (large quantum number $n$ of the H.O.) this shift is shown to be given by $-2\frac{\delta}{\pi}$, also valid in the limit of infinite as well as zero scattering length at all H.O. energies. Numerical investigation shows that the shifts differ from the exact result of Busch et al, by less than $<\frac{1}{2}\%$ except for $n=0$ when it can be as large as $\approx 2.5\%$. This approximation for the energy-shift is well known from another exactly solvable model, namely that of two particles interacting in a spherical infinite square-well trap (or box) of radius $R$ in the limit $R\rightarrow \infty$, and/or in the limit of large energy. It is in this context referred to as the \it phase-shift approximation \rm. It can be (and has been) used in (infinite) nuclear matter calculations to calculate the two-body effective interaction in situations where in-medium effects can be neglected. It has also been used in expressing the energy of free electrons in a metal.
