title: Quantum measurements need not conserve energy: relation to the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem

abstract: The paper focuses on the fact that quantum projective measurements do not necessarily conserve energy. On the other hand the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem states that assuming a "standard" von Neumann measurement model and "additivity" of the total energy operator, projective measurements of a system must conserve energy as defined by the system's energy operator. This paper explores the ideas behind the WAY theorem in hopes of uncovering the origin of the contradiction. After Araki and Yanase published their proof of the WAY theorem, Yanase appended a new condition now known as the Yanase condition. Under the simplifying assumption that the observable being measured has discrete and non-degenerate eigenvalues, we prove that the Yanase condition actually follows from the hypotheses of the original WAY theorem. The paper also proves that the hypotheses of the WAY theorem, together with the simplifying assumption, imply that the energy operator for the measuring apparatus must be a multiple of the identity, which seems physically unlikely. It seems probable that this surprising conclusion, along with the Yanase condition, also holds without the simplifying assumption.

abstract: The Transactional Interpretation has been subject at various times to a challenge based on a type of thought experiment first proposed by Maudlin. It has been argued by several authors that such experiments do not in fact constitute a significant problem for the transactional picture. The purpose of this work is to point out that, when the relativistic level of the interpretation is considered, Maudlin-type challenges cannot even be mounted, since the putative 'slow-moving offer wave,' taken as subject to contingent confirmation, does not exist. This is a consequence of the Davies relativistic quantum-mechanical version of the direct-action theory together with the asymmetry between fermionic field sources and bosonic fields. The Maudlin challenge therefore evaporates completely when the relativistic level of the theory is taken into account.

abstract: A change in the character of maser generation in a two-level system is found when the initial population inversion exceeds some threshold value proportional to the square root of the total number of atoms. Above this threshold, the number of photons begins to grow exponentially with time and the pulse with short leading edge and broadened trailing edge is generated. In this work, we attempt to explain the nature of this threshold. Coherent pulse duration estimated by its half-width increases significantly with increasing inversion, if all other parameters are fixed and the absorption is neglected. The inclusion of the energy loss of photons leads to the fact that the duration of coherent pulse is almost constant with increasing inversion, at least well away from the threshold. If there is exist a recovery mechanism for the population inversion, the pulsating mode of stimulated emission generation becomes possible. The integral radiation intensity at this may be increased several times. This approach can be used for analysis of the cosmic radiation that might help explain a great variety of pulsating radiation sources in space.

abstract: The are several non-equivalent notions of Markovian quantum evolution. In this paper we show that the one based on the so-called CP-divisibility of the corresponding dynamical map enjoys the following stability property: the dynamical map $\Lambda_t$ is CP-divisible iff the second tensor power $\Lambda_t\otimes\Lambda_t$ is CP-divisible as well. Moreover, the P-divisibility of the map $\Lambda_t\otimes\Lambda_t$ is equivalent to the CP-divisibility of the map $\Lambda_t$. Interestingly, the latter property is no longer true if we replace the P-divisibility of $\Lambda_t\otimes\Lambda_t$ by simple positivity and the CP-divisibility of $\Lambda_t$ by complete positivity. That is, unlike when $\Lambda_t$ has a time-independent generator, positivity of $\Lambda_t\otimes\Lambda_t$ does not imply complete positivity of $\Lambda_t$.

abstract: We investigate interference and correlation effects when several detuned emitters are placed along a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. Such a setup allows multiple interactions between the photons and the strongly coupled emitters, and underlies proposed devices for quantum information processing. We show, first, that a pair of distant, detuned two-level systems (2LS) coupled to a waveguide can mimic a driven three-level system (3LS) in both the single- and two- photon sectors. There is an interference-induced transparency peak; however, the fluorescence is quenched, leaving the transmitted photons completely uncorrelated. We then place a true 3LS midway between the two 2LS. For this structure, we show that elastic scattering produces only transmission, but inelastic scattering occurs (the fluorescence is not quenched) and causes substantial correlations.

The conditional concurrence of the qubits for each fixed number of created photons in a nonstationary cavity is obtained as a measure of the dynamical quantum entanglement due to the dynamical Lamb effect. We discuss the physical realization of the dynamical Lamb effect, based on superconducting qubits.

abstract: In 2011, Aaronson gave a striking proof, based on quantum linear optics, showing that the problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard. Aaronson's proof led naturally to hardness of approximation results for the permanent, and it was arguably simpler than Valiant's seminal proof of the same fact in 1979. Nevertheless, it did not prove that computing the permanent was #P-hard for any class of matrices which was not previously known. In this paper, we present a collection of new results about matrix permanents that are derived primarily via these linear optical techniques. First, we show that the problem of computing the permanent of a real orthogonal matrix is #P-hard. Much like Aaronson's original proof, this will show that even a multiplicative approximation remains #P-hard to compute. The hardness result even translates to permanents over finite fields, where the problem of computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is ModpP-hard in the finite field F_{p^4} for all primes p not equal to 2 or 3. Interestingly, this characterization is tight: in fields of characteristic 2, the permanent coincides with the determinant; in fields of characteristic 3, one can efficiently compute the permanent of an orthogonal matrix by a nontrivial result of Kogan. Finally, we use more elementary arguments to prove #P-hardness for the permanent of a positive semidefinite matrix, which shows that certain probabilities of boson sampling experiments with thermal states are hard to compute exactly despite the fact that they can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer.

abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem ensures that a slowly changing system, initially prepared in its ground state, will evolve to its final ground state with arbitrary precision. As a first result this thesis extends the original theorem to projection operators keeping the statement valid for Hamiltonians with degenerate ground spaces. Yet the main focus of this work lies in studying the efficiency of quantum circuit simulations by adabatic quantum computation. The standard Hamiltonian construction by Kitaev is based on a path graph reflecting the $L$ computation steps and influencing the scaling of the necessary evolution time by its spectral gap of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{L^2}\right)$. Aspiring to an improved running time we generalize Kitaev's Hamiltonian to so-called standard graph Hamiltonians based on graph families with a different spectral gap. In this generalized construction the first two time derivatives of the Hamiltonian and the fraction of initial vertices appear as additional parameters of running time. In a first step the time derivatives can be proven to be constant. Expansion results from spectral graph theory however impose a trade-off between the spectral gap and the fraction of initial vertices as well as the fraction of final vertices which corresponds to the probability for obtaining the correct computational output. Graphs with spectral gap $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{L^k}\right)$, $k<2$, turn out to contradict very likely, graphs with $k<1$ even for sure at least one of the efficiency criterias for running time, output probability or Hamiltonian implementation. The above results may also be obstacles for a possible quantum PCP-theorem in complexity theory claiming the local Hamiltonian problem with constant gap to be QMA-complete since the very same Kitaev Hamiltonian is constructed in the QMA-hardness proof for the Local Hamiltonian problem.

abstract: We present a scheme to prepare $n$-party-$k$-excitation Dicke states, $|D^{(k)}_n\rangle$, from a tunable source of entangled pairs. The process has the following distinctive features: (i) it relies on controlled {\it loss} of information and {\it unentangled} measurements; (ii) irrespective of the source entanglement, whenever a Dicke state is produced, it is perfect; (iii) given a fixed number of excitations $\ell$, the optimal entanglement of the source to create $|D^{(\ell)}_n\rangle$ undergoes a second-order-like transition as $n$ surpasses a critical value $n_c$. For $n<n_c$ the optimal success rate presents a steep decay, while for $n>n_c$ it falls-off as a power law. These properties makes it possible to make statements on the entanglement of $|D^{(k)}_n\rangle$, e.g., $E(|D^{(n/2)}_{n}\rangle)<\sqrt{\pi/2}\,n^{3/2}$ ebits as $n \rightarrow \infty$, where $E$ is an additive, otherwise {\it arbitrary} multipartite entanglement measure.

abstract: In quantum theory it is possible to explain time, and dynamics, in terms of entanglement. This is the timeless approach to time, which assumes that the universe is in a stationary state, where two non-interacting subsystems, the clock and the rest, are entangled. As a consequence, by choosing a suitable observable of the clock, the relative state of the rest of the universe evolves unitarily with respect to the variable labelling the clock observable's eigenstates, which is then interpreted as time. This model for an evolution without evolution (Page and Wootters, 1983), albeit elegant, has never been developed further, because it was criticised for generating severe ambiguities in the dynamics of the rest of the universe. In this paper we show that there are no such ambiguities, we also update the model, making it amenable to possible new applications.

abstract: We propose a method to manipulate the normal modes in a chain of trapped ions using only two lasers. Linear chains of trapped ions have proven experimentally to be highly controllable quantum systems with a variety of refined techniques for preparation, evolution, and readout, however, typically for quantum information processing applications people have been interested in using the internal levels of the ions as the computational basis. We analyse the case where the motional degrees of freedom of the ions is the quantum system of interest, and where the internal levels are leveraged to facilitate interactions. In particular, we focus on an analysis of mode-mixing of phonons in different normal modes to mimic the quantum optical equivalent of a beam splitter.

abstract: We present our approach for sharing photons and assessing resultant four-photon visibility between two distant parties using concatenated entanglement swapping. In addition we determine the corresponding key generation rate and the quantum bit-error rate. Our model is based on practical limitations of resources, including multipair parametric down-conversion sources, inefficient detectors with dark counts and lossy channels. Through this approach, we have found that a trade-off is needed between experimental run-time, pair-production rate and detector efficiency. Concatenated entanglement swapping enables huge distances for quantum key-distribution but at the expense of low key generation rate.

abstract: The standard postulates of quantum theory can be divided into two groups: the first one characterizes the structure and dynamics of pure states, while the second one specifies the structure of measurements and the corresponding probabilities. In this work we show that, if we keep the first group of postulates, all the alternatives to the second group are in correspondence with a class of representations of the unitary group. Some features of these alternative probabilistic theories are identical to quantum theory, but there are important differences in others. For example, some theories have three perfectly distinguishable states in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Others have exotic properties such as lack of "bit symmetry", the violation of "no simultaneous encoding" (a property similar to information causality) and the existence of maximal measurements without phase groups. We also show that pure-state bit symmetry and no restriction of effects single out the Born rule in finite dimensions.

abstract: The interplay of noise and quantum coherence in transport gives rise to rich dynamics relevant for a variety of systems. In this work, we put forward a proposal for an experiment testing noise-induced transport in the vibrational modes of a chain of trapped ions. We focus on the case of transverse modes, considering multiple-isotope chains and an "angle trap", where the transverse trapping varies along the chain. This variation induces localization of the motional modes and therefore suppresses transport. By suitably choosing the action of laser fields that couple to the internal and external degrees of freedom of the ions, we show how to implement effective local dephasing on the modes, broadening the vibrational resonances. This leads to an overlap of the local mode frequencies, giving rise to a pronounced increase in the transport of excitations along the chain. We propose an implementation and measurement scheme which require neither ground-state cooling nor low heating rates, and we illustrate our results with a simulation of the dynamics for a chain of three ions.

Here the Schmidt rank is defined over the bipartite space $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$. We also present a simple argument for why there is at least one vector unbiased to any two given orthonormal bases in any dimension.

abstract: We study the relationship between quantum chaos and pseudorandomness by developing probes of unitary design. A natural probe of randomness is the "frame potential," which is minimized by unitary $k$-designs and measures the $2$-norm distance between the Haar random unitary ensemble and another ensemble. A natural probe of quantum chaos is out-of-time-order (OTO) four-point correlation functions. We show that the norm squared of a generalization of out-of-time-order $2k$-point correlators is proportional to the $k$th frame potential, providing a quantitative connection between chaos and pseudorandomness. Additionally, we prove that these $2k$-point correlators for Pauli operators completely determine the $k$-fold channel of an ensemble of unitary operators. Finally, we use a counting argument to obtain a lower bound on the quantum circuit complexity in terms of the frame potential. This provides a direct link between chaos, complexity, and randomness.

abstract: We consider the problem of designing a variety of "system guided" basis sets for quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillators. Using ideas based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we design canonical transformations of the usual position and momentum to generate generalized "Cartesian-like positions, W and momenta, p_W" with unit Poisson brackets. These are quantized following Dirac, leading to an infinite family of potential "operator observables". The fundamental issue is that all but one of the operators are not Hermitian (formally self-adjoint) in the original position representation. We show that the resulting operators are "quasi-Hermitian" relative to the x-representation and that all are Hermitian in the W-representation. Depending on how one treats the Jacobian of the canonical transformation in the expression for the classical momentum, p_W, quantization yields a) continuous mutually unbiased bases (MUB) b) orthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) c) biorthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) d) new W-harmonic oscillators yielding standard orthonormal bases (as functions of W) and associated coherent states. The MUB include W-generalized Fourier transform kernels whose eigenvectors are the W-harmonic oscillator eigenstates, with the spectrum (p/m i, p/m i). The W, p_W satisfy the uncertainty product relation: Delta-W * Delta-p_W gte 1/2.

abstract: Characterizing properties of generic quantum systems of only a few tens of constituents can already become very challenging both experimentally and computationally. Here we show how autocorrelation functions in an interacting system of phonons as well as the quantum discord between distinct degrees of freedoms can be measured efficiently. As a benchmark, we show this in chains of up to 42 trapped ions, by tracing a single phonon excitation through interferometric measurements of only a single ion in the chain. We observe the spreading and partial refocusing of the excitation in the chain, even on a background of thermal excitations. We further show how this local observable reflects the dynamical evolution of quantum discord between the electronic state and the vibrational degrees of freedom of the probe ion, and give evidence for the scalability of our protocol.

abstract: We show how two recently developed quantum information theoretic tools can be applied to obtain lower bounds on quantum information complexity. We also develop new tools with potential for broader applicability, and use them to establish a lower bound on the quantum information complexity for the Augmented Index function on an easy distribution. This approach allows us to handle superpositions rather than distributions over inputs, the main technical challenge faced previously. By providing a quantum generalization of the argument of Jain and Nayak [IEEE TIT'14], we leverage this to obtain a lower bound on the space complexity of multi-pass, unidirectional quantum streaming algorithms for the DYCK(2) language.

abstract: We investigate experimentally a cascade of temperature-compensated unequal-path interferometers that can be used to measure frequency states in a high-dimensional quantum distribution system. In particular, we demonstrate that commercially-available interferometers have sufficient environmental isolation so that they maintain an interference visibility greater than 98.5\% at a wavelength of 1550 nm over extended periods with only moderate passive control of the interferometer temperature ($< \pm0.50 ^{\circ}$C). Specifically, we characterize two interferometers that have matched delays: one with a free-spectral range of 2.5 GHz, and the other with 1.25 GHz. We find that the relative path of these interferometers drifts less than 3~nm over a period of one hour during which the temperature fluctuates by $<\pm$0.10 $^{\circ} $C. When we purposely heat the interferometers over a temperature range of 20-50 $^{\circ}$C, we find that the temperature sensitivity is different for each interferometer, likely due to slight manufacturing errors during the temperature compensation procedure. Over this range, we measure a path-length shift of 26 $\pm$ 9 nm/$^{\circ} $C for the 2.5 GHz interferometer. For the 1.25 GHz interferometer, the path-length shift is nonlinear and is locally equal to zero at a temperature of 37.1 $^{\circ}$C and is 50 $\pm$ 17 nm/$^{\circ} $C at 22 $^{\circ}$C. With these devices, we realize a cascade of 1.25 GHz and 2.5 GHz interferometers to measure four-dimensional classical frequency states created by modulating a stable and continuous-wave laser. We observe a visibility $>99\%$ over an hour, which is mainly limited by our ability to precisely generate these states. Overall, our results indicate that these interferometers are well suited for realistic time-frequency quantum distribution protocols.

abstract: There are well-known dark states in the even-qubit Dicke models, which are the products of the two-qubit singlets and a Fock state, where the qubits are decoupled from the photon field. These spin singlets can be used to store quantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation, driving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark states is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling strength. We have obtained a novel kind of dark-like states for the multi-qubit and multi-photon Rabi models, whose eigenenergies are also constant in the whole coupling regime. Unlike the dark states, the qubits and photon field are coupled in the dark-like states. Furthermore, the photon numbers are bounded from above commonly at 1, which is different from that for the one-qubit case. The existence conditions of the dark-like states are simpler than exact isolated solutions, and may be fine tuned in experiments. While the single-qubit and multi-photon Rabi model is well-defined only if the photon number $M\leq2$ and the coupling strength is below a certain critical value, the dark-like eigenstates for multi-qubit and multiphoton Rabi model still exist, regardless of these constraints. In view of these properties of the dark-like states, they may find similar applications like "dark states" in quantum information.

abstract: We report a 65MHz-bandwidth triangular-shaped optical parametric oscillator (OPO) for squeezed vacuum generation at 860nm. The triangle structure of our OPO enables the round-trip length to reach 45mm as a ring cavity, which provides a counter circulating optical path available for introducing a probe beam or generating another squeezed vacuum. Hence our OPO is suitable for the applications in high-speed quantum information processing where two or more squeezed vacua form a complicated interferometer, like continuous-variable quantum teleportation. With a homemade, broadband and low-loss homodyne detector, a direct measurement shows 8.4dB of squeezing at 3MHz and also 2.4dB of squeezing at 100MHz.

abstract: Ghost imaging with thermal fermions is calculated based on two-particle interference in Feynman's path integral theory. It is found that ghost imaging with thermal fermions can be simulated by ghost imaging with thermal bosons and classical particles. Photons in pseudothermal light are employed to experimentally study fermionic ghost imaging. Ghost imaging with thermal bosons and fermions is discussed based on the point-to-point (spot) correlation between the object and image planes. The employed method offers an efficient guidance for future ghost imaging with real thermal fermions, which may also be generalized to study other second-order interference phenomena with fermions.

abstract: Establishing entanglement between distant parties is one of the most important problems of quantum technology, since long-distance entanglement is an essential part of such fundamental tasks as quantum cryptography or quantum teleportation. In this lecture we review basic properties of entanglement and quantum discord, and discuss recent results on entanglement distribution and the role of quantum discord therein. We also review entanglement distribution with separable states, and discuss important problems which still remain open. One such open problem is a possible advantage of indirect entanglement distribution, when compared to direct distribution protocols.

abstract: We investigate the nonlinear scattering dynamics in interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates under non-Hermitian dissipative conditions. We show that by carefully engineering a momentum-dependent atomic loss profile one can achieve matter-wave amplification through four wave mixing in a one-dimensional quasi free-space setup - a process that is forbidden in the counterpart Hermitian systems due to energy mismatch. Additionally, we show that similar effects lead to rich nonlinear dynamics in higher dimensions. Finally, we propose a physical realization for selectively tailoring the momentum-dependent atomic dissipation. Our strategy is based on a two step process: (i) exciting atoms to narrow Rydberg- or metastable excited states, and (ii) introducing loss through recoil; all while leaving the bulk condensate intact due to protection by quantum interference.

abstract: We study the evolution of the hybrid entangled squeezed states of the qubit-oscillator system in the strong coupling domain. Following the adiabatic approximation we obtain the reduced density matrices of the qubit and the oscillator degrees of freedom. The oscillator reduced density matrix is utilized to calculate the quasiprobability distributions such as the Sudarshan-Glauber diagonal P -representation, the Wigner W -distribution, and the nonnegative Husimi Q-function. The negativity associated with the W -distribution acts as a measure of the nonclassicality of the state. The existence of the multiple time scales induced by the interaction introduces certain features in the bipartite system. In the strong coupling regime the transient evolution to low entropy configurations reveals brief emergence of nearly pure kitten states that may be regarded as superposition of uniformly separated distinguishable squeezed coherent states. However, the quantum fluctuations with a short time period engender bifurcation and subsequent rejoining of these peaks in the phase space. The abovementioned doubling of the number of peaks increases the entropy to its near maximal value. Nonetheless, these states characterized by high entropy values, are endowed with a large negativity of the W -distribution that points towards their non-Gaussian behavior. This may be ascertained by the significantly large Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the oscillator state and an ensemble of most general statistical mixture of squeezed Gaussian states possessing nearly identical second order quadrature moments as that of the oscillator.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a task that we call symmetrization, in which a state of a quantum system, associated with a symmetry group, is transformed by a random unitary operation to a symmetric state. Each element of the random unitary ensemble is supposed to be symmetry preserving, in the sense that it maps any symmetric state to another. In an asymptotic limit of infinitely many copies and vanishingly small error, we analyze the symmetrizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required for symmetrization. We derive a single-letter formula for the symmetrizing cost of an arbitrary quantum state, by proving that it is equal to a function called the relative entropy of framenss.

abstract: It is known that if two players achieve a superclassical score at a nonlocal game $G$, then their outputs are certifiably random - that is, regardless of the strategy used by the players, a third party will not be able to perfectly predict their outputs (even if he were given their inputs). We prove that for any complete-support game $G$, there is an explicit nonzero function $F_G$ such that if Alice and Bob achieve a superclassical score of $s$ at $G$, then Bob has a probability of at most $1 - F_G ( s )$ of correctly guessing Alice's output after the game is played. Our result implies that certifying global randomness through such games must necessarily introduce local randomness.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.05153
abstract: We propose a novel type of optomechanical coupling which enables a tripartite interaction between a quantum emitter, an optical mode and a macroscopic mechanical oscillator. The interaction uses a mechanism we term mode field coupling: mechanical displacement modifies the spatial distribution of the optical mode field, which in turn modulates the atom-photon coupling rate. In properly designed multimode optomechanical systems, we can achieve situations in which mode field coupling is the only possible interaction pathway for the system. This enables, for example, swapping of a single excitation between emitter and phonon, creation of nonclassical states of motion and mechanical ground-state cooling in the bad-cavity regime. Importantly, the emitter-phonon coupling rate can be enhanced through an optical drive field, allowing active control of strong atom-phonon coupling for realistic experimental parameters.

abstract: The capability of a given channel to communicate information is, a priori, distinct from its capability to distribute shared randomness. In this article we define randomness distribution capacities of quantum channels assisted by forward, back, or two-way classical communication and compare these to the corresponding communication capacities. With forward assistance or no assistance, we find that they are equal. We establish the mutual information of the channel as an upper bound on the two-way assisted randomness distribution capacity. This implies that all of the capacities are equal for classical-quantum channels. On the other hand, we show that the back-assisted randomness distribution capacity of a quantum-classical channels is equal to its mutual information. This is often strictly greater than the back-assisted communication capacity. We give an explicit example of such a separation where the randomness distribution protocol is noiseless.

abstract: Quantum systems, in general, output data that cannot be simulated efficiently by a classical computer, and hence is useful for solving certain mathematical problems and simulating quantum many-body systems. This also implies, unfortunately, that verification of the output of the quantum systems is not so trivial, since predicting the output is exponentially hard. As another problem, quantum system is very delicate for noise and thus needs error correction. Here we propose a framework for verification of the output of fault-tolerant quantum computation in the measurement-based model. Contrast to existing analyses on fault-tolerance, we do not assume any noise model on the resource state, but an arbitrary resource state is tested by using only single-qubit measurements to verify whether the output of measurement-based quantum computation on it is correct or not. The overhead for verification including classical processing is linear in the size of quantum computation. Since full characterization of quantum noise is exponentially hard for large-scale quantum computing systems, our framework provides an efficient way of practical verification of experimental quantum error correction. Moreover, the proposed verification scheme is also compatible to measurement-only blind quantum computation, where a client can accept the delegated quantum computation even when a quantum sever makes deviation, as long as the output is correct.

abstract: This paper presents a novel index in order to characterize error propagation in quantum circuits by separating the resultant mixed error state in two components: an isotropic component, that quantifies the lack of information, and a dis-alignment component, that represents the shift between the current state and the original pure quantum state. The Isotropic Triangle, a graphical representation that fits naturally with the proposed index, is also introduced. Finally, some examples with the analysis of well-known quantum algorithms degradation are given.

abstract: The characterization of quantum information quantifiers has attracted a considerable attention in the last years, since they are a useful tool to verify the presence of quantum correlations in a quantum system. In this context, in the present work we show a theoretical study of these quantifiers, such as entanglement witness, entanglement of formation, Bell's inequality violation and geometric quantum discord as a function of difractive properties of neutron scattering. We provide one path toward to identify the presence of quantum correlations in a molecular magnet, such as a Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ dimer, by diffractive properties typically obtained via neutron scattering experiments.

abstract: Current methods of characterizing quantum devices focus on diagnosing individual components. While important, this falls short of the primary goal, namely, determining when the total noise in a quantum circuit is sufficiently small, so that the output of a quantum computer is reliable. In this work, we first obtain an optimal bound on the total fidelity of a circuit in terms of the component fidelities, which can be efficiently estimated by randomized benchmarking. This optimal bound grows quadratically in the length of the circuit. We then obtain an improved bound using additional information about the noise, namely, the unitarity, which can also be efficiently estimated. This improved bound smoothly interpolates between the worst-case quadratic and best-case linear scalings. We then show that our analysis substantially improves the bounds on the infidelities of individual gates obtained using interleaved randomized benchmarking.

abstract: We propose a route toward realizing fractionalized topological phases of matter (i.e. with intrinsic topological order) by literally building on un-fractionalized phases. Our approach employs a Kondo lattice model in which a gapped electronic system of non-interacting fermions is coupled to non-interacting local moments via the exchange interaction. Using general entanglement-based arguments and explicit lattice models, we show that in this way gapped spin liquids can be induced in the spin system. We demonstrate the power of this topological bootstrap concept with two examples: (1) a chiral spin liquid induced by a Chern insulator and (2) a Z2 spin liquid induced by a superconductor. In particular, in the latter example, the toric code is realized as an exactly solvable example of topological bootstrap. Our approach can be generalized to all lattices, higher dimensions, and non-abelian topological orders.

abstract: We address Bloch oscillations of a spin-orbit coupled atom in periodic potentials of two types: Optical and Zeeman lattices. We show that in optical lattices the spin-orbit coupling allows controlling the direction of atomic motion and may lead to complete suppression of the oscillations at specific values of the coupling strength. In Zeeman lattices the energy bands are found to cross each other at the boundaries of the Brillouin zone, resulting in period-doubling of the oscillations. In all cases, the oscillations are accompanied by rotation of the pseudo-spin, with a dynamics that is determined by the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. The predicted effects are discussed also in terms of a Wannier-Stark ladder, which in optical lattices consist of two mutually-shifted equidistant sub-ladders.

abstract: Photosynthesis has been the long-standing research interest due to its fundamental importance. Recently, studies on photosynthesis processes also inspire attention from thermodynamical aspect when considering photosynthetic apparatuses as biological quantum heat engines. Quantum coherence is shown to play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of these quantum heat engines. Based on the experimentally reported structure, we propose a quantum heat engine model with a non-Markovian vibrational mode. We show that one can obtain a performance enhancement easily for a wide range of parameters in the presence of the vibrational mode. Our results suggest new insights into the photosynthetic processes and a design principle mimicking natural organisms.

abstract: Frustrated quantum magnetism has moved to the forefront of physics research, posing fundamental questions concerning quantum disordered states, entanglement, topology and the nature of the quantum wavefunction. The defining problem in the field is one of the simplest, the ground state of the nearest-neighbour $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, but has defied all theoretical and numerical methods employed to date. We apply the formalism of tensor-network states (TNS), specifically the method of projected entangled simplex states (PESS), whose combination of a correct accounting for multipartite entanglement and infinite system size provides qualitatively new insight. By studying the ground-state energy, the staggered magnetization we find at all finite tensor bond dimensions and the effects of a second-neighbour coupling, we demonstrate that the ground state is a gapless spin liquid. We discuss the comparison with other numerical studies and the physical interpretation of the gapless ground state.

abstract: We have used high resolution transmission spectroscopy to study the exciton level spectrum in Cu$_2$O subject to a longitudinal external electric field, i.e., in the geometry where the transmitted light is propagating along the field direction. Different experimental configurations given by the field orientation relative to the crystal and the light polarization have been explored. We focus on the range of small principal quantum numbers $n \leq 7$. The number of exciton states belonging to a particular principal quantum number increases with $n$, leading to an enhanced complexity of the spectra. Still, in particular for $n = 3 \ldots 5$ a spectral separation of the different lines is feasible and identification as well as assignment of the dominant state character are possible. We find a strong dependence of the spectra on the chosen light propagation direction and polarization configuration, reflecting the inadequacy of the hydrogen model for describing the excitons. With increasing the field excitonic states with different parity become mixed, leading to optical activation of states that are dark in zero field. As compared with atoms, due to the reduced Rydberg energy states with different $n$ can be brought into resonance in the accessible electric field strength range. When this occurs, we observe mostly crossing of levels within the experimental accuracy showing that the electron and hole motion remains regular. The observed features are well described by detailed calculations accounting for the spin-orbit coupling, the cubic anisotropy effects, and the symmetry-imposed optical selection rules.

abstract: We review the Schr\"odinger picture of field theory in curved spacetime and using this formalism, the power spectrum of massive non-interacting, minimally coupled scalars in a fixed de Sitter background is obtained. To calculate the N-point function in Schr\"odinger field theory, the "in-in" formalism is extended in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We compute the three-point function for primordial scalar field fluctuation in the single field inflation by this in-in formalism. The results are the same as the three-point function in the Heisenberg picture.

abstract: Quantum master equations form an important tool in the description of transport problems in open quantum systems. However, they suffer from the difficulty that the shape of the Lindblad dissipator depends sensibly on the system Hamiltonian. Consequently, most of the work done in this field has focused on phenomenological dissipators which act locally on different parts of the system. In this paper we show how to construct Lindblad dissipators for quantum many-body systems starting from a microscopic theory of the system-bath interaction. We consider specifically a one-dimensional bosonic tight-binding chain connected to two baths at the first and last site, kept at different temperatures and chemical potentials. We then shown that, even though the bath coupling is local, the effective Lindblad dissipator stemming from this interaction is inherently non-local, affecting all normal modes of the system. We then use this formalism to study the current of particles and energy through the system and find that they have the structure of Landauer's formula, with the bath spectral density playing the role of the transfer integral. Finally, we consider infinitesimal temperature and chemical potential gradients and show that the currents satisfy Onsager's reciprocal relations, which is a consequence of the fact that the microscopic quantum dynamics obeys detailed balance.

In this short review, we discuss from a thermodynamical perspective recent investigations on nonstationary heat and work generated in quantum systems, emphasizing open questions and unsolved issues.

abstract: A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once. Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation.

abstract: We propose an improvement of the basis for the solution of the stationary two-centre Dirac equation in Cassini coordinates using the finite-basis-set method presented in [1]. For the calculations in [1], we constructed the basis for approximating the energy eigenfunctions by using smooth piecewise defined polynomials, called B-splines. In the present article, we report that an analysis of the employed representation of the Dirac matrices shows that the above approximation is not efficient using B-spines only. Therefore, we include basis functions which are defined using functions with step-like behaviour instead of B-splines. Thereby, we achieve a significant increase of accuracy of results as compared to [1].

abstract: We investigate the Wigner crystallization of electrons and holes at the zigzag edges of graphene nanoribbons using a combination of tight-binding, mean field Hubbard and many-body configuration interaction methods. The long-range electron-electrons interaction causes the electronic localization at the zigzag edge of graphene nanoribbon and formation of a Wigner crystal if the ribbon is wide enough. For thinner ribbons (11 \AA width), increased kinetic energy suppresses the Wigner crystal formation. For wider ribbons (28 \AA width), stronger Wigner localization is observed for even number of electrons, revealing an even-odd effect also found in Coulomb blockade addition spectrum. Finally, we show that Wigner crystallization can also occurs for holes, albeit weaker than for electrons.

abstract: We present designs for scalable quantum computers composed of qubits encoded in aggregates of four or more Majorana zero modes, realized at the ends of topological superconducting wire segments that are assembled into superconducting islands with significant charging energy. Quantum information can be manipulated according to a measurement-only protocol, which is facilitated by tunable couplings between Majorana zero modes and nearby semiconductor quantum dots. Our proposed architecture designs have the following principal virtues: (1) the magnetic field can be aligned in the direction of all of the topological superconducting wires since they are all parallel; (2) topological $T$-junctions are not used, obviating possible difficulties in their fabrication and utilization; (3) quasiparticle poisoning is abated by the charging energy; (4) Clifford operations are executed by a relatively standard measurement: detection of corrections to quantum dot energy, charge, or differential capacitance induced by quantum fluctuations; (5) it is compatible with strategies for producing good approximate magic states.
