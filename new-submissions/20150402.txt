abstract: Dispersion interactions such as the van der Waals interaction between atoms or molecules derive from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and can be understood as the exchange of virtual photons between the interacting partners. Any modification of the environment in which those photons propagate will thus invariably lead to an alteration of the van der Waals interaction. Here we show how the two-body dispersion interaction inside a cylindrical waveguide can be made to decay asymptotically exponentially, and how this effect sensitively depends on the material properties and the length scales of the problem, eventually leading to the possibility of controllable interactions. Further, we discuss the possibility to detect the retarded van der Waals interaction by resonant enhancement of the interaction between Rydberg atoms in the light of long-range potentials due to guided modes.

abstract: If the second law of thermodynamics forbids a transition from one state to another, then it is still possible to make the transition happen by using a sufficient amount of work. But if we do not have access to this amount of work, can the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this probability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized systems, it can be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a thermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state, and show that this maximum can be achieved. We also find upper and lower bounds on this transition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a bi-product, we introduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the thermo-majorization criteria which governs state transitions, and compute the work of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a transition, and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also considered. Our results have applications in entanglement theory, and we find the amount of entanglement required (or gained) when transforming one pure entangled state into any other.

abstract: It is shown that if a complete set of mutually commuting operators is formed by constants of motion, then, up to a factor that only depends on the time, each common eigenfunction of such operators is a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the operators representing the initial values of the Cartesian coordinates of a particle are constants of motion that commute with each other and from their common eigenfunction one readily obtains the Green function.

abstract: Many of the challenges of scaling quantum computer hardware lie at the interface between the qubits and the classical control signals used to manipulate them. Modular ion trap quantum computer architectures address scalability by constructing individual quantum processors interconnected via a network of quantum communication channels. Successful operation of such quantum hardware requires a fully programmable classical control system capable of frequency stabilizing the continuous wave lasers necessary for trapping and cooling the ion qubits, stabilizing the optical frequency combs used to drive logic gate operations on the ion qubits, providing a large number of analog voltage sources to drive the trap electrodes, and a scheme for maintaining phase coherence among all the controllers that manipulate the qubits. In this work, we describe scalable solutions to these hardware development challenges.

abstract: Tensor network states and specifically matrix-product states have proven to be a powerful tool for simulating ground states of strongly correlated spin models. Recently, they have also been applied to interacting fermionic problems, specifically in the context of quantum chemistry. A new freedom arising in such non-local fermionic systems is the choice of orbitals, it being far from clear what choice of fermionic orbitals to make. In this work, we propose a way to overcome this challenge. We suggest a method intertwining the optimisation over matrix product states with suitable fermionic Gaussian mode transformations, hence bringing the advantages of both approaches together. The described algorithm generalises basis changes in the spirit of the Hartree-Fock methods to matrix-product states, and provides a black box tool for basis optimisations in tensor network methods.

abstract: Hitherto, a finitely thick barrier next to a well or a rigid wall has been considered the potential of simplest shape giving rise to resonances (metastable states) in one dimension. In such a potential, there are three real turning points at an energy below the barrier. Resonances are Gamow's (time-wise) decaying states with discrete complex energies $({\cal E}_n = E_n -i\Gamma_n/2)$. These are also spatially catastrophic states that manifest as peaks/wiggles in Wigner's reflection time-delay at $E = \epsilon_n \approx E_n$. Here we explore potentials with simpler shapes giving rise to resonances - two-piece rising potentials having just one-turning point. We demonstrate our point by using rising exponential profile in various ways.

abstract: Recently, Girolami and Adesso have demonstrated that the calculation of quantum discord for two-qubit case can be viewed as to solve a pair of transcendental equation (Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 83}, 052108(2011)). In present work, we introduce the generalized Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism and apply it as a convenient tool for constructing transcendental equations. For the general two-qubit case, we show that the transcendental equations always have a finite set of universal solutions, this result can be viewed as a generalization of the one get by Ali, Rau, and Alber (Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 81}, 042105 (2010)). For a subclass of $X$ state, we find the analytical solutions by solving the transcendental equations.

abstract: In open system approaches with non-Markovian environments, the process of inserting an individual mode (denoted as "pseudomode") into the bath or extracting it from the bath is widely employed. This procedure, however, is typically performed on basis of the spectral density (SD) and does not incorporate temperature. Here, we show how the - temperature-dependent - bath correlation function (BCF) transforms in such a process. We present analytic formulae for the transformed BCF and numerically study the differences between factorizing initial state and global thermal (correlated) initial state of mode and bath, respectively. We find that in the regime of strong coupling of the mode to both system and bath, the differences in the BCFs give rise to pronounced differences in the dynamics of the system.

abstract: An extensively pursued current direction of research in physics aims at the development of practical technologies that exploit the effects of quantum mechanics. As part of this ongoing effort, devices for information processing, secure communication and high-precision sensing are being implemented with diverse systems, ranging from photons, atoms and spins to mesoscopic superconducting and nanomechanical structures. Their physical properties make some of these systems better suited than others for specific tasks; thus, photons are well suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins can serve as long-lived quantum memories, and superconducting elements can rapidly process information encoded in their quantum states. A central goal of the envisaged quantum technologies is to develop devices that can simultaneously perform several of these tasks, namely, reliably store, process, and transmit quantum information. Hybrid quantum systems composed of different physical components with complementary functionalities may provide precisely such multi-tasking capabilities. This article reviews some of the driving theoretical ideas and first experimental realizations of hybrid quantum systems and the opportunities and the challenges they present and offers a glance at the near- and long-term perspectives of this fascinating and rapidly expanding field.

abstract: Experiments in long distance quantum key distribution have motivated the development of ruggedised single photon sources, capable of producing useful correlations even when removed from the warm, nurturing environment found in most optics laboratories. As part of an ongoing pro- gramme to place such devices into low earth orbit (LEO), we have developed and built a number of rugged single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. In order to evalu- ate device reliability, we have subjected our design to various thermal, mechanical and atmospheric stresses. Our results show that while such a device may tolerate launch into orbit, operation in orbit and casual mishandling by graduate students, it is probably unable to survive the forcible disassembly of a launch vehicle at the top of a ball of rapidly expanding and oxidising kerosene and liquid oxygen.

abstract: We discuss a simple quantum thermal machine for the generation of steady-state entanglement between two interacting qubits. The machine is autonomous in the sense that it uses only incoherent interactions with thermal baths, but no source of coherence or external control. By weakly coupling the qubits to thermal baths at different temperatures, inducing a heat current through the system, steady-state entanglement is generated far from thermal equilibrium. Finally, we discuss two possible implementations, using superconducting flux qubits or a semiconductor double quantum dot. Experimental prospects for steady-state entanglement are promising in both systems.

abstract: We propose two schemes for concentration of $(n+1)$-qubit entangled states that can be written in the form of $(\alpha|\varphi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+\beta|\varphi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle)_{n+1}$ where $|\varphi_{0}\rangle$ and $|\varphi_{1}\rangle$ are mutually orthogonal $n$-qubit states. The importance of this general form is that the entangled states like Bell, cat, GHZ, GHZ-like, $|\Omega\rangle$, $|Q_{5}\rangle$, 4-qubit cluster states and specific states from the 9 SLOCC-nonequivalent families of 4-qubit entangled states can be expressed in this form. The proposed entanglement concentration protocol is based on the local operations and classical communications (LOCC). It is shown that the maximum success probability for ECP using quantum nondemolition (QND) technique is $2\beta^{2}$ for $(n+1)$-qubit states of the prescribed form. It is shown that the proposed schemes can be implemented optically. Further it is also noted that the proposed schemes can be implemented using quantum dot and microcavity systems.

abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of different types of qubits are promising for building quantum computers if they combine useful properties of their constituent qubits. However, they also pose additional challenges if one type of qubits is more susceptible to environmental noise than the others. Dynamical decoupling can help to protect such systems by reducing the decoherence due to the environmental noise, but the protection must be designed such that it does not interfere with the control fields driving the logical operations. Here, we test such a protection scheme on a quantum register consisting of the electronic and nuclear spins of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The results show that processing is compatible with protection: The dephasing time was extended almost to the limit given by the longitudinal relaxation time of the electron spin.

Different entanglement measures, such as one-site entanglement entropy, one-tangle, concurrence of formation and assistance, negativity and entanglement per bond are calculated and their `characterizing power' to determine quantum phase transitions is compared. A special emphasis is made on the study of entanglement monogamy properties.

abstract: One of the predominant challenges when engineering future quantum information processors is that large quantum systems are notoriously hard to maintain and control accurately. It is therefore of immediate practical relevance to investigate quantum information processing with limited physical resources, for example to ask: How well can we perform information processing tasks if we only have access to a small quantum device? Can we beat fundamental limits imposed on information processing with classical resources? This book will introduce the reader to the mathematical framework required to answer such questions. The focus is on measures of entropy and information that underly finite resource information theory, in particular Renyi and smooth entropies. We will review quantum generalizations of Renyi entropies and discuss their properties in detail. Smooth entropies are variants of Renyi entropies that have found various applications ranging from quantum cryptography to thermodynamics. A particular goal of this book is to give simple and concise proofs of the most important properties of Renyi and smooth entropies. A few specific applications of the framework are discussed.

abstract: We show that a class of exactly solvable quantum Ising models, including transverse-field Ising model and anisotropic XY model, can be characterized as the loops in a two-dimensional auxiliary space. The transverse-field Ising model corresponds to a circle and the XY model corresponds to an ellipse, while other models yield a Cardioid, Limacon, Hypocycloid, and Lissajous curves, et al.. It is shown that the variation of the ground state energy density, which is a function of the loop, experiences a non-analytical point when the winding number of the corresponding loop changes. The winding number can serve as a topological quantum number of the quantum phases in the extended quantum Ising model, which sheds some light upon the relation between quantum phase transition and the geometrical order parameter characterizing the phase diagram.

abstract: The Frenkel-Kontorova model reproduces in one dimension the essential features of the stick-slip motion characteristic of friction. We theoretically analyze a realization where the atomic array is an ion chain and the substrate potential is the optical lattice of a high-finesse resonator, to which the ions dipolar transitions strongly couple. In this regime the lattice depth depends on their spatial density and the cavity potential behaves like a dynamically deformable substrate, which mediates infinitely long-ranged interactions between the ions. We characterize the properties of the stationary state, resulting from the balance between a pump driving the resonator and losses due to cavity decay, in a finite chain within a harmonic trap. When the cavity wavelength is incommensurate with the interparticle distance at the chain center, the phase diagram exhibits a sliding-to-pinned transition. The transition point depends on the cavity nonlinearity $C$, and its nature changes from a symmetry-breaking to a first-order transition as $C$ is increased. Its salient features can be explained by the global lattice deformation and can be revealed by monitoring the emitted field, which carries information about the ions structure within the cavity mode. These dynamics represent a paradigm of competing self-organizing mechanisms which can be observed in existing experimental setups.

abstract: We measure the angular dependence of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two individual Rydberg atoms with controlled relative positions. By applying a combination of static electric and magnetic fields on the atoms, we demonstrate the possibility to isolate a single interaction channel at a F\"orster resonance, that shows a well-defined angular dependence. We first identify spectroscopically the F\"orster resonance of choice and we then perform a direct measurement of the interaction strength between the two atoms as a function of the angle between the internuclear axis and the quantization axis. Our results show good agreement with the expected angular dependence $\propto(1-3\cos^2\theta)$, and represent an important step towards quantum state engineering in two-dimensional arrays of individual Rydberg atoms.

abstract: We investigate many body localization in the presence of a single particle mobility edge. The mobility edge in the model we consider leads to an energy region where the non-interacting extended many body states are mixed with partially-localized states. We find through exact diagonalization, that such a mixed energy regime survives in the presence of interactions. Although not fully localized, states in this mixed regime are non-ergodic in nature, giving rise to an energy dependent violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Surprisingly, we find that the many body system could be completely localized even if there are extended single-particle eigenstates.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the quantum oscillator-like states recently observed experimentally in polariton condensates (Nat. Phys. 8, 190 (2012)). We consider a complex Gross-Pitaevskii type model which includes the effects of self-interactions, and creation and decay of exciton-polaritons. We develop a perturbation theory for approximate solutions to this non-equilibrium condensate model and compare the results with numerically calculated solutions for both repulsive and attractive polariton-polariton interactions. While the nonlinearity has a weak effect on the mode selection their density profiles are modified at moderate gain strengths and becomes more dominant when a very large gain of polaritons implies an extended cloud with high condensate densities. Finally, we identify the relation of the observed patterns to the input pump configuration, and suggest this may serve as a generalized NOR gate in the tradition of optical computing.

abstract: We introduce a scheme that combines photon-assisted tunneling by a moving optical lattice with strong Hubbard interactions, and allows for the quantum simulation of paradigmatic quantum many-body models. We show that, in a certain regime, this quantum simulator yields an effective Hubbard Hamiltonian with tunable bond-charge interactions, a model studied in the context of strongly-correlated electrons. In a different regime, we show how to exploit a correlated destruction of tunneling to explore Nagaoka ferromagnetism at finite Hubbard repulsion. By changing the photon-assisted tunneling parameters, we can also obtain a $t$-$J$ model with independently controllable tunneling $t$, super-exchange interaction $J$, and even a Heisenberg-Ising anisotropy. Hence, the full phase diagram of this paradigmatic model becomes accessible to cold-atom experiments, departing from the region $t\gg J$ allowed by standard single-band Hubbard Hamiltonians in the strong-repulsion limit. We finally show that, by generalizing the photon-assisted tunneling scheme, the quantum simulator yields models of dynamical Gauge fields, where atoms of a given electronic state dress the tunneling of the atoms with a different internal state, leading to Peierls phases that mimic a dynamical magnetic field.

abstract: We argue that an infinite circumference limit can be obtained in 2-dimensional conformal field theory by adopting $L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2$ as a Hamiltonian instead of $L_0$. The theory obtained has a circumference of infinite length and hence exhibits a continuous and heavily degenerated spectrum as well as the continuous Virasoro algebra. The choice of this Hamiltonian was inspired partly by the so-called sine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of quantum statistical systems. The enigmatic behavior of sine-square deformed systems such as the sharing of their vacuum states with the closed boundary systems can be understood by the appearance of an infinite circumference.

It is the first time to introduce general pure three-qubit states to complete remote state preparation. The probability of successful preparation is presented. Moreover, in some special cases, the successful probability could reach unit.

abstract: The local convertibility of quantum states, as measured by the R\'enyi entropy, is concerned with whether or not a state can be transformed into another state, using only local operations and classical communications. We found that in the one-dimensional Kitaev chain with quenched chemical potential $\mu$, the convertibility between the state for $\mu$ and that for $\mu+\delta\mu$, depends on the quantum phases of the system ($\delta\mu$ is a perturbation). This is similar to the adiabatic case where the ground state is considered. Specifically, when the quenched system has edge modes and the subsystem size for the partition is much larger than the correlation length of the Majorana fermions which forms the edge modes, the quenched state is locally inconvertible. We give a physical interpretation for the result, based on analyzing the interactions between the two subsystems for various partitions. Our work should help to better understand the many-body phenomena in topological systems and also the entanglement properties in the Majorana fermionic quantum computation.

The method combines the benefits of integrability and matrix product states in one dimension to avoid several issues that hinder other applications of tensor based methods in 2D. In particular it can be extended to infinitely long cylinders. As an example application we present results for quantum quenches in the 2D quantum (2+1 dimensional) Ising model. In quenches that cross a phase boundary we find that the return probability shows non-analyticities in time.

abstract: We analyze the energetic and dynamical properties of bright-bright (BB) soliton pairs in a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates subjected to the action of a combined optical lattice, acting as an external potential for the first species, while modulating the intraspecies coupling constant of the second. In particular, we use a variational approach and direct numerical integrations to investigate the existence and stability of BB solitons in which the two species are either spatially separated (split soliton) or located at the same optical lattice site (overlapped soliton). The dependence of these solitons on the interspecies interaction parameter is explicitly investigated. For repulsive interspecies interaction we show the existence of a series of critical values at which transitions from an initially overlapped soliton to split solitons occur. For attractive interspecies interaction only single direct transitions from split to overlapped BB solitons are found. The possibility to use split solitons for indirect measurements of scattering lengths is also suggested.

Amazingly the interchange phase yields a finite capacity of one quantum state interpolating between Fermion and Boson and the mutual exchange phase has no explicit effect on statistics. Finite capacity of quantum state is defined as Gentile statistics and it is different from the fractional exclusion statistics. Some discussion on the general model is also given.

Axions massive enough to be all of the DM do not affect the coherence length of the relative velocity, but the MBPT equations are modified by the inclusion of the axion effective sound speed. These MBPT equations are necessary for accurately modelling the effects of axion DM on the formation of the first cosmic structures, and suggest that the 21cm power spectrum could improve constraints on axion mass by up to four orders of magnitude with respect to the current best constraints. A further application of these results uses the "quantum force" analogy to model scalar field gradient energy in a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics model of axion DM. Such a model can treat axion DM in the non-linear regime and could be incorporated into existing N-body codes.
