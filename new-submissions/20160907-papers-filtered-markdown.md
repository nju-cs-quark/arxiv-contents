**1.    Statistical Bubble Localization with Random Interactions**

<p>
We study one-dimensional spinless fermions with random interactions, but without any on-site disorder. We find that random interactions generically stabilize a many-body localized phase, in spite of the completely extended single-particle degrees of freedom. In the large randomness limit, we construct "bubble-neck" eigenstates having a universal area-law entanglement entropy on average, with the number of volume-law states being exponentially suppressed. We argue that this statistical localization is beyond the phenomenological local-integrals-of-motion description of many-body localization. With exact diagonalization, we confirm the robustness of the many-body localized phase at finite randomness by investigating eigenstate properties such as level statistics, entanglement/participation entropies, and nonergodic quantum dynamics. At weak random interactions, the system develops a thermalization transition when the single-particle hopping becomes dominant.

**2.    Lyapunov Exponent and Four-Point Correlator's Growth Rate in a Chaotic System**

<blockquote>
<p>
It was proposed recently that the out-of-time-ordered four-point correlator (OTOC) may serve as a useful characteristic of quantum-chaotic behavior, because in the semi-classical limit, $\hbar \to 0$, its rate of exponential growth resembles the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here, we calculate the four-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a textbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times with the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both quantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the Lyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the logarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and to the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference appears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength, where no classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, while the OTOC's growth rate may remain finite corresponding to disconnected local chaotic islands in the phase space. We also show that the quantum correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear singularity at the Ehrenfest time $t_E$: transitioning from a time-independent value of $t^{-1} \ln{C(t)}$ at $t < t_E$ to its monotonous decrease with time at $t>t_E$. We note that the underlying physics here is the same as in the theory of weak dynamical localization [Tian, Kamenev, and Larkin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 124101 (2004)] and is due to a delay in the onset of quantum interference effects, which occur sharply at the Ehrenfest time.
