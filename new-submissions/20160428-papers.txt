abstract: We present a framework for systematically studying linear bosonic non-Gaussian channels. Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we call as photon-added Gaussian channels and these are experimentally viable with current quantum-optical technologies. These channels are obtained by extending Gaussian channels with photon addition applied to the environment state (in its respective Stinespring unitary representation) giving rise to a one-parameter family of non-Gaussian channels indexed by photon number $n$ with $n=0$ corresponding to the underlying Gaussian channel. We then derive the corresponding operator-sum representation and observe that these channels are Fock-preserving, i.e., coherence non-generating on incoherent states in the Fock basis. Furthermore, noisy Gaussian channels can be expressed as a convex mixture of these non-Gaussian channels analogous to the Fock basis representation of a thermal state. We then report examples of activation of nonclassicality, using this method of photon-addition, at outputs of channels that would otherwise output only classical states, and present a classicality no-go theorem. We also derive many structure theorems for these channels. Finally, we observe that there exists an environment-assisted error-correction scheme for transmitting classical information through these channels. These channels add to the toolbox of realizable non-Gaussian resources (both states and operations) that are of increasing use in continuous-variable quantum information processing.

abstract: Several locally deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics are presented and reviewed. The fundamental differences between these interpretations are made transparent by explicitly showing what information is carried locally by each physical system in an idealized experimental test of Bell's theorem. This also shows how each of these models can be locally causal and deterministic. First, a model is presented which avoids Bell's arguments through the assumption that space-time inflated from an initial singularity, which encapsulates the entire past light cone of every event in the universe. From this assumption, it is shown how quantum mechanics can produce locally consistent reality by choosing one of many possible futures at the time of the singularity. Secondly, we review and expand the Parallel Lives interpretation of Brassard and Raymond-Robichaud, which maintains local causality and determinism by abandoning the strictest notion of realism. Finally, the two ideas are combined, resulting in a parallel lives model in which lives branch apart earlier, under the assumption of a single unified interaction history. The physical content of weak values within each model is discussed, along with related philosophical issues concerning free will.

abstract: Optimal state transfer of a single two-level system (TLS) coupled to an Ohmic boson bath via off-diagonal TLS-bath coupling is studied by using optimal control theory. In the weak system-bath coupling regime where the time-dependent Bloch-Redfield formalism is applicable, we obtain the Bloch equation to probe the evolution of the dissipative TLS in the presence of a time-dependent external control field. By using the automatic differentiation technique to compute the gradient for the cost functional, we calculate the optimal transfer integral profile that can achieve an ideal transfer within a dimer system in the FennaMatthews-Olson (FMO) model. The robustness of the control profile against temperature variation is also analyzed.

abstract: We propose a feasible scheme to implement a universal set of quantum gates based on geometric phases and superadiabatic quantum control. Consolidating the advantages of both strategies, the proposed quantum gates are robust and fast. The diamond nitrogen-vacancy center system is adopted as a typical example to illustrate the scheme. We show that these gates can be realized in a simple two-level configuration by appropriately controlling the amplitude, phase, and frequency of just one microwave field. The gate's robust and fast features are confirmed by comparing the fidelity of the proposed superadiabatic geometric phase (controlled-PHASE) gate with those of two other kinds of phase (controlled-PHASE) gates.

abstract: One drawback of conventional quantum state tomography is that it does not readily provide access to single density matrix elements, since it requires a global reconstruction. Here we experimentally demonstrate a scheme that can be used to directly measure single density matrix elements of general quantum states. The scheme relies on measuring a sequence of three observables, each complementary to the last. The first two measurements are made weak to minimize the disturbance they cause to the state, while the final measurement is strong. We perform this joint measurement on polarized photons in pure and mixed states to directly measure their density matrix. The weak measurements are achieved using two walk-off crystals, each inducing a polarization-dependent spatial shift that couples the spatial and polarization degree of freedom of the photons. This direct measurement method provides an operational meaning to the density matrix and promises to be especially useful for large dimensional states.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1604.07925
abstract: A qudit code is a subspace of the state space of a fixed number of qudits. Such a code is permutation-invariant if it is unchanged under the swapping of any pair of the underlying qudits. Prior permutation-invariant qubit codes encode a single qubit while correcting $t$ arbitrary errors, and their logical codewords have two important properties. First, the Dicke states over which the logical codewords are superposed over have weights spaced a constant number apart. Second, the probability of observing each logical codeword as a given Dicke state is proportional to a binomial coefficient. We design permutation-invariant qudit codes encoding a single qubit with logical codewords that need not have the above two properties, while still allowing the correction of $t$ arbitrary errors. Polynomials govern the structure of the Dicke states and the probabilities in our construction.

abstract: Recently (PRL 113, 050403 (2014)) the concept of local symmetries in one-dimensional stationary wave propagation has been shown to lead to a class of invariant two-point currents that allow to generalize the parity and Bloch theorem. In the present work we establish the theoretical framework of local symmetries for higher-dimensional interacting many-body systems. Based on the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy we derive the equations of motion of local symmetry correlators which are off-diagonal elements of the reduced one-body density matrix at symmetry related positions. The natural orbital representation yields equations of motion for the convex sum of the local symmetry correlators of the natural orbitals as well as for the local symmetry correlators of the individual orbitals themselves. An alternative integral representation with a unique interpretation is provided. We discuss special cases, such as the bosonic and fermionic mean field theory and show in particular that the invariant two-point currents are recovered in the case of the non-interacting one-dimensional stationary wave propagation. Finally we derive the equations of motion for anomalous local symmetry correlators which indicate the breaking of a global into a local symmetry in the stationary non-interacting case.

abstract: A channel capacity is non-convex if the capacity of a mixture of different quantum channels exceeds the mixture of the individual capacities. This implies that there is a concrete communication scenario in which a sender can increase the transmission rate by forgetting which channel acts on the channel input. Previously, this surprising property had only been shown for the quantum capacity. Here we prove that both the private and classical environment-assisted capacities are non-convex.

abstract: We critically evaluate the most widespread assumption in the theoretical description of coherent control strategies for open quantum systems. We show that, for non-Markovian open systems dynamics, this fixed-dissipator assumption leads to a serious pitfall causing insurmountable difficulties in the effective modelling of the controlled system. We show that the only way to avoid these problems is a full microscopic description of the controlled system in presence of noise. We illustrate our findings with a paradigmatic example.

abstract: General probabilistic theories are designed to provide operationally the most general probabilistic models including both classical and quantum theories. In this letter, we introduce a systematic method to construct a series of entropies, all of which generalize Shannon entropy in classical system and von Neumann entropy in quantum system. Using these entropies, the Holevo bound, an upper bound of the accessible information from a quantum system, is generalized to hold in any general probabilistic theory.

abstract: This thesis explores ways in which quantum channels and correlations (of both classical and quantum types) manifest themselves, and also studies the interplay between these two aspects in various physical settings. Quantum channels represent all possible evolutions of states allowed by quantum mechanics while correlations are intrinsic (nonlocal) properties of composite systems. There are four main problems that are addressed (i) the role played by initial system-bath correlations on the subsystem dynamics of an open quantum system, (ii) computation of correlations for two-qubit X-states, (iii) the robustness of non-Gaussian entanglement under symmetric local noisy attenuator and amplifier channels, and finally, (iv) the connection between nonclassicality breaking and entanglement breaking for single-mode bosonic Gaussian channels.

abstract: Scattering of light by matter has been studied extensively in the past. Yet, the most fundamental process, the scattering of a single photon by a single atom, is largely unexplored [1-3]. One prominent prediction of quantum optics is the deterministic absorption of a traveling photon by a single atom, provided the photon waveform matches spatially and temporally the time-reversed version of a spontaneously emitted photon [4-12]. Here, we experimentally address this prediction and investigate the influence of the temporal profile of the photon on the scattering dynamics using a single trapped atom and heralded single photons. In a time-resolved measurement of the atomic excitation we find a 56(11)% increase of the peak excitation by photons with an exponentially rising profile compared to a decaying one. This result demonstrates that tailoring the envelope of single photons enables precise control of the photon-atom interaction.

abstract: Any quantum resource theory is based on free states and free operations, i.e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In the resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis, and free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular experimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been discussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these problems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be incoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create large amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework of genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and study other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in any experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure of this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations under these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does not have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all other states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the other hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what comes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the optimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent operations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can potentially create coherence in some experimental realization.

abstract: Tsallis-$q$ entanglement is a bipartite entanglement measure which is the generalization of entanglement of formation for $q$ tending to 1. We first expanded the range of $q$ for the analytic formula of Tsallis-\emph{q} entanglement. For $0.7 \leq \emph{q} \leq 4.3$, we proved the monogamy relation in terms of the squared Tsallis-$q$ entanglement for an arbitrary multi-qubit systems. We also showed that the $\mu$-th power of Tsallis-\emph{q} entanglement satisfies the monogamy or polygamy inequalities for any three-qubit state.

abstract: Secret sharing of a quantum state, or quantum secret sharing, in which a dealer wants to share certain amount of quantum information with a few players, has wide applications in quantum information. The critical criterion in a threshold secret sharing scheme is confidentiality, with less than the designated number of players, no information can be recovered. Furthermore, in a quantum scenario, one additional critical criterion exists, the capability of sharing entangled and unknown quantum information. Here by employing a six-photon entangled state, we demonstrate a quantum threshold scheme, where the shared quantum secrecy can be efficiently reconstructed with a state fidelity as high as 93%. By observing that any one or two parties cannot recover the secrecy, we show that our scheme meets the confidentiality criterion. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that entangled quantum information can be shared and recovered via our setting, which demonstrates that our implemented scheme is fully quantum. Moreover, our experimental setup can be treated as a decoding circuit of the 5-qubit quantum error-correcting code with two erasure errors.

abstract: According to the second law of thermodynamics, for every transformation performed on a system which is in contact with an environment of fixed temperature, the extracted work is bounded by the decrease of the free energy of the system. However, in a single realization of a generic process, the extracted work is subject to statistical fluctuations which may allow for probabilistic violations of the previous bound. We are interested in enhancing this effect, i.e. we look for thermodynamic processes that maximize the probability of extracting work above a given arbitrary threshold. For any process obeying the Jarzynski identity, we determine an upper bound for the work extraction probability that depends also on the minimum amount of work that we are willing to extract in case of failure, or on the average work we wish to extract from the system. Then we show that this bound can be saturated within the thermodynamic formalism of quantum discrete processes composed by sequences of unitary quenches and complete thermalizations. We explicitly determine the optimal protocol which is given by two quasi-static isothermal transformations separated by a finite unitary quench.

abstract: A system of two polarized photons in singlet state appears as being in one of two product states independent of any measurement. These states depend on the selected polarization angles. With the polarizers on either side perpendicular to each other, both photons pass the polarizers without any disturbance. Action at a distance is therefore not needed to explain the results of the measurements. In general, the elements of physical reality demanded by EPR are the polarization states of the two photons of the entangled pair. As these are local elements in the regions of space of the polarizers the EPR paradox for the case of entangled photons can be regarded as resolved.

abstract: Atom interferometers are a useful tool for precision measurements of fundamental physical phenomena, ranging from local gravitational field strength to the atomic fine structure constant. In such experiments, it is desirable to implement a high momentum transfer "beam-splitter," which may be achieved by inducing quantum resonance in a finite-temperature laser-driven atomic gas. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate these quantum resonances in the regime where the gas receives laser pulses of finite duration, and demonstrate that an $\epsilon$-classical model for the dynamics of the gas atoms is capable of reproducing quantum resonant behavior for both zero-temperature and finite-temperature non-interacting gases. We show that this model agrees well with the fully quantum treatment of the system over a time-scale set by the choice of experimental parameters. We also show that this model is capable of correctly treating the time-reversal mechanism necessary for implementing an interferometer with this physical configuration.

abstract: Information physics considers physical laws to result from the consistent quantification and processing of information about physical phenomena. In previous efforts, one of us (Knuth) has shown that a simple model of particles that directly influence one another results in a partially ordered set referred to as the influence network, from which emerge the Minkowski metric and Lorentz transformations of special relativity. Here, we extend earlier work on receipt of influence to the case of one particle influencing another, finding that this gives rise to equations of the form of geodesic equations from general relativity in 1+1 dimensions. Future work will test the equivalence of the current result to general relativity in 1+1 dimensions.

abstract: Self-testing refers to the phenomenon that certain extremal quantum correlations (almost) uniquely identify the quantum system under consideration. For instance observing the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality certifies that the two parties share a singlet. While self-testing results are known for several classes of states, in many cases they are only valid if the observed statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for practical applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less common and moreover they all result from a single numerical method (with one exception which we discuss in detail). In this work we present a new technique for proving analytic self-testing bounds of practically relevant robustness. We obtain improved bounds for the case of self-testing the singlet using the CHSH inequality (in particular we show that a non-trivial singlet can be extracted as long as the violation exceeds $\beta^{*} = (16 + 14 \sqrt{2})/17 \approx 2.11$). In case of self-testing the tripartite GHZ state using the Mermin inequality we derive a bound which not only improves on previously known results but turns out to be tight. We discuss other scenarios to which our technique can be immediately applied.

abstract: Recently it was shown in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 140402 (2014)] that in the idealized Dicke model of superradiance there is no entanglement among any partitions of the system during the total evolution time of the system. This result immediately conducts us to question if other measures from quantum information theory can explain the characteristic release of energy in a short time interval. In this work we identify the uncertainty of purely quantum origin as the property responsible for Dicke superradiance. The quantum uncertainty on the population of each emitter of the sample captured by the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) is proportional to the correlation radiation rate, which is the part of the total radiated power coming from dipole correlations and responsible for releasing in a short time a great intensity of radiation energy. We also show that the correlation measure called local quantum uncertainty, which is the minimization of the WYSI over all local observables, presents a double sudden change induced by environment. The time window between these two sudden changes is used to define the interval in which symmetric global observables of the system behave classically for $N \rightarrow \infty$, although the emitters remain strongly quantum correlated.

abstract: This paper develops general space-efficient methods for error reduction for unitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness (corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method known requires extra workspace of ${O \bigl( p \log \frac{1}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction methods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without intermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \bigl( \log \frac{p}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong amplification for matchgate computations.

abstract: Quantum channel discrimination is a fundamental task in quantum information theory. It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system can help in this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension as the input of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of two channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the output dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels is (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with dimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal discrimination? We show that the answer to this question is "no" by construction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances with arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still has the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is necessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input. The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm unit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density operators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement measures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization allows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it preserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the structure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of reversible maps via the Choi isomorphism. We also include alternate proofs of other known characterizations of channel reversibility.

As well as physical solutions, unphysical solutions are examined in detail, with taking the possibility of Jordan blocks of the matrix $\mathsf{N\,S}$ into consideration. Two types of duality of eigenvectors and basis vectors of the Jordan blocks are pointed out and explored, which disclose many basic properties of the RPA solutions.

Typical properties of the underlying models are present in our semiclassical-topological hybrid system, allowing us to investigate an interplay between semiclassical bifurcations at mean-field level and topological phases. Our results show that bifurcations of the energy landscape lead to diverse ordered quantum phases. Furthermore, the study of the quantum fluctuations around the mean field solution reveals the existence of nontrivial topological phases. These are characterized by the emergence of localized states at the edges of a chain with open boundary conditions.

abstract: The miscibility of two interacting quantum systems is an important testing ground for the understanding of complex quantum systems. Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates enable the investigation of this scenario in a particularly well controlled setting. In a homogeneous system, the transition between mixed and separated phases is fully characterised by a `miscibility parameter', based on the ratio of intra- to inter-species interaction strengths. Here we show, however, that this parameter is no longer the optimal one for trapped gases, for which the location of the phase boundary depends critically on atom numbers. We demonstrate how monitoring of damping rates and frequencies of dipole oscillations enables the experimental mapping of the phase diagram by numerical implementation of a fully self-consistent finite-temperature kinetic theory for binary condensates. The change in damping rate is explained in terms of surface oscillation in the immiscible regime, and counterflow instability in the miscible regime, with collisions becoming only important in the long time evolution.

abstract: A two-component two-dimensional (2D) dipolar bosonic system in the bilayer geometry is considered. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a wide range of layer spacings we analyze in detail the pair correlation functions, the static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing the layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer states. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations, suppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation spectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\em in-phase} (symmetric) and {\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes, during the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic reconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode spectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer superfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\gamma_s=\rho_s/\rho$). In a pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is recovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously, and the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a superfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly with $\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\gamma_s$ is reduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the interlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by static and dynamic properties.

abstract: Turbulent radiation flow is ubiquitous in many physical systems where light-matter interaction becomes relevant. Photon bubbling, in particular, has been identified as the main source of turbulent radiation transport in many astrophysical objects, such as stars and accretion disks. This mechanism takes place when radiation trapping in optically dense media becomes unstable, leading to the energy dissipation from the larger to the smaller bubbles. Here, we report on the observation of photon bubble turbulence in cold atomic gases in the presence of multiple scattering of light. The instability is theoretically explained by a fluid description for the atom density coupled to a diffusive transport equation for the photons, which is known to be accurate in the multiple scattering regime investigated here. We determine the power spectrum of the atom density fluctuations, which displays an unusual $\sim k^{-4}$ scaling, and entails a complex underlying turbulent dynamics resulting from the formation of dynamical bubble-like structures. We derive a power spectrum from the theoretical photon bubble model which, to a high level of accuracy, explains the observations. The experimental results reported here, along with the theoretical model we developed may shed light on the analogue photon bubble instabilities in astrophysical scenarios.
