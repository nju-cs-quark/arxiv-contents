**1.    Robust unidirectional transport in a one-dimensional metacrystal with long-range hopping**  
Stefano Longhi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.06004  
<blockquote>
<p>
In two- and three-dimensional structures, topologically-protected chiral edge modes offer a powerful mean to realize robust light transport. However, little attention has been paid so far to robust one-way transport in one-dimensional systems. Here it is shown that unidirectional transport, which is immune to disorder and backscattering, can occur in certain one-dimensional metacrystals with long-range hopping without resorting to topological protection. Such metacrystals are described by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian with broken time reversal symmetry, and transport does not require adiabatic (Thouless) pumping. A simple implementation in optics of such one-dimensional metacrystals, based on transverse light dynamics in a self-imaging optical cavity with phase gratings, is suggested

**2.    Localization, quantum resonances and ratchet acceleration in a periodically-kicked $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum rotator**  
Stefano Longhi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.06007  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider wave transport phenomena in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of the periodically-kicked quantum rotator model and reveal that dynamical localization assists the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ phase. In the delocalized (quantum resonance) regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is always in the broken phase and ratchet acceleration arises as a signature of unidirectional non-Hermitian transport. An optical implementation of the periodically-kicked $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian, based on transverse beam propagation in a passive optical resonator with combined phase and loss gratings, is suggested to visualize acceleration modes in fractional Talbot cavities.

**3.    Exceptional Configurations for Search by Szegedy's Quantum Walk**  
Thomas G. Wong, Raqueline A. M. Santos  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1610.06075  
<blockquote>
<p>
In seminal work, Szegedy gave a method for quantizing a classical Markov chain that has been especially useful for searching for marked vertices in graphs. We prove, however, that this algorithm fails when searching on the two-dimensional periodic square lattice with a marked diagonal, in the sense that the state of the system only evolves by acquiring minus signs. Then the state is a uniform probability distribution over the vertices for all time, which is equivalent to classically guessing and checking. Furthermore, we prove that this failure also occurs for any configuration of marked vertices on the one-dimensional cycle and for any configuration that reduces to it. Thus, Szegedy's quantum walk has a family of exceptional configurations for which it does not spread. Despite this, we exploit this stationary behavior to construct a quantum walk with an arbitrary polynomial speedup over the classical random walk, and it is the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup.
