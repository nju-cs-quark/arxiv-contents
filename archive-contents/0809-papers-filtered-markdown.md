<p>
Quantum random walks have received much interest due to their non-intuitive dynamics, which may hold the key to a new generation of quantum algorithms. What remains a major challenge is a physical realization that is experimentally viable and not limited to special connectivity criteria. We present a scheme for walking on arbitrarily complex graphs, which can be realized using a variety of quantum systems such as a BEC trapped inside an optical lattice. This scheme is particularly elegant since the walker is not required to physically step between the nodes; only flipping coins is sufficient.

**2.    Correlation effects in a discrete quantum random walk**

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce history-dependent discrete-time quantum random walk models by adding uncorrelated memory terms and also by modifying Hamiltonian of the walker to include couplings with memory-keeping agents. We next numerically study the correlation effects in these models. We also propose a correlation exponent as a relevant and promising tool for investigation of correlation or memory (hence non-Markovian) effects. Our analysis can easily be applied to more realistic models in which different regimes may emerge because of competition between different underlying physical mechanisms.

**3.    Hyperentanglement witness**  
Giuseppe Vallone, Raino Ceccarelli, Francesco De Martini, Paolo Mataloni  
Phys. Rev. A 78, 062305 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2155  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new criterium to detect the entanglement present in a {\it hyperentangled state}, based on the evaluation of an entanglement witness, is presented. We show how some witnesses recently introduced for graph states, measured by only two local settings, can be used in this case. We also define a new witness $W_3$ that improves the resistance to noise by increasing the number of local measurements.

**4.    Freezing a Coherent Field Growth in a Cavity by Quantum Zeno Effect**

<blockquote>
<p>
We have frozen the coherent evolution of a field in a cavity by repeated measurements of its photon number. We use circular Rydberg atoms dispersively coupled to the cavity mode for an absorption-free photon counting. These measurements inhibit the growth of a Field injected in the cavity by a classical source. This manifestation of the Quantum Zeno effect illustrates the back action of the photon number determination onto the Field phase. The residual growth of the Field can be seen as a random walk of its amplitude in the two-dimensional phase space. This experiment sheds light onto the measurement process and opens perspectives for active quantum feedback.
