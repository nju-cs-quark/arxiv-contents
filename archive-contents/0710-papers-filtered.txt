abstract: We study the quantum walk subjected to measurements with a L\'evy waiting-time distribution. We find that the system has a sub-ballistic behavior instead of a diffusive one. We obtain an analytical expression for the exponent of the power law of the variance as a function of the characteristic parameter of the L\'evy distribution.

abstract: The method of the quantum probability theory only requires simple structural data of graph and allows us to avoid a heavy combinational argument often necessary to obtain full description of spectrum of the adjacency matrix. In the present paper, by using the idea of calculation of the probability amplitudes for continuous-time quantum walk in terms of the quantum probability theory, we investigate quantum central limit theorem for continuous-time quantum walks on odd graphs.

abstract: We show by general arguments that networks whose density of states contains few highly degenerate eigenvalues result in inefficient performances of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) over these networks, while systems whose eigenvalues all have the same degeneracy lead to very efficient transport. We exemplify our results by considering CTQW and, for comparison, its classical counterpart, continuous-time random walks, over simple structures, whose eigenvalues and eigenstates can be calculated analytically. Extensions to more complicated, hyper-branched networks are discussed.

abstract: In the present paper, we study the continuous-time quantum walk on quotient graphs. On such graphs, there is a straightforward reduction of problem to a subspace that can be considerably smaller than the original one. Along the lines of reductions, by using the idea of calculation of the probability amplitudes for continuous-time quantum walk in terms of the spectral distribution associated with the adjacency matrix of graphs [Jafarizadeh and Salimi (Ann. Phys 322(2007))], we show the continuous-time quantum walk on original graph $\Gamma$ induces a continuous-time quantum walk on quotient graph $\Gamma_H$. Finally, for example we investigate continuous-time quantum walk on some quotient Cayley graphs.
