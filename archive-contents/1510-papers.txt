abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem holds that operations from the Clifford group, when combined with preparation and detection of qubit states in the computational basis, are insufficient for universal quantum computation. Indeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a local hidden variable theory, so that there is no need for a quantum mechanical explanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup. Unfortunately, Clifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and measurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are otherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum computation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an additional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate the Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable theory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell violations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the already existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems. We conclude with an experimentally feasible schematic combining the two, which should potentially lead to the demonstration of Bell violation in a Majorana experiment in the near future. Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which we describe.

abstract: Living organisms capitalize on their ability to predict their environment to maximize their available free energy, and invest this energy in turn to create new complex structures. Is there a preferred method by which this manipulation of structure should be done? Our intuition is "simpler is better," but this is only a guiding principal. Here, we substantiate this claim through thermodynamic reasoning. We present a new framework for the manipulation of patterns (structured sequences of data) by predictive devices. We identify the dissipative costs and how they can be minimized by the choice of memory in these predictive devices. For pattern generation, we see that simpler is indeed better. However, contrary to intuition, when it comes to extracting work from a pattern, any device capable of making statistically accurate predictions can recover all available energy.

abstract: Computing entanglement entropy and its cousins is often challenging even in the simplest continuum and lattice models, partly because such entropies depend nontrivially on all geometric characteristics of the entangling region. Quantum information measures between two or more regions are even more complicated, but contain more, and universal, information. In this paper, we focus on Renyi entropy and information of the order n=2. For a free field theory, we show that these quantities are mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy by introducing boundaries subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in one higher dimension. This mapping allows us to exploit the powerful tools available in the context of thermal Casimir effect, specifically a multipole expansion suited for computing the Renyi information between arbitrarily-shaped regions. We provide an alternative representation as a sum over closed-loop polymers, which establishes a connection to purely entropic effects, and proves useful in deriving information inequalities. Finally, we discuss specific examples that suggest a similar thermodynamic mapping for conformal field theories.

abstract: We analyze radiative processes of a quantum system composed by two identical two-level atoms interacting with a massless scalar field prepared in the vacuum state in the presence of perfect reflecting flat boundaries. We consider that the atoms are prepared in a stationary maximally entangled state. We investigate the spontaneous transition rates from the entangled states to its collective ground state induced by vacuum fluctuations. In the empty-space case, the spontaneous decay rates can be enhanced or inhibited depending on the specific entangled state and changes with the distance between the atoms. Next, we consider the presence of perfect mirrors and impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on such surfaces. In the presence of a single boundary the transition rate for the symmetric state undergoes a strong reduction, whereas for the antisymmetric state our results indicate a slightly enhancement. For completeness we also investigate the case of two perfect mirrors.

abstract: Current parameter estimation techniques rely on photodetectors which have low brightness and thus are based on gathering averaged statistics. Recently it was claimed that perfect photodetction will change the nature of sensing algorithms and will increase sensing efficiency beyond the immediate effect of having larger collection efficiency. In this paper we bring up the observation that perfect photodetection implies Heisenberg scaling($\frac{1}{T}$) for parameter estimations. We analyze a specific example in detail.

abstract: Efficient preparation and detection of the motional state of trapped ions is important in many experiments ranging from quantum computation to precision spectroscopy. We investigate the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique for the manipulation of motional states in a trapped ion system. The presented technique uses a Raman coupling between two hyperfine ground states in $^{25}$Mg$^+$, implemented with delayed pulses, which removes a single phonon independent of the initial motional state. We show that for a thermal state the STIRAP population transfer is more efficient than a stimulated Raman Rabi pulse on a motional sideband. In contrast to previous implementations, a large detuning of more than 200 times the natural linewidth of the transition is used. This approach renders STIRAP suitable for atoms in which resonant laser fields would populate fluorescing excited states and thus impede the STIRAP process. We use the technique to measure the wavefunction overlap of excited motional states with the motional ground state. This is an important application for photon recoil spectroscopy and other force sensing applications that utilize the high sensitivity of the motional state of trapped ions to external fields. Furthermore, a determination of the ground state population enables a simple measurement of the ion's temperature.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We construct a general measure for detecting the quantum speedup in both closed and open systems. This speed measure is based on the changing rate of the position of quantum states on a manifold with appropriate monotone Riemannian metrics. Any increase in speed is a clear signature of real dynamical speedup. To clarify the mechanisms of quantum speedup, we first introduce the concept of longitudinal and transverse types of speedup, and then apply the proposed measure to several typical closed and open quantum systems, illustrating that entanglement and the memory effect of the environment together can become resources for longitudinally or transversely accelerating dynamical evolution under certain conditions. Remarkably, a direct measurement of such speedup is feasible without the need for a tomographic reconstruction of the density matrix, which greatly enhances the feasibility of practical experimental tests.

abstract: The class $\MIP^*$ of promise problems that can be decided through an interactive proof system with multiple entangled provers provides a complexity-theoretic framework for the exploration of the nonlocal properties of entanglement. Little is known about the power of this class. The only proposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of semidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et al. This hierarchy converges to a value that is only known to coincide with the provers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible but difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds on the rate of convergence are known. We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any solution to its $N$-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in which measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise commutator bounded by $O(\ell^2/\sqrt{N})$ in operator norm, where $\ell$ is the number of possible answers per prover. Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of $\MIP^*$, called $\MIP_\delta^*$, in which the soundness property is required to hold as long as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at most $\delta$. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound $\MIP_\delta^* \subseteq \DTIME(\exp(\exp(\poly)/\delta^2))$. In terms of lower bounds we establish that $\MIP^*_{2^{-\poly}}$, with completeness $1$ and soundness $1-2^{-\poly}$, contains $\NEXP$. The relationship of $\MIP_\delta^*$ to $\MIPstar$ has connections with the mathematical literature on approximate commutation. Our rounding scheme gives an elementary proof that the Strong Kirchberg Conjecture implies that $\MIPstar$ is computable. We discuss applications to device-independent cryptography.

abstract: We present quantum algorithms to efficiently perform discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction and classification over an exponentially large input data set. Compared with the best-known classical algorithms, the quantum algorithms show an exponential speedup in both the number of training vectors $M$ and the feature space dimension $N$. We generalize the previous quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] to efficiently implement a Hermitian chain product of $k$ normalized $N\times N$ Hermitian positive-semidefinite matrices with time complexity of $O(\log (N))$. Using this result, we perform linear as well as nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction over $M$ vectors, each in an $N$-dimensional feature space, in time $O(\log (MN)/\epsilon ^{3})$, where $\epsilon $ denotes the tolerance error. We also present a quantum discriminant analysis algorithm for data classification with time complexity $O(\log (MN)/\epsilon ^{3})$.

abstract: Composite quantum systems exhibit non-local correlations. These counter intuitive correlations form a resource for quantum information processing and quantum computation. In our previous work on two qubit maximally entangled mixed states, we observed that entangled states, states that can be used for quantum teleportaion, states that violate Bell-CHSH inequality and states that do not admit local hidden variable description is the hierarchy in terms of the order of nonlocal correlations. In order to establish this hierarchy, in the present work, we investigate the effect of noise on two quibt states that exhibit higher order nonlocal correlations. We find that dilapidation of nonlocal correlations in the presence of noise follow the same hierarchy, that is, higher order nonlocal correlation disappears for small strength of noise, where as lower order nonlocal correlations survive strong noisy environment. We show the results for decoherence due to amplitude damping channel on various quantum states. However, we observe that same hierarchy is followed by states undergoing decoherence due to phase damping as well as depolarizing channels.

abstract: Continuous-time quantum error correction is a technique for protecting quantum information against decoherence, where both the decoherence and error correction processes are considered continuous in time. Given any [[$n,k,d$]] quantum stabilizer code, we formulate a class of protocols to implement CTQEC, involving weak coherent measurements and weak unitary corrections. Under this formalism, we show that the minimal required size of the ancillary system is $n-k+1$ qubits, and we propose one scheme that meets this minimal requirement. Furthermore, we compare our method with other known schemes, and show that a particular measure of performance described in this paper is better when using our method.

abstract: Nearly thirty years ago the possibility of anomalous weak amplfication (AWA) was revealed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman [1]. Recently two papers presents two AWA schemes which are beyond the traditional proposal given by them [14, 15]. At the first glance the two papers seems very different. Ref. [14] discusses the thermal light cross-Kerr effect and finds only postselection can give the amplification effect without interference of the postselected meter states, and Ref. [15] shows that only weak interaction itself can give the amplification effect without postselection. Here the relationships between the two papers are pointed out and a generalized framework for AWA via postselecting a pair of orthogonal final states is shown.

abstract: Two major challenges in the development of optomechanical devices are achieving a low mechanical and optical loss rate and vibration isolation from the environment. We address both issues by fabricating novel trampoline resonators made from low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si$_3$N$_4$ with a distributed bragg reflector (DBR) mirror. We construct a nested double resonator structure that generates approximately 80 dB of mechanical isolation from the mounting surface, eliminating the strong mounting dependence of the quality factor observed with single resonators. With the consistency provided by this isolation scheme we reliably fabricate devices with mechanical quality factors of around 400,000 at room temperature. In addition these devices were used to form optical cavities with finesse up to 181,000 $\pm$ 1,000. These promising parameters will enable experiments in the quantum regime with macroscopic mechanical resonators.

This is how it has been implemented in all recent Bell experiment addressing this loophole. I point out in this note that quantum random number generators are unnecessary for such experiments and that a Bell experiment with a pseudo-random (but otherwise completely deterministic) mechanism for selecting the measurement settings, such as taking a hash function of the latest million tweets with the hashtag #quantum, would be as convincing, or even more, than one using quantum random number generators.

abstract: Recently, a new type of quantum key distribution, called the round-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol [Nature 509, 475 (2014)], was proposed, where the security can be guaranteed without monitoring any statistics. In this Letter, we investigate source imperfections and side-channel attacks on the source of this protocol. We show that only three assumptions are needed for the security, and no detailed characterizations of the source or the side-channel attacks are needed. This high robustness is another striking advantage of the RRDPS protocol over other protocols.

abstract: The electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities for a relativistic electron gas are calculated from quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature and density as functions of temperature, chemical potential, frequency, and wavevector. The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both electric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and zero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical potential-dependent medium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend on three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the Lindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit, we obtain: i) for $\omega=0$, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known nonrelativistic limits; ii) for $\omega \neq 0$, Drude-type responses at zero and at high temperatures. The latter implies that one may have both $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials. This unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron plasma is one of nature's candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction system. Moreover, Maxwell's equations in the medium yield the dispersion relation and the index of refraction of the electron plasma. Present results should be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations, synchrotrons, and other environments with fast moving electrons.

abstract: We develop a framework for resource efficient compilation of higher-level programs into lower-level reversible circuits. Our main focus is on optimizing the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first, wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to "garbage collection" for reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed. We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions, reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method, REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to compile the reversible networks.

abstract: Quantum teleportation is an essential quantum operation by which we can transfer an unknown quantum state to a remote location with the help of quantum entanglement and classical communication. Since the first experimental demonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous variables, the distance of photonic quantum teleportation over free space channels has continued to increase and has reached >100 km. On the other hand, quantum teleportation over optical fiber has been challenging, mainly because the multi-fold photon detection that inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has been very inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of typical telecom-band single photon detectors. Here, we report efficient quantum teleportation over optical fiber using four high-detection efficiency superconducting nanowire superconducting single-photon detectors (SNSPD) based on MoSi. These SNSPDs make it possible to perform highly-efficient multi-fold photon measurements, allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input photons were successfully teleported over 100 km of fiber.

We show that this regime is fully compatible with a semi-classical treatment, and we derive master equations for the emitter and the resonator. Our framework allows studying a situation recently observable experimentally, where the emitter behaves as a finite size reservoir whose dynamics is strongly influenced by the mechanical evolution. The emitter induced fluctuations of the mechanical quadratures feature a random walk in phase space.

abstract: We find dynamical invariants for open quantum systems described by the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation. In stark contrast to closed systems where the dynamical invariant can be identical to the system density operator, these dynamical invariants no longer share the equation of motion for the density operator. Moreover, the invariants obtained with from bi-orthonormal basis can be used to render an exact solution to the QSD equation and the corresponding non-Markovian dynamics without using master equations or numerical simulations. Significantly we show that we can apply these dynamic invariants to reverse-engineering a Hamiltonian that is capable of driving the system to the target state, providing a novel way to design control strategy for open quantum systems.

abstract: Recently with the rapid development of technology, there are a lot of applications require to achieve low-cost learning in order to accomplish inexpensive computation. However the known computational power of classical artificial neural networks (CANN), they are not capable to provide low-cost learning due to many reasons such as linearity, complexity of architecture, etc. In contrast, quantum neural networks (QNN) may be representing a good computational alternate to CANN, based on the computational power of quantum bit (qubit) over the classical bit. In this paper, a new algorithm of quantum perceptron neural network based only on one neuron is introduced to overcome some limitations of the classical perceptron neural networks. The proposed algorithm is capable to construct its own set of activation operators that enough to accomplish the learning process in a limited number of iterations and, consequently, reduces the cost of computation. For evaluation purpose, we utilize the proposed algorithm to solve five problems using real and artificial data. It is shown throughout the paper that promising results are provided and compared favorably with other reported algorithms

abstract: The well-known Horodecki criterion asserts that a state $\rho$ on $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$ is entangled if and only if there exists a positive map $\Phi : \mathsf{M}_d \to \mathsf{M}_d$ such that the operator $(\Phi \otimes \mathsf{I})(\rho)$ is not positive semi-definite. We show that that the number of such maps needed to detect all the robustly entangled states (i.e., states $\rho$ which remain entangled even in the presence of substantial randomizing noise) exceeds $\exp(c d^3 / \log d)$. The proof is based on a study of the approximability of the set of states (resp. of separable states) by polytopes with few vertices or with few faces, and ultimately relies on the Dvoretzky--Milman theorem about the dimension of almost spherical sections of convex bodies. The result can be interpreted as a geometrical manifestation of the complexity of entanglement detection.

abstract: Entanglement drives nearly all proposed quantum information technologies. The suppression of the uncertainty in joint quadrature measurements below the level of vacuum fluctuations is a signature of non-classical correlations. Entangling frequency modes of optical fields has attracted increased attention in recent years, as a quantum network would rely on interfacing light at telecommunication wavelengths with matter-based quantum memories that are addressable at visible wavelengths. By up-converting part of a 1550 nm squeezed vacuum state to 532 nm, we demonstrate the generation and complete characterization of strong continuous-variable entanglement between widely separated frequencies. Non-classical correlations were observed in joint quadrature measurements of the 1550 nm and 532 nm fields, showing a maximum noise suppression 5.5 dB below vacuum. A spectrum was measured to demonstrate over 3 dB noise suppression up to 20 MHzmeasurement frequency. Our versatile technique combines strong non-classical correlations, large bandwidth and, in principle, the ability to entangle the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm with any optical wavelength, making this approach highly relevant to emerging proposals for quantum communication and computing.

We also consider implementation of procedures consisting black box operations and present a method to include them into the circuit with use of additional Hadamard gates. We will show that the cost of implementing $k$-qubit gate in terms of the number of entangling gates needed is $O(4^k)$. An example of such transformation is presented.

abstract: The interplay between open quantum systems and structured environments has recently been the subject of intense research. We explore the extent to which strong coupling to a single bosonic mode can alter the coherence properties of a two level system in a structured environment. This mode is treated exactly, with the rest of the environment comprising a Markovian bath of bosonic modes. The strength of the coupling between the two level system and the single mode is varied for a variety of different forms for the bath spectral density in order to assess whether the coherent dynamics of the two level system are modified. We find a clear renormalisation of the site population oscillation frequency that causes an altered interaction with the bath. This leads to enhanced or reduced coherent behaviour of the two level system depending on the form of the spectral density function. We present an intuitive interpretation, based on an analytical model, to explain the behaviour.

abstract: Temporal steering and violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality are two different ways of probing the violation of macro-realistic assumptions in quantum mechanics. It is shown here that under unitary evolution and projective measurements the two types of temporal correlations lead to similar results. However, their inequivalence is exhibited by formulating a task of secure key generation with different levels of trust on the devices. We further demonstrate the hierarchy between them by employing either generalized measurements, or noisy evolution.

abstract: We demonstrate and evaluate an on-demand source of single itinerant microwave photons. Photons are generated using a highly coherent, fixed-frequency qubit-cavity system, and a protocol where the microwave control field is far detuned from the photon emission frequency. By using a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), we perform efficient single-quadrature detection of the state emerging from the cavity. We characterize the imperfections of the photon generation and detection, including detection inefficiency and state infidelity caused by measurement backaction over a range of JPA gains from 17 to 33 dB. We observe that both detection efficiency and undesirable backaction increase with JPA gain. We find that the density matrix has its maximum single photon component $\rho_{11} = 0.36 \pm 0.01$ at 29 dB JPA gain. At this gain, backaction of the JPA creates cavity photon number fluctuations that we model as a thermal distribution with an average photon number $\bar{n} = 0.041 \pm 0.003$.

Oscillatory mode of PDNR is created in the process of a degenerate down-conversion of photons under interaction with a train of external Gaussian pulses. We calculate the Wigner functions of cavity mode showing two-fold symmetry in phase space and analyse formation of phase-locked states in the regular as well as the quantum chaotic regime.

abstract: The time-dynamics of quantum correlations in the quantum transverse anisotropic XY spin chain of infinite length is studied at zero as well as finite temperatures. The evolution occurs due to the instantaneous quenching of the coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is either performed within the same phase or across the quantum phase transition point connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the time-evolved quantum correlations, entanglement and quantum discord, which exhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching scheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced bipartite quantum correlations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from ordered to the deep disordered phase. However, bipartite quantum correlations are almost washed out when the system is quenched from disordered to the ordered phase with the initial state being at the zero-temperature. Moreover, we identify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations when the system is quenched within the same phase. Finally, we investigate the bipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation on the phenomena observed at zero-temperature.

abstract: The effects of bath coupling on an interacting two-particle quantum system are studied using tools from information theory. Shannon entropies of the one (reduced) and two-particle distribution functions in position, momentum and separable phase-space are examined. Results show that the presence of the bath leads to a delocalization of the distribution functions in position space, and a localization in momentum space. This can be interpreted as a loss of information in position space and a gain of information in momentum space. The entropy sum of the system, in the presence of a bath, is shown to be dependent on the strength of the interparticle potential and also on the strength of the coupling to the bath. The statistical correlation between the particles, and its dependence on the bath and interparticle potential, is examined using mutual information. A stronger repulsive potential between particles, in the presence of the bath, yields a smaller correlation between the particles positions, and a larger one between their momenta.

Furthermore, the total phase factor is in an elegent form, which is just identical to one term of product of two squeezed operators. In addition, when this system undergoes cyclic evolutions, the corresponding geometric phase is obtained, which is just the sum of the counterparts of two isolated one-mode squeezed state. Finally, the relationship between the cyclic geomtric phase and entanglement of two-mode squeezed state is established.

The large size of the resonator allows high magnetic field sensitivity to be achieved in the hertz to kilohertz frequency range. A peak sensitivity of 131 pT per root Hz is reported, in a magnetically unshielded non-cryogenic environment and using optical power levels beneath 100 microWatt. Femtotesla range sensitivity may be possible in future devices with further optimization of laser noise and the physical structure of the resonator, allowing applications in high-performance magnetometry.

abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for solving the following problem: given the Hamiltonian of a physical system and one of its eigenvalues, how to obtain the corresponding eigenstate? The algorithm is based on the resonance phenomena. For a probe qubit coupled to a quantum system, the system exhibits a resonance dynamics when the frequency of the probe qubit matches a transition frequency in the system. Therefore the system can be guided to evolve to the eigenstate with known eigenvalue by inducing resonance between the probe qubit and a designed transition in the system. This algorithm can also be used to obtain the energy spectrum of a physical system and can achieve even a quadratic speedup over the phase estimation algorithm.

We present a family of exactly solvable, two-dimensional, $\mathcal{PT}$ potentials for a non-relativistic particle confined in a circular geometry. We show that the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry threshold can be tuned by introducing a second gain-loss potential or its hermitian counterpart. Our results explicitly demonstrate that $\mathcal{PT}$ breaking in two dimensions has a rich phase diagram, with multiple re-entrant $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric phases.

abstract: We consider the optical generation and verification of entanglement in atomic ensembles under non-uniform interaction between the ensemble and an optical mode. We show that for a wide range of parameters a system of non-uniformly coupled atomic spins can be described as an ensemble of uniformly coupled spins with a reduced effective atom-light coupling and a reduced effective atom number, with a reduction factor of order unity given by the ensemble-mode geometry. This description is valid even for complex entangled states with arbitrary phase-space distribution functions as long as the detection does not resolve single spins. Furthermore, we derive an analytic formula for the observable entanglement in the case, of relevance in practice, where the ensemble-mode coupling differs between state generation and measurement.

abstract: How can relevant information be extracted from a quantum process? In many situations, only some part of the total information content produced by an information source is useful. Can one then find an efficient encoding, in the sense of retaining the largest fraction of relevant information? This paper offers one possible solution by giving a generalization of a classical method designed to retain as much relevant information as possible in a lossy data compression. A key feature of the method is to introduce a second information source to define relevance. We quantify the advantage a quantum encoding has over the best classical encoding in general, and we demonstrate using examples that a substantial quantum advantage is possible. A main result, however, is that if the relevant information is purely classical, then a classical encoding is optimal.

abstract: The dynamical invariant, whose expectation value is constant, is generalized to open quantum system. The evolution equation of dynamical invariant (the dynamical invariant condition) is presented for Markovian dynamics. Different with the dynamical invariant for the closed quantum system, the evolution of the dynamical invariant for the open quantum system is no longer unitary, and the eigenvalues of it are time-dependent. Since any hermitian operator fulfilling dynamical invariant condition is a dynamical invariant, we propose a sort of special dynamical invariant (decoherence free dynamical invariant) in which a part of eigenvalues are still constant. The dynamical invariant in the subspace spanned by the corresponding eigenstates evolves unitarily. Via the dynamical invariant condition, the results demonstrate that this dynamical invariant exists under the circumstances of emergence of decoherence free subspaces.

We study the convex set properties of dimension-altering quantum channels, and particularly the channel decomposition problem in terms of convex sum of extreme channels. We provide various quantum circuit representations of extreme and generalized extreme channels, which can be employed in an optimization to approximately decompose an arbitrary channel. Numerical simulations of low-dimensional channels are performed to demonstrate our channel decomposition scheme.

abstract: Vaidman pointed out the importance of modular values, and related the modular value of a Pauli spin operator to its weak value for specific coupling strengths [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 230401 (2010)]. It would be useful if this relationship is generalized since a modular value, which assumes a finite strength of the measurement interaction, is sometimes more practical than a weak value, which assumes an infinitesimally small interaction. In this paper, we give a general expression that relates the weak value and the modular value of an arbitrary observable in the 2-dimensional Hilbert space for an arbitrary coupling strength. Using this expression, we show the "failure of sum rule" for modular values, which has a resemblance to the "failure of product rule" for weak values. We give examples of "failure of sum rule" for some interesting cases, i.e., paradoxes based on nonlocality, which include EPR paradox, Hardy's paradox, and Cheshire cat experiment.

abstract: In the Hong--Ou--Mandel interferometric scheme, two identical photons that illuminate a balanced beam splitter always leave through the same exit port. Similar effects have been predicted and (partially) experimentally confirmed for multi-photon Fock-number states. In the limit of large photon numbers, the output distribution follows a $(1-x^2)^{-1/2}$ law, where $x$ is the normalized imbalance in the output photon numbers at the two output ports. We derive an analytical formula that is also valid for imbalanced input photon numbers with a large total number of photons, and focus on the extent to which the hypothesis of perfect balanced input can be relaxed, discussing the robustness and universal features of the output distribution.

We present a quantum speed limit governing the generation of nonclassicality and the mutual incompatibility of two states connected by time evolution. This result is used to characterize the timescale in which quantumness can emerge under arbitrary physical processes. The bound is shown to be tight under pure dephasing. More generally, our analysis reveals the dependence on the initial state and non-Markovian effects.

abstract: Non-destructive detection of photonic qubits is an enabling technology for quantum information processing and quantum communication. For practical applications such as quantum repeaters and networks, it is desirable to implement such detection in a way that allows some form of multiplexing as well as easy integration with other components such as solid-state quantum memories. Here we propose an approach to non-destructive photonic qubit detection that promises to have all the mentioned features. Mediated by an impurity-doped crystal, a signal photon in an arbitrary time-bin qubit state modulates the phase of an intense probe pulse that is stored during the interaction. Using a thulium-doped waveguide in LiNbO$_3$, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment with macroscopic signal pulses, demonstrating the expected cross-phase modulation as well as the ability to preserve the coherence between temporal modes. Our findings open the path to a new key component of quantum photonics based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.

abstract: Inhomogeneous dephasing from uncontrolled environmental noise can limit the coherence of a quantum sensor or qubit. For solid state spin qubits such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, a dominant source of environmental noise is magnetic field fluctuations due to nearby paramagnetic impurities and instabilities in a magnetic bias field. In this work, we use ac stress generated by a diamond mechanical resonator to engineer a dressed spin basis in which a single NV center qubit is less sensitive to its magnetic environment. For a qubit in the thermally isolated subspace of this protected basis, we prolong the dephasing time $T_2^*$ from $2.7\pm0.1$ $\mu$s to $15\pm1$ $\mu$s by dressing with a $\Omega=581\pm2$ kHz mechanical Rabi field. Furthermore, we develop a model that quantitatively predicts the relationship between $\Omega$ and $T_2^*$ in the dressed basis. Our model suggests that a combination of magnetic field fluctuations and hyperfine coupling to nearby nuclear spins limits the protected coherence time over the range of $\Omega$ accessed here. We show that amplitude noise in $\Omega$ will dominate the dephasing for larger driving fields.

abstract: Quantum repeaters rely on an interfacing of flying qubits with quantum memories. The most common implementations include a narrowband single photon matched in bandwidth and central frequency to an atomic system. Previously, we demonstrated the compatibility of our versatile source of heralded single photons, which is based on parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator, with alkaline transitions [Schunk et al., Optica 2, 773 (2015)]. In this paper, we analyze our source in terms of phase matching, available wavelength-tuning mechanisms, and applications to narrow-band atomic systems. We resonantly address the D1 transitions of cesium and rubidium with this optical parametric oscillator pumped above its oscillation threshold. Below threshold, the efficient coupling of single photons to atomic transitions heralded by single telecom-band photons is demonstrated. Finally, we present an accurate analytical description of our observations. Providing the demonstrated flexibility in connecting various atomic transitions with telecom wavelengths, we show a promising approach to realize an essential building block for quantum repeaters.

abstract: Imperfections in experimental measurement schemes can lead to falsely identifying, or over estimating, entanglement in a quantum system. A recent solution to this is to define schemes that are robust to measurement imperfections - measurement device independent entanglement witness (MDI-EW). Here we introduce a novel approach for MDI-EW, which significantly reduces the experimental complexity and is applicable to a wide range of physical systems. The scheme requires no prior description of the state, is detection loop-hole free, robust to classical communication, and works for all entangled qubit states. We focus on photonic entanglement, experimentally generating and testing bipartite Werner states, varying the entanglement from the maximally entangled Bell state, past the bound for nonlocal states and down to the separable bound of 1/3. We witness entanglement down to an entangled state fraction close to 0.4. These results could be of particular interest for device independent quantum random number generation.

abstract: A quantum system subjected to a strong continuous monitoring undergoes quantum jumps. This very well known fact hides a neglected subtlety: sharp scale-invariant fluctuations invariably decorate the jump process even in the limit where the measurement rate is very large. This article is devoted to the quantitative study of these remaining fluctuations, which we call spikes, and to a discussion of their physical status. We start by introducing a classical model where the origin of these fluctuations is more intuitive and then jump to the quantum realm where their existence is less intuitive. We compute the exact distribution of the spikes for a continuously monitored qubit. We conclude by discussing their physical and operational relevance.

Such a modification is expected from a fundamentally semi-classical theory of gravity, and can therefore be considered a test case for the necessity of the quantisation of the gravitational field. Here we provide a thorough study of the effects of the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation for a micron-sized sphere trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential. We discuss both the effect on the energy eigenstates and the dynamical behaviour of squeezed states, covering the experimentally relevant parameter regimes.

abstract: Many physical implementations of qubits---including ion traps, optical lattices and linear optics---suffer from loss. A nonzero probability of irretrievably losing a qubit can be a substantial obstacle to fault-tolerant methods of processing quantum information, requiring new techniques to safeguard against loss that introduce an additional overhead that depends upon the loss rate. Here we present a scalable and platform-independent protocol for estimating the average loss rate (averaged over all input states) resulting from an arbitrary Markovian noise process, as well as an independent estimate of detector efficiency. Moreover, we show that our protocol gives an additional constraint on estimated parameters from randomized benchmarking that improves the reliability of the estimated error rate and provides a new indicator for non-Markovian signatures in the experimental data. We also derive a bound for the state-dependent loss rate in terms of the average loss rate.

abstract: The motion of a particle in the potential well is studied when the particle is attached to the infinite elastic string. This is generic with the problem of dissipative quantum mechanics investigated by Caldeira and Leggett. Besides the dissipative motion there is another scenario of interaction of the string with the particle attached. Stationary particle-string states exist with string deformations accompanying the particle. This is like polaronic states in solids. Our polaronic states in the well are non-decaying and with continuous energy spectrum. Perhaps these states have a link to quantum electrodynamics. Quantum mechanical wave function, singular on some line, is smeared out by electron "vibrations" due to the interaction with photons. In those anomalous states the smeared singularity position would be analogous to the place where the particle is attached to the string.

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for communication between distant parties with security guaranteed by quantum theory. The main theoretical problem in QKD is to calculate the secret key rate for a given protocol. Analytical formulas for the key rate are known for protocols that have a high degree of symmetry, such as the BB84 and six-state protocols. However, experimental imperfections tend to break symmetries. Since symmetry is exploited in theoretical treatments, the effect of experimental imperfections on key rates is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, it is an interesting question whether (intentionally) asymmetric protocols could offer an advantage over their symmetric counterparts. In this work, we develop a robust numerical approach for calculating the key rate for arbitrary discrete-variable QKD protocols. Ultimately this approach will allow researchers to investigate the security of ``unstructured'' protocols, i.e., those that lack symmetry. Our approach relies on transforming the key rate calculation to the dual optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently with significantly fewer parameters than the primal problem, and gives reliable lower bounds on the key rate. We illustrate our method by giving tight lower bounds for some unstructured protocols for which the key rate was previously unknown.

abstract: Recent works in foundations of quantum (field) theory and relativistic quantum information try to better grasp the interplay between the structure of quantum correlations and the constraints imposed by causality on physical operations. Chapter 1 is dedicated to the study of the conceptual implications of quantum nonlocality, a concept that subsumes that of entanglement in a certain way. We detail the recent information-theoretic approaches to understanding the structure of nonlocal correlations, and the issues the latter raise concerning the ability of local observers to isolate a system from its environment. Chapter 2 reviews in what sense imposing Poincare invariance affects entanglement detection and quantification procedures. This invariance ultimately forces a description of all quantum systems within the framework of quantum field theory, which leads to the impossibility of localized finite-energy states and to the divergence of all entanglement measures for local observers. We provide a solution to these two problems by showing that there exists a generic equivalence between a finite spatial resolution of the measurement apparatus and the exclusion of high-energy degrees of freedom from the definition of the observed system. This equivalence allows for an epistemic interpretation of the standard quantum formalism describing nonrelativistic localized systems and their correlations, hence a clarification of the origin of the finite measures of entanglement between such systems. Chapter 3 presents a recent theoretical framework that predicts the existence of correlations with indefinite causal order. In analogy to the information-theoretic approaches to nonlocal correlations, we introduce some principles that constrain the structure of such correlations, which is a first step toward a clear understanding of their physical origin.

abstract: It is argued that quantum and relativistic correlations can be described in a unified way, in that both assume free will as an axiom, and happen without any continuous connection in space-time. This description may contribute to a coherent definition of "space-time quantization" and highlights the importance of solving the "measurement problem".

abstract: We establish a generic method to analyze the time evolution of open quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on a variational integration of the quantum master equation describing the dynamics and naturally connects to a variational principle for its nonequilibrium steady state. We successfully apply our variational method to study dissipative Rydberg gases, finding excellent quantitative agreement with small-scale simulations of the full quantum master equation. We observe that correlations related to non-Markovian behavior play a significant role during the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state. We further quantify this non-Markovianity and find it to be closely connected to an information-theoretical measure of quantum and classical correlations.

abstract: Quantum Computation and Quantum Information are continuously growing research areas which are based on nature and resources of quantum mechanics, as superposition and entanglement. In its gate array version, the use of convenient and appropriate gates is essential. But while those proposed gates adopt convenient forms for computational algorithms, in the practice, their design depends on specific quantum systems and stuff being used. Gates design is restricted to properties and limitations of interactions and physical elements being involved, where Quantum Control plays a deep role. Quantum complexity of multipartite systems and their interactions requires a tight control to manipulate their quantum states, either local and non-local ones, but still a reducibility procedure should be addressed. This work shows how a general $2d$-partite two level spin system in $SU(2d)$ could be decomposed in $2^{n-1}$ subsystems on $SU(2)$, letting establish control operations. In particular, it is shown that Bell gems basis is a set of natural states on which decomposition happen naturally under some interaction restrictions. Thus, alternating the direction of local interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, this procedure states a universal exchange semantics on those basis. The structure developed could be understood as a splitting of the $2d$ information channels into $2^{2d-1}$ pairs of $2$ level information subsystems.

abstract: The qubit depolarizing channel with noise parameter $\eta$ transmits an input qubit perfectly with probability $1-\eta$, and outputs the completely mixed state with probability $\eta$. We show that its complementary channel has positive quantum capacity for all $\eta>0$. Thus, we find that there exists a single parameter family of channels having the peculiar property of having positive quantum capacity even when the outputs of these channels approach a fixed state independent of the input. Comparisons with other related channels, and implications on the difficulty of studying the quantum capacity of the depolarizing channel are discussed.

abstract: We explicitly establish a unitary correspondence between spherical irreducible tensor operators and cartesian tensor operators of any rank. That unitary relation is implemented by means of a basis of integer-spin wave functions that constitute simultaneously a basis of the spaces of cartesian and spherical irreducible tensors. As a consequence, we extend the Wigner--Eckart theorem to cartesian irreducible tensor operators of any rank, and to totally symmetric reducible ones. We also discuss the tensorial structure of several standard spherical irreducible tensors such as ordinary, bipolar and tensor spherical harmonics, spin-polarization operators and multipole operators. As an application, we obtain an explicit expression for the derivatives of any order of spherical harmonics in terms of tensor spherical harmonics.

abstract: Recent progress in quantum information has led to the start of several large national and industrial efforts to build a quantum computer. Researchers are now working to overcome many scientific and technological challenges. The program's biggest obstacle, a potential showstopper for the entire effort, is the need for high-fidelity qubit operations in a scalable architecture. This challenge arises from the fundamental fragility of quantum information, which can only be overcome with quantum error correction. In a fault-tolerant quantum computer the qubits and their logic interactions must have errors below a threshold: scaling up with more and more qubits then brings the net error probability down to appropriate levels ~ $10^{-18}$ needed for running complex algorithms. Reducing error requires solving problems in physics, control, materials and fabrication, which differ for every implementation. I explain here the common key driver for continued improvement - the metrology of qubit errors.

abstract: Bosonic quantum conversion systems can be modeled by many-particle single-mode Hamiltonians describing a conversion of $n$ $m$-atomic molecules into $m$ $n$-atomic ones. These Hamiltonians are analyzed in terms of generators of a polynomially deformed $su(2)$ algebra. In the mean-field limit of large particle numbers, the system is classical and its Hamiltonian dynamics can again be described by a polynomial deformation of a Lie algebra, where quantum commutators are replaced by Poisson brackets. The Casimir operator restricts the motion to Kummer shapes, deformed Bloch spheres with cusp singularities depending on $m$ and $n$. The many-particle state densities can be semiclassically approximated by the time-periods of periodic orbits, which show characteristic steps and singularities related to the fixed points, whose bifurcation properties are analyzed.

abstract: By using a fully quantum approach based on an input-output formulation of the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation, we show rectification of radiation fields in a one-dimensional waveguide doped with a pair of ideal two-level systems for three topical cases: unidirectional driving, bidirectional driving, and single photon pulsed excitation. We show that even under extenuating circumstances of bidirectional pump the device still operates effectively as an optical isolator, which is of critical importance for noise resistance. Finally, harnessing stimulated emission allows for non-reciprocal behavior for single photon inputs, thus showing purely quantum rectification at the single-photon level. The latter is a considerable step towards the ultimate goal of devising an unconditional quantum rectifier for arbitrary quantum states.

abstract: Bloch oscillations (BOs), i.e. the oscillatory motion of a quantum particle in a periodic potential, are one of the most striking effects of coherent quantum transport in the matter. In the semiclassical picture, it is well known that BOs can be explained owing to the periodic band structure of the crystal and the so-called 'acceleration' theorem: since in the momentum space the particle wave packet drifts with a constant speed without being distorted, in real space the probability distribution of the particle undergoes a periodic motion following a trajectory which exactly reproduces the shape of the lattice band. In non-Hermitian lattices with a complex (i.e. not real) energy band, extension of the semiclassical model is not intuitive. Here we show that the acceleration theorem holds for non-Hermitian lattices with a complex energy band only {\it on average}, and that the periodic wave packet motion of the particle in the real space is described by a trajectory in {\it complex} plane, i.e. it generally corresponds to reshaping and breathing of the wave packet in addition to a transverse oscillatory motion. The concept of BOs involving complex trajectories is exemplified by considering two examples of non-Hermitian lattices with a complex band dispersion relation, including the Hatano-Nelson tight-binding Hamiltonian describing the hopping motion of a quantum particle on a linear lattice with an imaginary vector potential and a tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping rates.

abstract: Studies of atomic systems in electric fields are challenging because of the diverging perturbation series. However, physically meaningful Stark shifts and ionization rates can be found by analytical continuation of the series using appropriate branch cut functions. We apply this approach to low-dimensional hydrogen atoms in order to study the effects of reduced dimensionality. We find that modifications by the electric field are strongly suppressed in reduced dimensions. This finding is explained from a Landau-type analysis of the ionization process.

abstract: Quantum computation and simulation with a complete graph of superconducting qubits has been proposed [PRA 91, 062309 (2015)]. The method does not require error correction and is practical now. By controlling the vertices (qubits) and edges (couplers) appropriately, and working in the single-excitation subspace (SES), a real but otherwise arbitrary nxn Hamiltonian can be directly programmed into the chip. The SES method, however, requires a physical qubit for every basis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costs for algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla doubles the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by leaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in the computational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES register holding "data" with one or more ancilla qubits, which are able to independently control arbitrary nxn unitary operations on the data in a constant number of steps. This enables a hybrid form of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the data, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas, and controlled-unitaries act between. As an application we give an ancilla-assisted SES implementation of the quantum linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, and estimate that reasonably accurate symmetric matrix inversions up to dimension 10 would be possible before running out of coherence time.

abstract: In this paper, we discuss the parametric symmetries in different exactly solvable systems characterized by real or complex P T symmetric potentials. We focus our at- tention on the conventional potentials such as the generalized Poschl Teller (GPT), o Scarf-I and P T symmetric Scarf-II which are invariant under certain parametric transformations. The resulting set of potentials are shown to yield a completely dif- ferent behavior of the bound state solutions. Further the supersymmetric (SUSY) partner potentials acquire different forms under such parametric transformations leading to new sets of exactly solvable real and P T symmetric complex potentials. These potentials are also observed to be shape invariant (SI) in nature. We subse- quently take up a study of the newly discovered rationally extended SI Potentials, corresponding to the above mentioned conventional potentials, whose bound state solutions are associated with the exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOPs). We discuss the transformations of the corresponding Casimir operator employing the properties of the so(2,1) algebra.

abstract: Open Quantum Walks (OQWs) are exclusively driven by dissipation and are formulated as completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) maps on underlying graphs. The microscopic derivation of discrete and continuous in time OQWs is presented. It is assumed that connected nodes are weakly interacting via a common bath. The resulting reduced master equation of the quantum walker on the lattice is in the generalised master equation form. The time discretisation of the generalised master equation leads to the OQWs formalism. The explicit form of the transition operators establishes a connection between dynamical properties of the OQWs and thermodynamical characteristics of the environment. The derivation is demonstrated for the examples of the OQW on a circle of nodes and on a finite chain of nodes. For both examples a transition between diffusive and ballistic quantum trajectories is observed and found to be related to the temperature of the bath.

It contains self-gravitational terms, which slightly modify the quantum dynamics. Here we show that it distorts the spectrum of a harmonic system. Based on this effect, we propose an optomechanical experiment with a trapped microdisc to test the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, and we show that it can be realized with existing technology.

abstract: Tomography of a quantum-state is usually based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM) and on their experimental statistics. Among the available reconstructions, the maximum-likelihood (MaxLike) technique is an efficient one. We propose an extension of this technique when the measurement process cannot be simply described by POVM. Here, the tomography relies on a set of quantum trajectories and their measurement records. It includes the fact that, in practice, each measurement could be corrupted by imperfections and decoherence, and could also be associated with the record of continuous-time signals over a finite amount of time. The proposed extension relies on an explicit expression of the likelihood function via the effective matrices appearing in quantum smoothing and solutions of the adjoint quantum filter. It also provides, aside the MaxLike estimate of the quantum state, confidence intervals for any observable. Such confidence intervals are derived, as the MaxLike estimate, from an asymptotic expansion of multi-dimensional Laplace integrals appearing in Bayesian Mean estimation. A validation is performed on two sets of experimental data: photon(s) trapped in a microwave cavity subject to quantum non-demolition measurements relying on Rydberg atoms; heterodyne fluorescence measurements of a superconducting qubit.

abstract: Measurement scenarios containing events with relations of exclusivity represented by pentagons, heptagons, nonagons, etc., or their complements are the only ones in which quantum probabilities cannot be described classically. Interestingly, quantum theory predicts that the maximum values for any of these graphs cannot be achieved in Bell inequality scenarios. With the exception of the pentagon, this prediction remained experimentally unexplored. Here we test the quantum maxima for the heptagon and the complement of the heptagon using three- and five-dimensional quantum states, respectively. In both cases, we adopt two different encodings: linear transverse momentum and orbital angular momentum of single photons. Our results exclude maximally noncontextual hidden-variable theories and are in good agreement with the maxima predicted by quantum theory.

abstract: The interaction of optical fields sculpted on the nano-scale with matter may not be described by the dipole approximation since the fields vary appreciably across the molecular length scale. Rather than incrementally adding higher multipoles it is advantageous and more physically transparent to describe the optical process using non-local response functions that intrinsically include all multipoles. We present a semi-classical approach to the non-linear response functions based on the minimal coupling Hamiltonian. The first, second and third order non-local response functions are expressed in terms of correlation functions of the charge and the current densities. This approach is based on the gauge invariant current rather than the polarization, and on the vector potential rather than the electric and magnetic fields.

abstract: The fully symmetric Gaussian tripartite entangled pure states will not exhibit two-mode Einstein Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-steering. This means that any two participants cannot share quantum secrets using the security of one-sided device independent quantum key distribution (1SDI-QKD) without involving the third. They are restricted at most to standard quantum key distribution (S-QKD), which is less secure. Here we show that least some asymmetric tripartite systems can exhibit bipartite EPR-steering, so that two of the participants can use 1SDI-QKD without involving the other. This is possible because the promiscuity relations of continuous-variable tripartite entanglement are different from those of discrete-variable systems. We analyse these properties for two different systems, showing that the asymmetric system has an extra degree of flexibility not found in the symmetric one.

abstract: A quantum time crystal (QTC) is a novel quantum mechanical ground state that was recently proposed by Wilczek. Although many QTC models have been proposed, it is not clear yet if such states are possible. We propose the idea that an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) forms a quantum space crystal (QSC), which is an extension of a QTC in the spatial domain. Consequently, a rotating ring-shaped ICDW naturally forms a quantum space-time crystal (QSTC), which combines the two concepts of QTC and QSC. The breaking of space-time translation symmetry is understood using time-dependent density matrices. Furthermore, we show that this model can be observed in real systems such as TaS$_3$ ring crystals at finite temperature. Our results suggest that QTC/QSTC can exist.

We observe pronounced nonreciprocity and asymmetry in the sideband signals generated by the magnon-induced Brillouin scattering of light. The spin-orbit coupled nature of the WGM photons, their geometric birefringence and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the magnon dynamics impose the angular-momentum selection rules in the scattering process and account for the observed phenomena. The unique features of the system may find interesting applications at the crossroad between quantum optics and spintronics.

abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the biphoton state from the cascade emissions of cold atomic ensembles, which composes of a telecommunication photon (signal) followed by an infrared one (idler) via four-wave mixing.\ With adiabatic conditions for Gaussian driving pulses of width $\tau$, the spectrum of the biphoton state has the form of a Gaussian that conserves signal and idler photon energies within $\hbar/\tau$ modulated by a Lorentzian with a superradiant linewidth.\ Multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency-shifted cascade emissions, we may manipulate and shape the spectrum of the biphoton state.\ The entropy of entanglement is derived from Schmidt decomposition, which can be larger if we multiplex the atomic ensembles in a way that conserves signal and idler photon central energies.\ The eigenvalues in Schmidt bases are degenerate in pairs for symmetric spectral shaping in which the mode probability densities show interference patterns.\ We also demonstrate the excess entropy of entanglement that comes from continuous frequency space, which scales up the total entropy.\ The scheme of multiplexed cascade-emitted biphoton state provides multimode structures that are useful in long-distance quantum communication and multimode quantum information processing.

The problem is mapped to a decision problem on a quantum computer, a probe qubit is coupled to a register that represents the problem and detects the energy levels of the problem Hamiltonian. The decision problem is solved by determining whether the probe qubit exhibits resonance dynamics. The algorithm shows a quadratic speedup over its classical counterparts, and the degenerate ground state problem in the adiabatic quantum evolution algorithm for this problem is avoided.

abstract: We present a general method to undertake a thorough analysis of the thermodynamics of the quantum jump trajectories followed by an arbitrary quantum harmonic network undergoing linear and bilinear dynamics. The approach is based on the phase-space representation of the state of a harmonic network. The large deviation function associated with this system encodes the full counting statistics of exchange and also allows one to deduce for fluctuation theorems obeyed by the dynamics. We illustrate the method showing the validity of a local fluctuation theorem about the exchange of excitations between a restricted part of the environment (i.e., a local bath) and a harmonic network coupled with different schemes.

abstract: Unidirectional light transport in one-dimensional nanomaterials at the quantum level is a crucial goal to achieve for upcoming computational devices. We here employ a full-quantum mechanical approach based on master equation to describe unidirectional light transport through a pair of two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By comparing with published semi-classical results, we find that the nonlinearity of the system is reduced, thereby reducing also the unidirectional light transport efficiency. Albeit not fully efficient, we find that the considered quantum system can work as a light diode with an efficiency of approximately 60%. Our results may be used in quantum computation with classical and quantized light.

abstract: An external, time-dependent perturbing potential acting upon a quantum system can lead to transitions between its eigenstates which oscillate in time. In this paper we present an approximate analytic solution for the temporal evolution of the system in response to an arbitrary perturbing Hamiltonian that has been decomposed into its Fourier modes. We impose no restriction upon the number of eigenstates of the system nor upon the structure of the perturbing Hamiltonian, the number of Fourier modes, their amplitude or their frequencies. New terms appear in our results indicating new avenues by which the frequencies and amplitudes of the modes may affect the transition probabilities. As an example of the application of our method, we consider the case of a mono-energetic, neutrino self-interaction Hamiltonian with constant coupling. After decomposing the numerical solution for the self-interaction Hamiltonian into its Fourier modes, we demonstrate how the analytic solutions are able to match the amplitude and wavenumber of the numerical results to within a few percent.

Such processes occur within Landauer's framework if they rely on an interaction between the object and a thermal reservoir. Landauer's principle dictates that this must dissipate a minimum quantity of heat, proportional to the entropy reduction that is incurred by the object, to the thermal reservoir. However, this lower bound is only reachable for some specific physical situations, and it is not necessarily achievable for any given reservoir. The main task of our work can be stated as the minimisation of heat dissipation given probabilistic information erasure, i.e., minimising the amount of energy transferred to the thermal reservoir as heat if we require that the probability of preparing the object in a specific pure state $|\varphi_1\rangle$ be no smaller than $p_{\varphi_1}^{\max}-\delta$. Here $p_{\varphi_1}^{\max}$ is the maximum probability of information erasure that is permissible by the physical context, and $\delta\geqslant 0$ the error. To determine the achievable minimal heat dissipation of quantum information erasure within a given physical context, we explicitly optimise over all possible unitary operators that act on the composite system of object and reservoir. Specifically, we characterise the equivalence class of such optimal unitary operators, using tools from majorisation theory, when we are restricted to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we discuss how pure state preparation processes could be achieved with a smaller heat cost than Landauer's limit, by operating outside of Landauer's framework.

abstract: The fact that any physical quantity is defined and measured relative to a reference frame is generally not explicitly reflected in the theoretical description of physical experiments. Instead, the relevant observables are typically represented as "absolute" quantities. Here we investigate the conditions under which, in quantum theory, an account in terms of absolute quantities can provide a good approximation of relative quantities. We find that this requires the reference system to be large in a suitable sense.

abstract: We prove the NLTS (No Low-energy Trivial States) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings. Specifically, we construct an explicit infinite family of 7-local commuting Hamiltonians such that any quantum state that has only locally-generated entanglement has high energy w.r.t. the Hamiltonian, and this energy scales linearly in the number of local terms. From a complexity-theoretic viewpoint, since an existence of a quantum PCP theorem implies NLTS our result may be seen as the first evidence in favor of a quantum PCP. From a purely quantum-mechanical perspective, our result implies for the first time the existence of locally-defined Hamiltonians, albeit with long-range interactions, with the following property of "robust entanglement": applying to the ground-space of the Hamiltonian any error that generates a sufficiently small constant fractional energy cannot destroy its long-range entanglement. This suggests that the apparent fragility of multipartite entanglement is essentially an artifact of considering local Hamiltonian systems which are not only local but spatially local. Our Hamiltonian is based on applying the Tillich-Zemor product code to a classical locally testable code such as the Hadamard code - as in previous work by one of us (Eldar). A key tool in our proof is a new lower bound on the vertex expansion of the output of low-depth quantum circuits.

abstract: We study a generalization of nonlocal games---which we call extended nonlocal games---in which the players, Alice and Bob, initially share a tripartite quantum state with the referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to randomly selected questions. Our study of this class of games was inspired by the monogamy-of-entanglement games introduced by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner, which they also generalize. We prove that a natural extension of the Navascues--Pironio--Acin hierarchy of semidefinite programs converges to the optimal commuting operator value of extended nonlocal games, and we prove two extensions of results of Tomamichel et al. concerning monogamy-of-entanglement games.

abstract: We present a new method to study the semiclassical dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings dimer model, describing two coupled cavities each containing a two-level system (qubit). We develop a Fock space WKB approach in the polariton basis where each site is treated exactly while the intersite polariton hopping is treated semiclassically. We show that the self-trapped states can be viewed as Fock space localized states. We find that this picture yields the correct critical value of interaction strength at which the delocalization-localization transition occurs. Moreover, the validity of our WKB approach is supported by showing that the quantum spectrum can be derived from a set of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions and by confirming that the quantum eigenstates are consistent with the classical orbital motion in the polariton band picture. The underlying idea of our method is quite general and can be applied to other interacting spin-boson models.

abstract: It is commonly claimed in the recent literature that certain solutions to wave equations of positive energy of Dirac-type with internal variables are characterized by a non-thermal spectrum. As part of that statement, it was said that the transformations and symmetries involved in equations of such type correspond to a particular representation of the Lorentz group. In this paper we give the general solution to this problem emphasizing the interplay between the group structure, the corresponding algebra and the physical spectrum. This analysis is completed with a strong discussion and proving that: i) the physical states are represented by coherent states; ii) the solutions in previous references [1] are not general, ii) the symmetries of the considered physical system in [1] (equations and geometry) do not correspond to the Lorentz group but to the fourth covering: the Metaplectic group Mp(n).

abstract: We consider an Ehrenfest approximation for a particle in a double-well potential in the presence of an external environment schematized as a finite resource heat bath. This allows us to explore how the limitations in the applicability of Ehrenfest dynamics to nonlinear systems are modified in an open system setting. Within this framework, we have identified an environment-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, and we argue that the Ehrenfest approximation becomes increasingly valid in the limit of strong coupling to the external reservoir, either in the form of increasing number of oscillators or increasing temperature. The analysis also suggests a rather intuitive picture for the general phenomenon of quantum tunneling and its interplay with classical thermal activation processes, which may be of relevance in physical chemistry, ultracold atom physics, and fast-switching dynamics such as in superconducting digital electronics.

abstract: We report an experimental realisation of Maxwell's demon in a photonic setup. We show that a measurement at the single-photon level followed by a feed-forward operation allows the extraction of work from intense thermal light into an electric circuit. The interpretation of the experiment stimulates the derivation of a new equality relating work extraction to information acquired by measurement. We derive a bound using this relation and show that it is in agreement with the experimental results. Our work puts forward photonic systems as a platform for experiments related to information in thermodynamics.

abstract: This thesis contains contributions to the theory of quantum computation. We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary operators. Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision {\epsilon} > 0, we show how to efficiently find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T operators whose product approximates U up to {\epsilon} in the operator norm. In the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to {\epsilon}. Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties.

abstract: In a hybrid quantum network, linking two kinds of quantum nodes through photonic channels requires excellent matching of central frequency and bandwidth between both nodes and their interfacing photons. However, pre-existing photon sources can not fulfill this requirement. Using a novel conjoined double-cavity strategy, we report the generation of nondegenerate narrow-band photon pairs by cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The central frequencies and bandwidths of the signal and idler photons are independently set to match with trapped ions and solid-state quantum memories. With this source we achieve the bandwidths and central frequencies of 4 MHz at 935 nm and 5 MHz at 880 nm for the signal and idler photons respectively, with a normalized spectrum brightness of 4.9/s/MHz/mW. Due to the ability of being independently locked to two different wavelenghts, the conjoined double-cavity is universally suitable for hybrid quantum network consisting of various quantum nodes.

abstract: We compare and contrast the entangling properties of a three-well Bose-Hubbard model and an optical beamsplitter. The coupling between the different modes is linear in both cases, and we may identify two output modes. Obvious differences are that our Bose-Hubbard model, with only the middle well initially occupied, does not have a vacuum input port, there is no equivalent of a collisional, $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity with the beamsplitter, and the results of the Bose-Hubbard model show a time-dependence. In the non-interacting case, we obtain analytic solutions and show that, like a beamsplitter, the Bose-Hubbard system will not produce entanglement for classical initial states. We also show that whether inseparability or entanglement are detected depends sensitively on the criteria measured, with different criteria giving contradictory predictions.

abstract: We present a new approach based on real time domain Feynman path integrals (RTPI) for electronic structure calculations and quantum dynamics, which includes correlations between particles exactly but within the numerical accuracy. We demonstrate that incoherent propagation by keeping the wave function real is a novel method for finding and simulation of the ground state, similar to Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, but introducing new useful tools lacking in DMC. We use 1D Hooke's atom, a two-electron system with very strong correlation, as our test case, which we solve with incoherent RTPI (iRTPI) and compare against DMC. This system provides an excellent test case due to exact solutions for some confinements and because in 1D the Coulomb singularity is stronger than in two or three dimensional space. The use of Monte Carlo grid is shown to be efficient for which we determine useful numerical parameters. Furthermore, we discuss another novel approach achieved by combining the strengths of iRTPI and DMC. We also show usefulness of the perturbation theory for analytical approximates in case of strong confinements.

abstract: We explore the behavior in time of the energy exchange between a system of interest and its environment, together with its relationship to the non-Markovianity of the system dynamics. In order to evaluate the energy exchange we rely on the full counting statistics formalism, which we use to evaluate the first moment of its probability distribution. We focus in particular on the energy backflow from environment to system, to which we associate a suitable condition and quantifier, which enables us to draw a connection with a recently introduced notion of non-Markovianity based on information backflow. This quantifier is then studied in detail in the case of the spin-boson model, described within a second order time-convolutionless approximation, observing that non-Markovianity allows for the observation of energy backflow. This analysis allows us to identify the parameters region in which energy backflow is higher.

abstract: It is essential for a secure quantum key agreement protocol (QKA) to possess the fairness property in which all protocol participants contribute their information evenly for the construction of a shared secret key and none of them has the advantage to control (manipulate) even a bit of the key. This study shows that most of the existing QKAs cannot prevent a malicious participant from manipulating the shared secret key. To solve this problem, a model which describes the way to design a QKA with the fairness property is proposed. Based on the model, an example QKA is presented. Security analyses show that the proposed QKA is effective to resist not only outsider's eavesdropping attack but also insider's key manipulation.

abstract: We study the behavior of Quantum Darwinism (Zurek, [8]) within the iterative, random unitary operations qubit-model of pure decoherence (Novotny et al, [6]). We conclude that Quantum Darwinism, which describes the quantum mechanical evolution of an open system S from the point of view of its environment E, is not a generic phenomenon, but depends on the specific form of input states and on the type of S-E-interactions. Furthermore, we show that within the random unitary model the concept of Quantum Darwinism enables one to explicitly construct and specify artificial input states of environment E that allow to store information about an open system S of interest with maximal efficiency.

Kehlet, T. Schulte-Herbruggen, S.J. Glaser, J. Magn. Reson. 172 (2005) 296-305] leads to the possibility of using very efficient optimization techniques with quadratic convergence throughout the active space. In particular, the Newton-Raphson version of GRAPE with RFO regularized Hessian is shown in this communication to be significantly faster than all other algorithms in the GRAPE family. This communication describes the technical matters (matrix exponential recycling, Hessian regularization, etc.) involved in the implementation of the Newton-Raphson version of GRAPE and reports the benchmarks for the resulting method. The algorithm described in this communication is implemented in versions 1.7 and later of the Spinach library.

abstract: We explore the question of entanglement as a universal resource for implementing quantum measurements by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that for most multipartite systems (consisting of three or more subsystems), there is no entangled state from the same space that can enable all measurements by LOCC. This is in direct contrast to the bipartite case, where a maximally entangled state is an universal resource. Our results are obtained by considering the problem of local state discrimination using entanglement as a resource; and a key ingredient in our proofs is showing an equivalence between the problem of local state discrimination and that of unambiguous local state transformation. We also present partial characterization of universal resource states in multipartite systems.

abstract: In this thesis we use the language of sheaf theory in order to develop a deeper understanding of some of the fundamental differences - such as entanglement, contextuality and non-locality - between quantum and classical physics. We first present, based on the work of Abramsky and Brandenburger, how sheaves, defined over certain posets of physically meaningful contexts, give a natural setting for capturing and analysing important quantum mechanical phenomena, such as quantum non-locality and contextuality. We also describe how this setting naturally leads to a three level hierarchy of quantum contextuality: weak contextuality, logical non-locality and strong contextuality. We use these insights in order to classify certain multipartite entangled states. Almost all of these turn out to be at least logically non-local, and a number of them even turn out to be strongly contextual. We further extend this result by showing that all n-qubit entangled states, with the exception of tensor products of single-qubit and bipartite maximally-entangled states, are logically non-local. Our proof is constructive: given any n-qubit state, we present an algorithm which produces n+2 local observables witnessing its logical non-locality. In the second half of the thesis we use the same basic principle of sheaves defined over physically meaningful contexts, in order to present an elegant mathematical language, known under the name of the Topos Approach, in which many quantum mechanical concepts, such as states, observables, and propositions about these, can be expressed. We then show that the language of the Topos Approach is as least as expressive, in logical terms, as traditional quantum logic. Finally, starting from a topos-theoretic perspective, we develop the construction of contextual entropy in order to give a unified treatment of classical and quantum notions of information theoretic entropy.

abstract: The dynamics of nonlinear systems qualitatively change depending on their parameters, which is called bifurcation. A quantum-mechanical nonlinear oscillator can yield a quantum superposition of two oscillation states, known as a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state, via its bifurcation with a slowly varying parameter. Here we propose a quantum computer comprising such quantum nonlinear oscillators, instead of quantum bits, to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. The nonlinear oscillator network finds optimal solutions via quantum adiabatic evolution, where nonlinear terms are increased slowly, in contrast to conventional adiabatic quantum computation or quantum annealing. It is notable that the present computer is analogous to neural computers, which are networks of nonlinear components. Thus, the present scheme will open various possibilities for quantum computation, nonlinear science, and artificial intelligence.

abstract: We show that the multiqubit (including qubit) Clifford group in any even prime power dimension is not only a unitary 2-design, but also a unitary 3-design. Moreover, it is a minimal unitary 3-design except for dimension 4. As an immediate consequence, any orbit of pure states of the multiqubit Clifford group forms a complex projective 3-design; in particular, the set of stabilizer states forms a 3-design. By contrast, the Clifford group in any odd prime power dimension is only a unitary 2-design. In addition, we show that no operator basis is covariant with respect to any group that is a unitary 3-design, thereby providing a simple explanation of why no discrete Wigner function is covariant with respect to the multiqubit Clifford group.

abstract: We consider two ultracold particles confined in spherically symmetric harmonic trap and interacting via isotropic potential with absorbing boundary conditions at short range that models reactive scattering. First, we apply the contact pseudopotential with complex scattering length and investigate the properties of eigenergies and eigenfunctions for different trap states as a function of real and imaginary part of the scattering length. In the analyzed case the eigenenergies take complex values, and their imaginary part can be interpreted in terms of decay rates. Then we introduce the model of a square well with absorbing boundary conditions that is later used to investigate the effects of the finite range of interaction on the properties of a reactive scattering in the trap. Finally, we analyze the decay rates for some reactive alkali dimer molecules assuming short-range probability of reaction equal to unity. In this case the complex scattering length is given by universal value related to the mean scattering length of van der Waals interaction between molecules.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts microscopic phenomena with undeniable success. Nevertheless, current theoretical and experimental efforts still do not yield conclusive evidence that there is, or not, a fundamental limitation on the possibility to observe quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale. This question prompted several experimental efforts producing quantum superpositions of large quantum states in light or matter. Here we report on the observation of entanglement between a single photon and an atomic ensemble containing about 10 billion atoms and up to 47 atomic excitations. This observed signature of entanglement stems from a light-matter micro-macro entangled state that involves the superposition of two macroscopically distinguishable solid-state components, and that bears analogies with a state of the form $\vert\hspace{-2pt}\uparrow\rangle \vert{0}\rangle + \vert\hspace{-2pt}\downarrow\rangle \vert{N}\rangle$, where $N \approx 13$ is the number of excitation in a bosonic mode. Our approach leverages from quantum memory techniques and could be used in other systems to expand the size of quantum superpositions in matter.

abstract: Randomized benchmarking is a widely used experimental technique to characterize the average error of quantum operations. Benchmarking procedures that scale to enable characterization of $n$-qubit circuits rely on efficient procedures for manipulating those circuits and, as such, have been limited to subgroups of the Clifford group. However, universal quantum computers require additional, non-Clifford gates to approximate arbitrary unitary transformations. We define a scalable randomized benchmarking procedure over $n$-qubit unitary matrices that correspond to protected non-Clifford gates for a class of stabilizer codes. We present efficient methods for representing and composing group elements, sampling them uniformly, and synthesizing corresponding $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-sized circuits. The procedure provides experimental access to two independent parameters that together characterize the average gate fidelity of a group element.

abstract: We consider a coupled-cavity array, where each cavity interacts with an atom under the rotating-wave approximation. For a staggered pattern of inter-cavity couplings, a pair of field normal modes each bi-localized at the two array ends arise. A rich structure of dynamical regimes can hence be addressed depending on which resonance condition between the atom and field modes is set. We show that this can be harnessed to carry out high-fidelity quantum-state transfer (QST) of photonic, atomic or polaritonic states. Moreover, by partitioning the array into coupled modules of smaller length, the QST time can be substantially shortened without significantly affecting the fidelity.

abstract: We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that the state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value. In this scenario, new notions of informationally complete POVMs emerge, which allow for high-fidelity state estimation with fewer measurement outcomes than are required for an arbitrary rank state. We study this in the context of matrix completion, where the POVM outcomes determine only a few of the density matrix elements. We give an analytic solution that fully characterizes informational completeness and elucidates the important role that the positive-semidefinite property of density matrices plays in tomography. We show how positivity can impose a stricter notion of information completeness and allow us to use convex optimization programs to robustly estimate bounded-rank density matrices in the presence of statistical noise.

abstract: Sensing in the presence of environmental noise is a problem of increasing practical interest. In a master equation description, where the state of the environment is unobserved, the effect of signal and noise is described by system operators only. In this context it is well-known that noise that is orthogonal on an external signal can be corrected for without perturbing the signal, while similarly efficient strategies for non-orthogonal signal and noise operators are not known. Here we make use of the fact that system-environment interaction typically arises via local two-body interactions describing the exchange of quanta between system and environment, which are observable in principle. That two-body-interactions are usually orthogonal on system operators, allows us to develop error corrected sensing supported by the observation of the quanta that are emitted into the environment. We describe such schemes and outline a realistic proof-of-principle experiment in an ion trap set-up.

abstract: I argue that Deutsch's model for the behavior of systems traveling around closed timelike curves (CTCs) relies implicitly on a substantive metaphysical assumption. Deutsch is employing a version of quantum theory with a significantly supplemented ontology of parallel existent worlds, which differ in kind from the many worlds of the Everett interpretation. Standard Everett does not support the existence of multiple identical copies of the world, which the D-CTC model requires. This has been obscured because he often refers to the branching structure of Everett as a "multiverse'', and describes quantum interference by reference to parallel interacting definite worlds. But he admits that this is only an approximation to Everett. The D-CTC model, however, relies crucially on the existence of a multiverse of parallel interacting worlds. Since his model is supplemented by structures that go significantly beyond quantum theory, and play an ineliminable role in its predictions and explanations, it does not represent a quantum solution to the paradoxes of time travel.

abstract: Time-symmetric quantum mechanics can be described in the usual Weyl--Wigner--Moyal formalism (WWM) by using the properties of the Wigner distribution, and its generalization, the cross-Wigner distribution. The use of the latter makes clear a strongly oscillating interference between the pre- and post-selected states. This approach allows us to give explicit formulas for the state reconstruction problem, thus generalizing known results to the case of arbitrary observables. In a forthcoming paper we will extend these results to other quantization schemes.

abstract: A three-body quantum correlation is calculated for two particles reflecting from a mirror. Correlated interference, a consequence of conservation of energy and momentum, occurs for states in which the order of reflection is indeterminate. The resulting quantum joint probability density function exhibits interference with diverse characteristics, depending on the coherence lengths of the substates. Marginal probability density functions can contain information about the quantum nature of all three bodies, even if only one particle is measured. Microscopic particles reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic mirror are used to illustrate unique features of this three-body correlation interferometry. The microscopic momentum exchanged then generates mirror substates which interfere to produce quantum effects which do not vanish with increasing mirror mass, while the small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental decoherence times.

abstract: A complex projective $t$-design is a configuration of vectors which is ``evenly distributed'' on a sphere in the sense that sampling uniformly from it reproduces the moments of Haar measure up to order $2t$. We show that the set of all $n$-qubit stabilizer states forms a complex projective $3$-design in dimension $2^n$. Stabilizer states had previously only been known to constitute $2$-designs. The main technical ingredient is a general recursion formula for the so-called frame potential of stabilizer states. To establish it, we need to compute the number of stabilizer states with pre-described inner product with respect to a reference state. This, in turn, reduces to a counting problem in discrete symplectic vector spaces for which we find a simple formula. We sketch applications in quantum information and signal analysis.

abstract: Unitary $k$-designs are finite ensembles of unitary matrices that approximate the Haar distribution over unitary matrices. Several ensembles are known to be 2-designs, including the uniform distribution over the Clifford group, but no family of ensembles was previously known to form a 3-design. We prove that the Clifford group is a 3-design, showing that it is a better approximation to Haar-random unitaries than previously expected. Our proof strategy works for any distribution of unitaries satisfying a property we call Pauli 2-mixing and proceeds without the use of heavy mathematical machinery. We also show that the Clifford group does not form a 4-design, thus characterizing how well random Clifford elements approximate Haar-random unitaries. Additionally, we show that the generalized Clifford group for qudits is not a 3-design unless the dimension of the qudit is a power of 2.

abstract: Physical modeling closes the gap between perception in terms of measurements and abstraction in terms of theoretical models. Physical modeling is a major objective in physics and is generally regarded as a creative process. How good are computers at solving this task? This question is both of philosophical and practical interest because a positive answer would allow an artificial intelligence to understand the physical world. Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental physical theory and there is a deep belief that nature follows the rules of quantum mechanics. Hence, we raise the question whether computers are able to learn optimal quantum models from measured data. Here we show that in the absence of physical heuristics, the inference of optimal quantum models cannot be computed efficiently (unless P = NP). This result illuminates rigorous limits to the extent to which computers can be used to further our understanding of nature.

abstract: We propose a method to measure the hyperfine vectors between a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and an environment of interacting nuclear spins. Our protocol enables the generation of tunable electron-nuclear coupling Hamiltonians while suppressing unwanted inter-nuclear interactions. In this manner, each nucleus can be addressed and controlled individually thereby permitting the reconstruction of the individual hyperfine vectors. With this ability the 3D-structure of spin ensembles and spins in bio-molecules can be identified without the necessity of varying the direction of applied magnetic fields. We demonstrate examples including the complete identification of an interacting spin cluster in diamond and 3D imaging of all the nuclear spins in a bio-molecule of L-malic acid.

abstract: We propose a general and computable measure of quantum macroscopicity for arbitrary spin states by quantifying interference fringes in phase space. It effectively discriminates genuine macroscopic quantum effects from mere accumulations of microscopic quantum effects in large systems. The measure is applied to several examples and it is found to be consistent with some previous proposals. In particular, we investigate many-body spin systems undergoing the quantum phase transition (QPT) and the QPT turns out to be a genuine macroscopic quantum phenomenon. Our result suggests that a macroscopic quantum superposition of an extremely large size may appear during the QPT.

abstract: A two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized by alternating a two-state DTQW in one spatial dimension followed by an evolution in the other dimension. This was shown to reproduce a probability distribution for a certain configuration of a four-state DTQW on a two-dimensional lattice. In this work we present a three-state alternate DTQW with a parameterized coin-flip operator and show that it can produce localization that is also observed for a certain other configuration of the four-state DTQW and non-reproducible using the two-state alternate DTQW. We will present two limit theorems for the three-state alternate DTQW. One of the limit theorems describes a long-time limit of a return probability, and the other presents a convergence in distribution for the position of the walker on a rescaled space by time. We will also outline the relevance of these walks in physical systems.

abstract: Recently we pointed out the so-called Local Time Scheme [J. Jekni\' c-Dugi\'c et al, (2014) Ref. [1]] as a novel approach to quantum foundations that solves the preferred pointer-basis problem. In this paper we introduce and analyze in depth a rather non-standard dynamical map that is imposed by the scheme. On one hand, the map does not allow for introducing a properly defined generator of the evolution nor does it represent a quantum channel. On the other hand, the map is linear, positive, trace preserving and unital as well as completely positive, but is not divisible and therefore non-Markovian. Nevertheless, we provide quantitative criteria for dynamical emergence of time-coarse-grained Markovianity, for exact dynamics of an open system, as well as for operationally-defined approximation of a closed or open many-particle system. A closed system never reaches a steady state, while an open system may reach a unique steady state given by the L\" uders-von Neumann formula; where the smaller the open system, the faster a steady state is attained. These generic findings extend the standard open quantum systems theory and substantially tackle certain cosmological issues.

abstract: Gaussian state decoherence aspects due to interacting magnetic-like and gravitational fields are quantified through the quantum fidelity and Shannon entropy in the scope of the phase-space representation of elementary quantum systems. For Gaussian Wigner functions describing harmonic oscillator states, an interacting external field destroys the quantum fidelity and introduces a quantum beating behavior. Likewise, it introduces harmonic profiles for free particle systems. Some aspects of quantum decoherence for the quantum harmonic oscillator and for the free particle limit are also quantified through the Shannon entropy. For the gravitational quantum well, the effect of a magnetic-like field on the quantum fidelity is suppressed by the linear term of the gravitational potential. To conclude, one identifies a fine formal connection of the quantum decoherence aspects discussed here with the noncommutative quantum mechanics.

abstract: Recently, in the letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 114}, 170502 (2015)], Tavakoli et al. derived interesting results by studying classical and quantum random access codes (RACs) in which the parties communicate higher-dimensional systems. They construct quantum RACs with a bigger advantage over classical RACs compared to previously considered RACs with binary alphabet. However, these results crucially hinge upon an unproven assertion that the classical strategy "majority-encoding-identity-decoding" leads to the maximum average success probability achievable for classical RACs; in this article we provide a proof of this intuition. We characterize all optimal classical RACs and show that indeed "majority-encoding-identity-decoding" is one among the several optimal strategies. Along with strengthening the results in Tavakoli et al., our result provides a firm basis for future research on this topic.

abstract: Quantum walks behave differently from what we expect and their probability distributions have unique structures. They have localization, singularities, a gap, and so on. Those features have been discovered from the view point of mathematics and reported as limit theorems. In this paper we focus on a time-dependent three-state quantum walk on the line and demonstrate a limit distribution. Three coin states at each position are iteratively updated by a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. As the result of the evolution, we end up to observe both localization and a gap in the limit distribution.

abstract: Optomechanical cooling is a prerequisite for many exotic applications promised by modern quantum technology and it is crucial to achieve it in short times, in order to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment. We formulate cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum-time optimal control problem on anti-de Sitter space of appropriate dimension and use the Legendre pseudospectral optimization method to find the minimum time and the corresponding optimal control, for various values of the maximum coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. The present framework can also be applied to create optomechanical entanglement in minimum time and to improve the efficiency of an optomechanical quantum heat engine.

abstract: We study one- and two-photon scattering from a qubit embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of modal dispersion. We use a resolvent based analysis and utilize techniques borrowed from the Lee model studies. Modal dispersion leads to atom-photon bound states which necessitate the use of multichannel scattering theory. We present multichannel scattering matrix elements in terms of the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Through the use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we derive an infinite series of Feynman diagrams that represent the solution to the integral equation. We use the Feynman diagrams as vertex correction terms to come up with closed form formulas that successfully predict the trapping rate of a photon in the atom-photon bound state. We verify our formalism through Krylov-subspace based numerical studies. Our results provide the tools to calculate the complex correlations between scattered photons in a dispersive environment.

abstract: We maintain that the wavefunction is best understood as describing ensembles rather than individual particles. For a single particle, we propose an ontology underwritten by the Heisenberg representation. It consists of deterministic operators which may have nonlocal dynamics. Indeed, nonlocal equations of motion, arising from the transition from Poisson brackets to commutator algebra, are a salient feature of the proposed ontology. Using this feature, we show how interference phenomena can be understood without having to conceive of the quantum state as wave-like. Nonlocal information is provided by a modular momentum operator. By augmenting the individual particle description with a final boundary condition and employing weak measurements, we show how both interference and which-path can be deduced for the same system. The resulting description is based on a time-symmetric Heisenberg representation, which we believe to capture the essence of quantum mechanics, particularly its nonlocal nature, better than any wavefunction based ontology.

We present two novel gedanken experiments, based on the quantum Zeno effect, suggesting a dynamical process thorough which this curious phenomenon occurs. We analyze, for the first time, a quantum current consisting of spin without mass. Thus, the quantum variables of pre- and post-selected particles are understood to be involved in various interactions, even in the absence of their owners. This current is shown to provide a local explanation for seemingly nonlocal interactions.

abstract: In a recent detailed research program we proposed to study the complex physics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a discrete-time quantum walk. The main novel ingredient proposed for this study is the use of non-linear parametric amplifiers in the network which could in turn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body effects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker. In this paper, and as a first step towards the implementation of our scheme, we analize the interplay between quantum walk lattice topology and spatial correlations of bi-photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We also describe different detection methods suitable for our proposed experimental scheme.

abstract: We address the interaction of single- and two-qubit systems with external fluctuating transverse fields and analyze in details the dynamical decoherence induced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, e.g. random telegraph noise (RTN). Upon exploiting the exact RTN solution of the time-dependent Von Neumann equation, we analyze in details the behavior of quantum correlations and prove the non-Markovianity of the dynamical map in the full parameter range, i.e. for either fast or slow noise. The dynamics induced by Gaussian noise is studied numerically and compared to the RTN solution, showing the existence of (state dependent) regions of the parameter space where the two noises lead to very similar dynamics. Our results shows that while the effects of non-Gaussian noise cannot be trivially mapped to that of Gaussian noise and viceversa, i.e. the spectrum alone is not enough to summarize the noise effects, the dynamics under the effect of one kind of noise may be simulated with high fidelity by the other one.

We briefly introduce both methods, followed by a benchmark to prove viability and combination synergies. Subsequently we illustrate the capabilities of this approach at the hand of specific examples and conclude our analysis by highlighting possible further applications of our method.

abstract: We demonstrate a monolithically integrable heralded photon source in a femtosecond laser direct written glass waveguide. The generation of photon pairs with a wide wavelength separation requires a concomitant large birefringence in the normal dispersion regime. Here, by incorporation of side-stress tracks, we produce a waveguide with a birefringence of $1.64\times~10^{-4}$ and propagation loss as low as 0.21 dB/cm near 980~nm. We measure photon pairs with 300~nm wavelength separation at an internal generation rate exceeding $5.05\times10^6$/s. The second order correlations indicate that the generated photon pairs are in a strongly non-classical regime.

abstract: The Loschmidt echo is a measure of quantum irreversibility and is determined by the fidelity amplitude of an imperfect time-reversal protocol. Fidelity amplitude plays an important role both in the foundations of quantum mechanics and its applications, such as time-resolved electronic spectroscopy. We derive an exact path integral formula for the fidelity amplitude and use it to obtain a series of increasingly accurate semiclassical approximations by truncating an exact expansion of the path integral exponent. While the zeroth-order expansion results in a remarkably simple, yet nontrivial approximation for the fidelity amplitude, the first-order expansion yields an alternative derivation of the so-called "dephasing representation", circumventing the use of semiclassical propagator as in the original derivation. We also obtain approximate expression for fidelity based on the second-order expansion, which resolves several shortcomings of the dephasing representation. The rigorous derivation from the path integral permits the identification of sufficient conditions under which various approximations obtained become exact.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Bell measurement scheme proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 113603 (2015)] based on a logical qubit using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement of photons. The success probability of the proposed Bell measurement can be made arbitrarily high using only linear optics as the number of photons in a logical qubit increases. We compare our scheme with all the other proposals, using single-photon qubits, coherent-state qubits or hybrid qubits, suggested to enhance the efficiency of the Bell measurement. As a remarkable advantage, our scheme requires only photon on-off measurements, while photon number resolving detectors are necessary for all the other proposals. We find that the scheme based on coherent-state qubits shows the best performance with respect to the attained success probability in terms of the average number of photons used in the process, while our scheme outperforms the schemes using single-photon qubits. We finally show that efficient quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computation can be realized using our approach.

abstract: Quantum communication protocols such as quantum cloud computing, digital signatures, coin-tossing, secret-sharing, and key distribution, using similar optical technologies, claim to provide unconditional security guaranteed by quantum mechanics. Among these protocols, the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is most scrutinized and believed to be guaranteed as long as implemented devices are properly characterized and existing implementation loopholes are identified and patched. Here we show that this assumption is not true. We experimentally demonstrate a class of attacks based on laser damage, capable of creating new security loopholes on-demand. We perform it on two different implementations of QKD and coin-tossing protocols, and create new information leakage side-channels. Our results show that quantum communication protocols cannot guarantee security alone, but will always have to be supported by additional technical countermeasures against laser damage.

Connection of random variables and is found, when is a qudrature phase. Connection of the tomogram and the tomogram is found. The protocol prescribes the rule of choice of problem parameters, such as interaction time, and the number of atoms in series . The method contains a single fitting parameter that is selected in the process of numerical simulation of the quadrature distribution in a coherent state. Quality selection is determined by the Kolmogorov test. The result of the calculation protocol is a convolution with the instrumental function of the method. The parameters of the instrumental function are shown. Numerical simulations performed for typical numerical values of parameters of the experimental setup, shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Our approach replaces the polaron-like transformation of previous work, which required a lengthy calculation for the physically interesting case of three qubits and two resonator modes. The technique introduced here makes this calculation straightforward and manifestly correct. Using this technique, we are able to show that registers larger than one qubit evolve under a non-Markovian master equation. We perform numerical simulations of the three-qubit, two-mode case from previous work, obtaining an average post-measurement state fidelity near 94%.

abstract: The construction of physically relevant low dimensional state models, and the design of appropriate measurements are key issues in tackling quantum state tomography for large dimensional systems. We consider the statistical problem of estimating low rank states in the set-up of multiple ions tomography, and investigate how the estimation error behaves with a reduction in the number of measurement settings, compared with the standard ion tomography setup. We present extensive simulation results showing that the error is robust with respect to the choice of states of a given rank, the random selection of settings, and that the number of settings can be significantly reduced with only a negligible increase in error. We present an argument to explain these findings based on a concentration inequality for the Fisher information matrix. In the more general setup of random basis measurements we use this argument to show that for certain rank $r$ states it suffices to measure in $O(r\log d)$ bases to achieve the average Fisher information over all bases. We present numerical evidence for states upto 8 atoms, supporting a conjecture on a lower bound for the Fisher information which, if true, would imply a similar behaviour in the case of Pauli bases. The relation to similar problems in compressed sensing is also discussed.

abstract: Entanglement is at the heart of most quantum information tasks, and therefore considerable effort has been made to find methods of deciding the entanglement content of a given bipartite quantum state. Here, we prove a fundamental limitation to deciding if an unknown state is entangled or not: we show that any quantum measurement which can answer this question necessarily gives enough information to identify the state completely. Therefore, only prior information regarding the state can make entanglement detection less expensive than full state tomography in terms of the demanded quantum resources. We also extend our treatment to other classes of correlated states by considering the problem of deciding if a state is NPT, discordant, or fully classically correlated. Remarkably, only the question related to quantum discord can be answered without resorting to full state tomography.

abstract: The concept of complementarity in combination with a non-Boolean calculus of propositions refers to a pivotal feature of quantum systems which has long been regarded as a key to their distinction from classical systems. But a non-Boolean logic of complementary features may also apply to classical systems, if their states and observables are defined by partitions of a classical state space. If these partitions do not satisfy certain stability criteria, complementary observables and non-Boolean propositional lattices may be the consequence. This is especially the case for non-generating partitions of nonlinear dynamical systems. We show how this can be understood in more detail and indicate some challenging consequences for systems outside quantum physics, including mental processes.

abstract: We propose an optical implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm using classical light in a binary decision-tree scheme. Our approach uses a ring cavity and linear optical devices in order to efficiently quarry the oracle functional values. In addition, we take advantage of the intrinsic Fourier transforming properties of a lens to read out whether the function given by the oracle is balanced or constant.

abstract: We report the spectroscopic observation of a resonant transition that breaks a selection rule in the quantum Rabi model, implemented using an LC resonator and a superconducting qubit. The eigenstates of the system consist of a superposition of bare qubit-oscillator states with a relative sign. In the limit of low qubit-oscillator coupling strength, the matrix element between excited eigenstates of different sign is very small in presence of an oscillator drive, establishing a sign-preserving selection rule. Here, our qubit-resonator system operates in the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the coupling strength is 10% of the resonator frequency, allowing sign-changing transitions to be activated and, therefore, detected. This work shows that sign-changing transitions are an unambiguous, distinctive signature of systems operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime of the quantum Rabi model. These results pave the way to further studies of sign-preserving selection rules in multiqubit and multiphoton models.

abstract: Unpredictability, or randomness, of the outcomes of measurements made on an entangled state can be certified provided that the statistics violate a Bell inequality. In the standard Bell scenario where each party performs a single measurement on its share of the system, only a finite amount of at most $4 log_2 d$ bits of randomness can be certified from a pair of qudits. In our work, it is shown that this fundamental limitation can be overcome using sequences of (non-projective) measurements on the same system. More precisely, we prove that one can certify any amount of random bits from a pair of qubits in a pure state as resource, even if it is arbitrarily weakly entangled. In addition, this certification is achieved by near-maximal violation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement in the sequence.

abstract: The orbital angular momentum Hall effect and spin Hall effect of electron vortex beams (EVB) have been studied for the EVBs interacting with laser field. In the scenario of paraxial beam, the cumulative effect of the orbit-orbit interaction of EVBs and laser fields drives the orbital Hall effect, which in turn produces a shift of the center of the beam from that of the field-free case towards the polarization axis of photons. Besides, for non-paraxial beams one can also perceive a similar shift of the center of the beam owing to spin Hall effect involving spin-orbit interaction. Our analysis suggests that the shift in the paraxial beams will always be larger than that in non-paraxial beams.

abstract: Contextuality is a key resource in quantum information and the device-independent security of quantum algorithms. In this work, we show that the recently developed, operational Mermin non-locality arguments provide a large, novel family of quantum realisable All-vs-Nothing models. In particular, they result in a diverse wealth of quantum realisable models which are maximally contextual (i.e. lie on the faces of the no-signalling polytope with no local elements), and could be used as a resource for the security of a new class of quantum secret sharing algorithms.

abstract: One unique feature of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the outcomes of two incompatible measurements cannot simultaneously achieve arbitrary precision. In an information-theoretic context of quantum information, the uncertainty principle can be formulated as entropic uncertainty relations with two measurements for a quantum bit (qubit) in two-dimensional system. New entropic uncertainty relations are studied for a higher-dimensional quantum state with multiple measurements, the uncertainty bounds can be tighter than that expected from two measurements settings and cannot result from qubits system with or without a quantum memory. Here we report the first room-temperature experimental testing of the entropic uncertainty relations with three measurements in a natural three-dimensional solid-state system: the nitrogen-vacancy center in pure diamond. The experimental results confirm the entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements. Our result represents a more precise demonstrating of the fundamental uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Two-photon interference effects, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, can be used to characterize to what extent two photons are identical. Furthermore, these interference effects underly linear optics quantum computation. We show here how nonlinear optical effects, such as those mediated by atoms or quantum dots in a cavity, degrade the interference. This implies that, on the one hand, nonlinearities are to be avoided if one wishes to utilize the interference, but on the other hand, one may be able to measure or detect nonlinearities by observing the disappearance of the interference.

abstract: Cold atomic gases have provided us with a great number of opportunities for studying various physical systems under controlled conditions that are seldom offered in other fields. We are thus at the point where one can truly do quantum simulation of models that are relevant for instance in condensed-matter or high-energy physics, i.e. we are on the verge of a 'cool' quantum simulator as envisioned by Feynman. One of the avenues under exploration is the physics of one-dimensional systems. Until recently this was mostly in the many-body limit but now experiments can be performed with controllable particle numbers all the way down to the few-body regime. After a brief introduction to some of the relevant experiments, I will review recent theoretical work on one-dimensional quantum systems containing bosons, fermions, or mixtures of the two, with a particular emphasis on the case where the particles are held by an external trap.

We apply this result to multi-qubit {\sf X}-shaped Hermitian matrices, and characterize the conditions for them to be genuine entanglement witnesses, in terms of entries. Furthermore, we find all optimal ones among them. They turn out to have the spanning properties, and so they detect non-zero volume set of multi-qubit genuine entanglement. We also characterize decomposability for {\sf X}-shaped entanglement witnesses.

abstract: The information content of continuous quantum variables systems is usually studied using a number of well known approximation methods. The approximations are made to obtain the spectrum, eigenfunctions or the reduced density matrices that are essential to calculate the entropy-like quantities that quantify the information. Even in the sparse cases where the spectrum and eigenfunctions are exactly known the entanglement spectrum, {\em i.e.} the spectrum of the reduced density matrices that characterize the problem, must be obtained in an approximate fashion. In this work, we obtain analytically a finite representation of the reduced density matrices of the fundamental state of the N-particle Calogero model for a discrete set of values of the interaction parameter. As a consequence, the exact entanglement spectrum and von Neumann entropy is worked out.

abstract: Quantities invariant under local unitary transformations are of natural interest in the study of entanglement. This paper deduces and studies a particularly simple quantity that is constructed from a combination of two standard permutations of the density matrix, namely realignment and partial transpose. This bipartite quantity, denoted here as $R_{12}$, vanishes for product states and classical-classical and classical-quantum correlated states, while being maximum for maximally entangled states. It is shown to be naturally related to the 3-tangle in three qubit states via their two-qubit reduced density matrices. Upper and lower bounds on the concurrence of two-qubit density matrices of rank two is given in terms of $R_{12}$. Here, it is shown that the states satisfying the lower bound define a class of three qubit states that maximizes the tripartite entanglement (the 3-tangle) given an amount of entanglement between a pair of them. The measure $R_{12}$ is studied for higher rank two qubit states and is conjectured, via numerical sampling, to be always larger than the concurrence. In particular this is shown to be true for the physically interesting case of $X$ states.

abstract: We introduce and study a generalization of majorization called relative submajorization and show that it has many applications to the resource theories of thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and bipartite entanglement. In particular, we show that relative submajorization characterizes both the probability and approximation error that can be obtained when transforming one resource to another, also when assisted by additional standard resources such as useful work or maximally-entangled states. These characterizations have a geometric formulation as the ratios or differences, respectively, between the Lorenz curves associated with the input and output resources. We also find several interesting bounds on the reversibility of a given transformation in terms of the properties of the forward transformation. The main technical tool used to establish these results is linear programming duality.

abstract: We present in total fifteen potentials for which the stationary Klein-Gordon equation is solvable in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Because of the symmetry of the confluent Heun equation with respect to the transposition of its regular singularities, only nine of the potentials are independent. Four of these independent potentials are five-parametric. One of them possesses a four-parametric ordinary hypergeometric sub-potential, another one possesses a four-parametric confluent hypergeometric sub-potential, and one potential possesses four-parametric sub-potentials of both hypergeometric types. The fourth five-parametric potential has a three-parametric confluent hypergeometric sub-potential, which is, however, only conditionally integrable. The remaining five independent Heun potentials are four-parametric and have solutions only in terms of irreducible confluent Heun functions.

abstract: An explicit retrocausal model is used to analyze the general Wood-Spekkens argument [1] that any causal explanation of Bell-inequality violations must be unnaturally fine-tuned to avoid signaling. The no-signaling aspects of the model turn out to be robust under variation of the only free parameter, even as the probabilities deviate from standard quantum theory. The ultimate reason for this robustness is then traced to a symmetry assumed by the original model. A broader conclusion is that symmetry-based restrictions seem a natural and acceptable form of fine-tuning, not an unnatural model-rigging. And if the Wood-Spekkens argument is indicating the presence of hidden symmetries, this might even be interpreted as supporting time-symmetric retrocausal models.

Here we show that this correspondence can be harnessed in the reverse direction to yield a graph data structure which allows for more efficient manipulation and comparison of graphs than any possible classical structure. We introduce efficient algorithms for many transformation and comparison operations on graphs represented as graph states, and prove that no classical data structure can have similar performance for the full set of operations studied.

abstract: We show that, in principle, an arbitrarily large amount of energy can be teleported through a massless quantum field, where the sender and receiver have access only to a fixed finite region in space each and are performing only local operations and classical or quantum communication. To this end, the usual quantum energy teleportation protocol is modified by using qudits of increasing dimension and by scaling suitable local interaction Hamiltonians. Remarkably, this yields a method for generating arbitrarily negative local energy densities in a quantum field.

abstract: We report theoretical calculations and experimental observations of Pancharatnam's phase originating from arbitrary SU(2) transformations applied to polarization states of light. We have implemented polarimetric and interferometric methods which allow us to cover the full Poincar\'e sphere. As a distinctive feature, our interferometric array is robust against mechanical and thermal disturbances, showing that the polarimetric method is not inherently superior to the interferometric one, as previously assumed. Our strategy effectively amounts to feed an interferometer with two copropagating beams that are orthogonally polarized with respect to each other. It can be applied to different types of standard arrays, like a Michelson, a Sagnac, or a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We exhibit the versatility of our arrangement by performing measurements of Pancharatnam's phases and fringe visibilities that closely fit the theoretical predictions. Our approach can be easily extended to deal with mixed states and to study decoherence effects.

abstract: We report polarimetric measurements of geometric phases that are generated by evolving polarized photons along non-geodesic trajectories on the Poincar\'e sphere. The core of our polarimetric array consists of seven wave plates that are traversed by a single photon beam. With this array any SU(2) transformation can be realized. By exploiting the gauge invariance of geometric phases under U(1) local transformations, we nullify the dynamical contribution to the total phase, thereby making the latter coincide with the geometric phase. We demonstrate our arrangement to be insensitive to various sources of noise entering it. This makes the single-beam, polarimetric array a promising, versatile tool for testing robustness of geometric phases against noise.

Topological defects in solids are considered as an example. The aim is helping to grasp the underlying pre-theoretical new intuitions, which should replace the old ones attached to the background of classical physics.

abstract: Recent improvements in control of quantum systems make it seem feasible to finally build a quantum computer within a decade. While it has been shown that such a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic structure problems and idealized model Hamiltonians, the highly relevant problem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a prohibitive amount of resources. Here, we show that by using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum computer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms, the electronic structure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a quantum computer. In our approach, the quantum computer solves a small effective quantum impurity problem that is self-consistently determined via a feedback loop between the quantum and classical computation. Use of a quantum computer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known classical algorithm, and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to be resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical qubits becomes available.

abstract: Quantum interference lies at the heart of several quantum computational speed-ups and provides a striking example of a phenomenon with no classical counterpart. An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three slit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in terms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits. This is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the interference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who asked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit experiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of quantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope of determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer from pathological -- or at least undesirable -- features. In this paper two proposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density Cubes proposed by Dakic, Paterek and Brukner, which has been shown to exhibit irreducible interference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of Zyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage over quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a well-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory -- analogous to the emergence of classical physics from quantum theory via decoherence. Despite this, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient to uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is a well-defined theory and we demonstrate that it exhibits irreducible interference to all orders. Finally, we provide evidence that this theory offers of a speed-up over quantum in communication complexity problems.

abstract: We present an algorithm for efficiently approximating of qubit unitaries over gate sets derived from totally definite quaternion algebras. It achieves $\varepsilon$-approximations using circuits of length $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, which is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm achieves the same quality of approximation as previously-known algorithms for Clifford+T [arXiv:1212.6253], V-basis [arXiv:1303.1411] and Clifford+$\pi/12$ [arXiv:1409.3552], running on average in time polynomial in $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ (conditional on a number-theoretic conjecture). Ours is the first such algorithm that works for a wide range of gate sets and provides insight into what should constitute a "good" gate set for a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

abstract: Photocount statistics are an important tool for the characterization of electromagnetic fields, especially for fields with an irrelevant phase. In the microwave domain, continuous rather than discrete measurements are the norm. Using a novel approach, we recover discrete photon statistics from the cumulants of a continuous distribution of field quadrature measurements. The use of cumulants allows the separation between the signal of interest and experimental noise. Using a parametric amplifier as the first stage of the amplification chain, we extract useful data from up to the sixth cumulant of the continuous distribution of a coherent field, hence recovering up to the third moment of the discrete statistics associated with a signal with much less than one average photon.

abstract: The radiation pressure of light can act to damp and cool the vibrational motion of a mechanical resonator. In understanding the quantum limits of this cooling, one must consider the effect of shot noise fluctuations on the final thermal occupation. In optomechanical sideband cooling in a cavity, the finite Stokes Raman scattering defined by the cavity linewidth combined with shot noise fluctuations dictates a quantum backaction limit, analogous to the Doppler limit of atomic laser cooling. In our work we sideband cool to the quantum backaction limit by using a micromechanical membrane precooled in a dilution refrigerator. Monitoring the optical sidebands allows us to directly observe the mechanical object come to thermal equilibrium with the optical bath.

abstract: In general, it is difficult to evaluate measurement errors when the initial and final conditions of the measurement make it impossible to identify the correct value of the target observable. Ozawa proposed a solution based on the operator algebra of observables which has recently been used in experiments investigating the error-disturbance trade-off of quantum measurements. Importantly, this solution makes surprisingly detailed statements about the relations between measurement outcomes and the unknown target observable. In the present paper, we investigate this relation by performing a sequence of two measurements on the polarization of a photon, so that the first measurement commutes with the target observable and the second measurement is sensitive to a complementary observable. While the initial measurement can be evaluated using classical statistics, the second measurement introduces the effects of quantum correlations between the non-commuting physical properties. By varying the resolution of the initial measurement, we can change the relative contribution of the non-classical correlations and identify their role in the evaluation of the quantum measurement. It is shown that the most striking deviation from classical expectations is obtained at the transition between weak and strong measurements, where the competition between different statistical effects results in measurement values well outside the range of possible eigenvalues.

abstract: We formulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems under real-time spatially-resolved measurement, and show that, in the continuous measurement limit, the indistinguishability of identical particles results in the complete suppression of relative positional decoherence. As a consequence, the indistinguishability persists in the course of quantum dynamics under weak continuous observation. We numerically demonstrate this result for ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Our results can be applied to quantum feedback control of quantum many-body systems which may be realized in subwavelength spacing lattice systems.

abstract: Removing a single photon from a pulse is one of the most elementary operations that can be performed on light, having both fundamental significance and practical applications in quantum communication and computation. So far, photon subtraction, in which the removed photon is detected and therefore irreversibly lost, has been implemented in a probabilistic manner with inherently low success rates using low-reflectivity beam splitters. Here we demonstrate a scheme for the deterministic extraction of a single photon from an incoming pulse. The removed photon is diverted to a different mode, enabling its use for other purposes, such as a photon number-splitting attack on quantum key distribution protocols. Our implementation makes use of single-photon Raman interaction (SPRINT) with a single atom near a nanofibre-coupled microresonator. The single-photon extraction probability in our current realization is limited mostly by linear loss, yet probabilities close to unity should be attainable with realistic experimental parameters.

abstract: Quantum chemistry simulations on a quantum computer suffer from the overhead needed for encoding the fermionic problem in a bosonic system of qubits. By exploiting the block diagonality of a fermionic Hamiltonian, we show that the number of required qubits can be reduced by a factor of two or more. There is no need to go into the basis of the Hilbert space for this reduction because all operations can be performed in the operator space. The scheme is conceived as a pre-computational step that would be performed on a classical computer prior to the actual quantum simulation. We apply this scheme to reduce the number of qubits necessary to simulate both the Hamiltonian of the two-site Fermi-Hubbard model and the hydrogen molecule. Both quantum systems can then be simulated with a two-qubit quantum computer.

abstract: The quantum Fisher metrics represent the continuous family of metrics on the space of quantum states, and place the fundamental limit of accuracy of quantum state estimation. We show that the entire quantum Fisher metrics can be determined from linear response theory through generalized covariances. We derive the generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem that relates the linear response function to generalized covariances and hence allows us to determine the quantum Fisher metrics from experimentally measurable quantities.

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with single-molecule sensitivity and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angstrom resolution are the highest challenges in magnetic microscopy. Recent development in dynamical decoupling (DD) enhanced diamond quantum sensing has enabled NMR of single nuclear spins and nanoscale NMR. The current DD-based quantum sensing, however, cannot resolve different nuclear spins that have the same noise frequency or identify correlations in nuclear spin clusters, which are critical information for angstrom-resolution MRI. Here we demonstrate a scheme of angstrom-resolution MRI by DD-based quantum sensing. We find that for DD resonant with the noise frequency of a species of nuclear spins, the sensor coherence presents a sharp dip, whose depth oscillates as a function of the DD pulse number. The oscillation features unambiguously determine the number of nuclear spins coupled to the sensor, the individual coupling strengths, and the correlations, in a quantized manner. Therefore a nitrogen-vacancy centre spin sensor near a diamond surface can be employed to determine, with angstrom-resolution, the positions and conformation of single molecules that are isotope-labelled. This work offers an approach to angstrom-resolution MRI, which may be useful for quantum computing and conformation analysis of single macromolecules.

abstract: We study two operational approaches to quantifying incompatibility that depart significantly from the well known entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) formalism. Both approaches result in incompatibility measures that yield non-zero values even when the pair of incompatible observables commute over a subspace, unlike EURs which give a zero lower bound in such cases. Here, we explicitly show how these measures go beyond EURs in quantifying incompatibility: For any set of quantum observables, we show that both incompatibility measures are bounded from below by the corresponding EURs for the Tsallis ($T_{2}$) entropy. We explicitly evaluate the incompatibility of a pair of qubit observables in both operational scenarios. We also obtain an efficiently computable lower bound for the mutually incompatibility of a general set of observables.

abstract: Gaussian quantum systems capture many important quantum features, but can be simulated classically. Using both the Koopmanian and phase-space formalisms we investigate how robust this classicality is. We find from both perspectives that failures of consistency of the dynamics of a hybrid classical-quantum system are exhibited. By demanding that no unobservable operators couple to the quantum sector in the Koopmanian formalism, we show that the classical equations of motion act on their quantum counterparts without experiencing any back-reaction, resulting in non-conservation of energy in the quantum system. Using the phase-space formalism we study the short time evolution of the moment equations of a hybrid classical-Gaussian quantum system, and observe violations of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation in the quantum sector for a broad range of initial conditions. This inconsistency indicates that while many explicitly quantum effects can be represented classically, quantum aspects of the system cannot be fully masked. We comment on the implications of our results for quantum gravity.

The Gouy phase differs for classical or non-classical paths as it depends on the propagation time. In this case the Gouy phase difference changes the Sorkin parameter $\kappa$ used to estimate non-classical path contribution in a nontrivial way shedding some light in the implementation of experiments to detect non-classical path contributions.

abstract: Partial polarization is the manifestation of the correlation between two mutually orthogonal transverse field components associated with a light beam. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the origin of this correlation can be purely quantum mechanical. We perform a two-path first-order (single photon) interference experiment and demonstrate that the degree of polarization of the light emerging from the output of the interferometer depends on path distinguishability. We use two independent methods to control the distinguishability of the photon paths. While the distinguishability introduced in one of the methods can be erased by performing a suitable measurement on the superposed beam, the distinguishability introduced in the other method cannot be erased. We show that the beam is partially polarized only when both types of distinguishability exist. Our main result is the dependence of the degree of polarization on the inerasable distinguishability, which cannot be explained by the classical (non-quantum) theory of light.

abstract: A key ingredient in emerging quantum-enhanced technologies is the ability to coherently manipulate and detect superpositions of basis states. In integrated optics implementations, transverse spatial modes supported by multimode structures offer an attractive carrier of quantum superpositions. Here we propose an integrated dynamic mode converter based on the electro-optic effect in nonlinear channel waveguides for deterministic transformations between mutually non-orthogonal bases of spatial modes. We theoretically show its capability to demonstrate a violation of a Bell-type Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by measuring spatially mode-entangled photon pairs generated by an integrated photon pair source. The proposed configuration, numerically studied for the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) material, can be easily implemented using standard integrated optical fabrication technology.

abstract: The subtraction of a single photon from a multimode quantum field is analyzed as the conditional evolution of an open quantum system. We develop a theory describing different subtraction schemes in a unified approach and we introduce the concept of subtraction modes intrinsic to the process. The matching between the subtraction modes and the modes of the field defines different possible scenarios for the photon subtraction. In particular, our framework identifies: the conditions of pure photon subtraction, the quantum states of the field modes conditioned to the photon subtraction, the mode with the highest fidelity with a single-photon state when the subtraction is performed on multimode squeezed light. We use our theory to analyze the photon subtraction from a highly multimode quantum resource - a train of quantum squeezed or correlated optical pulses. Performing the photon subtraction optimally on various multimode light field has the potential to implement a number of quantum information protocols in a multiplexed and scalable way.

abstract: Although practised as an art and science for ages, cryptography had to wait until the mid-twentieth century before Claude Shannon gave it a strong mathematical foundation. However, Shannon's approach was rooted is his own information theory, itself inspired by the classical physics of Newton and Einstein. But our world is ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics. When quantum-mechanical phenomena are taken into account, new vistas open up both for codemakers and codebreakers. Is quantum mechanics a blessing or a curse for the protection of privacy? As we shall see, the jury is still out!

The equation is valid for a weak probe pulse. We solve the equation for the case of a three-level BEC in $\Lambda$ configuration with one of its ground state spatial profiles initially constant. The solution characterizes, in detail, the effect that the evolution of the condensate wave function has on pulse propagation, including the process of stopping and releasing it.

abstract: Why is thermalisation a universal phenomenon? How does a quantum system reach thermodynamical equilibrium? These questions are not new, dating even from the very birth of quantum theory and have been the subject of a renewed interest over the two last decades (see for instance the review in Eisert et al, Nature Physics 2015). In this work, we propose a universal model demonstrating that thermalisation of a small quantum system is an emergent property of the unitary evolution under a Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a larger composite system, whose initial state can be arbitrary. We show that the origin of universality lies in the phenomenon of 'measure concentration', which provides self-averaging properties for the reduced density matrix characterizing the state of the small subsystem. Using our framework, we focus on the asymptotic state at long times and consider its stationary properties. In typical macroscopic conditions, we recover the canonical state and the Boltzmann distribution well known from statistical thermodynamics. This findings lead us to propose an alternative and more general definition of the canonical partition function which also allow us to describe non thermal stationary states.

abstract: Superoscillations, i.e., the phenomenon that a bandlimited function can temporary oscillate faster than its highest Fourier component, are being much discussed for their potential for `superresolution' beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we consider systems that are driven with a time dependence that is off-resonance for the system, in the Fourier sense. We show that superoscillating sources can temporarily induce resonance during the period when the source is behaving superoscillatory. This observation poses the question as to how the system `undoes' the `false resonance' after the full source has acted and its band limitation is apparent. We discuss several examples of systems which might be capable of distilling the temporary excitation through some non-harmonic effects, such as dissipation or dispersion at high frequencies, opening up the possibility of low frequency detection of `fast' microphysics through superoscillations. We conclude that, either superoscillations really can beat the bandlimit and achieve superresolution (`kinematic superresolution') or the superoscillating high frequency is absorbed and we gain dynamical access to the physics of high frequency processes with low frequency signals (`dynamical superresolution').

abstract: Temperature determines the relative probability of observing a physical system in an energy state when that system is energetically in equilibrium with its environment. In this manuscript, we present a theory for engineering the temperature of a quantum system different from its ambient temperature, that is basically an analog version of the quantum metropolis algorithm. We define criteria for an engineered quantum bath that, when couples to a quantum system with Hamiltonian $H$, drives the system to the equilibrium state $\frac{e^{-H/T}}{{{\rm{Tr}}}(e^{-H/T})}$ with a tunable parameter $T$. For a system of superconducting qubits, we propose a circuit-QED approximate realization of such an engineered thermal bath consisting of driven lossy resonators. We consider an artificial thermal bath as a simulator for many-body physics or a controllable temperature knob for a hybrid quantum-thermal annealer.

abstract: The technological world is in the midst of a quantum computing and quantum information revolution. Since Richard Feynman's famous "plenty of room at the bottom" lecture, hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum mechanics, the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in understanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the foundational requirements for building one. We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.

abstract: We study the thermalization of an elementary quantum system modeled by a two-level atom interacting with stationary electromagnetic fields out of thermal equilibrium near a dielectric slab. The slab is held at a temperature different from that of the region where the atom is located. We find that when the slab is a nonabsorbing and nondispersive dielectric of a finite thickness $ d$, no out of thermal equilibrium effects appear as far as the thermalization of the atom is concerned, and a finite thick dielectric slab with a tiny imaginary part in the relative permittivity $\operatorname{Im} \epsilon$ behaves like a half space dielectric substrate if $\frac{\operatorname{Im} \epsilon}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Re}\epsilon-1}} \frac{d}{\lambda_0} > 1$ is satisfied, where $\lambda_0$ is the transition wavelength of the atom. This condition can serve as a guide for an experimental verification, using a dielectric substrate of a finite thickness, of the effects that arise from out of thermal equilibrium fluctuations with a half-space (infinite thickness) dielectric.

abstract: Quantum algorithm is an algorithm for solving mathematical problems using quantum systems encoded as information, which is found to outperform classical algorithms in some specific cases. The objective of this study is to develop a quantum algorithm for finding the roots of nth degree polynomials where n is any positive integer. In classical algorithm, the resources required for solving this problem increase drastically when n increases and it would be impossible to practically solve the problem when n is large. It was found that any polynomial can be rearranged into a corresponding companion matrix, whose eigenvalues are roots of the polynomial. This leads to a possibility to perform a quantum algorithm where the number of computational resources increase as a polynomial of n. In this study, we construct a quantum circuit representing the companion matrix and use eigenvalue estimation technique to find roots of polynomial.

A proposal based on a pair of two-level atoms strongly coupled to a one-dimenisonal waveguide showed a promising behavior based on a semi-classical study [Fratini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 243601 (2014)]. Our study in the full quantum regime shows that, in such a device, rectification is a purely multi-photon effect. For an input field in a coherent state, rectification reaches up to $70\%$ for the range of power in which one of the two atoms is excited, but not both.

abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model of two anisotropically interacting spins in a magnetic field is proposed as a working substance of a quantum Otto engine to explore and exploit the anisotropy effects for the optimization of engine operation. Three different cases for the adiabatic branches of the cycle have been considered. In the first two cases, either the magnetic field or coupling strength are changed; while in the third case, both the magnetic field and the coupling strength are changed by the same ratio. The system parameters, for which the engine can operate similar to or dramatically different than the engines of a single qubit or of non-interacting or non-isotropic interacting spins are determined. The role of anisotropy to open new operational windows, inaccessible to single spin or non-interacting or non-isotropic interacting spins, to enhance cooperative work, and to optimize maximum work with high efficiency, as well as to operate the engine near the Carnot bound is revealed.

abstract: We examine one asymmetric adnd two fully symmetric Gaussian continuous-variable systems in terms of their tripartite and bipartite entanglement properties. We treat pure states and are able to find analytic solutions using the undepleted pump approximation for the Hamiltonian models, and standard beamsplitter relations for a model that mixes the outputs of optical parametric oscillators. Our two symmetric systems exhibit perfect tripartite correlations, but only in the unphysical limit of infinite squeezing. For more realistic squeezing parameters, all three systems exhibit both tripartite and bipartite entanglement. We conclude that none of the outputs are completely analogous to either GHZ or W states, but there are parameter regions where they produce T states introduced by Adesso \etal The qualitative differences in the output states for different interaction parameters indicate that continuous-variable tripartite quantum information systems offer a versatility not found in bipartite systems.

Standard telecommunication components allow one to efficiently implement quantum communication by measuring field quadratures (continuous variables). This opens the possibility to adapt our Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) to quantum key distribution (QKD). First satellite measurement campaigns are currently validating our approach.

abstract: The quantum mechanical one-dimensional (1D) Coulomb-like potential $1/|x|$ is treated in this paper by direct Fourier transformation of the Schroedinger equation. To this purpose, a specific regularization technique is introduced, the solutions turning out to be independent of the regularization parameter. Projecting the momentum space from the real line on the circle, in an analogy with Fock's treatment of the 3D case, the equation is found to admit an $O(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is responsible for the double degeneracy of energy levels. Employing the boundary condition of vanishing wave function at infinite momenta, the symmetry spontaneously breaks, removing the unwanted degeneracy.

With reduced detector dark counts, precertification will be immediately useful in quantum communication.

abstract: Nonfreeness is an entropy functional that ascribes an amount of "correlation" to many-fermion states. The nonfreeness of a many-fermion state equals the minimum of its entropy relative to all "free" states, the states we deem to be "uncorrelated." Slater determinant states and their "substates" are free; the remaining free states are limits of such states. Correlation functionals closely related to nonfreeness can be defined in terms of Renyi entropies; nonfreeness is the one that uses Shannon entropy. These correlation functionals all share desirable additivity and monotonicity properties, but nonfreeness has additional attractive properties related to entropy maximization and statistical mechanics.

abstract: We define a deformed kinetic energy operator for a discrete position space with finite number of points. The structure may be either periodic or nonperiodic with well-defined end points. It is shown that for the nonperiodic case, the translation operator becomes nonunitary due to the end points. This uniquely defines an algebra which has the desired unique representation. Energy eigenvalues and energy wave functions for both cases are found. At the continuum limit, the solution for the nonperiodic case becomes the same as the solution of infinite one dimensional square well and the periodic case solution becomes the same as the solution of a particle in a box with periodic boundary conditions.

abstract: Broadband quantum memories hold great promise as multiplexing elements in future photonic quantum information protocols. Alkali vapour Raman memories combine high-bandwidth storage, on-demand read-out, and operation at room temperature without collisional fluorescence noise. However, previous implementations have required large control pulse energies and suffered from four-wave mixing noise. Here we present a Raman memory where the storage interaction is enhanced by a low-finesse birefringent cavity tuned into simultaneous resonance with the signal and control fields, dramatically reducing the energy required to drive the memory. By engineering anti-resonance for the anti-Stokes field, we also suppress the four-wave mixing noise and report the lowest unconditional noise floor yet achieved in a Raman-type warm vapour memory, $(15\pm2)\times10^{-3}$ photons per pulse, with a total efficiency of $(9.5\pm0.5)$%.

We report many-particle effects that enhance the optimal work output per cycle and the associated engine efficiency for exclusion statistics varying from bosons to semions and decrease it otherwise. In particular, we report for Bose statistics a many-particle quantum enhancement of the engine efficiency by up to $\sim$50 percent with respect to the single-particle case.

abstract: We study the dynamics of photonic quantum circuits consisting of nodes coupled by quantum channels. We are interested in the regime where time delay in communication between the nodes is significant. This includes the problem of quantum feedback, where a quantum signal is fed back on a system with a time delay. We develop a matrix product state approach to solve the Quantum Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation with time delays, which accounts in an efficient way for the entanglement of nodes with the stream of emitted photons in the waveguide, and thus the non-Markovian character of the dynamics. We illustrate this approach with two paradigmatic quantum optical examples: two coherently driven distant atoms coupled to a photonic waveguide with a time delay, and a driven atom coupled to its own output field with a time delay as an instance of a quantum feedback problem.

abstract: We describe the action of the symplectic group on the homogeneous space of squeezed states (quantum blobs) and extend this action to the semigroup. We then extend the metaplectic representation to the metaplectic (or oscillator) semigroup and study the properties of such an extension using Bargmann-Fock space. The shape geometry of squeezing is analyzed and noncommuting elements from the symplectic semigroup are proposed to be used in simultaneous monitoring of noncommuting quantum variables - which should lead to fractal patterns on the manifold of squeezed states.

abstract: Quantum Stein's Lemma is a cornerstone of quantum statistics and concerns the problem of correctly identifying a quantum state, given the knowledge that it is one of two specific states ($\rho$ or $\sigma$). It was originally derived in the asymptotic i.i.d. setting, in which arbitrarily many (say, $n$) identical copies of the state ($\rho^{\otimes n}$ or $\sigma^{\otimes n}$) are considered to be available. In this setting, the lemma states that, for any given upper bound on the probability $\alpha_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\sigma$, the probability $\beta_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\rho$ decays exponentially in $n$, with the rate of decay converging to the relative entropy of the two states. The second order asymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing, which establishes the speed of convergence of this rate of decay to its limiting value, was derived in the i.i.d. setting independently by Tomamichel and Hayashi, and Li. We extend this result to settings beyond i.i.d.. Examples of these include Gibbs states of quantum spin systems (with finite-range, translation-invariant interactions) at high temperatures.

abstract: The advent of quantum computing has challenged classical conceptions of which problems are efficiently solvable in our physical world. This motivates the general study of how physical principles bound computational power. A major roadblock to such a study is that quantum computation is phrased in the language of Hilbert spaces, which lacks direct operational significance -- making connections to physical principles difficult to uncover. In contrast, the framework of general probabilistic theories provides a clear-cut operational language in which to address this question. In this paper we show that some of the common machinery of quantum computation -- namely reversible controlled transformations and the phase kick-back mechanism -- exist in any general theory with a well-defined notion of information. These results provide the tools for an exploration of the structure of computational algorithms and how they connect to physical principles. We show in such theories that non-trivial interference behaviour is a general resource for post-classical computation. Motivated by the intimate connection between interference and phase in quantum theory, we introduce a framework that relates higher-order (post-quantum) interference, originally defined by Sorkin, and phase transformations. This framework -- via the generalised phase kick-back -- is used to provide evidence that theories with higher-order interference can solve problems intractable on a quantum computer. Additionally, using the existence of reversible controlled transformations, higher-order interference is shown to imply the existence of post-quantum particle types.

abstract: We study the transmission of information and correlations through quantum fields in cosmological backgrounds. With this aim, we make use of quantum information tools to quantify the classical and quantum correlations induced by a quantum massless scalar field in two particle detectors, one located in the early universe (Alice's) and the other located at a later time (Bob's). In particular, we focus on two phenomena: a) the consequences on the transmission of information of the violations of the strong Huygens principle for quantum fields, and b) the analysis of the field vacuum correlations via correlation harvesting from Alice to Bob. We will study a standard cosmological model first and then assess whether these results also hold if we use other than the general relativistic dynamics. As a particular example, we will study the transmission of information through the Big Bounce, that replaces the Big Bang, in the effective dynamics of Loop Quantum Cosmology.

abstract: Quantum theory presents us with the tools for potential computational and communication complexity advantages over classical theory. It has been suggested that this quantum advantage in both tasks is because quantum theory has both entangled states and entangling dynamics. Within a framework of general physical theories, one can construct theories that excel even quantum theory at communication tasks but at the cost of faring worse at computational tasks, and vice versa. So while quantum computation and communication complexity are sub-optimal when considered separately in this framework, quantum theory achieves a trade-off in power between the two. Is such a trade-off a general feature of theories in this framework? In this work we provide strong evidence for the existence of such a trade-off by utilising tools from computational complexity, in particular the tools of computations with advice and proofs. We give general bounds on the complexity of these scenarios and use them to argue that quantum theory achieves an optimal balance in the trade-off. If such a conjecture is borne out, it would provide a reason why nature chose quantum theory over every other theory in this framework. One of our results provides a new proof that QMA is contained in PP which does not make use of any uniquely quantum structure, and thus may be of independent interest.

abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing universal steering criteria that are applicable to arbitrary bipartite states and measurement settings of the steering party. The same framework is also useful for studying the joint measurement problem. Based on the data-processing inequality for an extended R\'enyi relative entropy, we then introduce a family of universal steering inequalities, which detect steering much more efficiently than those inequalities known before. As illustrations, we show unbounded violation of a steering inequality for assemblages constructed from mutually unbiased bases and establish an interesting connection between maximally steerable assemblages and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases. We also provide a single steering inequality that can detect all bipartite pure states of full Schmidt rank. In the course of study, we generalize a number of results intimately connected to data-processing inequalities, which are of independent interest.

abstract: The Comment of Brown and Carrington Jr. (BC) has two main points: 1) that the contraction idea of Shimshovitz and Tannor (ST) can be used for any DVR basis, not necessarily periodic, and 2) that the biorthogonal basis introduced by ST is unnecessary. We fully agree with the first point and in fact have several works that were in press at the time of the Comment that illustrate this. On the second point we show that BC implicitly use the biorthogonal basis of ST.

abstract: We reveal that quadrature squeezing can result in significantly better quantum-estimation performance with quantum heterodyne detection (of H. P. Yuen and J. H. Shapiro) as compared to quantum homodyne detection for Gaussian states, which touches an important aspect in the foundational understanding of these two schemes. Taking single-mode Gaussian states as examples, we show analytically that the competition between the errors incurred during tomogram processing in homodyne detection and the Arthurs-Kelly uncertainties arising from simultaneous incompatible quadrature measurements in heterodyne detection can often lead to the latter giving more accurate estimates. This observation is also partly a manifestation of a fundamental relationship between the respective data uncertainties for the two schemes. In this sense, quadrature squeezing can be used to overcome intrinsic quantum-measurement uncertainties in heterodyne detection.

abstract: Although quantum computers are capable of solving problems like factoring exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, determining the resources responsible for their computational power remains unclear. An important class of problems where quantum computers possess an advantage is phase estimation, which includes applications like factoring. We introduce a new computational model based on a single squeezed state resource that can perform phase estimation, which we call the power of one qumode. This model is inspired by an interesting computational model known as deterministic quantum computing with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using the power of one qumode, we identify that the amount of squeezing is sufficient to quantify the resource requirements of different computational problems based on phase estimation. In particular, it establishes a quantitative relationship between the resources required for factoring and DQC1. For example, we find the squeezing required to factor has an exponential scaling whereas no squeezing (i.e., a coherent state) is already sufficient to solve the hardest problem in DQC1.

abstract: An ensemble of electron spins with hyperfine coupled nuclei is a promising system for testing and developing ideas of quantum control and quantum error correction. We have built an X-band pulsed electron spin resonance spectrometer designed to achieve high fidelity microwave control of electron spins, including a loop-gap resonator for sub-millimeter sized samples that allows for relatively broadband control. We employ a single-qubit randomized benchmarking protocol of the Clifford gates to quantify the average gate errors. Improvements are achieved through phase transient correction, hardware configuration optimization, and the design of a preparation pulse sequence to reduce inhomogeneous broadening effects. The best average fidelity for the single-qubit Clifford gates obtained here is 99.2%.

abstract: Quantum optics did not, and could not, flourish without the laser. The present paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a history of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what are the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light? The answers do, however, show, in a quantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up to $\sim 10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a light bulb. Some of this paper is based on material I use to introduce advanced undergraduate students to quantum optics. The theory presented is mostly quite simple, and yet it is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to my knowledge. The obvious answer, ``laser light is coherent'', is, I argue, so vague that it must be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A specific version, ``laser light is in a coherent state'', is simply wrong in this context, since both laser light and thermal light can be described by a coherent state, though necessarily one that varies stochastically in space. Nevertheless, this perspective does reveal a profound difference between them, in that this description (a stochastically varying coherent state) is the only simple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this implies the (perhaps new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are indistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams. I hope that other educators find this material useful; it may contain surprises even for researchers who have been in the field longer than I have. But I cannot finish the abstract without answering the titular question: four --- high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable intensity.

abstract: The photon spectrum in macrocoherent atomic de-excitation via radiative emission of neutrino pairs (RENP) has been proposed as a sensitive probe of the neutrino mass spectrum, capable of competing with conventional neutrino experiments. In this paper we revisit this intriguing possibility, presenting an alternative method for inducing large coherence in a target based on adiabatic techniques. More concretely, we propose the use of a modified version of Coherent Population Return (CPR), namely double CPR, that turns out to be extremely robust with respect to the experimental parameters, and capable of inducing a coherence close to 100% in the target.

abstract: Measurement is one of the most counter-intuitive aspects of quantum physics. Frequent measurements of a quantum system lead to quantum Zeno dynamics where time evolution becomes confined to a subspace defined by the projections. However, weak measurement performed at a finite rate is also capable of locking the system into such a Zeno subspace in an unconventional way: by Raman-like transitions via virtual intermediate states outside this subspace, which are not forbidden. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of non-Hermitian dynamics by showing that the stochastic competition between measurement and a system's own dynamics can be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We obtain an analytic solution for ultracold bosons in a lattice and show that a dark state of the tunnelling operator is a steady state in which the observable's fluctuations are zero and tunnelling is suppressed by destructive matter-wave interference. This opens a new venue of investigation beyond the canonical quantum Zeno dynamics and leads to a new paradigm of competition between global measurement backaction and short-range atomic dynamics.

abstract: We show that global light scattering from ultracold fermions in an optical lattice into a cavity can be used for tailoring local properties of the atomic system. Quantum measurement backaction strongly affects the evolution of the atoms and leads to quantum states with spatial modulations of the density and magnetisation. We propose different detection schemes for realising antiferromagnetic states and density waves. We demonstrate that such long-range correlations are a consequence of the global but spatially structured measurement backaction and cannot be realized with local addressing.

Based on the same quantum infrastructure, we also propose a loss tolerant quantum position verification scheme, which could allow the QKD users to initiate the QKD process without relying on pre-shared key.

abstract: We present systematic measurements of the quality factors of surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators on ST-X quartz in the gigahertz range at a temperature of $10 \, \textrm{mK}$. We demonstrate a internal quality factor $Q_\mathrm{i}$ approaching $0.5$ million at $0.5 \, \textrm{GHz}$ and show that $Q_\mathrm{i}\geq4.0\times10^4$ is achievable up to $4.4 \, \textrm{GHz}$. We show evidence for a polynomial dependence of propagation loss on frequency, as well as a weak drive power dependence of $Q_\mathrm{i}$ that saturates at low power, the latter being consistent with coupling to a bath of two-level systems. Our results indicate that SAW resonators are promising devices for integration with superconducting quantum circuits.

abstract: A quantum system interacting with its environment is subject to dephasing which ultimately destroys the information it holds. Using a superconducting qubit, we experimentally show that this dephasing has both dynamic and geometric origins. It is found that geometric dephasing, which is present even in the adiabatic limit and when no geometric phase is acquired, can either reduce or restore coherence depending on the orientation of the path the qubit traces out in its projective Hilbert space. It accompanies the evolution of any system in Hilbert space subjected to noise.

abstract: Quantum systems can be correlated in ways that classical systems can not. A wide variety of non-classical forms of correlation exist: amongst the best known are entanglement and discord. Quantum correlations can be used to enhance measurement accuracy and energy transport. This paper shows that quantum correlations -- in the form of discord -- are mandatory for any energy transport. Without discord, energy transport cannot occur. Moreover, we show that the initial rate of heat transfer between two systems prepared at different temperatures is directly proportional to the rate of increase in diagonal/energetic discord between the systems. We measured the increase of energetic discord induced by nanoscale heat flow across an aluminum-sapphire interface. The rate of increase of discord is measured to be 4.28*10^24 bits m^{-2} K^{-1} s^{-1}.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.05044
abstract: We present a new quantum secret sharing protocol based on recent advances in Mermin-type contextuality scenarios, which is provably secure against postquantum nonsignaling attackers. It is a fundamental assumption of secret sharing protocols that not all players are trusted parties, and that some may collude amongst themselves and with eavesdroppers to break confidentiality. To this extent, quantum secret sharing introduces a new layer of security, enabling eavesdropping detection via entangled states and non-commuting observables. A more thorough security analysis, however, becomes crucial if the protocol relies on untrusted devices for its implementation: for example, it cannot be excluded that some players may collude with the device supplier. In this paper, we put recent developments in Mermin-type contextuality to work in a new quantum secret sharing protocol. The maximal contextuality (aka maximal non-locality, or zero local fraction) demonstrated by the measurement scenarios results in strong device-independent security against nonsignaling attackers -- be they classical, quantum or postquantum -- which can be operationally established by means of minimal statistical analysis.

Some coupling tensors of various ranks are introduced that couple the magnetodielectric medium with the electromagnetic field. The polarization and magnetization fields of the medium are defined in terms of the coupling tensors and the oscillators modeling the medium. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the medium are obtained in terms of the coupling tensors. It is shown that the electric field satisfy an integral equation in frequency domain. The integral equation is solved by an iteration method and the electric field is found up to an arbitrary accuracy.

abstract: We try to find an optimal quantum measurement for generalized quantum state discrimination problems, which include the problem of finding an optimal measurement maximizing the average correct probability with and without a fixed rate of inconclusive results and the problem of finding an optimal measurement in the Neyman-Pearson strategy. We propose an approach in which the optimal measurement is obtained by solving a modified version of the original problem. In particular, the modified problem can be reduced to one of finding a minimum error measurement for a certain state set, which is relatively easy to solve. We clarify the relationship between optimal solutions to the original and modified problems, with which one can obtain an optimal solution to the original problem in some cases. Moreover, as an example of application of our approach, we present an algorithm for numerically obtaining optimal solutions to generalized quantum state discrimination problems.

abstract: This research note suggests a new way to realize a high speed direct encryption based on quantum detection theory. The conventional cipher is designed by a mathematical algorithm and its security is evaluated by the complexity of the algorithm for cryptanalysis and ability of computers. This kind of cipher cannot exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography,and it can be decrypted with probability one in principle by trying all the possible keys against the data length equal to the secret key length. A cipher with quantum effect in physical layer may exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography. The quantum stream cipher by $\alpha/\eta$ or Yuen-2000 protocol (Y-00) which operates at Gbit/sec is a typical example of such a cipher. That is, ciphertext of mathematical cipher with a secret key is masked by quantum noise of laser light when an eavesdropper observes optical signals as a ciphertext of the mathematical cipher, while the legitimate receiver does not suffer the quantum noise effect. As a result, the inherent difference of accuracy of ciphertext between eavesdropper and legitimate receiver arises. This is a necessary condition to exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography. In this note, we present a new method to generate an inherent difference of accuracy of the ciphertext, taking into account a fundamental properties of quantum detection schemes.

abstract: We describe an approach to electrically control the strong interaction between a single electron spin and the vibrational motion of a suspended carbon nanotube resonator. The strength of the deflection-induced spin-phonon coupling is dependent on the wavefunction of the electron confined in a lateral carbon nanotube quantum dot. An electrical field along the nanotube shifts the effective center of the quantum dot, leading to the corresponding modification of the spin-phonon strength. Numerical simulations with experimentally reachable parameters show that high fidelity quantum state transfer between mechanical and spin qubits driven by electrical pulses is feasible. Our results form the basis for the fully electrical control of the coherent interconvertion between light and spin qubits and for manufacturing electrically driven quantum information processing systems.

Therefore the claim that Braak's solution is not complete is incorrect.

abstract: BosonSampling is an intermediate model of quantum computation where linear-optical networks are used to solve sampling problems expected to be hard for classical computers. Since these devices are not expected to be universal for quantum computation, it remains an open question of whether any error-correction techniques can be applied to them, and thus it is important to investigate how robust the model is under natural experimental imperfections, such as losses and imperfect control of parameters. Here we investigate the complexity of BosonSampling under photon losses---more specifically, the case where an unknown subset of the photons are randomly lost at the sources. We show that, if $k$ out of $n$ photons are lost, then we cannot sample classically from a distribution that is $1/n^{\Theta(k)}$-close (in total variation distance) to the ideal distribution, unless a $\text{BPP}^{\text{NP}}$ machine can estimate the permanents of Gaussian matrices in $n^{O(k)}$ time. In particular, if $k$ is constant, this implies that simulating lossy BosonSampling is hard for a classical computer, under exactly the same complexity assumption used for the original lossless case.

We identify the conditions under which $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric microcavities allow to improve sensitivity beyond what is achievable in loss-only systems. We discuss its application to the detection of mechanical motion, and show that the sensitivity is significantly enhanced in the vicinity of the transition point from unbroken- to broken-$\mathcal{PT}$ regimes. We believe that our results open a new direction for $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric physical systems and it may find use in ultra-high precision metrology and sensing.

abstract: We report an experimental realization of adaptive Bayesian quantum state tomography for two-qubit states. Our implementation is based on the adaptive experimental design strategy proposed in [F.Husz\'ar and N.M.T.Houlsby, Phys.Rev.A 85, 052120 (2012)] and provides an optimal measurement approach in terms of the information gain. We address the practical questions, which one faces in any experimental application: the influence of technical noise, and behavior of the tomographic algorithm for an easy to implement class of factorized measurements. In an experiment with polarization states of entangled photon pairs we observe a lower instrumental noise floor and superior reconstruction accuracy for nearly-pure states of the adaptive protocol compared to a non-adaptive. At the same time we show, that for the mixed states the restriction to factorized measurements results in no advantage for adaptive measurements, so general measurements have to be used.

abstract: Standard quantum state preparation methods work by preparing a required state locally and then distributing it to a distant location by a free-space propagation. We instead study procedures of preparing a target state at a remote location in the presence of an interacting background medium on which no control is required, manipulating only local dissipation. In mathematical terms, we characterize a set of reduced steady states stabilizable by local dissipation. An explicit local method is proposed by which one can construct a wanted one-site reduced steady state at an arbitrary remote site in a lattice of any size and geometry. In the chain geometry we also prove uniqueness of such a steady state. We demonstrate that the convergence time to fixed precision is smaller than the inverse gap, and study robustness of the scheme to different medium interactions.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation, which recently attained a considerable attention, offers a promising approach for implementation of fast, universal, and robust quantum information processing. In this all-geometric approach, quantum gates are all based on non-adiabatic extensions of the geometric Berry phase effects. Apart from its fundamental and conceptual aspects, physical realizations of proposed mathematical structures play central role in the development of large-scale quantum computation. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible nano-engineered solid-state structure to realize geometric quantum computation via non-adiabatic quantum holonomies. We use a system of three coupled quantum dots containing a single electron, where two states of a double quantum-dot charge qubit interact through an intermediate quantum dot. Careful control of the inter-dot tunneling parameters makes it possible to create a geometric model system, which allows for robust and efficient quantum information processing.

abstract: We study the performance of a partially correlated amplitude damping channel acting on two qubits. We derive lower bounds for the single-shot classical capacity by studying two kinds of quantum ensembles, one which allows to maximize the Holevo quantity for the memoryless channel and the other allowing the same task but for the full-memory channel. In these two cases, we also show the amount of entanglement which is involved in achieving the maximum of the Holevo quantity. For the single-shot quantum capacity we discuss both a lower and an upper bound, achieving a good estimate for high values of the channel transmissivity. We finally compute the entanglement-assisted classical channel capacity.

abstract: Quantum repeaters are critical components for distributing entanglement over long distances in presence of unavoidable optical losses during transmission. Stimulated by Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller protocol, many improved quantum-repeater protocols based on quantum memories have been proposed, which commonly focus on the entanglement-distribution rate. Among these protocols, the elimination of multi-photons (multi-photon-pairs) and the use of multimode quantum memory are demonstrated to have the ability to greatly improve the entanglement-distribution rate. Here, we demonstrate the storage of deterministic single photons emitted from a quantum dot in a polarization-maintaining solid-state quantum memory; in addition, multi-temporal-mode memory with $1$, $20$ and $100$ narrow single-photon pulses is also demonstrated. Multi-photons are eliminated, and only one photon at most is contained in each pulse. Moreover, the solid-state properties of both sub-systems make this configuration more stable and easier to be scalable. Our work will be helpful in the construction of efficient quantum repeaters based on all-solid-state devices

abstract: It is demonstrated how quantum mechanics emerges from the stochastic dynamics of force-carriers. It is shown that the quantum Moyal equation corresponds to some dynamic correlations between the momentum of a real particle and the position of a virtual particle, which are not present in classical mechanics. The new concept throws light on the physical meaning of quantum theory, showing that the Planck constant square is a second-second cross-cumulant. The novel approach to quantum systems is extended to the relativistic case and an expression is derived for the relativistic mass in the Wigner quantum phase-space.

abstract: Mechanical oscillators which respond to radiation pressure are a promising means of transferring quantum information between light and matter. Optical--mechanical state swaps are a key operation in this setting. Existing proposals for optomechanical state swap interfaces are only effective in the resolved sideband limit. Here, we show that it is possible to fully and deterministically exchange mechanical and optical states outside of this limit, in the common case that the cavity linewidth is larger than the mechanical resonance frequency. This high-bandwidth interface opens up a significantly larger region of optomechanical parameter space, allowing generation of non-classical motional states of high-quality, low-frequency mechanical oscillators.

abstract: Interactions between different bound states in bosonic systems can lead to pair creation. We study this process in detail by solving the Klein-Gordon equation on space-time grids in the framework of time-dependent quantum field theory. By choosing specific external field configurations, two bound states can become pseudo degenerate, which is commonly referred to as Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect. These pseudo degenerate bound states, which have complex energy eigenvalues, are related to the pseudo hermiticity of the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian. In this work, the influence of the Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect on pair production is studied. A generalized Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect, where several pairs of pseudo degenerate states appear, is found in combined electric and magnetic fields. The generalized Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect likewise triggers pair creation. The particle number in these situations obeys an exponential growth law in time enhancing the creation of bosons, which cannot be found in fermionic systems.

abstract: Recently the one-shot quantum no-signalling assisted zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel has been formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) depending only on the Choi-Kraus operator space of the channel. In this paper, we study the \textit{activated quantum no-signalling assisted zero-error classical capacity} by first allowing the assistance from some noiseless forward communication channel and later paying back the cost of the helper. We show that the one-shot activated capacity can also be formulated as a SDP and derive a number of striking properties of this number. In particular, this number is additive under direct sum, and is always greater than or equal to the super-dense coding bound. An a remarkable consequence, we find that one bit noiseless classical communication is able to fully activate any classical-quantum channel to achieve its asymptotic capacity, or the semidefinite fractional packing number. We also discuss the condition under which a noisy channel can activate an activatable channel. Interestingly, a channel is able to activate itself if its one-shot capacity is greater than or equal to the Golden Ratio - $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. We also show that the asymptotic activated capacity is still equal to the usual no-signalling assisted capacity. Finally, we show that general the asymptotic no-signalling assisted zero-error capacity does not equal to the semidefinite (fractional) packing number by an explicit construction.

abstract: We report on the spectroscopic investigation of quantum dot - micropillar cavities with unprecedented quality factors. We observe a pronounced dependency of the quality factor on the measurement scheme, and find that significantly larger quality factors can be extracted in photoreflectance compared to photoluminescence measurements. While the photoluminescence spectra of the microcavity resonances feature a Lorentzian lineshape and Q-factors up to 184,000, the reflectance spectra have a Fano-shaped asymmetry and feature significantly higher Q-factors in excess of 250,000 resulting from a full saturation of the embedded emitters. The very high quality factors in our cavities promote strong light-matter coupling with visibilities exceeding 0.5 for a single QD coupled to the cavity mode.

abstract: We derive the category-theoretic backbone of quantum theory from a process ontology. More specifically, we treat quantum theory as a theory of systems, processes and their interactions. Classical and quantum systems are treated as distinct types, of which the respective behavioural properties are also specified in terms of processes and their compositions. In this first part of a two-part overview, we define process theories, and define a very general notion of quantum type. We show how our process ontology enables us to assert causality, that is, compatibility of quantum theory and relativity theory, and we prove the no-signalling theorem. Notable contributions include new, elegant derivations of the no-broadcasting theorem, unitarity of evolution, and Stinespring dilation, all for any 'quantum' type in a general class of process theories.

abstract: We study the best Slater approximation of an $N$-fermion wave function analytically. That is, we seek the Slater determinant (constructed out of $N$ orthonormal single-particle orbitals) wave function having largest overlap with a given $N$-fermion wave function. Some simple lemmas have been established and their usefulness is demonstrated on some structured states, such as the GHZ state. In the simplest nontrivial case of three fermions in six orbitals, which the celebrated Borland-Dennis discovery is about, the best Slater approximation wave function is proven to be built out of the natural orbitals in an interesting way. We also show that the Hadamard inequality is useful for finding the best Slater approximation of some special target wave functions.

abstract: Achieving error rates that meet or exceed the fault-tolerance threshold is a central goal for quantum computing experiments, and measuring these error rates using randomized benchmarking is now routine. However, direct comparison between measured error rates and thresholds is complicated by the fact that benchmarking estimates average error rates while thresholds reflect worst-case behavior. These two can differ by orders of magnitude in the regime of interest. Here we facilitate comparison between the experimentally accessible average error rates and the worst-case quantities that arise in current threshold theorems by deriving relations between the two for a variety of physical noise sources. These include dephasing, thermal relaxation, coherent and incoherent leakage, as well as coherent unitary over and under rotation. Our results indicate that it is coherent errors that lead to an enormous mismatch between average and worst case, and we quantify how well these errors must be controlled to ensure fair comparison between average error probabilities and fault-tolerance thresholds. Finally, we show how a recently introduced measure of coherent errors called the unitarity can sometimes be used to directly quantify the distance to the threshold based on data collected from randomized benchmarking experiments.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Adaptive data collection and analysis, where data are being fed back to update the measurement settings, can greatly increase speed, precision, and reliability of the characterization of quantum systems. However, decoherence tends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider two coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled and measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of measurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy. However, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating between the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi oscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless carefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for efficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We find, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi oscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are sufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger. We also develop policies optimized for extreme initial parameter uncertainty and for the presence of imperfections in the readout.

abstract: Quantum-mechanical interpretation-related implications of the theory of uni- tary premeasurement [1] on complete measurement(objecti?cation or collapse included) are investigated in the present article with a view to give an af- ?rmative answer to the question in the title. It is argued that both Bohr's and von Neumann's ideas lead to those of Everett. Hence, the latter can be, in some sense, considered to be a continuation and elaboration of both former approaches. The importance of the idea of relativeness in Everett's theory is emphasized. To free the relative-state theory from its roots both of classicalness and of subjective observation in the argument of this study, the general or unfolded version of Everett's theory is sketched.

abstract: In this work we show how to complete some Hamilton-Jacobi solutions of linear, nonconservative classical oscillatory systems which appeared in the literature and we extend these complete solutions to the quantum mechanical case. In addition, we get the solution of the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an electric charge in an oscillating pulsing magnetic field. We also argue that for the case where a charged particle is under the action of an oscillating magnetic field, one can apply nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in order to find experimental results regarding this problem. We obtain all results analytically, showing that the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is a powerful tool to describe quantum mechanics.

Our scheme uses a digital quantum coprocessor to efficiently solve an impurity problem whose parameters are iterated to self-consistency via a classically computed feedback loop where quantum gate errors can be partly accounted for. Our results indicate that a hybrid scheme with near-future quantum devices has the potential to outperform purely classical non-equilibrium DMFT simulations.

abstract: Using different configurations of applied strong driving and weak probe fields, we find that only a single three-level superconducting quantum circuit (SQC) is enough to realize amplification, attenuation and frequency conversion of microwave fields. Such a three-level SQC has to possess $\Delta$-type cyclic transitions. Different from the parametric amplification (attenuation) and frequency conversion in nonlinear optical media, the real energy levels of the three-level SQC are involved in the energy exchange when these processes are completed. We mainly show the efficiencies of the amplification and the frequency conversion for different types of driving fields. Our study provides a new method to amplify (attenuate) microwave, realize frequency conversion, and also lays a foundation for generating single or entangled microwave photon states using a single three-level SQC.

abstract: In this work we probe the usefulness of non-Gaussian entangled states as a resource for quantum communication through atmospheric channels. We outline the initial conditions in which non-Gaussian state transfer leads to enhanced entanglement transfer relative to that obtainable via Gaussian state transfer. However, we conclude that in (anticipated) operational scenarios - where most of the non-Gaussian states to be transferred over the air are created just-in-time via photonic subtraction, addition or replacement from incoming Gaussian states - the entanglement-generation rate between stations via non-Gaussian state transfer will be substantially less than that created by direct Gaussian state transfer. The role of post-selection, distillation and quantum memory in altering this conclusion is discussed, and comparison with entanglement rates produced via single-photon technologies is provided. Our results suggest that in the near term entangled Gaussian states, squeezed beyond some modest level, offer the most attractive proposition for the distribution of entanglement through high-loss atmospheric channels. The implications of our results for entanglement-based QKD to low-earth orbit are presented.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.05772
abstract: The rate of the trace distance is used to evaluate quantum speed-up for arbitrary mixed states. Compared with some present methods, the approach based on trace distance can provide an optimal bound to the speed of the evolution. The dynamical transition from no speed-up region to speed-up region takes on in the spontaneous decay of an two-level atom with detuning. The evolution is characteristic of the alternating behavior between quantum speed-up and speed-down in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime. Under the o?ff-resonance condition, the dynamical evolution can be accelerated for short previous times and then decelerated to a normal process either in the weak or strong coupling regime. From the time-energy uncertainty relation, we demonstrate that the potential capacity for quantum speed-up evolution is closely related to the energy flow-back from the reservoir to the system. The negative decay rate for short time intervals leads to the speed-up process where the photons previously emitted by the atom are reabsorbed at a later time. The values of the spontaneous decay rate becomes positive after a long enough time, which results in the normal evolution with no speed-up potential.

comments:

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.05785
abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to the counterintuitive result of a vanishing electronic flux density upon vibrational dynamics in the electronic ground state. To circumvent this long known issue, we propose using pairwise anti-symmetrically translated vibronic densities to generate a symmetric electronic density that can be forced to satisfy the continuity equation approximately. The so-called Born-Oppenheimer broken symmetry ansatz yields all components of the flux density simultaneously while requiring only knowledge about the nuclear quantum dynamics on the electronic adiabatic ground state potential energy surface. The underlying minimization procedure is transparent and computationally inexpensive, and the solution can be computed from the standard output of any quantum chemistry program. Taylor series expansion reveals that the implicit electron dynamics originates from non-adiabatic coupling to the explicit Born-Oppenheimer nuclear dynamics. The new approach is applied to the ${\rm H}_2^+$ molecular ion vibrating in its ${}^2\Sigma^+_g$ ground state. The electronic flux density is found to have the correct nodal structure and symmetry properties at all times.

abstract: Collapse models predict a tiny violation of energy conservation, as a consequence of the spontaneous collapse of the wave function. This property allows to set experimental bounds on their parameters. We consider an ultrasoft magnetically tipped nanocantilever cooled to millikelvin temperature. The thermal noise of the cantilever fundamental mode has been accurately estimated in the range $0.03-1$ K, and any other excess noise is found to be negligible within the experimental uncertainty. From the measured data and the cantilever geometry, we estimate the upper bound on the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) collapse rate in a wide range of the correlation length $r_C$. Our upper bound improves significantly previous constraints for $r_C>10^{-6}$ m, and partially excludes the enhanced collapse rate suggested by Adler. We discuss future improvements.

abstract: In this paper, we explicitly evaluate the one-shot quantum non-signalling assisted zero-error classical capacities $\M_0^{\mathrm{QNS}}$ for qubit channels. In particular, we show that for nonunital qubit channels, $\M_0^{\mathrm{QNS}}=1$, which implies that in the one-shot setting, nonunital qubit channels cannot transmit any information with zero probability of error even when assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations. Furthermore, we show that for qubit channels, $\M_0^{\mathrm{QNS}}$ equals to the one-shot entanglement-assisted zero-error classical capacities. This means that for a single use of a qubit channel, quantum non-signalling correlations are not more powerful than shared entanglement.

abstract: Quantum computers, that may become available one day, will impact many scientific fields. Cryptography is certainly one of them since many asymmetric primitives would become insecure against an adversary with quantum capabilities. Cryptographers are already anticipating this threat by proposing and studying a number of potentially quantum-safe alternatives for those primitives. On the other hand, the situation of symmetric primitives which seem less vulnerable against quantum computing, has received much less attention. We need to prepare symmetric cryptography for the eventual arrival of the post-quantum world, as it is done with other cryptography branches. Cryptanalysis and security analysis are the only proper way to evaluate the security of symmetric primitives: our trust in specific ciphers relies on their ability to resist all known cryptanalysis tools. This requires a proper investigation of the toolkit of quantum cryptanalysis, that might include radically new attacks. This toolkit has not been much developed so far. In this paper, we study how some of the main cryptanalytic attacks behave in the post-quantum world. More specifically, we consider here quantum versions of differential and linear cryptanalysis. While running Grover's search algorithm on a quantum computer brings a quadratic speedup for brute-force attacks, we show that the situation is more subtle when considering specific cryptanalysis techniques. In particular, we give the quantum version of various classes of differential and linear attacks and show that the best attacks in the classical world do not necessarily lead to the best quantum ones. Some non-intuitive examples of application on ciphers LAC and KLEIN are provided.

abstract: We derive the relativistic energy spectrum for the modified Dirac equation by adding a harmonic oscillator potential where the coordinates and momenta are assumed to obey the commutation relation $\left[\hat{x},\hat{p}\right]=i\hbar\left(1+\eta p^2\right)$. In the nonrelativistic limit, our results are in agreement with the ones obtained {previously}. Furthermore, the extension to the construction of creation and annihilation operators for the harmonic oscillators with minimal length uncertainty relation is presented. Finally, we show that the commutation relation of the $su(1, 1)\sim so(2,1)$ algebra is satisfied by the {operators $\hat{\mathcal{L}_{\pm}}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{L}_{z}}$}.

abstract: Producing advanced quantum states of light is a priority in quantum information technologies. While remarkable progress has been made on single photons and photon pairs, multipartite correlated photon states are usually produced in purely optical systems by post-selection or cascading, with extremely low efficiency and exponentially poor scaling. Multipartite states enable improved tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics as well as implementations of complex quantum optical networks and protocols. It would be favorable to directly generate these states using solid state systems, for better scaling, simpler handling, and the promise of reversible transfer of quantum information between stationary and flying qubits. Here we use the ground states of two optically active coupled quantum dots to directly produce photon triplets. The wavefunctions of photogenerated excitons localized in these ground states are correlated via molecular hybridization and Coulomb interactions. The formation of a triexciton leads to a triple cascade recombination and sequential emission of three photons with strong correlations. The quantum dot molecule is embedded in an epitaxially grown nanowire engineered for single-mode waveguiding and improved extraction efficiency at the emission wavelength. We record 65.62 photon triplets per minute, surpassing rates of all earlier reported sources, in spite of the moderate efficiency of our detectors. Our structure and data represent a breakthrough towards implementing multipartite photon entanglement and multi-qubit readout schemes in solid state devices, suitable for integrated quantum information processing.

abstract: Bell inequalities bound the strength of classical correlations between observers measuring on a shared physical system. However, studies of physical correlations can be considered beyond the standard Bell scenario by networks of observers sharing some configuration of many independent physical systems. Here, we show how to construct Bell-type inequalities for correlations arising in any network that is a tree i.e. it does not contain a cycle. This is achieved by an iteration procedure that in each step allows one to add a branch to the tree-structured network and construct a corresponding Bell-type inequality. We explore our inequalities in several examples, in all of which we demonstrate strong violations from quantum theory.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.06049
abstract: We revisit the problem of the dynamics of quantum correlations in the exact Tavis-Cummings model. We show that many of the dynamical features of quantum discord attributed to dissipation are already present in the exact framework and are due to the well known non-linearities in the model and to the choice of initial conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis, supported by explicit analytical calculations, we find that the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord are far from being trivial or intuitive. In this context, we find states that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and distinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two quantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the same information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial conditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be used for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of manifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a counterintuitive sudden birth as the number of photons increase. We furthermore propose an experiment called quantum discord gates where discord is zero or non-zero depending on the number of photons.

abstract: Superconducting systems such as those modeled by the Kitaev Hamiltonian are found to exhibit the Zitterbewegung (ZB) oscillations. Remarkably, the dispersion relation in one-dimensional Kitaev systems allows for wavepackets of arbitrary size undergoing non-decaying ZB without any distortion, with the typical ZB amplitude being one lattice site. To motivate possible experimental interest in this dynamical aspect of superconducting systems, we further show that certain on-resonance modulation of the Hamiltonian parameter can be exploited to convert ZB oscillations to net drifting of particle's wavepacket and hole's wavepacket along opposite directions, leading to long-distance particle-hole separation.

abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for building a quantum computer. However, individual qubit coherence times are not far past the scalability threshold for quantum error correction, meaning that millions of physical devices would be required to construct a useful quantum computer. Consequently, further increases in coherence time are very desirable. In this letter, we blueprint a simple circuit consisting of two transmon qubits and two additional lossy qubits or resonators, which is passively protected against all single qubit quantum error channels through a combination of continuous driving and engineered dissipation. Photon losses are rapidly corrected through two-photon drive fields implemented with driven SQUID couplings, and dephasing from random potential fluctuations is heavily suppressed by the drive fields used to implement the multi-qubit Hamiltonian. Comparing our theoretical model to published noise estimates from recent experiments on flux and transmon qubits, we find that logical state coherence could be improved by a factor of forty or more compared to the individual qubit $T_1$ and $T_2$ using this technique. We thus demonstrate that there is substantial headroom for improving the coherence of modern superconducting qubits with a fairly modest increase in device complexity.

abstract: Quantum cryptography is the art and science of exploiting quantum mechanical effects in order to perform cryptographic tasks. While the most well-known example of this discipline is quantum key distribution (QKD), there exist many other applications such as quantum money, randomness generation, secure two- and multi-party computation and delegated quantum computation. Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries---including the impossibility of quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond the realm of QKD.

abstract: The binary (one-bit-per-photon) encoding that most existing quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols employ puts a fundamental limit on their achievable key rates, especially under high channel loss conditions associated with long-distance fiber-optic or satellite-to-ground links. Inspired by the pulse-position-modulation (PPM) approach to photon-starved classical communications, we design and demonstrate the first PPM-QKD, whose security against collective attacks is established through continuous-variable entanglement measurements that also enable a novel decoy-state protocol performed conveniently in post processing. We achieve a throughput of 8.0 Mbit/s (2.5 Mbit/s for loss equivalent to 25 km of fiber) and secret-key capacity up to 4.0 bits per detected photon, thus demonstrating the significant enhancement afforded by high-dimensional encoding. These results point to a new avenue for realizing high-throughput satellite-based or long-haul fiber-optic quantum communications beyond their photon-reception-rate limits.

These analytic calculations show how nonlinearity parameter and decay rates of two different excited states of the qubit-resonator system affect time-oscillating and decaying of Rabi oscillation.

Since density matrix nonlinearity opens a pathway to create remote quantum correlations due to a common local cause, the scheme is non-signaling.

abstract: Recent results in quantum information theory characterize quantum coherence in the context of resource theories. Here we study the relation between quantum coherence and quantum discord, a kind of quantum correlation which appears even in non-entangled states. We prove that the creation of quantum discord with multipartite incoherent operations is bounded by the amount of quantum coherence consumed in its subsystems during the process. We show how the interplay between quantum coherence consumption and creation of quantum discord works in the preparation of multipartite quantum correlated states and in the model of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1).

While the corrections to the standard quantum mechanical spectrum arise at first order in the Snyder parameter for the $l=0$ states, they are of second order for $l\neq 0$. This can be understood as due to the different topology of the regions of integration in phase space.

abstract: We investigate the parametric evolution of the real discrete spectrum of several complex PT symmetric scattering potentials of the type $V(x)=-V_1 F_e(x) + i V_2 F_o(x), V_1>0, F_e(x)>0$ by varying $V_2$ slowly. Here $e,o$ stand for even and odd parity and $F_{e,o}(\pm \infty)=0$. Unlike the case of Scarf II potential, we find a general absence of the recently explored accidental (real to real) crossings of eigenvalues in these scattering potentials. On the other hand, we find a general presence of coalescing of real pairs of eigenvalues to the complex conjugate pairs at a finite number of exceptional points. We attribute such coalescings of eigenvalues to the presence of a finite barrier (on the either side of $x=0$ ) which has been linked to a recent study of stokes phenomenon in the complex PT-symmetric potentials.

abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open systems driven by classical fields is studied in the presence of thermal bosonic environments. The decoherence process is quantitatively described by the time-convolutionless master equation. The evolution speed of an open system is related not only to the strength of driving classical field but also to the environmental temperature. The energy-state population plays a key role in the thermal QSL. Comparing with the zero-temperature reservoir, we predict that the structural reservoir at low temperatures may contribute to the acceleration of quantum decoherence. The manifest oscillation of QSL time takes on under the circumstance of classical driving fields. We also investigate the scaling property of QSL time for multi-particle noninteracting entangled systems. It is demonstrated that entanglement of open systems can be considered as one resource for improving the potential capacity of thermal quantum speedup.

abstract: Random access codes are important for a wide range of applications in quantum information. However, their implementation with quantum theory can be made in two very different ways: (i) by distributing data with strong spatial correlations violating a Bell inequality, or (ii) using quantum communication channels to create stronger-than-classical sequential correlations between state preparation and measurement outcome. Here, we study this duality of the quantum realization. We present a family of Bell inequalities tailored to the task at hand and study their quantum violations. Remarkably, we show that the use of spatial and sequential quantum correlations imposes different limitations on the performance of quantum random access codes. We also show that there exist random access codes for which spatial quantum correlations offer no gain over classical strategies, whereas sequential quantum correlations can yield an advantage. We discuss the physics behind the observed discrepancy between spatial and sequential quantum correlations.

abstract: We introduce a combination of coherent states as variational test functions for the atomic and radiation sectors to describe a system of Na three- level atoms interacting with a one-mode quantised electromagnetic field, with and without the rotating wave approximation, which preserves the symmetry presented by the Hamiltonian. These provide us with the possibility of finding analytical solutions for the ground and first excited states. We study the properties of these solutions for the V-configuration in the double resonance condition, and calculate the expectation values of the number of photons, the atomic populations, the total number of excitations, and their corresponding fluctuations. We also calculate the photon number distribution and the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix to estimate the entanglement between matter and radiation. For the first time, we exhibit analytical expressions for all of these quantities, as well as an analytical description for the phase diagram in parameter space, which distinguishes the normal and collective regions, and which gives us all the quantum phase transitions of the ground state from one region to the other as we vary the interaction parameters (the matter-field coupling constants) of the model, in functional form.

abstract: Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in terms of wavefunctions (probability amplitudes) obeying the static and the time-dependent Schroedinger equations (SE). Despite the success of this representation of the quantum world a wave-particle duality concept is required to reconcile the theory with observations (experimental measurements). A first solution to this dichotomy was introduced in the de Broglie-Bohm theory according to which a pilot wave (solution of the SE) is guiding the evolution of particle trajectories. Here, I propose a geometrization of quantum mechanics that describes the time evolution of particles as geodesic lines in a curved space, whose curvature is induced by the quantum potential. This formulation allows therefore the incorporation of all quantum effects into the geometry of space-time, as it is the case for gravitation in the general relativity.

abstract: Standard quantum mechanics assumes that events are embedded in a global causal structure such that, for every pair of events, the causal order between them is always fixed. The process matrix framework keeps the local validity of standard quantum mechanics while relaxing the assumption on the global causal structure. This allows to describe situations in which the order of events is not fixed, i.e. there are processes where it is not possible to specify whether A causes B or B causes A. Such processes are called causally nonseparable. So far, the formalism has been developed only for finite-dimensional systems and a straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions leads to singularities. Here we develop such generalization, and derive the correlations arising from a causally nonseparable process - the quantum switch - in infinite dimensions. The correlations exhibit interference which is due to superposition of processes in which A is before B and B is before A.

abstract: Point-defects in wide bandgap semiconductors are promising candidates for future applications that necessitate quantum light sources. Recently, defect-based single photon sources have been observed in ZnO that are very bright and remain photoactive from 4.5 K to room temperature. Despite several investigations, the structure and electronic states of these emitters remain unknown. In this work, we establish a procedure to distinguish a Z dipole from an XY dipole when studying quantum emitters that are randomly oriented. Our cryogenic and room temperature polarization measurements collectively establish that these unidentified ZnO quantum emitters have a Z dipole. We show that the associated absorption and emission dipoles are parallel within experimental uncertainty for all 32 individuals studied. Additionally, we apply group theory and find that assuming the defect symmetry belongs to a point-group relevant to the ZnO wurtzite lattice, the ground and excited states are orbital singlets. These results are a significant step in identifying the structure and electronic states of defect-based single photon sources in ZnO.

abstract: In Deep Learning, a well-known approach for training a Deep Neural Network starts by training a generative Deep Belief Network model, typically using Contrastive Divergence (CD), then fine-tuning the weights using backpropagation or other discriminative techniques. However, the generative training can be time-consuming due to the slow mixing of Gibbs sampling. We investigated an alternative approach that estimates model expectations of Restricted Boltzmann Machines using samples from a D-Wave quantum annealing machine. We tested this method on a coarse-grained version of the MNIST data set. In our tests we found that the quantum sampling-based training approach achieves comparable or better accuracy with significantly fewer iterations of generative training than conventional CD-based training. Further investigation is needed to determine whether similar improvements can be achieved for other data sets, and to what extent these improvements can be attributed to quantum effects.

abstract: Wallstrom's criticism of existing formulations of stochastic mechanics is that they fail to derive quantum theory because they require an \emph{ad hoc} quantization condition on the postulated velocity potential, \emph{S}, in order to derive single-valued Schr\"odinger wave functions. We propose an answer to this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue formulation of non-relativistic stochastic mechanics for spinless particles with the following hypothesis: a spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass \emph{m} always undergoes simple harmonic `zitterbewegung' (\emph{zbw}) oscillations in its instantaneous mean rest frame. With this hypothesis we show that, in the mean lab frame, \emph{S} arises as the mean \emph{zbw} phase for an ensemble of such particles, satisfies the required quantization condition, and evolves by the Nelson-Yasue stochastic equations of motion (which are thereby equivalent to the Schr\"odinger equation). The paper begins by reviewing Nelson-Yasue stochastic mechanics and Wallstrom's criticism, after which we develop a classical model of a particle of mass \emph{m} undergoing the hypothesized \emph{zbw} oscillations, with the purpose of making clear the physical assumptions of the \emph{zbw} model without the added complications of stochastic mechanics. We develop the classical model for the spinless one-particle case, without and with field interactions, and then carry out the analogous developments for a Nelson-Yasue version of this model. Using this `zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics' (ZSM) we readily derive the single-valued wave functions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics for a spinless particle in the analyzed cases. We also apply ZSM to the case of a central potential and show that it predicts angular momentum quantization.

We restrict ourselves to the case where only the positive part of the spectrum gives a contribution to the sum in partition function. We give the analytical results for high temperatures.

The energy spectra given are incorrect and the wave functions are not physically acceptable. We clarify the problem and prove that the spinor wave functions are expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions. The energy eigenvalues for the bound states are given by the solution of a transcendental equation involving the hypergeometric function.

abstract: A model of universal quantum computation with qudits ($d$-level systems) is presented in which the gates are implemented on a register entirely via fixed-form sequential interactions with ancillary qudits followed by adaptive, variable basis measurements of these ancillas. The model maintains determinism via classical feed-forward of measurement outcomes in a similar fashion to the qudit one-way model. An embedding of the qudit one-way model is given which demonstrates that the hybrid quantum-classical advantages of one-way quantum computation are also inherent in the model presented here, including the ability to implement any Clifford gate in constant depth using multiple ancillas in parallel. A model which requires only fixed basis measurements is then presented, but due to the lack of adaptive controls it can only implement universal quantum computation in a stochastic sense. Interestingly, this scheme may then be altered to recover determinism by replacing ancilla measurements with ancilla preparation. These models provide an intuitive setting for understanding the interplay between the benefits gained from classical controls, measurements and state preparation in the context of multi-valued logic ancilla-based quantum computation.

abstract: In this paper we investigate how common is the phenomenon of Finite Time Disentanglement (FTD) with respect to the set of quantum dynamics of bipartite quantum states with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Considering a quantum dynamics from a general sense, as just a continuous family of Completely Positive Trace Preserving maps (parametrized by the time variable) acting on the space of the bipartite systems, we conjecture that FTD does not happen only when all maps of the family are induced by local unitary operations. We prove that is the case for dynamics where all maps are induced by unitaries and, for pairs of qubits, where all maps are unital. Moreover, we prove some results about unitaries/CPTP maps preserving product/pure states.

abstract: Low depth measurement-based quantum computation with qudits ($d$-level systems) is investigated and a precise relationship between this powerful model and qudit quantum circuits is derived in terms of computational depth and size complexity. To facilitate this investigation a qudit `unbounded fan-out' circuit model, in which a qudit may be quantum-copied into an arbitrary number of ancillas in a single time-step, is introduced and shown to be capable of implementing interesting $n$-qudit unitaries in constant depth. A procedure for reducing the quantum computational depth in the measurement-based model is then proposed and using this it is then shown that there is a logarithmic depth separation between the depth complexity of qudit measurement-based computation and circuits composed of gates act on a bounded number of qudits. The relationship is made precise by showing that the depth complexity of the qudit measurement-based model is exactly equivalent to that of unbounded fan-out circuits. These results illustrate that the well-known advantages inherent in qubit measurement-based quantum computation are also applicable to the higher-dimensional generalisation. As qudits are both naturally available and have been shown to provide fundamental advantages over binary logic encodings, this then suggests that the qudit measurement-based model is a particularly appealing paradigm for universal quantum computation.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the cohering power of unitary operation, which is defined by the maximum coherence caused by an unitary operation acting on incoherent states. We obtain that the optimizations can be reduced to a simple discrete set that depends only on the fixed reference basis. Then, we investigate that the de-cohering power of quantum channel, which is defined by the maximum decay of coherence caused by quantum channel acting on the maximally coherent states. Based on the relative entropy, we discuss the cohering power of 1-qubit and 2-qubit unitary operations and the de-cohering power of quantum channel on 1-qubit system. Finally, we study the relation between the coherence and the discord via incoherent operation.

abstract: The resource theory of asymmetry is a framework for classifying and quantifying the symmetry-breaking properties of both states and operations relative to a given symmetry. In the special case where the symmetry is the set of translations generated by a fixed observable, asymmetry can be interpreted as coherence relative to the observable eigenbasis, and the resource theory of asymmetry provides a framework to study this notion of coherence. We here show that this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed limits. Indeed, the very concept of speed of evolution, i.e., the inverse of the minimum time it takes the system to evolve to another (partially) distinguishable state, is a measure of asymmetry relative to the time translations generated by the system Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the celebrated Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin speed limits can be interpreted as upper bounds on this measure of asymmetry by functions which are themselves measures of asymmetry in the special case of pure states. Using measures of asymmetry that are not restricted to pure states, such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information, we obtain extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound which are significantly tighter in the case of mixed states. We also clarify some confusions in the literature about coherence and asymmetry, and show that measures of coherence are a proper subset of measures of asymmetry.

abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate a hybrid system of two optomechanically coupled resonators, which exhibits induced transparency. This is realized by coupling an optical ring resonator to a toroid. In the semiclassical analyses, the system displays bistabilities, isolated branches (isolas) and self-sustained oscillation dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the induced transparency transparency window sensitively relies on the mechanical motion. Based on this fact, we show that the described system can be used as a weak force detector and the optimal sensitivity can beat the standard quantum limit without using feedback control or squeezing under available experimental conditions.

abstract: We study the energy level crossing behavior in two-dimensional quantum well with the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). By mapping the SOC Hamiltonian onto an anisotropic Rabi model, we obtain the approximate ground state and its quantum Fisher information (QFI) via performing a unitary transformation. We find that the energy level crossing can occur in the quantum well system within the available parameters rather than in cavity and circuit quantum eletrodynamics systems. Futhermore, the influence of two kinds of SOCs on the QFI is investigated and an intuitive explanation from the viewpoint of the stationary perturbation theory is given.

abstract: Single-photons are key elements of many future quantum technologies, be it for the realisation of large-scale quantum communication networks for quantum simulation of chemical and physical processes or for connecting quantum memories in a quantum computer. Scaling quantum technologies will thus require efficient, on-demand, sources of highly indistinguishable single-photons. Semiconductor quantum dots inserted in photonic structures are ultrabright single photon sources, but the photon indistinguishability is limited by charge noise induced by nearby surfaces. The current state of the art for indistinguishability are parametric down conversion single-photon sources, but they intrinsically generate multiphoton events and hence must be operated at very low brightness to maintain high single photon purity. To date, no technology has proven to be capable of providing a source that simultaneously generates near-unity indistinguishability and pure single photons with high brightness. Here, we report on such devices made of quantum dots in electrically controlled cavity structures. We demonstrate on-demand, bright and ultra-pure single photon generation. Application of an electrical bias on deterministically fabricated devices is shown to fully cancel charge noise effects. Under resonant excitation, an indistinguishability of $0.9956\pm0.0045$ is evidenced with a $g^{2}(0)=0.0028\pm0.0012$. The photon extraction of $65%$ and measured brightness of $0.154\pm0.015$ make this source $20$ times brighter than any source of equal quality. This new generation of sources open the way to a new level of complexity and scalability in optical quantum manipulation.

abstract: Relativistic effects on the precision of quantum metrology for particle detectors, such as two-level atoms are studied. The quantum Fisher information is used to estimate the phase sensitivity of atoms in non-inertial motions or in gravitational fields. The Unruh-DeWitt model is applicable to the investigation of the dynamics of a uniformly accelerated atom weakly coupled to a massless scalar vacuum field. When a measuring device is in the same relativistic motion as the atom, the dynamical behavior of quantum Fisher information as a function of Rindler proper time are obtained. It is found out that monotonic decrease in phase sensitivity is characteristic of dynamics of relativistic quantum estimation. To improve relativistic quantum metrology, we reasonably take into account two reflecting plane boundaries perpendicular to each other.

abstract: We derive the explicit expression for the Casimir energy between a sphere and a 1D grating, in terms of the sphere and grating reflection matrices, and valid for arbitrary materials, sphere radius, and grating geometric parameters. We then numerically calculate the Casimir energy between a metallic (gold) sphere and a dielectric (fused silica) lamellar grating at room temperature, and explore its dependence on the sphere radius, grating-sphere separation, and lateral displacement. We quantitatively investigate the geometrical dependence of the interaction, which is sensitive to the grating height and filling factor, and show how the sphere can be used as a local sensor of the Casimir force geometric features. To this purpose we mostly concentrate on separations and sphere radii of the same order of the grating parameters (here of the order of one micrometer). We also investigate the lateral component of the Casimir force, resulting from the absence of translational invariance. We compare our results with those obtained within the proximity force approximation (PFA). When applied to the sphere only, PFA overestimates the strength of the attractive interaction, and we find that the discrepancy is larger in the sphere-grating than in the sphere-plane geometry. On the other hand, when PFA is applied to both sphere and grating, it provides a better estimate of the exact results, simply because the effect of a single grating is underestimated, thus leading to a partial compensation of errors.

abstract: This article reviews efforts to build a new type of quantum device, which combines an ensemble of electronic spins with long coherence times, and a small-scale superconducting quantum processor. The goal is to store over long times arbitrary qubit states in orthogonal collective modes of the spin-ensemble, and to retrieve them on-demand. We first present the protocol devised for such a multi-mode quantum memory. We then describe a series of experimental results using NV center spins in diamond, which demonstrate its main building blocks: the transfer of arbitrary quantum states from a qubit into the spin ensemble, and the multi-mode retrieval of classical microwave pulses down to the single-photon level with a Hahn-echo like sequence. A reset of the spin memory is implemented in-between two successive sequences using optical repumping of the spins.

Our general Hamiltonian encompasses many previously studied lattice models as special cases. We provide numerical results regarding domains of observability and exceptional points, and discuss the possibility of explicit construction of general metric operators (which in turn determine all the physical Hilbert spaces). The condition of computational simplicity for the metrics motivates the introduction of certain one-parametric special cases, which consequently admit closed-form extrapolation patterns of the low-dimensional results.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality has recently been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. Experimentally Bell's nonlocality is usually tested by quantum violation of the Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in the two-qubit system. Bell's nonlocality is the strongest type of nonlocality, also due this reason Bell-test experiments have encountered both the locality loophole and the detection loophole for a very long time. As a weaker nonlocality, EPR steering naturally escapes from the locality loophole and is correspondingly easier to be demonstrated without the detection loophole. In this work, we trigger an extraordinary approach to investigate Bell's nonlocality, which is strongly based on the EPR steering. We present a theorem, showing that for any two-qubit state $\tau$, if its mapped state $\rho$ is EPR steerable, then the state $\tau$ must be Bell nonlocal. The result not only pinpoints a deep connection between EPR steering and Bell's nonlocality, but also sheds a new light to realize a loophole-free Bell-test experiment (without the CHSH inequality) through the violation of steering inequality.

abstract: In the present work we investigate the existence of multiple nonequilibrium steady states in a coherently-driven XY lattice of dissipative two-level systems. A commonly-used mean-field ansatz, in which spatial correlations are neglected, predicts a bistable behavior with a sharp shift between low- and high-density states. In contrast one-dimensional matrix product methods reveal these effects to be artifacts of the mean-field approach, with both disappearing once correlations are taken fully into account. Instead a bunching-antibunching transition emerges. This indicates that alternative approaches should be considered for higher spatial dimensions, where classical simulations are currently infeasible. Thus we propose a circuit QED quantum simulator implementable with current technology, to enable an experimental investigation of the model considered.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate multi-user distribution of polarization entanglement using commercial tele- com wavelength division demultiplexers. The entangled photon pairs are generated from a broadband source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal using a double path setup employing a Michelson interferometer and active phase stabilisation. We test and compare demultiplexers based on various technologies and analyze the effect of their characteristics, such as losses and polarization dependence, on the quality of the distributed entanglement for three channel pairs of each demultiplexer. In all cases, we obtain a Bell inequality violation, whose value depends on the demultiplexer features. This demonstrates that entanglement can be distributed to at least three user pairs of a network from a single source. Additionally, we verify for the best demultiplexer that the violation is maintained when the pairs are distributed over a total channel attenuation corresponding to 20 km of optical fiber. These tech- niques are therefore suitable for resource-efficient practical implementations of entanglement-based quantum key distribution and other quantum communication network applications.

Linear bosonic channels are considered and specific examples of Gaussian quantum channels are given to illustrate the new framework together with the complementarity theorem.

In this note we discuss various possible definitions of coherence power. Then we prove that the coherence power of a unitary operator acting on a qubit, computed with respect to the $l_1$-coherence measure, can be calculated by maximizing its coherence gain over pure incoherent states. We proceed to show that this result fails for dimensions N>2, that is, the maximal coherence gain is found when acting on a state with non-vanishing coherence.

abstract: Quantum weirdness has been in the news recently, thanks to an ingenious new experiment by a team led by Roland Hanson, at the Delft University of Technology. Much of the coverage presents the experiment as good (even conclusive) news for spooky action-at-a-distance, and bad news for local realism. We point out that this interpretation ignores an alternative, namely that the quantum world is retrocausal. We conjecture that this loophole is missed because it is confused for superdeterminism on one side, or action-at-a-distance itself on the other. We explain why it is different from these options, and why it has clear advantages, in both cases.

abstract: Electron spins of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are important quantum resources for nanoscale sensing and quantum information. Combining such NV spin systems with levitated optomechanical resonators will provide a hybrid quantum system for many novel applications. Here we optically levitate a nanodiamond and demonstrate electron spin control of its built-in NV centers in low vacuum. We observe that the strength of electron spin resonance (ESR) is enhanced when the air pressure is reduced. To better understand this novel system, we also investigate the effects of trap power and measure the absolute internal temperature of levitated nanodiamonds with ESR after calibration of the strain effect. Our results show that optical levitation of nanodiamonds in vacuum not only can improve the mechanical quality of its oscillation, but also enhance the ESR contrast, which pave the way towards a novel levitated spin-optomechanical system for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics. The results also indicate potential applications of NV centers in gas sensing.

abstract: Quantum steering can be detected via the violation of steering inequalities, which provide sufficient conditions for the steerability of quantum states. Here we discuss the converse problem, namely ensuring that a state is unsteerable, and hence Bell local. We present a simple criterion, applicable to any two-qubit state, which guarantees that the state admits a local hidden state model for arbitrary projective measurements. We find new classes of unsteerable entangled states, which can thus not violate any steering or Bell inequality. In turn, this leads to sufficient conditions for a state to be only one-way steerable, and provides the simplest possible example of one-way steering. Finally, by exploiting the connection between steering and measurement incompatibility, we give a sufficient criterion for a continuous set of qubit measurements to be jointly measurable.

abstract: The observation of quantum nonlocality, i.e. quantum correlations violating a Bell inequality, implies the use of incompatible local quantum measurements. Here we consider the converse question. That is, can any set of incompatible measurements be used in order to demonstrate Bell inequality violation? Our main result is to construct a local hidden variable model for an incompatible set of qubit measurements. Specifically, we show that if Alice uses this set of measurements, then for any possible shared entangled state, and any possible dichotomic measurements performed by Bob, the resulting statistics are local. This represents significant progress towards proving that measurement incompatibility does not imply Bell nonlocality in general.

abstract: Randomness extractors, widely used in classical and quantum cryptography and other fields of computer science, e.g., derandomization, are functions which generate almost uniform randomness from weak sources of randomness. In the quantum setting one must take into account the quantum side information held by an adversary which might be used to break the security of the extractor. In the case of seeded extractors the presence of quantum side information has been extensively studied. For multi-source extractors one can easily see that high conditional min-entropy is not sufficient to guarantee security against arbitrary side information, even in the classical case. Hence, the interesting question is under which models of (both quantum and classical) side information multi-source extractors remain secure. In this work we suggest a natural model of side information, which we call the Markov model, and prove that any multi-source extractor remains secure in the presence of quantum side information of this type (albeit with weaker parameters). This improves on previous results in which more restricted models were considered and the security of only some types of extractors was shown.

We also use the framework to prove a particularly simple standard oracle separation between QCMA and AM.

abstract: The wave packet approach to neutrino oscillations provides an enlightening description of quantum decoherence induced, during propagation, by localization effects. Within this approach, we show that a deeper insight into the dynamical aspects of particle mixing can be obtained if one investigates the behavior of quantum correlations associated to flavor oscillations. By identifying the neutrino three-flavor modes with (suitably defined) three-qubit modes, the exploitation of tools of quantum information theory for mixed states allows a detailed analysis of the dynamical behavior of flavor entanglement during free propagation. This provides further elements leading to a more complete understanding of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, and a basis for possible applicative implementations. The analysis is carried out by studying the distribution of the flavor entanglement and by detecting the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement; to this aim, we perform combined investigations of the behaviors of the two-flavor concurrence and of the logarithmic negativities associated with specific bipartitions of the three flavors.

This is interesting because the gap is slightly different than in the context of Hardy's similar nonlocality argument\cite{gazi}

abstract: QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is the class of problems which, though potentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified efficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version of the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA, Merlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational resources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum resources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on single qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this grave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to QMA$_1$, i.e., QMA with one-sided error.

abstract: Optimal control theory provides recipes to achieve quantum operations with high fidelity and speed, as required in quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and computation. While technical advances have achieved the ultrastrong driving regime in many physical systems, these capabilities have yet to be fully exploited for the precise control of quantum systems, as other limitations, such as the generation of higher harmonics or the finite bandwidth of the control fields, prevent the implementation of theoretical time-optimal control. Here we present a method to achieve time-optimal control of qubit systems that can take advantage of fast driving beyond the rotating wave approximation. We exploit results from optimal control theory to design driving protocols that can be implemented with realistic, finite-bandwidth control and we find a relationship between bandwidth limitations and achievable control fidelity.

abstract: Using quantum theory, we study the propagation of an optical field in an inhomogeneous dielectric, and apply this scheme to traveling optical fields in a waveguide. We introduce a field-atom interaction Hamiltonian and derive the refractive index using quantum optics. We show that the transmission and reflection of optical fields at an interface between different materials can be described with normalized Fresnel coefficients and that this representation is related to the beam splitter operator. We then study the propagation properties of the optical fields for two types of slab waveguides: step-index and graded-index. The waveguides are divided into multiple layers to represent the spatial dependence of the optical field. We can evaluate the number of photons in an arbitrary volume in the waveguide using this procedure. Using the present method, the quantum properties of weak optical fields in a waveguide are revealed, while coherent states with higher amplitudes reduces to representation of classical waveguide optics.

abstract: We propose a new no-go theorem by proving the impossibility of constructing a deterministic quantum circuit that iterates a unitary oracle by calling it only once. Different schemes are provided to bypass this result and to approximately realize the iteration. The optimal scheme is also studied. An interesting observation is that for large number of iterations, a trivial strategy like using the identity channel has the optimal performance, and preprocessing, postprocessing, or using resources like entanglement does not help at all. Intriguingly, the number of iterations, when being large enough, does not affect the performance of the proposed schemes.

abstract: We address the problem of integrating operator equations concomitant with the dynamics of non autonomous quantum systems by taking advantage of the use of time-dependent canonical transformations. In particular, we proceed to a discussion in regard to basic examples of one-dimensional non-autonomous dynamical systems enjoying the property that their Hamiltonian can be mapped through a time-dependent linear canonical transformation into an autonomous form, up to a time-dependent multiplicative factor. The operator equations we process essentially reproduce at the quantum level the classical integrability condition for these systems. Operator series form solutions in the Bender-Dunne basis of pseudo-differential operators for one dimensional quantum system are sought for such equations. The derivation of generating functions for the coefficients involved in the \emph{minimal} representation of the series solutions to the operator equations under consideration is particularized. We also provide explicit form of operators that implement arbitrary linear transformations on the Bender-Dunne basis by expressing them in terms of the initial Weyl ordered basis elements. We then remark that the matching of the minimal solutions obtained independently in the two basis, i.e. the basis prior and subsequent the action of canonical linear transformation, is perfectly achieved by retaining only the lowest order contribution in the expression of the transformed Bender-Dunne basis elements.

abstract: Quantum pseudo-telepathy games are good examples of explaining the strangeness of quantum mechanics and demonstrating the advantage of quantum resources over classical resources. Most of the quantum pseudo-telepathy games are common interest games, nevertheless conflicting interest games are more widely used to model real world situations. Recently Pappa et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401, 2015) proposed the first two-party conflicting interest game where quantum advice enhances social optimality. In the present paper we give two new three-party conflicting interest games and show that quantum advice can enhance social optimality in a three-party setting. The first game we propose is based on the famous GHZ game which is a common interest game. The second game we propose is related to the Svetlichny inequality which demonstrates quantum mechanics cannot be explained by the local hidden variable model in a three-party setting.

abstract: We study the $\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry breaking for the scattering problem in a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian tight-binding lattice model with balanced gain and loss distributed on two adjacent sites. In the scattering process the system undergoes a transition from the exact $\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry phase to the phase with spontaneously breaking $\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry as the amplitude of complex potentials increases. Using the S-matrix method, we derive an exact discriminant, which can be used to distinguish different symmetry phases, and analytically determine the exceptional point for the symmetry breaking. In the $\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry breaking region, we also confirm the appearance of the unique feature, i.e., the coherent perfect absorption Laser, in this simple non-Hermitian lattice model. The study of the scattering problem of such a simple model provides an additional way to unveil the physical effect of non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT} $-symmetric potentials.

abstract: We investigate and compare three distinguished geometric measures of bipartite quantum correlations that have been recently introduced in the literature: the geometric discord, the measurement-induced geometric discord, and the discord of response, each one defined according to three contractive distances on the set of quantum states, namely the trace, Bures, and Hellinger distances. We establish a set of exact functional relations and inequalities between the different measures. In many cases, we determine which bounds are tight. In particular, we show that the geometric discord and the discord of response based on the Hellinger distance are easy to compute analytically for all quantum states whenever the reference subsystem is a qubit. These two measures thus provide the first instance of discords that are simultaneously fully computable, reliable (since they satisfy all the basic Axioms that must be obeyed by a proper measure of quantum correlations), and operationally viable (in terms of state distinguishability). We apply the general mathematical structure to determine the closest classical-quantum state of a given state and the maximally quantum-correlated states at fixed global state purity according to the different distances, as well as a necessary condition for a channel to be quantumness breaking.

abstract: We report a quantitative, analytical and numerical, comparison between two models of the interaction of a non-relativistic quantum particle with a thin time-dependent absorbing barrier. The first model represents the barrier by a set of time-dependent discontinuous matching conditions, which are closely related to Kottler boundary conditions used in stationary wave optics as a mathematical basis for Kirchhoff diffraction theory. The second model mimics the absorbing barrier with an off-diagonal $\delta$-potential with a time-dependent amplitude. We show that the two models of absorption agree in their predictions in a semiclassical regime -- the regime readily accessible in modern experiments with ultracold atoms.

The solution of this problem is obtained via an explicit description of the reachable set of the associated control system on SU(2). The treatment generalizes previous results on the time optimal control of two level quantum systems and suggests that similar techniques could be used to solve the minimum time control problem for a larger class of right invariant systems on Lie groups.

abstract: We investigate the relationship between two kinds of ground-state local convertibility and quantum phase transitions in XY model. The local operations and classical communications (LOCC) convertibility is examined by the majorization relations and the entanglement-assisted local operations and classical communications (E- LOCC) via Renyi entropy interception. In the phase diagram of XY model, LOCC convertibility and ELOCC convertibility of ground-states are presented and compared. It is shown that different phases in the phase dia- gram of XY model can have different LOCC or ELOCC convertibility, which can be used to detect the quantum phase transition. This study will enlighten extensive studies of quantum phase transitions from the perspective of local convertibility, e.g., finite-temperature phase transitions and other quantum many-body models.

abstract: Oblivious transfer is a powerful cryptographic primitive that is complete for secure multi-party computation. In oblivious transfer protocols a user sends one or more messages to a receiver, while the sender remains oblivious as to which messages have been received. Protocols for oblivious transfer cannot exist in a classical or fully-quantum world, but can be implemented by restricting the users' power. The isolated qubits model is a cryptographic model in which users are restricted to single-qubit operations and are not allowed to use entangling operations. Furthermore, all parties are allowed to store qubits for a long time before measuring them. In this model, a secure single-bit one-out-of-two randomised oblivious transfer protocol was recently presented by Liu. Motivated by this result, we construct a protocol for secure string one-out-of-two randomised oblivious transfer by simplifying and generalising the existing proof. We then study for the first time interactive protocols for more complex two-party functionalities in this model based on the security of our construction. In order to guarantee the composability of our construction, users are restricted to measurement at the end of each sub-protocol. It is then possible to construct secure one-out-of-two and one-out-of-k oblivious transfer protocols in the isolated qubits model. Moreover, we study secure password-based identification, where a user identifies himself to another user by evaluating the equality function on their inputs, or passwords. We use the oblivious transfer constructions mentioned above as sub-protocols to construct a secure identification protocol. Finally, we prove that constructing a secure identification protocol non-interactively is impossible, even using oblivious transfer.

In particular, we focus on phase estimation by Mach-Zehnder interferometers and show how to mitigate the conflict between the two approaches by using suitable priors.

abstract: In this paper we provide a proof of unconditional security for a semi-quantum key distribution protocol introduced in a previous work. This particular protocol demonstrated the possibility of using $X$ basis states to contribute to the raw key of the two users (as opposed to using only direct measurement results) even though a semi-quantum participant cannot directly manipulate such states. In this work we provide a complete proof of security by deriving a lower bound of the protocol's key rate in the asymptotic scenario. Using this bound we are able to find an error threshold value such that for all error rates less than this threshold, it is guaranteed that $A$ and $B$ may distill a secure secret key; for error rates larger than this threshold, $A$ and $B$ should abort. We demonstrate that this error threshold compares favorably to several fully quantum protocols. We also comment on some interesting observations about the behavior of this protocol under certain noise scenarios.

abstract: Explicitly separable density matrices are constructed for all separable two-qubits states based on Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions. For density matrices which include only two-qubits correlations the number of HS parameters is reduced to 3 by using local rotations, and for two-qubits states which include single qubit measurements, the number of parameters is reduced to 4 by local Lorentz transformations. For both cases we related the absolute values of the HS parameters to probabilities, and the outer products of various Pauli matrices were transformed to density matrices products. Simple necessary and sufficient conditions for separability are derived. We discuss related problems for three qubits. For n-qubits correlation systems the sufficient condition for separability may be improved by local transformations, related to tensor analysis.

abstract: A key objective in conducting a Bell test is to quantify the statistical evidence against a local-hidden variable model (LHVM) given that we can collect only a finite number of trials in any experiment. The notion of statistical evidence is thereby formulated in the framework of hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that the experiment can be described by an LHVM. The statistical confidence with which the null hypothesis of an LHVM is rejected is quantified by the so-called P-value, where a smaller P-value implies higher confidence. Establishing good statistical evidence is especially challenging if the number of trials is small, or the Bell violation very low. Here, we derive the optimal P-value for a large class of Bell inequalities. What's more, we obtain very sharp upper bounds on the P-value for all Bell inequalities. These values are easily computed from experimental data, and are valid even if we allow arbitrary memory in the devices. Our analysis is able to deal with imperfect random number generators, and event-ready schemes, even if such a scheme can create different kinds of entangled states. Finally, we review requirements for sound data collection, and a method for combining P-values of independent Bell experiments.

abstract: It is well known that the Mach-Zender interferometer exhibits a trade-off between the a priori which-path knowledge and the visibility of its interference pattern. This trade-off is expressed by the inequality $\mathcal{P}^2 + \mathcal{V}^2 \leq 1$, constraining the predictability $\mathcal{P}$ and visibility $\mathcal{V}$ of the interferometer. In this paper we extend the Mach-Zender scheme to a setup where the central phase shifter is substituted by a generic unitary operator. We find that the sum $\mathcal{P}^2 + \mathcal{V}^2$ is in general no longer upper bounded by $1$, and that there exists a whole class of interferometers such that the full fringe visibility and the full which-way information are not mutually exclusive. We show that $\mathcal{P}^2 + \mathcal{V}^2 \leq L_U$, with $1 \leq L_U \leq 2$, and we illustrate how the tight bound $L_U$ depends on the choice of the unitary operation $U$ replacing the central phase shifter.

abstract: A method is presented to transfer a system of two-level atoms from a spin coherent state to a maximally spin squeezed Dicke state, relevant for quantum metrology and quantum information processing. The initial state is the ground state of an initial linear Hamiltonian which is gradually turned into a final quadratic Hamiltonian whose ground state is the selected Dicke state. We use compensating operators to suppress diabatic transitions to unwanted states that would occur if the change were not slow. We discuss the possibilities of constructing the compensating operators by sequential application of quadratic Hamiltonians available in experiments.

abstract: Nonreflexive quantum mechanics is a formulation of quantum theory based on a non-classical logic termed \ita{nonreflexive logic} (a.k.a. `non-reflexive'). In these logics, the standard notion of identity, as encapsulated in classical logic and set theories, does not hold in full. The basic aim of this kind of approach to quantum mechanics is to take seriously the claim made by some authors according to whom quantum particles are \ita{non-individuals} in some sense, and also to take into account the fact that they may be absolutely indistinguishable (or indiscernible). The nonreflexive formulation of quantum theory assumes these features of the objects already at the level of the underlying logic, so that no use is required of symmetrization postulates or other mathematical devices that serve to pretend that the objects are indiscernible (when they are not: all objects that obey classical logic are \ita{individuals} in a sense). Here, we present the ideas of the development of nonreflexive quantum mechanics and discuss some philosophical (mainly metaphysical) motivations and consequences of it.

The scheme addresses two key difficulties in realizing such a system; a combined microfabricated ion trap and superconducting qubit architecture, and the experimental infrastructure to facilitate both technologies. Developing upon work by Kielpinski et al. [1] we describe the design, simulation and fabrication process for a microfabricated ion trap capable of coupling an ion to a superconducting microwave LC circuit with a coupling strength in the tens of kHz. We also describe existing difficulties in combining the experimental infrastructure of an ion trapping setup into a dilution fridge with superconducting qubits and present solutions that can be immediately implemented using current technology.

abstract: The development, characterization and control of $N$-photon sources are instrumental for quantum technological applications. This work constitutes a step forward in this direction, where we propose a cavity quantum electrodynamics setup designed for the generation of photon pairs. We analyze it both via the scattering and master equation formalisms. From the connection between these two frameworks it naturally arises a physical criterion characterizing when weakly-driven systems behave as continuous antibunched two-photon sources. We find the optimal parameters for which our setup works as an efficient photon-pair source, showing also that it becomes a deterministic down-converter of single photons. We provide a specific implementation based on state-of-the-art superconducting circuits, showing how our proposal is within the reach of current technologies.

abstract: We consider the extraction of shared secret key from correlations that are generated by either a classical or quantum source. In the classical setting, two honest parties (Alice and Bob) use public discussion and local randomness to distill secret key from some distribution $p_{XYZ}$ that is shared with an unwanted eavesdropper (Eve). In the quantum settings, the correlations $p_{XYZ}$ are delivered to the parties as either an \textit{incoherent} mixture of orthogonal quantum states or as \textit{coherent} superposition of such states; in both cases, Alice and Bob use public discussion and local quantum operations to distill secret key. While the power of quantum mechanics increases Alice and Bob's ability to generate shared randomness, it also equips Eve with a greater arsenal of eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, it is not obvious who gains the greatest advantage for distilling secret key when replacing a classical source with a quantum one. In this paper we first demonstrate that the classical key rate is equivalent to the quantum key rate when the correlations are generated incoherently in the quantum setting. For coherent sources, we next show that the rates are incomparable, and in fact, their difference can be arbitrarily large in either direction. However, we identify a large class of non-trivial distributions $p_{XYZ}$ that possess the following properties: (i) Eve's advantage is always greater in the quantum source than in its classical counterpart, and (ii) for the quantum entanglement shared between Alice and Bob in the coherent source, the so-called entanglement cost/squashed entanglement/relative entropy of entanglement can all be computed. With property (ii), we thus present a rare instance in which the various entropic entanglement measures of a quantum state can be explicitly calculated.

abstract: The purport of quantum teleportation is to completely transfer information from one party to another distant partner. However, from the perspective of parameter estimation, it is the information carried by a particular parameter, not the information of total quantum state that needs to be teleported. Due to the inevitable noise in environment, we propose two schemes to enhance quantum Fisher information (QFI) teleportation under amplitude damping noise with the technique of partial measurements. We find that post partial measurement can greatly enhance the teleported QFI, while the combination of prior partial measurement and post partial measurement reversal could completely eliminate the effect of decoherence. We show that, somewhat consequentially, enhancing QFI teleportation is more economic than that of improving fidelity teleportation. Our work extends the ability of partial measurements as a quantum technique to battle decoherence in quantum information processing.

Then we consider the effect of both amplitude damping and phase diffusion on phase-shift precision. At last, we extend the constant phase estimation to the case of continuous fluctuating phase estimation, and find that due to photon losses the corresponding mean square error transits from the stochastic Heisenberg limit to the stochastic standard quantum limit as the total photon flux increases.

abstract: Recent developments make the possibility of achieving scalable quantum networks and quantum devices closer. From the computational point of view these emerging technologies become relevant when they are no longer classically simulatable. Hence a pressing challenge is the construction of practical methods to verify the correctness of the outcome produced by universal or non-universal quantum devices. A promising approach that has been extensively explored is the scheme of verification via encryption through blind quantum computing initiated by Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We present here a new construction that simplifies the required resources for any such verifiable blind quantum computating protocol. We obtain an overhead that is linear in the size of the input, while the security parameter remains independent of the size of the computation and can be made exponentially small. Furthermore our construction is generic and could be applied to any non-universal scheme with a given underlying graph.

abstract: We introduce two methods for speeding up adiabatic quantum computations by increasing the energy between the ground and first excited states. Our methods are even more general. They can be used to shift a Hamiltonian's density of states away from the ground state, so that fewer states occupy the low-lying energies near the minimum, hence allowing for faster adiabatic passages to find the ground state with less risk of getting caught in an undesired low-lying excited state during the passage. Even more generally, our methods can be used to transform a discrete optimization problem into a new one whose unique minimum still encodes the desired answer, but with the objective function's values forming a different landscape. Aspects of the landscape such as the objective function's range, or the values of certain coefficients, or how many different inputs lead to a given output value, can be decreased *or* increased. One of the many examples for which these methods are useful is in finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian using NMR: If it is difficult to find a molecule such that the distances between the spins match the interactions in the Hamiltonian, the interactions in the Hamiltonian can be changed without at all changing the ground state. We apply our methods to an AQC algorithm for integer factorization, and the first method reduces the maximum runtime in our example by up to 754%, and the second method reduces the maximum runtime of another example by up to 250%. These two methods may also be combined.

In contrast to the binary game, the best classical and quantum winning strategies are not known exactly. In this paper we provide a constructive classical strategy for winning a $\mathrm{CHSH}_{q}$ game, with $q$ being a prime. Our construction achieves a winning probability better than $\frac{1}{22}q^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, which is in contrast with the previously known constructive strategies achieving only the winning probability of $O(q^{-1})$.

abstract: A fundamental goal of quantum technologies concerns the exploitation of quantum coherent dynamics for the realisation of novel quantum applications such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. A key challenge on the way towards these goals remains the protection of quantum coherent dynamics from environmental noise. Here, we propose a concept of hybrid dressed state from a pair of continuously driven systems. It allows sufficiently strong driving fields to suppress the effect of environmental noise, while at the same time being insusceptible to both the amplitude and phase noise in the continuous driving fields. This combination of robust features significantly enhances coherence times under realistic conditions, and at the same time provides new flexibility in Hamiltonian engineering that otherwise is not achievable. We demonstrate theoretically applications of our scheme for noise resistant analog quantum simulation in the well studied physical systems of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and of trapped ions. The scheme may also be exploited for quantum computation and quantum metrology.

abstract: The thermometry precision of a sample is a question of both fundamental and technological importance. In this paper, we consider a ring-structure system as our probe to estimate the temperature of a bath. Based on the Markovian master equation of the probe, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the probe at any time. We find that for the thermal equilibrium thermometry, the ferromagnetic structure can measure a lower temperature of the bath with a higher precision compared with the non-structure probe. While for the dynamical thermometry, the antiferromagnetic structure can make the QFI of the probe in the dynamical process much larger than that in equilibrium with the bath, which is somewhat counterintuitive. Moreover, the best accuracy for the thermometry achieved in the antiferromagnetic structure case can be much higher than that in the non-structure case. The physical mechanisms of above phenomena are given in this paper.

Our criteria can detect the non-$k$-separability of Dicke class of states, anti W states and mixtures thereof and higher dimensional W class of states. We then investigate the performance of our criteria by considering $N$-qubit Dicke states with arbitrary excitations added with white noise and mixture of $N$-qudit W state with white noise. We also study the robustness of our criteria against white noise. Further, we demonstrate that our criteria are experimentally implementable by means of local observables such as Pauli matrices and generalized Gell-Mann matrices.

abstract: The interplay between steering and quantum coherence is studied in a scenario, where two atoms move through an external massless scalar field. We show that just like entanglement, the steering induced coherence of the equilibrium state may increase or decrease with acceleration depending on the initial condition of the state. We also investigate the condition for coherence steerability - as opposed to simple state steerability. Interestingly, we find that the quantum coherence of the equilibrium state cannot be steered, even when the steering induced coherence is non-zero. We argue that under any condition, gravity prohibits the coherence steering of the equilibrium state.

abstract: The familiar concepts of state vectors and operators in quantum mechanics rely on associative products of observables. However, these notions do not apply to some exotic systems such as magnetic monopoles, which have long been known to lead to non-associative algebras. Their quantum physics has remained obscure. This letter presents the first derivation of potentially testable physical results in non-associative quantum mechanics, based on effective potentials. They imply new effects which cannot be mimicked in usual quantum mechanics with standard magnetic fields.

abstract: Sampling is at the core of deep learning and more general machine learning applications; an increase in its efficiency would have a significant impact across several domains. With the advent of more mature quantum computing technologies, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential candidate to speed up these tasks, but several limitations still bar these state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main limitations, and the focus of this work, is that using the device's experimentally accessible temperature as a reference for sampling purposes leads to very poor correlation with the Boltzmann distribution it is programmed to sample from. Based on quantum dynamical arguments, one can expect that if the device indeed happens to be sampling from a Boltzmann-like distribution, it will correspond to one with an {\it instance-dependent} effective temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling processes. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. To highlight the importance of this estimation, we provide a systematic study assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the training of a kind of restricted Boltzmann machine on quantum hardware, which can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures. We also provide a comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence(CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100 to have better assessment of the performance. Although our suggested quantum-assisted training algorithm as well as other simplifications that assume a fixed effective temperature clearly outperform conventional contrastive divergence (CD-1), only our algorithm is capable of matching CD-100 for the Boltzmann machine trained in this work.

abstract: Optimal control theory has been employed to populate separately two dark states of the acetylene polyad $N_s=1$, $N_r=5$ by indirect coupling via the ground state. Relevant level energies and transition dipole moments are extracted from the experimental literature. The optimal pulses are rather simple. The evolution of the populations is shown for the duration of the control process and also for the field free-evolution that follows the control. One of the dark states appears to be a potential target for realistic experimental investigation because the average population of the Rabi oscillation remains high and decoherence is expected to be weak.

abstract: We study the fidelity of single qubit quantum gates performed with two-frequency laser fields that have a Gaussian or super Gaussian spatial mode. Numerical simulations are used to account for imperfections arising from atomic motion in an optical trap, spatially varying Stark shifts of the trapping and control beams, and transverse and axial misalignment of the control beams. Numerical results that account for the three dimensional distribution of control light show that a super Gaussian mode with intensity $I\sim e^{-2(r/w_0)^n}$ provides reduced sensitivity to atomic motion and beam misalignment. Choosing a super Gaussian with $n=6$ the decay time of finite temperature Rabi oscillations can be increased by a factor of 60 compared to an $n=2$ Gaussian beam, while reducing crosstalk to neighboring qubit sites.

abstract: Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that combines encoding with energy penalties and decoding to suppress and correct errors that degrade the performance of quantum annealers in solving optimization problems. While QAC has been experimentally demonstrated to successfully error-correct a range of optimization problems, a clear understanding of its operating mechanism has been lacking. Here we bridge this gap using tools from quantum statistical mechanics. We study analytically tractable models using a mean-field analysis, specifically the $p$-body ferromagnetic infinite-range transverse-field Ising model as well as the quantum Hopfield model, in the zero temperature limit. We demonstrate that for $p=2$, where the quantum phase transition is of second order, QAC pushes the phase transition to infinite transverse field strength. For $p\ge3$, where the quantum phase transition is of first order, QAC softens the closing of the gap for small energy penalty values and prevents its closure for sufficiently large energy penalty values. Thus QAC provides protection from excitations that occur near the quantum critical point.

abstract: We address precision of optical interferometers fed by Gaussian states and involving passive and/or active elements, such as beam splitters, photodetectors and optical parametric amplifiers. We first address the ultimate bounds to precision by discussing the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information. We then consider photodetection at the output and calculate the sensitivity of the interferometers taking into account the non unit quantum efficiency of the detectors. Our results show that in the ideal case of photon number detectors with unit quantum efficiency the best configuration is the symmetric one, namely, passive (active) interferometer with passive (active) detection stage: in this case one may achieve Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity by suitably optimizing over Gaussian states at the input. On the other hand, in the realistic case of detectors with non unit quantum efficiency, the performances of passive scheme are unavoidably degraded, whereas detectors involving optical parametric amplifiers allow to fully compensate the presence of loss in the detection stage, thus restoring the Heisenberg scaling.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of a localized spin-$\frac{1}{2} $ Particle interacting with an absorbing environment is investigated. The quantum Langevin-Schr\"odinger equation for spin-$\frac{1}{2} $ is obtained. The susceptibility function of the environment is calculated in terms of the coupling function of the spin and the environment. it is shown that the susceptibility function satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations. Spontaneous emission and the shift frequency of the spin is obtained in terms of the imaginary part of the susceptibility function in frequency domain. Some transition probabilities between the spin states are calculated when the absorbing environment is in the thermal state.

As an application, we present a protocol in which Bob determines whether Alice prepares a pure quantum state close to a product state. In the protocol, Alice transmits to Bob multiple copies of a pure state through a depolarizing channel, and Bob estimates its output quantum $p$-R\'enyi entropy. By using our stability theorem, we show that Bob can determine whether her preparation is appropriate.

abstract: There are very few systems of interacting particles (with continuous variables) for which the entanglement of the concomitant eigenfunctions can be computed in an exact, analytical way. Here we present analytical calculations of the amount of entanglement exhibited by $s$-states of \emph{spherium}. This is a system of two particles (electrons) interacting via a Coulomb potential and confined to a $(d-1)$-sphere (that is, to the surface of a $d$-dimensional ball). We investigate the dependence of entanglement on the radius $R$ of the system, on the spatial dimensionality $d$, and on energy. We find that entanglement increases monotonically with $R$, decreases with $d$, and also tends to increase with the energy of the eigenstates. These trends are discussed and compared with those observed in other two-electron atomic-like models where entanglement has been investigated.

For any Boolean function there exists a span program that leads to a quantum algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity. In general, finding such span programs is not an easy task. In this work, given a query access to the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we provide two new span-program-based quantum algorithms: an algorithm for testing if the graph is bipartite that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries; an algorithm for testing if the graph is connected that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries.

abstract: We test variational quantum dynamics with the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) against exact solutions for the dynamics of two attractive bosons following trap release. MCTDHB produces unphysical and qualitatively incorrect results of breathing dynamics where ballistic expansion should occur, although an analysis of participating mode functions indicates that the numerical result should be converged. Further analysis reveals that the calculations are indeed unconverged due to an unphysical coupling of the center-of-mass and relative motion at diverging length scales. Our results indicate that convergence of the MCTDHB expansion cannot be practically achieved in the presence of incongruent length scales for center-of-mass and relative motion, as is typically the case for untrapped attractive bosons.

We derive its analytic expression in the case of pure states as a function of the smallest eigenvalue of the Bloch matrix and give explicitly the closest classical state for an arbitrary pure state. Numerical evidence is provided that the exact formula for pure states provides an upper bound on the quantumness of mixed states. Due to the connection between quantumness and entanglement we obtain new insights into the geometry of symmetric entangled states.

During the cycle, a $\delta$-wall is applied and varied its strength and position. After the completion of the cycle, the state of the particle arrives another eigenstate. It is also shown that an arbitrary pair of eigenstates can be connected through a combination of adiabatic cycles. A detailed argument is provided for the case that the particle is confined by an infinite square well. This is an example of exotic quantum holonomy in Hamiltonian systems.

abstract: Highly integrated single photon sources are key components in future quantum-optical circuits. Whereas the probabilistic generation of single photons can routinely be done by now, their triggered generation is a much greater challenge. Here, we describe the triggered generation of single photons in a hybrid plasmonic device. It consists of a lambda-type quantum emitter coupled to a multimode optical nanoantenna. For moderate interaction strengths between the subsystems, the description of the quantum optical evolution can be simplified by an adiabatic elimination of the electromagnetic fields of the nanoantenna modes. This leads to an insightful analysis of the emitter's dynamics, entails the opportunity to understand the physics of the device, and to identify parameter regimes for a desired operation. Even though the approach presented in this work is general, we consider a simple exemplary design of a plasmonic nanoantenna, made of two silver nanorods, suitable for triggered generation of single photons.

abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) hypothesis identifies the relevant time scales in out-of-equilibrium dynamics of critical systems employing concepts valid at equilibrium: It predicts the scaling of the defect formation immediately after quenches across classical and quantum phase transitions as a function of the quench speed. Here we study the crossover between the scaling dictated by a slow quench, which is ruled by the critical properties of the quantum phase transition, and the excitations due to a faster quench, where the dynamics is often well described by the classical model. We estimate the value of the quench rate that separates the two regimes and support our argument using numerical simulations of the out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics. For the specific case of a $\phi^4$ model we demonstrate that the two regimes exhibit two different power-law scalings, which are in agreement with the KZ theory when applied to the quantum and to the classical case. This result contributes to extending the prediction power of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism and to provide insight into recent experimental observations in systems of cold atoms and ions.

abstract: This paper presents a new Relativistic Symmetrical Interpretation (RSI) of the Dirac equation in (1+1)D which postulates: quantum mechanics is intrinsically time-symmetric, with no arrow of time; the fundamental objects of quantum mechanics are transitions; a transition is fully described by a complex transition amplitude density with specified initial and final boundary conditions; and transition amplitude densities never collapse. This RSI is compared to the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) for the analysis of Einstein's bubble experiment with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. This RSI can predict the future and retrodict the past, has no zitterbewegung, resolves some inconsistencies of the CI, and eliminates some of the conceptual problems of the CI.

abstract: Propagation of light through dielectrics lies at the heart of optics. However, this ubiquitous process is commonly described using phenomenological dielectric function $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$, i.e. without addressing the quantum graininess of the dielectric matter. Here, we present a theoretical study where we consider a one-dimensional ensemble of atoms in a subwavelength waveguide (nanoguide) as fundamental building blocks of a model dielectric. By exploring the roles of the atom-waveguide coupling efficiency, density, disorder, and dephasing, we establish connections among various features of polaritonic light-matter states such as localization, super and subradiance, and strong coupling. In particular, we show that coherent multiple scattering of light among atoms that are coupled via a single propagating mode can gives rise to Rabi splitting. These results provide important insight into the underlying physics of strong coupling reported by recent room-temperature experiments with microcavities and surface plasmons.

abstract: In this paper we consider the phenomenon of superpositions in quantum mechanics and suggest a way to deal with the idea in a logical setting from a syntactical point of view, that is, as subsumed in the language of the formalism, and not semantically. We restrict the discussion to the propositional level only. Then, after presenting the motivations and a possible world semantics, the formalism is outlined and we also consider within this schema the claim that superpositions may involve contradictions, as in the case of the Schr\"odinger's cat, which (it is usually said) is both alive and dead. We argue that this claim is a misreading of the quantum case. Finally, we sketch a new form of quantum logic that involves three kinds of negations and present the relationships among them. The paper is a first approach to the subject, introducing some main guidelines to be developed by a `syntactical' logical approach to quantum superpositions.

abstract: In the last few years, several criteria to identify Eistein-Podolski-Rosen steering have been proposed and experimentally implemented. On the operational side, however, the evaluation of the steerability degree of a given state has shown to be a difficult task and only a few results are known. In this work, we propose a measure of steering that is based on the maximal violation of well established steering inequalities. Applying this approach to two-qubit states, we managed to derive simple closed formulas for steering in the two- and three-measurement scenarios. Among the options investigated, a measure has been found that correctly satisfies the entanglement-steering-nonlocality hierarchy and reproduces results reported so far.

abstract: The ultimate semiclassical wave packet propagation technique is a complex, time-dependent WBK method known as generalized Gaussian wave packet dynamics (GGWPD). It requires overcoming many technical difficulties in order to be carried out fully in practice. In its place roughly twenty years ago, linearized wave packet dynamics was generalized to methods that include sets of off-center, real trajectories for both classically integrable and chaotic dynamical systems that completely capture the dynamical transport. The connections between those methods and GGWPD are developed here. The complex saddle point trajectories are found using a multi-dimensional, Newton-Raphson root search method that begins with the set of off-center, real trajectories. This is possible because there is a one-to-one correspondence. The neighboring trajectories associated with each off-center real trajectory form a path that crosses a unique saddle; there are exceptions which are straightforward to identify. The method is applied to the kicked rotor and comparisons of the accuracy as a function of $\hbar$ are made between the quantum dynamics, and the GGWPD and real, off-center trajectory approximations.

abstract: The tunneling between the two ground states of an Ising ferromagnet is a typical example of many-body tunneling processes between two local minima, as they occur during quantum annealing. Performing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations we find that the QMC tunneling rate displays the same scaling with system size, as the rate of incoherent tunneling. The scaling in both cases is $O(\Delta^2)$, where $\Delta$ is the tunneling splitting. An important consequence is that QMC simulations can be used to predict the performance of a quantum annealer for tunneling through a barrier. Furthermore, by using open instead of periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, equivalent to a projector QMC algorithm, we obtain a quadratic speedup for QMC, and achieve linear scaling in $\Delta$. We provide a physical understanding of these results and their range of applicability based on an instanton picture.

abstract: The first post-classical computation will most probably be performed not on a universal quantum computer, but rather on a dedicated quantum hardware. A strong candidate for achieving this is represented by the task of sampling from the output distribution of linear quantum optical networks. This problem, known as boson sampling, has recently been shown to be intractable for any classical computer, but it is naturally carried out by running the corresponding experiment. However, only small scale realizations of boson sampling experiments have been demonstrated to date. Their main limitation is related to the non-deterministic state preparation and inefficient measurement step. Here, we propose an alternative setup to implement boson sampling that is based on microwave photons and not on optical photons. The certified scalability of superconducting devices indicates that this direction is promising for a large-scale implementation of boson sampling and allows for more flexible features like arbitrary state preparation and efficient photon-number measurements.

A product state of such a system is shown to be mutually unbiased to a product basis only if each of its factors is mutually unbiased to all the states which occur in the corresponding factors of the product basis. This result implies both a tight limit on the number of mutually unbiased product bases which the system can support and a complete classification of mutually unbiased product bases for multiple qubits or qutrits. In addition, only maximally entangled states can be mutually unbiased to a maximal set of mutually unbiased product bases.

On the contrary, for any quantum system with a non-vanishing gap $\Delta$, precision of any temperature estimator diverges as $\Delta T^2 \gtrsim T^4 e^{\Delta/T}$.

abstract: The causal structure of a stochastic process can be more efficiently transmitted via a quantum channel than a classical one, an advantage that increases with codeword length. While previously difficult to compute, we express the quantum advantage in closed form using spectral decomposition, leading to direct computation of the quantum communication cost at all encoding lengths, including infinite. This makes clear how finite-codeword compression is controlled by the classical process' cryptic order and allows us to analyze structure within the length-asymptotic regime of infinite-cryptic order (and infinite Markov order) processes.

abstract: A polarization entangled photon pair source is widely used in many quantum information processing applications such as teleportation, quantum swapping, quantum computation and high precision quantum metrology. Here, we report on the generation of a continuous-wave pumped degenerated 1550 nm polarization entangled photon pair source at telecom wavelength using a type-II phase-matched periodically poled KTiOPO4 crystal in a Sagnac interferometer. Hong-Ou-Mandel-type interference measurement shows the photon bandwidth of 2.4 nm. High quality of entanglement is verified by various kinds of measurements, for example two-photon interference fringes, Bell inequality and quantum states tomography. The wavelength of photons can be tuned over a broad range by changing the temperature of crystal or pump power without losing the quality of entanglement. This source will be useful for building up long-distance quantum networks.

abstract: The ability to determine whether a multi-level quantum system is in a certain state while preserving quantum coherence between all orthorgonal states is necessary to realize binary-outcome compatible measurements which are, in turn, a prerequisite for testing the contextuality of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we use a three-level superconducting system (a qutrit) coupled to a microwave cavity to explore different regimes of quantum measurement. In particular, we engineer the dispersive shifts of the cavity frequency to be identical for the first and second excited states of the qutrit which allows us to realize a strong projective binary-outcome measurement onto its ground state with a fidelity of 94.3%. Complemented with standard microwave control and low-noise parametric amplification, this scheme can be used to create sets of compatible measurements to reveal the contextual nature of superconducting circuits.

abstract: In a generalisation of the Landauer erasure protocol, we study bounds on the heat generated in typical open quantum processes. We derive a fluctuation relation for this heat, implying that it is almost always positive when either the system or reservoir is large, as well as in the high temperature limit. This emergence of a fluctuation relation occurs at least exponentially quickly in the dimension of the larger subsystem, and linearly in the inverse temperature $\beta$. Finally, we propose efficiently computable bounds for the remaining cases.

abstract: We investigate how to enhance entanglement in the steady state of interacting two-level systems. The steady state is reached by spontaneous decay of the individual systems. When we additionally couple them to a dissipative two-level ancilla with variable eigenfrequency and coupling strength, we observe a considerable enhancement effect in the entanglement of this steady state. Moreover, we see that the increased entanglement is directly connected to the selection of certain excited states via the environment disturbing the ancilla. This effect could be used in dissipative state preparation schemes as well as a testbed for decoherence models.

abstract: Designing a quantum key agreement (QKA) protocol is always a challenging task, because both the security and the fairness properties have to be considered simultaneously. Recently, Zhu et al. (Quantum Inf Process 14(11): 4245-4254) pointed out that Shukla et al.'s QKA protocol (Quantum Inf Process 13(11): 2391-2405) has some security flaws (which lead to the Participant Attack). Moreover, they proposed an improvement to avoid these weaknesses. However this study points out that the improved protocol also suffers from a colluding attack, i.e., two dishonest participants in the protocol can collaborate to manipulate the final secret key without being detected.

abstract: One way to look for complex behaviours in many-body quantum systems is to let the number $N$ of degrees of freedom become large and focus upon collective observables. Mean-field quantities scaling as $1/N$ tend to commute, whence complexity at the quantum level can only be inherited from complexity at the classical level. Instead, fluctuations of microscopic observables scale as $1/\sqrt{N}$ and exhibit collective Bosonic features, typical of a mesoscopic regime half-way between the quantum one at the microscopic level and the classical one at the level of macroscopic averages. Here, we consider the mesoscopic behaviour emerging from an infinite quantum spin chain undergoing a microscopic dissipative, irreversible dynamics and from global states without long-range correlations and invariant under lattice translations and dynamics. We show that, from the fluctuations of one site spin observables whose linear span is mapped into itself by the dynamics, there emerge bosonic operators obeying a mesoscopic dissipative dynamics mapping Gaussian states into Gaussian states. Instead of just depleting quantum correlations because of decoherence effects, these maps can generate entanglement at the collective, mesoscopic level, a phenomenon with no classical analogue that embodies a peculiar complex behaviour at the interface between micro and macro regimes.

abstract: A major goal in quantum computation is the implementation of error correction to produce a logical qubit with an error rate lower than that of the underlying physical qubits. Recent experimental progress demonstrates physical qubits can achieve error rates sufficiently low for error correction, particularly for codes with relatively high thresholds such as the surface code and color code. Motivated by experimental capabilities of neutral atom systems, we use numerical simulation to investigate whether coherent error correction can be effectively used with the 7-qubit color code. The results indicate that coherent error correction does not work at the 10-qubit level in neutral atom array quantum computers. By adding more qubits there is a possibility of making the encoding circuits fault-tolerant which could improve performance.

abstract: We theoretically study the phenomenon of self-propulsion through Casimir forces in thermal non-equilibrium. Using fluctuational electrodynamics, we derive a formula for the self-propulsion force for an arbitrary small object in two scenarios, i) for the object being isolated, and ii) for the object being close to a planar surface. In the latter case, the self-propulsion force (i.e., the force parallel to the surface) increases with decreasing distance, i.e., it couples to the near-field. We numerically calculate the lateral force acting on a hot spheroid near a surface and show that it can be as large as the gravitational force, thus being potentially measurable in fly-by experiments. We close by linking our results to well-known relations of linear response theory in fluctuational electrodynamics: Looking at the friction of the anisotropic object for constant velocity, we identify a correction term that is additional to the typically used approach.

abstract: The expected hitting time of discrete quantum walks on the hypercube (HC) is numerically known to be exponentially shorter than their classical analogues in terms of the scaling with the HC dimension. Recent numerics illustrated that this scaling exists not only on the bare HC, but also when the HC graph is symmetrically and locally embedded into larger graphs. The present work investigates the necessity of symmetry and locality for the speed-up by considering embeddings that are non-symmetric or non-local. We provide numerical evidence that the exponential speed-up survives also in these cases. Furthermore, our numerical simulations demonstrate that removing a single edge from the HC also does not destroy the exponential speed-up. In the non-local embedding of the HC we encounter "dark states", which we analyze. We provide a general and detailed presentation of the mapping that reduces the exponentially large Hilbert space of the quantum walk to an effective subspace of polynomial scaling. This mapping is our essential tool to numerically study quantum walks in such large dimensional structures.

abstract: Inspired by the scenario by Bennett et al., a teleportation protocol of qubits formed in a two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface of a GaAs heterostructure is proposed. The teleportation is carried out using three GaAs quantum dots (say $P$, $Q$, $R$) and three electrons. The electron spin on GaAs quantum dot $P$ is used to encode the unknown qubit. The GaAs quantum dot $Q$ and $R$ combine to form {an} entangled state. We perform a Bell measurement and depending on the outcome of {the} measurement, a suitable Hamiltonian for the quantum gate can be used to transform the information based on {a} spin to charge-based information.

abstract: Microwave photons inside lattices of coupled resonators and superconducting qubits can exhibit surprising matter-like behavior. Realizing such open-system quantum simulators presents an experimental challenge and requires new tools and measurement techniques. Here, we introduce Scanning Defect Microscopy as one such tool and illustrate its use in mapping the normal-mode structure of microwave photons inside a 49-site Kagome lattice of coplanar waveguide resonators. Scanning is accomplished by moving a probe equipped with a sapphire tip across the lattice. This locally perturbs resonator frequencies and induces shifts of the lattice resonance frequencies which we determine by measuring the transmission spectrum. From the magnitude of mode shifts we can reconstruct photon field amplitudes at each lattice site and thus create spatial images of the photon-lattice normal modes.

abstract: We prove a deterministic exponential time upper bound for Quantum Merlin-Arthur games with k unentangled provers. This is the first non-trivial upper bound of QMA(k) better than NEXP and can be considered an exponential improvement, unless EXP=NEXP. The key ideas of our proof are to use perturbation theory to reduce the QMA(2)-complete Separable Sparse Hamiltonian problem to a variant of the Separable Local Hamiltonian problem with an exponentially small promise gap, and then to decide this instance using epsilon-net methods. Our results imply an exponential time algorithm for the Pure State N-Representability problem in quantum chemistry, which is in QMA(2), but is not known to be in QMA. We also discuss the implications of our results on the Best Separable State problem.

abstract: We analyze homodyne detection of macroscopically bright multimode nonclassical states of light and propose their application in quantum communication. We observe that the homodyne detection is sensitive to a mode-matching of the bright light to the highly intense local oscillator. Unmatched bright modes of light result in additional noise which technically limits detection of Gaussian entanglement at macroscopic level. When the mode-matching is sufficient, we show that multimode quantum key distribution with bright beams is feasible. It finally merges the quantum communication with classical optical technology of visible beams of light.

Representing the dynamics by a matrix-vector notation overcomes this problem. We review three approaches to obtain such a representation. The methods are demonstrated for a driven two-level system subject to spontaneous emission.

abstract: A classical-kind phase-space formalism is developed to address the tiny intrinsic dynamical deviation from what is predicted by Wilczek-Zee theorem during quantum adiabatic evolution on degeneracy levels. In this formalism, the Hilbert space and the aggregate of degenerate eigenstates become the classical-kind phase-space and a high-dimensional subspace in the phase-space, respectively. Compared with the previous same study by a different method, the current result is qualitatively different in that the first-order deviation derived here is always perpendicular to the degeneracy subspace. A tripod scheme Hamiltonian with two degenerate dark states is employed to illustrate the adiabatic deviation with degeneracy levels.

abstract: We address the dynamics of continuous-time quantum walks on one-dimensional disordered lattices. Noise is introduced as time-dependent fluctuations of the tunneling amplitudes between adjacent sites, and attention is focused on non-Gaussian telegraph noise. We demonstrate the emergence of two different dynamical behaviors for the walker, corresponding to two opposite noise regimes: {\em slow} noise confines the walker into few lattice nodes, while {\em fast} noise induce a transition between quantum and classical diffusion over the lattice. By tuning the ratio between the autocorrelation time of the noise and the coupling between the walker and the external environment generating the noise, it is possible to move continuosly from one dynamical behavior to the other. We also address the non-Markovianity of the quantum map by assessing its divisibility as well as evaluating the information backflow to the system. Our results suggest that the non-Markovian character of the evolution is linked to the dynamical behavior in the slow noise regime, and that fast noise induces a Markovian dynamics for the walker.

abstract: The random walk formalism is used across a wide range of applications, from modelling share prices to predicting population genetics. Likewise quantum walks have shown much potential as a frame- work for developing new quantum algorithms. In this paper, we present explicit efficient quantum circuits for implementing continuous-time quantum walks on the circulant class of graphs. These circuits allow us to sample from the output probability distributions of quantum walks on circulant graphs efficiently. We also show that solving the same sampling problem for arbitrary circulant quantum circuits is intractable for a classical computer, assuming conjectures from computational complexity theory. This is a new link between continuous-time quantum walks and computational complexity theory and it indicates a family of tasks which could ultimately demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computers. As a proof of principle we have experimentally implemented the proposed quantum circuit on an example circulant graph using a two-qubit photonics quantum processor.

abstract: We observe interaction-induced broadening of the two-photon 5s-18s transition in 87Rb atoms trapped in a 3D optical lattice. The measured linewidth increases by nearly two orders of magnitude with increasing atomic density and excitation strength, with corresponding suppression of resonant scattering and enhancement of off-resonant scattering. We attribute the increased linewidth to resonant dipole-dipole interactions of 18s atoms with spontaneously created populations of nearby np states. Over a range of initial atomic densities and excitation strengths, the transition width is described by a single function of the steady-state density of Rydberg atoms, and the observed resonant excitation rate corresponds to that of a two-level system with the measured, rather than natural, linewidth. The broadening mechanism observed here is likely to have negative implications for many proposals with coherently interacting Rydberg atoms.

abstract: Existing quantum key distribution protocols typically transmit at most one photon per bit, so that the no-cloning theorem ensures their security. As a result, their key rates suffer dramatically in long-distance transmission because of channel loss. We introduce floodlight quantum key distribution (FL-QKD), which breaks the one photon per bit barrier and overcomes loss by exploiting a huge number of optical modes per bit. FL-QKD is capable of 2 Gbps secret-key rates over a 50 km fiber link. Its security follows from employing less than one photon per mode and using photon-coincidence channel monitoring.

abstract: We treat the eigenvalue problem posed by self-similar potentials, i.e. homogeneous functions under a particular affine transformation, by means of symmetry techniques. We find that the eigenfunctions of such problems are localized, even when the potential does not rise to infinity in every direction. It is shown that the logarithm of the energy displays levels contained in families that are analogous to Wannier-Stark ladders. The position of each ladder is proved to be determined by the specific details of the potential and not by its transformation properties. This is done by direct computation of matrix elements. The results are compared with numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: We study quantum teleportation between two different types of optical qubits using hybrid entanglement as a quantum channel under decoherence effects. One type of qubit employs the vacuum and single photon states for the basis, called a single-rail single-photon qubit, and the other utilizes coherent states of opposite phases. We find that teleportation from a single-rail single-photon qubit to a coherent state qubit is better than the opposite direction in terms of fidelity and success probability. We compare our results with those using a different type of hybrid entanglement between a polarized single-photon qubit and a coherent state.

We derive inequalities to detect these two types of genuine steering from the structure of Bell-type inequalities detecting genuine nonlocality and GHZ paradox. Svetlichny and Mermin steerability of statistics which have local hidden variable model originate from incompatible measurements that give rise to Svetlichny nonlocality and GHZ paradox. We observe that there are compatible measurements which can be used to demonstrate tripartite steering.

abstract: The generic aspects of the entanglement for random pure states are known to be established via the powerful phenomena of concentration of measure. Here, we find analytical expressions for the average subentropy over the set of random mixed states generated via various probability measures on it. The main ingredients in these results are Selberg's integrals. Surprisingly, our results show that the average subentropy of random mixed states approaches to the maximum value of the subentropy which is attained for the maximally mixed state as we increase the dimension. As an application, we find the average coherence of random mixed quantum states sampled from various probability measures, analytically. In the special case of the random mixed states sampled from the induced measure via the partial tracing of the random bipartite pure states, we establish the typicality of the relative entropy of coherence for random mixed states, numerically. In particular, we show that almost all random mixed states have relative entropy of coherence equal to the average relative entropy of coherence.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1510.08863
abstract: We determine the ultimate rate for the quantum distribution of secure keys over a channel with arbitrary transmissivity $\eta$. This is the secret-key capacity of the lossy channel that we prove to be $-log_2(1-\eta)$, providing a scaling of about $1.44\eta$ bits per pulse for high loss. Notably, this capacity corresponds to the maximum quantum discord that can be distributed to the remote parties through the lossy channel. In our proof we construct an upper bound, based on the relative entropy of entanglement, which is shown to coincide with the best known achievable lower bound. No secret key can be generated at a rate higher than our secret-key capacity by discrete- or continuous-variable protocols without the active help of quantum repeaters. Thus, our results establish the fundamental benchmark for testing the ultimate performance of secure quantum communications.

abstract: We develop a method for quantum process tomography that combines the efficiency of compressed sensing with the robustness of randomized benchmarking. Our method is robust to state preparation and measurement errors, and it achieves a quadratic speedup over conventional tomography when the unknown process is a generic unitary evolution. Our method is based on PhaseLift, a convex programming technique for phase retrieval. We show that this method achieves approximate recovery of almost all signals, using measurements sampled from spherical or unitary 2-designs. This is the first positive result on PhaseLift using 2-designs. We also show that exact recovery of all signals is possible using unitary 4-designs. Previous positive results for PhaseLift required spherical 4-designs, while PhaseLift was known to fail in certain cases when using spherical 2-designs.

Using methods originally developed for "electric" walks with a space-dependent, rather than a time-dependent coin, we provide a full explanation of the observations of Xue et al. We extend the analysis from periodic time-dependence to quasi-periodic behaviour with periods incommensurate to the step size. Spectral analysis, one of the principal tools for the study of electric walks, fails for time-dependent systems, but we find qualitative propagation behaviour of the time-dependent system in close analogy to the electric case.

abstract: We study cavity quantum electrodynamics of Bose-condensed atoms that are subjected to continuous monitoring of the light leaking out of the cavity. Due to a given detection record of each stochastic realization, individual runs spontaneously break the symmetry of the spatial profile of the atom cloud and this symmetry can be restored by considering ensemble averages over many realizations. We show that the cavity optomechanical excitations of the condensate can be engineered to target specific collective modes. This is achieved by exploiting the spatial structure and symmetries of the collective modes and light fields. The cavity fields can be utilized both for strong driving of the collective modes and for their measurement. In the weak excitation limit the condensate-cavity system may be employed as a sensitive phonon detector which operates by counting photons outside the cavity that have been selectively scattered by desired phonons.

abstract: Networks of open quantum systems with feedback have become an active area of research for applications such as quantum control, quantum communication and coherent information processing. A canonical formalism for the interconnection of open quantum systems using quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs) has been developed by Gough, James and co-workers and has been used to develop practical modeling approaches for complex quantum optical, microwave and optomechanical circuits/networks. In this paper we fill a significant gap in existing methodology by showing how trapped modes resulting from feedback via coupled channels with finite propagation delays can be identified systematically in a given network. Our method is based on the Blaschke-Potapov multiplicative factorization theorem for inner matrix-valued functions, which has been applied in the past to analog electronic networks. Our results provide a basis for extending the Quantum Hardware Description Language (QHDL) framework for automated quantum network model construction to efficiently treat scenarios in which each interconnection of components has an associated signal propagation time delay.

abstract: A major problem facing the realisation of scalable solid-state quantum computing is that of overcoming decoherence - the process whereby phase information encoded in a qubit is lost as the qubit interacts with its environment. Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is challenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when the qubit and environment are highly correlated. Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon, possess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced decoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs was previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid qubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the nuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding of the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$. I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which (i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in multiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath and (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and classical-field decoherence. To achieve these, the cluster correlation expansion was adapted to include electron-nuclear state mixing. In addition, an analysis supported by experiment was carried out to characterise the nuclear spin bath for a bismuth donor as the hybrid qubit, a simple analytical formula for $T_2$ was derived with predictions in agreement with experiment, and the established method of dynamical decoupling was combined with operating near OWPs in order to maximise $T_2$. Finally, the decoherence of a $^{29}$Si spin in proximity to the hybrid qubit was studied, in order to establish the feasibility for its use as a quantum register.

Such genuine randomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature of quantumness --- coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. Genuine randomness generation is generally considered impossible with only classical mechanics procedures. Based on the degree of trustworthiness on a device, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be grouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on fully trusted and calibrated devices and generates randomness at a high speed by properly modeling the devices. The second category is self-testing QRNG, which produces randomness without depending on the realisation devices. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG, is an intermediate category in which parts of the system are self-testing, and the high performance of practical QRNGs is also maintained.

abstract: We demonstrate simple and robust methods for Doppler cooling and obtaining high fluorescence from trapped 43Ca+ ions at a magnetic field of 146 Gauss. This field gives access to a magnetic-field-independent "atomic clock" qubit transition within the ground level hyperfine structure of the ion, but also causes the complex internal structure of the 64 states relevant to Doppler cooling to be spread over many times the atomic transition line-width. Using a time-dependent optical Bloch equation simulation of the system we develop a simple scheme to Doppler-cool the ion on a two-photon dark resonance, which is robust to typical experimental variations in laser intensities, detunings and polarizations. We experimentally demonstrate cooling to a temperature of 0.3 mK, slightly below the Doppler limit for the corresponding two-level system, and then use Raman sideband laser cooling to cool further to the ground states of the ion's radial motional modes. These methods will enable two-qubit entangling gates with this ion, which is one of the most promising qubits so far developed.

abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) output genuine random numbers based upon the uncertainty principle. A QRNG contains two parts in general --- a randomness source and a readout detector. How to remove detector imperfections has been one of the most important questions in practical randomness generation. We propose a simple solution, measurement-device-independent QRNG, which not only removes all detector side channels but is robust against losses. In contrast to previous fully device-independent QRNGs, our scheme does not require high detector efficiency or nonlocality tests. Simulations show that our protocol can be implemented efficiently with a practical coherent state laser and other standard optical components. The security analysis of our QRNG consists mainly of two parts: measurement tomography and randomness quantification, where several new techniques are developed to characterize the randomness associated with a positive-operator valued measure.

abstract: We suggest and investigate a scheme for non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification of coherent states using successive photon addition, $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$, where $\hat a^\dagger$ is the photon creation operator. We compare it with a previous proposal using the photon addition-then-subtraction, $\hat a \hat a^\dagger$, where $\hat a$ is the photon annihilation operator, that works as an appropriate amplifier only for weak light fields. We show that when the amplitude of a coherent state is $|\alpha| \gtrsim 0.91$, the $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$ operation serves as a more efficient amplifier compared to the $\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ operation in terms of equivalent input noise. Using $\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ and $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$ as basic building blocks, we compare combinatorial amplifications of coherent states using $(\hat a \hat a^\dagger)^2$, $\hat a^{\dagger 4}$, $\hat a \hat a^\dagger\hat a^{\dagger 2}$, and $\hat a^{\dagger 2}\hat a \hat a^\dagger$, and show that $(\hat a \hat a^\dagger)^2$, $\hat a^{\dagger 2}\hat a \hat a^\dagger$, and $\hat a^{\dagger 4}$ exhibit strongest noiseless properties for $|\alpha| \lesssim 0.51$, $0.51 \lesssim |\alpha| \lesssim 1.05 $, and $|\alpha|\gtrsim 1.05 $, respectively. We further show that the $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$ operation can be used for amplifying superpositions of the coherent states. In contrast to previous studies, our work provides efficient schemes to implement a noiseless amplifier for light fields with medium and large amplitudes.

abstract: We consider recurrence to the initial state after repeated actions of a quantum channel. After each iteration a projective measurement is applied to check recurrence. The corresponding return time is known to be an integer for the special case of unital channels, including unitary channels. We prove that for a more general class of quantum channels the expected return time can be given as the inverse of the weight of the initial state in the steady state. This statement is a generalization of the Kac lemma for classical Markov chains.

abstract: A primer on the Floquet theory of periodically time-dependent quantum systems is provided, and it is shown how to apply this framework for computing the quasienergy band structure governing the dynamics of ultracold atoms in driven optical cosine lattices. Such systems are viewed here as spatially and temporally periodic structures living in an extended Hilbert space, giving rise to spatio-temporal Bloch waves whose dispersion relations can be manipulated at will by exploiting ac-Stark shifts and multiphoton resonances. The elements required for numerical calculations are introduced in a tutorial manner, and some example calculations are discussed in detail, thereby illustrating future prospects of Floquet engineering.

abstract: We present the experimental measurement of a squeezed vacuum state by means of a bichromatic local oscillator (BLO). A pair of local oscillators at $\pm$5 MHz around the central frequency $\omega_{0}$ of the fundamental field with equal power are generated by three acousto-optic modulators and phase-locked, which are used as a BLO. The squeezed vacuum light are detected by a phase-sensitive balanced-homodyne detection with a BLO. The baseband signal around $\omega_{0}$ combined with a broad squeezed field can be detected with the sensitivity below the shot-noise limit, in which the baseband signal is shifted to the vicinity of 5 MHz (the half of the BLO separation). This work has the important applications in quantum state measurement and quantum information

abstract: The necessity and usefulness of considering the interaction of a quantum system with the environment when describing its time evolution have been recognized in several branches of physics and of other sciences. The Kraus' representation is a general and succinct approach to describe such open system dynamics in a wide range of relevant physical scenarios. In this article, by abdicating from the generality of the formalism of quantum operations and thus avoiding its associated complications, we show in a simple manner how one can obtain the Kraus representation using basically the closed system (system plus environment) unitary dynamics and the partial trace function. The example of a two-level atom interacting with the vacuum of the electromagnetic field is regarded for the sake of instantiating this formalism, which is then applied to study the time evolution of the atom's quantum coherence.

abstract: The demonstration and use of Bell-nonlocality, a concept that is fundamentally striking and is at the core of applications in device independent quantum information processing, relies heavily on the assumption of measurement independence, also called the assumption free choice. The latter cannot be verified or guaranteed. In this paper, we consider a relaxation of the measurement independence assumption. We show that with our relaxation, the set of so-called measurement dependent local (MDL) correlations is a polytope, i.e. it can be fully described using a finite set of linear inequalities. We analyze this polytope, first in the simplest case of 2 parties with binary inputs and outputs, for which we give a full characterization. Perhaps surprisingly, already in this scenario there are quantum correlations which cannot be reproduced unless the measurement independence assumption is almost fully relaxed. We further present a method which transforms any Bell-inequality into an MDL inequality and give valid inequalities for the case of arbitrary number of parties as well as one for arbitrary number of inputs. We introduce the assumption of independent sources in the measurement dependence scenario and give a full analysis for the bipartite scenario with binary inputs and outputs. Finally, we establish a link between measurement dependence and another strong hindrance in certifying nonlocal correlations: nondetection events.

abstract: The link of two concepts, indistinguishability and entanglement, with the energy-time uncertainty principle is demonstrated in a system composed of two strongly coupled bosonic modes. Working in a short interaction limit, we find that the inclusion of the anti-resonant terms to the coupling Hamiltonian leads the system to relax to a state which is not the ground state of the system. This effect occurs passively by just presence of the anti-resonant terms and is explained in terms of the time-energy uncertainty principle for the simple reason that at a very short interaction time, the uncertainty in the energy is of order of the energy of a single excitation, thereby leading to a distribution of the population among the zero, singly and doubly excited states. The population distribution, correlations and entanglement are shown to be substantially depend on whether the modes decay independently or collectively to an exterior reservoir. In particular, when the modes decay independently with equal rates, entanglement with the complete distinguishability of the modes is observed. The modes can be made mutually coherent if they decay with unequal rates. However, the visibility in the single-photon interference cannot exceed 50%. When the modes experience collective damping, they are indistinguishable even if decay with equal rates and the visibility can, in principle, be as large as unity. We find that this feature derives from the decay of the system to a pure entangled state rather than the expected mixed state. When the modes decay with equal rates, the steady-state values of the density matrix elements are found dependent on their initial values.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Entanglement is a resource to overcome the natural restriction of operations used for state manipulation to Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state which can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In the multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the Maximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is required. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of this set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on the other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via LOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states and derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states. Here, we consider the non-generic 4-qubit states and analyze their properties regarding local transformations. We prove that most SLOCC classes show a similar behavior as the generic states, however we also identify three classes with very distinct properties. The first consists of the GHZ and W class, where any state can be transformed into some other state non-trivially. In particular, there exists no isolation. On the other hand, there also exist classes where all states are isolated. Last but not least we identify an additional class of states, whose transformation properties differ drastically from all the other classes. Our investigations do not only identify the most relevant classes of states for LOCC entanglement manipulation, but also reveal new insight into the similarities and differences between separable and LOCC transformations and enable the investigation of LOCC transformations among arbitrary four qubit states.

abstract: In previous work, we have proposed an entanglement indicator for a general multiqubit state, which can be "learned" by a quantum system. The system can be in a pure or a mixed state, and it need not be "close" to any particular state; moreover, as the size of the system grows, the amount of additional training necessary diminishes. Here, we show that for small amounts of noise and decoherence the indicator is stable.

abstract: We study quantum control techniques, specifically Adiabatic Rapid Passage (ARP) and Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE), for transferring atoms trapped in an optical lattice between different vibrational states. We compare them with each other and with previously studied coupling schemes in terms of performance. In our study of ARP, we realize control of the vibrational states by tuning the frequency of a spatial modulation through the inhomogeneously broadened vibrational absorption spectrum. We show that due to the presence of multiple crossings, the population transfer depends on the direction of the frequency sweep, in contrast to traditional ARP. In a second study, we control these states by applying a pulse sequence involving both the displacement of the optical lattice and modulation of the lattice depth. This pulse is engineered via the GRAPE algorithm to maximize the number of atoms transferred from the initial (ground) state to the first excited state. We find that the ARP and the GRAPE techniques are superior to the previously tested techniques at transferring population into the first excited state from the ground state: $38.9\pm0.2\%$ and $39\pm2\%$ respectively. GRAPE outperforms ARP in leaving the higher excited states unpopulated (less than $3.3\%$ of the ground state population, at $84\%$ confidence level), while $18.7\pm0.3\%$ of the ground state population is transferred into higher excited states by using ARP. On the other hand, ARP creates a normalized population inversion of $0.21\pm0.02$, which is the highest obtained by any of the control techniques we have investigated.

abstract: Here we study multiplayer linear games, a natural generalization of XOR games to multiple outcomes. We generalize a recently proposed efficiently computable bound, in terms of the norm of a game matrix, on the quantum value of 2-player games to linear games with $n$ players. As an example, we bound the quantum value of a generalization of the well-known CHSH game to $n$ players and $d$ outcomes. We also apply the bound to show in a simple manner that any nontrivial functional box, that could lead to trivialization of communication complexity in a multiparty scenario, cannot be realized in quantum mechanics. We then present a systematic method to derive device-independent witnesses of genuine tripartite entanglement.

abstract: We directly measured the normalized $\it{s}$-wave scattering cross-section of ultracold $^{40}\rm{K}$ atoms across a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance by colliding pairs of degenerate Fermi gases (DFGs) and imaging the scattered atoms. We extracted the scattered fraction for a range of bias magnetic fields, and measured the resonance location to be $B_0 = 20.206(15)$ mT with width $\Delta = 1.0(5)$ mT. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of atom number in scattering images, we developed techniques to interpret absorption images in a regime where recoil induced detuning corrections are significant. These imaging techniques are generally applicable to experiments with lighter alkalis that would benefit from maximizing signal-to-noise ratio on atom number counting at the expense of spatial imaging resolution.

abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall edge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall edge modes which occur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of quantum spin Hall edge modes is because of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These quantum spin Hall edge modes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing directions. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than charge- in lieu of this its expected that quantum spin Hall edge modes will be more robust to disorder and inelastic scattering than quantum Hall edge modes which are charge dependent and independent of spin. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to quantum spin Hall edge modes when subjected to same degree of disorder and/or inelastic scattering in similar setups as quantum Hall edge modes. In fact we observe that quantum spin Hall edge modes are more susceptible to decoherence and disorder than quantum Hall edge modes and while a single disordered contact has no effect on quantum Hall edge modes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall edge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. In case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while quantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a finite charge Hall current still flows. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry can have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in quantum Hall case.

abstract: Critical dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to understanding the universal behavior of spontaneous defect formation in various system from the early universe, condensed-matter systems to ultracold atomic systems. We explore the universal real-time dynamics in an array of coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates, which undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking from the symmetric Rabi oscillation to the broken-symmetry self-trapping. In addition to Goldstone modes, there exist gapped Higgs mode whose excitation gap vanishes at the critical point. In the slow passage through the critical point, we analytically find that the symmetry-breaking dynamics obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. From the scalings of bifurcation delay and domain formation, we numerically extract two Kibble-Zurek exponents $b_{1}=\nu/(1+\nu z)$ and $b_{2}=1/(1+\nu z)$, which give the static correlation-length critical exponent $\nu=1/2$ and the dynamic critical exponent $z=1$. Our approach provides an efficient way to simultaneous determination of the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ for a continuous phase transition.

Here we propose the use of the optical Stark effect to reduce the sensitivity of the effective hole Zeeman energy to fluctuations in the local electric-field. Calculations using measured quantum dot parameters are presented, and demonstrate a factor of 10-100 reduction in the extrinsic dephasing. Compared to active stabilization methods, this technique should benefit from reduced experimental complexity.

abstract: We propose a realistic scheme to quantum simulate the so-far experimentally unobserved topological Mott insulator phase -- an interaction-driven topological insulator -- using cold atoms in an optical Lieb lattice. To this end, we study a system of spinless fermions in a Lieb lattice, exhibiting repulsive nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions, and derive the associated zero temperature phase diagram within mean-field approximation. In particular, we analyze how the interactions can dynamically generate a charge density wave ordered, a nematic as well as a topologically non-trivial quantum anomalous Hall phase. We characterize the topology of the different phases by the Chern number and discuss the possibility of phase coexistence. Based on the identified phases, we propose a realistic implementation of this model using cold Rydberg-dressed atoms in an optical lattice. The scheme, which allows one to access in particular the topological Mott insulator phase, robustly and independently of its exact position in parameter space, merely requires global, always-on off-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states and is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques.

abstract: In this paper we present a general framework for solving the stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) on a network of one-dimensional wires modelled by a metric graph with suitable matching conditions at the vertices. A formal solution is given that expresses the wave function and its derivative at one end of an edge (wire) nonlinearly in terms of the values at the other end. For the cubic NLSE this nonlinear transfer operation can be expressed explicitly in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Its application reduces the problem of solving the corresponding set of coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations to a finite set of nonlinear algebraic equations. For sufficiently small amplitudes we use canonical perturbation theory that allows to extract the leading nonlinear corrections over large distances.

abstract: The recent experimental condensation of ultracold atoms in a triangular optical lattice with negative effective tunneling energies paves the way to study frustrated systems in a controlled environment. Here, we explore the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in such a frustrated lattice in three dimensions. We represent the low-energy action of the lattice system as a two-component Bose gas corresponding to the two minima of the dispersion. The contact repulsion between the bosons separates into intra- and inter-component interactions, referred to as $V_{0}$ and $V_{12}$, respectively. We first employ a Huang-Yang-Luttinger approximation of the free energy. For $V_{12}/V_{0} = 2$, which corresponds to the bare interaction, this approach suggests a first order phase transition, at which both the U$(1)$ symmetry of condensation and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the emergent chiral order is broken simultaneously. Furthermore, we perform a renormalization group calculation at one-loop order. We demonstrate that the coupling regime $0<V_{12}/V_0\leq1$ shares the critical behavior of the Heisenberg fixed point at $V_{12}/V_{0}=1$. For $V_{12}/V_0>1$ we show that $V_{0}$ flows to a negative value, while $V_{12}$ increases and remains positive. This results in a breakdown of the effective quartic field theory due to an cubic anisotropy, and again suggests a discontinuous phase transition.

abstract: By incorporating the nonempirical SCAN semilocal density functional [Sun, Ruzsinszky, and Perdew, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] in the underlying expression of four existing parameter-free hybrid and double-hybrid models, we propose one hybrid (SCAN0) and three double-hybrid (SCAN0-DH, SCAN-QIDH, and SCAN0-2) density functionals, which are free of any empirical parameter. The SCAN-based hybrid and double-hybrid functionals consistently outperform their parent SCAN semilocal functional for a diverse range of applications. The SCAN-based semilocal, hybrid, and double-hybrid functionals generally perform better than the corresponding PBE-based functionals. In addition, the SCAN0-2 and SCAN-QIDH double-hybrid functionals significantly reduce the self-interaction error and noncovalent interaction error associated with their parent SCAN semilocal functional, extending the applicability of SCAN-based functionals to a very wide variety of systems.

abstract: It is well-known that a dilute one-dimensional (1D) gas of bosons with infinitely strong repulsive interactions behaves like a gas of free fermions. Just as with conduction electrons in metals, we consider a single-particle picture of the resulting dynamics, when the gas is isolated by enclosing it into a box with hard walls and preparing it in a special initial state. We show, by solving the nonstationary problem of a free particle in a 1D hard-wall box, that the single-particle state recurs in time, signaling the intuitively expected back-and-forth motion of a free particle moving in a confined space. Under suitable conditions, the state of the whole gas can then be made to recur if all the particles are put in the same initial momentum superposition. We introduce this problem here as a modern instance of the discussions giving rise to the famous recurrence paradox in statistical mechanics: on one hand, our results may be used to develop a poor man's interpretation of the recurrence of the initial state observed [T. Kinoshita et al, Nature 440, 900 (2006)] in trapped 1D Bose gases of cold atoms, for which our estimated recurrence time is in fair agreement with the period of the oscillations observed; but this experiment, on the other hand, has been substantially influential on the belief that an isolated quantum many-body system can equilibrate as a consequence of its own unitary nonequilibrium dynamics. Some ideas regarding the latter are discussed.

abstract: We study Landauer's Principle for Repeated Interaction Systems (RIS) consisting of a reference quantum system $\mathcal S$ in contact with a structured environment $\mathcal E$ made of a chain of independent quantum probes; $\mathcal S$ interacts with each probe, for a fixed duration, in sequence. We first adapt Landauer's lower bound, which relates the energy variation of the environment~$\mathcal E$ to a decrease of entropy of the system $\mathcal S$ during the evolution, to the peculiar discrete time dynamics of RIS. Then we consider RIS with a structured environment $\mathcal E$ displaying small variations of order $T^{-1}$ between the successive probes encountered by $\mathcal S$, after $n\simeq T$ interactions, in keeping with adiabatic scaling. We establish a discrete time non-unitary adiabatic theorem to approximate the reduced dynamics of $\mathcal S$ in this regime, in order to tackle the adiabatic limit of Landauer's bound. Our analysis shows that, in general, Landauer's bound for RIS is not saturated in the adiabatic regime, due to the entropy production inherent to the RIS dynamics. This is to be contrasted with the saturation of Landauer's bound known to hold for continuous time evolution of open quantum system in the adiabatic regime.

abstract: We combine the ideas of intensity interferometry, polarization optics and Bells measurement into an exper- imental proposal which is hosted in a {\nu} = 2 quantum Hall (QH) edge state. Our interferometer comprises of a single quantum point contact (QPC). An analog of waveplate (from polarization optics) is realized by ex- posing the individual edges to nano-magnets over a finite length which facilitates coherent manipulation of the electron spin on the edge. We show that the in-plane rotation of magnetization direction of the nano-magnets results in oscillations observed solely in the cross-correlated noise which is purely due to two particle inter- ference. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate that our proposal is well within the reach of recent experimental developments of spin manipulations on the QH edge.

abstract: Consider the partition function of a classical system in two spatial dimensions, or the Euclidean path integral of a quantum system in two space-time dimensions, both on a lattice. We show that the tensor network renormalization (TNR) algorithm [\textit{G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, arXiv:1412.0732}] can be used to implement local scale transformations on these objects, namely a lattice version of conformal maps. Specifically, we explain how to implement the lattice equivalent of the logarithmic conformal map that transforms the Euclidean plane into a cylinder. As an application, and with the 2D critical Ising model as a concrete example, we use this map to build a lattice version of the scaling operators of the underlying conformal field theory, from which one can extract their scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients.

abstract: We investigate the effect of disorder on the transfer of quantum states across a one-dimensional lattice with varying levels of control fields applied to the different sites in the lattice. We find that the application of properly designed control signals, even when applied only to the two ends of the lattice, allows perfect state transfer up to disorder strengths that would not allow a generic quantum state to propagate the length of the system. At sufficiently large disorder strengths, however, the local control signals fail to send the quantum state from one end of the system to the other end. Our results shed light on the interplay between disorder and controlled transport in one-dimensional systems.

abstract: Graphene plasmons (GPs) have been found to be an exciting plasmonic platform, thanks to their high field confinement and low phase velocity, motivating contemporary research to revisit established concepts in light-matter interaction. In a conceptual breakthrough that is now more than 80 years old, \v{C}erenkov showed how charged particles emit shockwaves of light when moving faster than the phase velocity of light in a medium. To modern eyes, the \v{C}erenkov effect (\v{C}E) offers a direct and ultrafast energy conversion scheme from charge particles to photons. The requirement for relativistic particles, however, makes \v{C}E-emission inaccessible to most nanoscale electronic and photonic devices. We show that GPs provide the means to overcome this limitation through their low phase velocity and high field confinement. The interaction between the charge carriers flowing inside graphene and GPs presents a highly efficient 2D \v{C}erenkov emission, giving a versatile, tunable, and ultrafast conversion mechanism from electrical signal to plasmonic excitation.

abstract: We study the contribution of the thermal zero modes to the Casimir free energy, in the case of a fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) field in the presence of real materials described by frequency-dependent, local and isotropic permittivity ($\epsilon$) and permeability ($\mu$) functions. Those zero modes, present at any finite temperature, become dominant at high temperatures, since the theory is dimensionally reduced. Our work, within the context of the Derivative Expansion (DE) approach, focusses on the emergence of non analyticities in that dimensionally reduced theory. We conclude that the DE is well defined whenever the function $\Omega(\omega)$, defined by $[\Omega(\omega)]^2 \equiv \omega^2\epsilon(\omega)$, vanishes in the zero-frequency limit, for at least one of the two material media involved.

abstract: We demonstrate that not all generalized Bogoliubov transformations lead to $\cal D$-pseudo-bosons and prove that a correspondence between the two can only be achieved with the imposition of specific constraints on the parameters defining the transformation. For certain values of the parameters we find that the norms of the vectors in sets of eigenvectors of two related apparently non self-adjoint number-like operators possess different types of asymptotic behavior. We use this result to deduce further that they constitute bases for a Hilbert space, albeit neither of them can form a Riesz base. When the constraints are relaxed they cease to be Hilbert space bases, but remain $\cal D$-quasi bases.

abstract: We develop an alternative view of the semiclassical wave packets of Hagedorn---often called the Hagedorn wave packets---stressing the roles of the symplectic and metaplectic groups along with the Heisenberg--Weyl group. Our point of view clarifies the relationship between the Hagedorn wave packets and the Hermite functions by building a bridge between the ladders of wave functions in both theories. This Hagedorn--Hermite correspondence provides an elegant view as well as simple proofs of some essential results on the Hagedorn wave packets. We build the theory starting from fundamental properties of ladder operators. Particularly, we show that the ladder operators of Hagedorn are a natural set obtained from the position and momentum operators using the symplectic group. The idea that pervades our view of the Hagedorn wave packets is so-called symplectic covariance; it generalizes some of fundamental results concerning the Hagedorn wave packets as well as simplifies their proofs. We apply our formulation to show the existence of minimal uncertainty products for the Hagedorn wave packets; it generalizes the one-dimensional result by Hagedorn to multi-dimensions. The Hagedorn--Hermite correspondence also leads to an alternative derivation of the generating function for the Hagedorn wave packets and clarifies its relationship with the generating function for the Hermite functions. This result, in turn, reveals the relationship between the Hagedorn polynomials and the Hermite polynomials.

We compute the superfluid stiffness and superfluid correlations close to the superfluid to glass transition line, obtaining accurate locations of the critical points. By studying the statistics of the exponent of the power-law decay of the correlation, we determine the boundary between the superfluid region and the Bose glass phase in the regime of strong disorder and in the weakly interacting region, not explored numerically before. In the former case our simulations are in agreement with previous Monte Carlo calculations.

abstract: Strong field ionization by circularly polarized laser fields from initial states with internal orbital momentum has interesting propensity rule: electrons counter-rotating with respect to the laser field can be liberated more easily than co-rotating electrons [Barth and Smirnova PRA 84, 063415, 2011}]. Here we show that application of few-cycle IR pulses allows one to use this propensity rule to detect ring currents associated with such quantum states, by observing angular shifts of the ejected electrons. Such shifts present the main observable of the attoclock method. We use time-dependent Analytical $R$-Matrix (A$R$M) theory to show that the attoclock measured angular shifts of an electron originating from two counter-rotating orbitals ($p^{+}$ and $p^{-}$) are noticeably different. Our work opens new opportunities for detecting ring currents excited in atoms and molecules, using the attoclock set-up.

abstract: We study the problem of two interacting particles in a two-dimensional quasiperiodic potential of the Harper model. We consider an amplitude of the quasiperiodic potential such that in absence of interactions all eigenstates are exponentially localized while the two interacting particles are delocalized showing anomalous subdiffusive spreading over the lattice with the spreading exponent $b \approx 0.5$ instead of a usual diffusion with $b=1$. This spreading is stronger than in the case of a correlated disorder potential with a one particle localization length as for the quasiperiodic potential. At the same time we do not find signatures of ballistic FIKS pairs existing for two interacting particles in the one-dimensional Harper model.

abstract: We identify a nontrivial 4-state Landau-Zener model for which transition probabilities between any pair of diabatic states can be determined analytically and exactly. The model describes an experimentally accessible system of two interacting qubits, such as a localized state in a Dirac material with both valley and spin degrees of freedom or a singly charged quantum dot (QD) molecule with spin orbit coupling. Application of the linearly time-dependent magnetic field induces a sequence of quantum level crossings with possibility of interference of different trajectories in a semiclassical picture. We argue that this system satisfies the criteria of integrability in the multistate Landau-Zener theory, which allows us to derive explicit exact analytical expressions for the transition probability matrix. We also argue that this model is likely a special case of a larger class of solvable systems, and present a 6-state generalization as an example.

abstract: The controlled transfer of particles from one site of a spatial lattice to another is essential for many tasks in quantum information processing and quantum communication. Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold atoms held in optical lattices, provide two means of studying coherent quantum transport in well-controlled systems. In this work we study how to induce long-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states that are localized just on the chain's end-points. This has the appealing feature that the transfer occurs only between the end-points -- the particle does not pass through the intermediate sites -- making the transfer less susceptible to decoherence. We first show how a repulsively bound-pair of fermions, known as a doublon, can be transferred from one end of the chain to the other via topological edge states. We then show how non-topological surface states of the familiar Shockley or Tamm type can be used to produce a similar form of transfer under the action of a periodic driving potential. Finally we show that combining these effects can produce transfer by means of more exotic topological effects, in which the driving field can be used to switch the topological character of the edge states, as measured by the Zak phase. Our results demonstrate how to induce long range transfer of strongly correlated particles by tuning both topology and driving.

abstract: In a recent work, S.A.R. Horsley and coworkers [Nature Photon 9, 436-439 (2015)] showed rather interestingly that planar dielectric media, for which the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity are related by spatial Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations, are one-way reflectionless, whatever the angle of incidence. Such a fascinating property, besides of extending our comprehension of the fundamental phenomenon of reflection, may offer new ways for the design of antireflection surfaces and thin materials with efficient light absorption. However, KK dielectric media are generally described by slowly-decaying complex permittivity profiles which may introduce some subtle issues in the study of the scattering problem. Here we provide a condition on the imaginary part of the dielectric profile that ensures the existence of proper scattering states and present a proof of the one-way reflectionless property in KK dielectric media which is free from loophole. Finally, we show that instabilities might arise at the interface of KK dielectric media when the medium is not purely dissipative.

The Gray images of cyclic, quasi-cyclic, skew cyclic, skew quasi-cyclic and skew constacyclic codes over R are obtained. A necessary and sufficient condition for cyclic (negacyclic) codes over R that contains its dual has been given. The parameters of quantum error correcting codes are obtained from both cyclic and negacyclic codes over R. It is given some examples. Firstly, quasi-constacyclic and skew quasi-constacyclic codes are introduced. By giving two product, it is investigated their duality. A sufficient condition for 1-generator skew quasi-constacyclic codes to be free is determined.

abstract: We introduce a method for calculating the dielectric function of nanostructures with an arbitrary band dispersion and Bloch wave functions. The linear response of a dissipative electronic system to an external electromagnetic field is calculated by a self-consistent-field approach within a Markovian master-equation formalism (SCF-MMEF) coupled with full-wave electromagnetic equations. The SCF-MMEF accurately accounts for several concurrent scattering mechanisms. The method captures interband electron-hole-pair generation, as well as the interband and intraband electron scattering with phonons and impurities. We employ the SCF-MMEF to calculate the dielectric function, complex conductivity, and loss function for supported graphene. From the loss-function maximum, we obtain plasmon dispersion and propagation length for different substrate types [nonpolar diamondlike carbon (DLC) and polar SiO$_2$ and hBN], impurity densities, carrier densities, and temperatures. Plasmons on the two polar substrates are suppressed below the highest surface phonon energy, while the spectrum is broad on the nonpolar DLC. Plasmon propagation lengths are comparable on polar and nonpolar substrates and are on the order of tens of nanometers, considerably shorter than previously reported. They improve with fewer impurities, at lower temperatures, and at higher carrier densities.

We also discuss the energy Eigen-values and the Dirac spinors for the Eckart plus Hulthen potentials for the spin and pseudo-spin symmetry with PNU method.

abstract: Recently introduced time-dependent renormalized-natural-orbital theory (TDRNOT) is based on the equations of motion for the so-called natural orbitals, i.e., the eigenfunctions of the one-body reduced density matrix. Exact TDRNOT can be formulated for any time-dependent two-electron system in either spin configuration. In this paper, the method is tested against high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and Fano profiles in absorption spectra with the help of a numerically exactly solvable one-dimensional model He atom, starting from the spin-singlet ground state. Such benchmarks are challenging because Fano profiles originate from transitions involving autoionizing states, and HHG is a strong-field phenomenon well beyond linear response. TDRNOT with just one natural orbital per spin in the helium spin-singlet case is equivalent to time-dependent Hartree-Fock or time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in exact exchange-only approximation. It is not unexpected that TDDFT fails in reproducing Fano profiles due to the lack of doubly excited, autoionizing states. HHG spectra, on the other hand, are widely believed to be well-captured by TDDFT. However, HHG spectra of helium may display a second plateau that originates from simultaneous HHG in He$^+$ and neutral He. It is found that already TDRNOT with two natural orbitals per spin is sufficient to capture this effect as well as the Fano profiles on a qualitative level. With more natural orbitals (6--8 per spin) quantitative agreement can be reached. Errors due to the truncation to a finite number of orbitals are identified.

abstract: Proposals for systems embodying condensed matter spin qubits cover a very wide range of length scales, from atomic defects in semiconductors all the way to micron-sized lithographically-defined structures. Intermediate scale molecular components exhibit advantages of both limits: like atomic defects, large numbers of identical components can be fabricated; as for lithographically defined structures, each component can be tailored to optimize properties such as quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate what is perhaps the most potent advantage of molecular spin qubits, the scalability of quantum information processing structures using bottom-up chemical self-assembly. Using Cr7Ni spin qubit building blocks, we have constructed several families of two-qubit molecular structures with a range of linking strategies. For each family, long coherence times are preserved, and we demonstrate control over the inter-qubit quantum interactions that can be used to mediate two-qubit quantum gates.

abstract: We investigated the coherent phonon generation mechanism by irradiation of an ultrashort pulse with a simple two-level model. Our derived formulation shows that both impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and impulsive absorption (IA) simultaneously occur, and phonon wave packets are generated in the electronic ground and excited states by ISRS and IA, respectively. We identify the dominant process from the amplitude of the phonon oscillation. For short pulse widths, ISRS is very small and becomes larger as the pulse width increases. We also show that the initial phase is dependent on the pulse width and the detuning.

abstract: We study a system-bath description in the strong coupling regime, where it is not possible to derive a master equation for the reduced density matrix by a direct expansion in the system-bath coupling. A particular example is a bath with significant spectral weight at low frequencies. Through an unitary transformation it can be possible to find a more suitable small expansion parameter. Within this approach we construct a formally exact expansion of the master equation on the Keldysh contour. The lowest-order expansion is similar to the so-called $P(E)$-theory or non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA). The analysis of the higher-order contributions shows that there are two different classes of higher-order diagrams. We study how the form of the spectral function affects their convergence.

abstract: Interacting Bose-Fermi systems play a central role in condensed matter physics. Here, we analyze a novel Bose-Fermi mixture formed by a cavity exciton-polariton condensate interacting with a two-dimensional electron system. We show that that previous predictions of superconductivity [F.P. Laussy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 10, 104 (2010)] and excitonic supersolid formation [I.A. Shelykh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 14, 105 (2010)] in this system are closely intertwined- resembling the predictions for strongly correlated electron systems such as high temperature superconductors. In stark contrast to a large majority of Bose-Fermi systems analyzed in solids and ultracold atomic gases, the renormalized interaction between the polaritons and electrons in our system is long-ranged and strongly peaked at a tunable wavevector, which can be rendered incommensurate with the Fermi momentum. We analyze the prospects for experimental observation of superconductivity and find that critical temperatures on the order of a few Kelvins can be achieved in heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers that are embedded in an open cavity structure. All optical control of superconductivity in semiconductor heterostructures could enable the realization of new device concepts compatible with semiconductor nanotechnology. In addition the possibility to interface quantum Hall physics, superconductivity and nonequilibrium polariton condensates is likely to provide fertile ground for investigation of completely new physical phenomena.

abstract: Motivated by recent trapped-ion quantum simulation experiments, we carry out a comprehensive study of the phase diagram of a spin-1 chain with XXZ-type interactions that decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, using a combination of finite and infinite-size DMRG calculations, spin-wave analysis, and field theory. In the absence of long-range interactions, varying the spin-coupling anisotropy leads to four distinct phases: a ferromagnetic Ising phase, a disordered XY phase, a topological Haldane phase, and an antiferromagnetic Ising phase. If long-range interactions are antiferromagnetic and thus frustrated, we find primarily a quantitative change of the phase boundaries. On the other hand, ferromagnetic (non-frustrated) long-range interactions qualitatively impact the entire phase diagram. Importantly, for $\alpha\lesssim3$, long-range interactions destroy the Haldane phase, break the conformal symmetry of the XY phase, give rise to a new phase that spontaneously breaks a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry, and introduce an exotic tricritical point with no direct parallel in short-range interacting spin chains. We show that the main signatures of all five phases found could be observed experimentally in the near future.

abstract: Thermalization of a system in the presence of a heat bath has been the subject of many theoretical investigations especially in the framework of solid-state physics. In this setting, the presence of a large bandwidth for the frequency distribution of the harmonic oscillators schematizing the heat bath is crucial, as emphasized in the Caldeira-Leggett model. By contrast, ultracold gases in atomic traps oscillate at well-defined frequencies and therefore seem to lie outside the Caldeira-Leggett paradigm. We introduce interaction Hamiltonians which allow us to adapt the model to an atomic physics framework. The intrinsic nonlinearity of these models differentiates them from the original Caldeira-Leggett model and calls for a nontrivial stability analysis to determine effective ranges for the model parameters. These models allow for molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of ultracold gases, which is of current relevance for optimizing sympathetic cooling in degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures.

abstract: The identification of new solid-state defect qubit candidates in widely used semiconductors has the potential to enable the use of nanofabricated devices for enhanced qubit measurement and control operations. In particular, the recent discovery of optically active spin states in silicon carbide thin films offers a scalable route for incorporating defect qubits into on-chip photonic devices. Here we demonstrate the use of 3C silicon carbide photonic crystal cavities for enhanced excitation of color center defect spin ensembles in order to increase measured photoluminescence signal count rates, optically detected magnetic resonance signal intensities, and optical spin initialization rates. We observe up to a factor of 30 increase in the photoluminescence and ODMR signals from Ky5 color centers excited by cavity resonant excitation and increase the rate of ground-state spin initialization by approximately a factor of two. Furthermore, we show that the small excitation mode volume and enhanced excitation and collection efficiencies provided by the structures can be used to study inhomogeneous broadening in defect qubit ensembles. These results highlight some of the benefits that nanofabricated devices offer for engineering the local photonic environment of color center defect qubits to enable applications in quantum information and sensing.

abstract: It is possible to condense a macroscopic number of bosons into a single mode. Adding interactions the question arises whether the condensate is stable. For repulsive interaction the answer is positive with regard to the ground-state, but what about a condensation in an excited mode? We discuss some results that have been obtained for a 2-mode bosonic Josephson junction, and for a 3-mode minimal-model of a superfluid circuit. Additionally we mention the possibility to stabilize an unstable condensate by introducing periodic or noisy driving into the system: this is due to the Kapitza and the Zeno effects.

abstract: We consider the psychological effect of preference reversal and show that it finds a natural explanation in the frame of quantum decision theory. When people choose between lotteries with non-negative payoffs, they prefer a more certain lottery because of uncertainty aversion. But when people evaluate lottery prices, e.g. for selling to others the right to play them, they do this more rationally, being less subject to behavioral biases. This difference can be explained by the presence of the attraction factors entering the expression of quantum probabilities. Only the existence of attraction factors can explain why, considering two lotteries with close utility factors, a decision maker prefers one of them when choosing, but evaluates higher the other one when pricing. We derive a general quantitative criterion for the preference reversal to occur that relates the utilities of the two lotteries to the attraction factors under choosing versus pricing and test successfully its application on experiments by Tversky et al. We also show that the planning paradox can be treated as a kind of preference reversal.

abstract: We extend the range of quantum dot (QD) emission energies where electron and hole $g$ factors have been measured to the practically important telecom range. The spin dynamics in InAs/In$_{0.53}$Al$_{0.24}$Ga$_{0.23}$As self-assembled QDs with emission wavelengths at about 1.6 $\mu$m grown on InP substrate is investigated by pump-probe Faraday rotation spectroscopy in a magnetic field. Pronounced oscillations on two different frequencies, corresponding to the QD electron and hole spin precessions about the field are observed from which the corresponding $g$ factors are determined. The electron $g$ factor of about $-1.9$ has the largest negative value so far measured for III-V QDs by optical methods. This value, as well as the $g$ factors reported for other III-V QDs, differ from those expected for bulk semiconductors at the same emission energies, and this difference increases significantly for decreasing energies.

abstract: The Keldysh-ordered full counting statistics is a quasi-probability distribution describing the fluctuations of a time-integrated quantum observable. While it is well known that this distribution can fail to be positive, the interpretation and origin of this negativity has been somewhat unclear. Here, we show how the full counting statistics can be tied to trajectories through Hilbert space, and how this directly connects negative quasi-probabilities to an unusual interference effect. Our findings are illustrated with the example of energy fluctuations in a driven bosonic resonator; we discuss how negative quasi-probability here could be detected experimentally using superconducting microwave circuits.

abstract: We show that cosmological quantum relaxation predicts an anisotropic primordial power spectrum with a specific dependence on wavenumber k. We explore some of the consequences for precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Quantum relaxation is a feature of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, which allows the existence of more general physical states that violate the Born probability rule. Recent work has shown that relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes on expanding space, resulting in a large-scale power deficit with a characteristic inverse-tangent dependence on k. Because the quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave vector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able to derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined by the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB covariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the lowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling with multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual statistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency relation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the angular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the l-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation appears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale power deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with potentially testable relationships between them.

abstract: Optical frequency conversion has applications ranging from tunable light sources to telecommunications-band interfaces for quantum information science. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise frequency conversion on a nanophotonic chip through four-wave-mixing Bragg scattering in compact (footprint < 0.5 x 10^-4 cm^2) Si3N4 microring resonators. We investigate three frequency conversion configurations: (1) spectral translation over a few nanometers within the 980 nm band, (2) upconversion from 1550 nm to 980 nm, and (3) downconversion from 980 nm to 1550 nm. With conversion efficiencies ranging from 25 % for the first process to > 60 % for the last two processes, a signal conversion bandwidth > 1 GHz, < 60 mW of continuous-wave pump power needed, and background noise levels between a few fW and a few pW, these devices are suitable for quantum frequency conversion of single photon states from InAs quantum dots. Simulations based on coupled mode equations and the Lugiato-Lefever equation are used to model device performance, and show quantitative agreement with measurements.

abstract: We discuss the quantum phase transition from the Mott-insulator state to the density-wave state for cold Bose atoms in a 2D square lattice as the lattice is adiabatically tilted along one of its primary axes. It is shown that a small misalignment of the tilt drastically changes the result of the adiabatic passage and, instead of the density-wave state, one obtains a disordered state. Intrinsic relation of the problem to Bloch oscillations of hard-core bosons in a 2D lattice is illuminated.

abstract: The influence of additional information on the decision making of agents, who are interacting members of a society, is analyzed within the mathematical framework based on the use of quantum probabilities. The introduction of social interactions, which influence the decisions of individual agents, leads to a generalization of the quantum decision theory developed earlier by the authors for separate individuals. The generalized approach is free of the standard paradoxes of classical decision theory. This approach also explains the error-attenuation effects observed for the paradoxes occurring when decision makers, who are members of a society, consult with each other, increasing in this way the available mutual information. A precise correspondence between quantum decision theory and classical utility theory is formulated via the introduction of an intermediate probabilistic version of utility theory of a novel form, which obeys the requirement that zero-utility prospects should have zero probability weights.

abstract: It is well known that the bulk physics of a topological phase constrains its possible edge physics through the bulk-edge correspondence. Therefore, the different types of edge theories that a topological phase can host is a universal piece of data which can be used to characterize topological order. In this paper, we argue that beginning from only the fixed point wavefunction (FPW) of a nonchiral topological phase and by locally deforming it, all possible edge theories can be extracted from its entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). We illustrate our claim by deforming the FPW of the Wen-plaquette model, the quantum double of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that the possible EHs of the deformed FPWs reflect the known possible types of edge theories, which are generically gapped, but gapless if translationally symmetry is preserved. We stress that our results do not require an underlying Hamiltonian -- thus, this lends support to the notion that a topological phase is indeed characterized by only a set of quantum states and can be studied through its FPWs.

abstract: We report on an implementation of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method (MCTDH) for spin-polarized fermions (MCTDHF). Our approach is based on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and efficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations of motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive implementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB, the present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark the accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a time-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically trapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We demonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion Schr\"odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can hence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with time-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the problem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling through a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model proposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic particles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from sequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic momenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped subsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the different chemical potentials into kinetic energy.

abstract: The striking efficiency of energy transfer in natural photosynthetic systems and the recent evidence of long-lived quantum coherence in biological light harvesting complexes has triggered much excitement, due to the evocative possibility that these systems - essential to practically all life on earth -- use quantum mechanical effects to achieve optimal functionality. A large body of theoretical work has addressed the role of local environments in determining the transport properties of excitons in photosynthetic networks and the survival of quantum coherence in a classical environment. Nonetheless, understanding the connection between quantum coherence, exciton network geometry and energy transfer efficiency remains a challenge. Here we address this connection from the perspective of heat transfer within the exciton network. Using a non-equilibrium open quantum system approach and focusing on the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that finite local dephasing can be beneficial to the overall power output. The mechanism for this enhancement of power output is identified as a gentle balance between quantum and classical contributions to the local heat flow, such that the total heat flow is directed along the shortest paths and dissipation is minimized. Strongly related to the spatial network structure of the exciton transfer complex, this mechanism elucidates how energy flows in photosyntetic excitonic complexes.

abstract: Most quantum computing architectures can be realized as two-dimensional lattices of qubits that interact with each other. We take transmon qubits and transmission line resonators as promising candidates for qubits and couplers; we use them as basic building elements of a quantum code. We then propose a simple framework to determine the optimal experimental layout to realize quantum codes. We show that this engineering optimization problem can be reduced to the solution of standard binary linear programs. While solving such programs is a NP-hard problem, we propose a way to find scalable optimal architectures that require solving the linear program for a restricted number of qubits and couplers. We apply our methods to two celebrated quantum codes, namely the surface code and the Fibonacci code.

abstract: We present an impedance engineered Josephson parametric amplifier capable of providing bandwidth beyond the traditional gain-bandwidth product. We achieve this by introducing a positive linear slope in the imaginary component of the input impedance seen by the Josephson oscillator using a $\lambda/2$ transformer. Our theoretical model predicts an extremely flat gain profile with a bandwidth enhancement proportional to the square root of amplitude gain. We experimentally demonstrate a nearly flat 20 dB gain over a 640 MHz band, along with a mean 1-dB compression point of -110 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. The results are in good agreement with our theoretical model.

abstract: Forbidden transitions between energy levels typically involve violation of selection rules imposed by symmetry and/or conservation laws. A nanomagnet tunneling between up and down states violates angular momentum conservation because of broken rotational symmetry. Here we report observations of highly forbidden transitions between spin states in a Ni$_4$ single-molecule magnet in which a single photon can induce the spin to change by several times $\hbar$, nearly reversing the direction of the spin. These observations are understood as tunneling-assisted transitions that lift the standard $\Delta m = \pm 1$ selection rule for single-photon transitions. These transitions are observed at low applied fields, where tunneling is dominated by the molecule's intrinsic anisotropy and the field acts as a perturbation. Such transitions may be exploited in quantum information processing since under certain circumstances decoherence due to fluctuations in local magnetic fields is suppressed.

In this contribution, we exemplarily stick to the case of vacuum birefringence in a stationary perpendicularly directed, purely magnetic background field extending over a finite spatial extent. Similar field configurations are realized in the BMV and PVLAS experiments. We demonstrate that we can reproduce the conventional constant field result. Our focus is on effects which arise when the probe photons originate in the field free region, are directed towards the magnetic field region, and detected well after the interaction with the magnetic field has taken place, again at zero field.

abstract: We study the incandescence of a semiconductor system characterized by a radiatively broadened material excitation. We show that the shape of the emission spectrum and the peak emissivity value are determined by the ratio between radiative and non-radiative relaxation rates of the material mode. Our system is a heavily doped quantum well, exhibiting a collective bright electronic excitation in the mid-infrared. The spontaneous emission rate of this collective mode strongly depends on the emission direction and, uncommonly for a solid-state system, can dominate non-radiative scattering processes. Consequently the incandescence spectrum undergoes strong modifications when the detection angle is varied. Incandescence is modelled solving quantum Langevin equations, including a microscopic description of the collective excitations, decaying into electronic and photonic baths. We demonstrate that the emissivity reaches unity value for a well-defined direction and presents an angular radiative pattern which is very different from that of an oscillating dipole.

abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of molecules in a solution at room temperature has potential to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions are typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation times between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible molecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the liquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times. Importantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to solid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large detuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme with optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to design a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by room temperature electron thermal polarisation. We illustrate numerically the effectiveness of the model in a flow cell containing nanodiamonds immobilized in a hydrogel, polarising flowing water molecules 4700-fold above thermal polarisation in a magnetic field of 0.35 T, in volumes detectable by current NMR scanners.

abstract: The claim some years ago, contrary to all textbooks, that the angular momentum of a photon (and gluon) can be split in a gauge-invariant way into an orbital and spin term, sparked a major controversy in the Particle Physics community. A further cause of upset was the realization that the gluon polarization in a nucleon, a supposedly physically meaningful quantity, corresponds only to the gauge-variant gluon spin derived from Noether's theorem, evaluated in a particular gauge. On the contrary, Laser Physicists have, for decades, been happily measuring physical quantities which correspond to orbital and spin angular momentum evaluated in a particular gauge. This paper reconciles the two points of view.

abstract: Density functional theory provides the most widespread framework for the realistic description of the electronic structure of solids, but the description of strongly-correlated systems has remained so far elusive. Here we consider a particular limit of electrons in a periodic ionic potential in which a one-band description becomes exact all the way from the weakly-correlated metallic regime to the strongly-correlated Mott-Hubbard regime. We provide a necessary condition a density functional should fulfill to describe Mott-Hubbard behavior and show that it is not satisfied by standard and widely used local, semilocal and hybrid functionals. We illustrate the condition in the case of a few-atom system and provide an analytic approximation to the exact exchange-correlation potential based on a variational wave function which shows explicitly the correct behavior providing a robust scheme to combine lattice and continuum methods.

abstract: A co-dimension one critical surface in the momentum space can be either a familiar Fermi surface, which separates occupied states from empty ones in the non-interacting fermion case, or a novel Bose surface, where gapless bosonic excitations are anchored. Their presence gives rise to logarithmic violation of entanglement entropy area law. When they are convex, we show that the shape of these critical surfaces can be determined by inspecting the leading logarithmic term of real space entanglement entropy. The fundamental difference between a Fermi surface and a Bose surface is revealed by the fact that the logarithmic terms in entanglement entropies differ by a factor of two: $S^{Bose}_{log} = 2 S^{Fermi}_{log}$, even when they have identical geometry. Our method has remarkable similarity with determining Fermi surface shape using quantum oscillation. We also discuss possible probes of concave critical surfaces in momentum space.

abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory allows the existence of physical states that violate the Born probability rule. Recent work has shown that in pilot-wave field theory on expanding space relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes, resulting in a large-scale power deficit {\xi}(k) which for a radiation-dominated expansion is found to have a characteristic (approximate) inverse-tangent dependence on k. In this paper we show that the functional form of {\xi}(k) is robust under changes in the initial nonequilibrium distribution as well as under the addition of an inflationary era at the end of the radiation-dominated phase. In both cases the predicted deficit {\xi}(k) remains an inverse-tangent function of k. Furthermore, with the inflationary phase the dependence of the fitting parameters on the number of superposed pre-inflationary energy states is comparable to that found previously. Our results indicate that an inverse-tangent power deficit is likely to be a fairly general and robust signature of quantum relaxation in the early universe.

abstract: Standard semiconductor fabrication techniques are used to fabricate a quantum dot (QD) made of WS2, where Coulomb oscillations were found. The full-width-at-half-maximum of the Coulomb peaks increases linearly with temperature while the height of the peaks remains almost independent of temperature, which is consistent with standard semiconductor QD theory. Unlike graphene etched QDs, where Coulomb peaks belonging to the same QD can have different temperature dependences, these results indicate the absence of the disordered confining potential. This difference in the potential-forming mechanism between graphene etched QDs and WS2 QDs may be the reason for the larger potential fluctuation found in graphene QDs.

abstract: We report the experimental realization of a single-atom heat engine. An ion is confined in a linear Paul trap with tapered geometry and driven thermally by coupling it alternately to hot and cold reservoirs. The output power of the engine is used to drive a harmonic oscillation. From direct measurements of the ion dynamics, we determine the thermodynamic cycles for various temperature differences of the reservoirs. We use these cycles to evaluate power $P$ and efficiency $\eta$ of the engine, obtaining up to $P=342\,$yJ and $\eta=0.28 \,\%$, consistent with analytical estimations. Our results demonstrate that thermal machines can be reduced to the ultimate limit of single atoms.

abstract: Following a letter by Bassett, we show first that it is possible to find an analytical approximation to the error function in terms of a finite series of hyperbolic tangents from the supersymmetric (SUSY) solution of the Poschl-Teller eigenvalue problem in quantum mechanics (QM). Afterwards, we show that the second order differential equation for the derivatives of Dawson's function can be found in another SUSY related eigenvalue problem, where the factorization of the simple harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian renders the wrong-sign Hermite differential equation, and that Dawson's second order differential equation possess a singular SUSY type relation to this equation.

abstract: We consider a superconducting microwave cavity capacitively coupled to both a quantum conductor and its electronic reservoirs. We analyze in details how the measurements of the cavity microwave field, which are related to the electronic charge susceptibility, can be used to extract information on the transport properties of the quantum conductor. We show that the asymmetry of the capacitive couplings between the electronic reservoirs and the cavity plays a crucial role in relating optical measurements to transport properties. For asymmetric capacitive couplings, photonic measurements can be used to probe the finite low frequency admittance of the quantum conductor, the real part of which being related to the differential conductance. In particular, when the quantum dot is far from resonance, the charge susceptibility is directly proportional to the admittance for a large range of frequencies and voltages. However, when the quantum conductor is near a resonance, such a relation generally holds only at low frequency and for equal tunnel coupling or low voltage. Beyond this low-energy near equilibrium regime, the charge susceptibility and thus the optical transmission offers new insights on the quantum conductors since the optical observables are not directly connected to transport quantities. For symmetric lead capacitive couplings, we show that the optical measurements can be used to reveal the Korringa-Shiba relation, connecting the reactive to the dissipative part of the susceptibility, at low frequency and low bias.

abstract: A numerical method, suitable for the simulation of the time evolution of quantum spin models of arbitrary lattice dimension, is presented. The method combines sampling of the Wigner function with evolution equations obtained from the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy. Going to higher orders of the BBGKY hierarchy allows for a systematic refinement of the method. Quantum correlations are treated through both, the Wigner function sampling and the BBGKY evolution, bringing about highly accurate estimates of correlation functions. The method is particularly suitable for long-range interacting systems, and we demonstrate its power by comparing with exact results as well as other numerical methods. As an application we compute spin squeezing in a two-dimensional lattice with power-law interactions, as measured in recent ion trap experiments.

abstract: Tensor networks implementing quantum error correcting codes have recently been used to construct toy models of holographic duality explicitly realizing some of the more puzzling features of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These models reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for boundary intervals, and allow bulk operators to be mapped to the boundary in a redundant fashion. These exactly solvable, explicit models have provided valuable insight but nonetheless suffer from many deficiencies, some of which we attempt to address in this article. We propose a new class of tensor network models that subsume the earlier advances and, in addition, incorporate additional features of holographic duality, including: (1) a holographic interpretation of all boundary states, not just those in a "code" subspace, (2) a set of bulk states playing the role of "classical geometries" which reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for boundary intervals, (3) a bulk gauge symmetry analogous to diffeomorphism invariance in gravitational theories, (4) emergent bulk locality for sufficiently sparse excitations, and (5) the ability to describe geometry at sub-AdS resolutions or even flat space.

abstract: We present a bright and directional polarization-entangled photon-pair source generated by a photonic nanostructure that violates Bell's inequality. The solid-state quantum light source is an InAsP quantum dot in a tapered InP nanowire waveguide. Utilizing quasi-resonant excitation at the wurtzite InP nanowire resonance reduces multi-photon emission resulting in an entanglement fidelity of $F=0.835\,\pm\,0.004$ without temporal post-selection. The performed Bell test using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality reveals clear violation ($S_{\text{CHSH}}>2$) of the local hidden variable theory by 3.5 standard deviations and highlights the possible application in source-independent quantum key distribution.

abstract: We investigate the quantumness of primordial cosmological fluctuations and its detectability. The quantum discord of inflationary perturbations is calculated for an arbitrary splitting of the system, and shown to be very large on super-Hubble scales. This entails the presence of large quantum correlations, due to the entangled production of particles with opposite momentums during inflation. To determine how this is reflected at the observational level, we study whether quantum correlators can be reproduced by a non-discordant state, i.e. a state with vanishing discord that contains classical correlations only. We demonstrate that this can be done for the power spectrum, the price to pay being twofold: first, large errors in other two-point correlation functions, that cannot however be detected since hidden in the decaying mode; second, the presence of intrinsic non-Gaussianity the detectability of which remains to be determined but which could possibly rule out a non-discordant description of the Cosmic Microwave Background. If one abandons the idea that perturbations should be modeled by Quantum Mechanics and wants to use a classical stochastic formalism instead, we show that any two-point correlators on super-Hubble scales can exactly be reproduced regardless of the squeezing of the system. The later becomes important only for higher order correlation functions, that can be accurately reproduced only in the strong squeezing regime.

abstract: Recently, West and Fong [New J. Phys. 14, 083002 (2012)] introduced an echo scheme for an exchange-only qubit, which relies entirely on the exchange-interaction. Here, we compare two different exchange-based sequences and two optimization strategies, Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) and optimized filter function dynamical decoupling (OFDD), which were introduced for a single-spin qubit and are applied in this paper to the three-spin exchange-only qubit. The calculation shows that the adaption of the optimization concepts can be achieved by straight-forward calculation. We consider two types of noise spectra, Lorentzian and Ohmic noise. For both spectra, the results reveal a slight dependence of the performance on the choice of the echo sequence.

abstract: We consider a two level system with both a transversal and a longitudinal coupling to the electromagnetic field of a resonator. Using a polaron transformation, this Hamiltonian can be mapped onto a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with generalized field operators acting on the electromagnetic field in the resonator. In contrast to the usual ladder operators $a$ and $a^\dagger$, these operators exhibit a non-monotous coupling strength with respect to the number $n$ of photons in the resonator. Especially, there are roots of the coupling between qubit and resonator at certain photon numbers $n_0$. We show, that this effect can be exploited to generate photon-number squeezed light, characterized by a Fano factor $F \ll 1$, with a large number of photons (e.g. of the order of $10^4$).

abstract: The simulation of quantum transport in a realistic, many-particle system is a nontrivial problem with no quantitatively satisfactory solution. While real-time propagation has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of conventional transport methods, this approach is prone to finite size effects that are associated with modeling an open system on a closed spatial domain. Using a master equation framework, we exploit an equivalence between the superoperators coupling an open system to external particle reservoirs and non-Hermitian terms defined at the periphery of a quantum device. By taking the mean-field limit, the equation of motion for the single-particle reduced density matrix becomes equivalent to real-time time-dependent density functional theory in the presence of imaginary source and sink potentials. This method may be used to converge nonequilibrium steady states for a many-body quantum system using a previously reported constraint algorithm.

We highlight the consequences of introducing a weak-link into the circuit. In the latter context we clarify the phase-space considerations that are involved in setting up an effective "systems plus bath" description in terms of Josephson-Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian.

abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum annealing as a heuristic optimization method to find the absolute minimum of various continuous models, including landscapes with only two wells and also models with many competing minima and with disorder. The simulations performed using a projective quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm are compared with those based on the finite-temperature path-integral QMC technique and with classical annealing. We show that the projective QMC algorithm is more efficient than the finite-temperature QMC technique, and that both are inferior to classical annealing if this is performed with appropriate long-range moves. However, as the difficulty of the optimization problem increases, classical annealing looses efficiency, while the projective QMC algorithm keeps stable performance and is finally the most effective optimization tool. We discuss the implications of our results for the outstanding problem of testing the efficiency of adiabatic quantum computers using stochastic simulations performed on classical computers.

abstract: We demonstrate fluorescence microscopy of individual fermionic potassium atoms in a 527-nm-period optical lattice. Using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling on the 770.1-nm D$_1$ transition of $^{40}$K, we find that atoms remain at individual sites of a 0.3-mK-deep lattice, with a $1/e$ pinning lifetime of $67(9)\,\rm{s}$, while scattering $\sim 10^3$ photons per second. The plane to be imaged is isolated using microwave spectroscopy in a magnetic field gradient, and can be chosen at any depth within the three-dimensional lattice. With a similar protocol, we also demonstrate patterned selection within a single lattice plane. High resolution images are acquired using a microscope objective with 0.8 numerical aperture, from which we determine the occupation of lattice sites in the imaging plane with 94(2)\% fidelity per atom. Imaging with single-atom sensitivity and addressing with single-site accuracy are key steps towards the search for unconventional superfluidity of fermions in optical lattices, the initialization and characterization of transport and non-equilibrium dynamics, and the observation of magnetic domains.

abstract: We study the average rate of change of energy for a static atom immersed in a thermal bath of electromagnetic radiation in the cosmic string spacetime and separately calculate the contributions of thermal fluctuations and radiation reaction. We find that the transition rates are crucially dependent on the atom-string distance and polarization of the atom and they in general oscillate as the atom-string distance varies. Moreover, the atomic transition rates in the cosmic string spacetime can be larger or smaller than those in Minkowski spacetime contingent upon the atomic polarization and position. In particular, when located on the string, ground-state atoms can make a transition to excited states only if they are polarizable parallel to the string, whereas ground state atoms polarizable only perpendicular to the string are stable as if they were in a vacuum, even if they are immersed in a thermal bath. Our results suggest that the influence of a cosmic string is very similar to that of a reflecting boundary in Minkowski spacetime.

abstract: Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) widely exists in polyatomic systems including organic molecules, nano-magnets, and solid-state defects. Detecting the JTE at single-molecule level can provide unique properties about the detected individual object. However, such measurements are challenging because of the weak signals associated with a single quantum object. Here, we propose that the dynamic JTE of single defects in solids can be observed with nearby quantum sensors. With numerical simulations, we demonstrate the real-time monitoring of quantum jumps between different stable configurations of single substitutional nitrogen defect centers (P1 centers) in diamond. This is achieved by measuring the spin coherence of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center near the P1 center with the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Our work extends the ability of NV center as a quantum probe to sense the rich physics in various electron-vibrational coupled systems.

We show that a generating function of expectation values among two excited states of the dilatation operator in conformal quantum mechanics is a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and it corresponds to the AdS2 partition function evaluated as the minisuperspace wave function in Liouville field theory. We also show that the dilatation expectation values in conformal quantum mechanics lead to the asymptotic smoothed counting function of the Riemann zeros.

Through the Naimark dilation in operator algebra, passive $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric couplers can thus be implemented with a refractive index of real values and asymmetric coupling coefficients. This opens up the possibility to implement general $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with state-of-the-art asymmetric slab waveguides, dissimilar optical fibers, or cavities with chiral mirrors.

abstract: A new method of analysing positive bistochastic maps on the algebra of complex matrices $M_{3}$ has been proposed. By identifying the set of such maps with a convex set of linear operators on $\mathbb{R}^{8}$, one can employ techniques from the theory of compact affine semigroups to obtain results concerning asymptotic properties of positive maps. It turns out that the idempotent elements play a crucial role in classifying the convex set into subsets, in which representations of extremal positive maps are to be found. It has been show that all extremal positive bistochastic maps that are not Jordan isomorphisms of $M_3$ are represented by matrices that fall into two possible categories, determined by the simplest idempotent matrices: one by the zero matrix, and the other by a one dimensional orthogonal projection. Some norm conditions for matrices representing possible extremal maps have been specified and examples of maps from both categories have been brought up, based on the results published previously.

abstract: Correlated phases of matter provide long-term stability for systems as diverse as solids, magnets, and potential exotic quantum materials. Mechanical systems, such as relays and buckling transition spring switches can yield similar stability by exploiting non-equilibrium phase transitions. Curiously, in the optical domain, observations of such phase transitions remain elusive. However, efforts to integrate optical and mechanical systems -- optomechanics -- suggest that a hybrid approach combining the quantum control of optical systems with the engineerability of mechanical systems may provide a new avenue for such explorations. Here we report the first observation of the buckling of an optomechanical system, in which transitions between stable mechanical states corresponding to both first- and second-order phase transitions are driven by varying laser power and detuning. Our results enable new applications in photonics and, given rapid progress in pushing optomechanical systems into the quantum regime, the potential for explorations of quantum phase transitions.

abstract: Theoretical models of spins coupled to bosons provide a simple setting for studying a broad range of important phenomena in many-body physics, from virtually mediated interactions to decoherence and thermalization. In many atomic, molecular, and optical systems, such models also underlie the most successful attempts to engineer strong, long-ranged interactions for the purpose of entanglement generation. Especially when the coupling between the spins and bosons is strong---such that it cannot be treated perturbatively---the properties of such models are extremely challenging to calculate theoretically. Here, exact analytical expressions for nonequilibrium spin-spin correlation functions are derived for a specific model of spins coupled to bosons. The spatial structure of the coupling between spins and bosons is completely arbitrary, and thus the solution can be applied to systems in any number of dimensions. The explicit and nonperturbative inclusion of the bosons enables the study of entanglement generation (in the form of spin squeezing) even when the bosons are driven strongly and near-resonantly, and thus provides a quantitative view of the breakdown of adiabatic elimination that inevitably occurs as one pushes towards the fastest entanglement generation possible. The solution also helps elucidate the effect of finite temperature on spin squeezing. The model considered is relevant to a variety of atomic, molecular, and optical systems, such as atoms in cavities or trapped ions. As an explicit example, the results are used to quantify phonon effects in trapped ion quantum simulators, which are expected to become increasingly important as these experiments push towards larger numbers of ions.

In general, in this group-theoretical approach, the above wave equations arise in certain overdetermined forms, which can be reduced to the conventional ones by a Gaussian elimination. A connection between the spin of a particle/field and consistency of the corresponding overdetermined system is emphesized.

abstract: A Markovian open quantum system which relaxes to a unique steady state $\rho_{ss}$ of finite rank can be decomposed into a finite physically realizable ensemble (PRE) of pure states. That is, as shown by Karasik and Wiseman [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 020406 (2011)], in principle there is a way to monitor the environment so that in the long time limit the conditional state jumps between a finite number of possible pure states. In this paper we show how to apply this idea to the dynamics of a double quantum dot arising from the feedback control of quantum transport, as previously considered by one of us and co-workers [Phys. Rev. B 84, 085302 (2011)]. Specifically, we consider the limit where the system can be described as a qubit, and show that while the control scheme can always realize a two-state PRE, in the incoherent tunneling regime there are infinitely many PREs compatible with the dynamics that cannot be so realized. For the two-state PREs that are realized, we calculate the counting statistics and see a clear distinction between the coherent and incoherent regimes.

We demonstrate the existence of X-wave traveling solutions in the coupled exciton-photon system past the inflection point, where the effective mass of lower polaritons is negative in the direction perpendicular to the wavevector of the pumping beam. Contrary to the case of bright solitons, X-waves do not require nonlinearity for sustaining their shape. Nevertheless, we show that nonlinearity is important for their dynamics, as it allows for their spontaneous formation from an initial Gaussian wavepacket.

abstract: The phenomenon of half-spectral unidirectional invisibility is introduced for one-dimensional periodic optical structures with tailored real and imaginary refractive index distributions in a non-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration. The effect refers to the property that the optical medium appears to be invisible, both in reflection and transmission, below the Bragg frequency when probed from one side, and above the Bragg frequency when probed from the opposite side. Half-spectral invisibility is obtained by a combination of in-phase index and gain gratings whose spatial amplitudes are related each other by a Hilbert transform.

abstract: Synthetic ladders realized with one-dimensional alkaline-earth(-like) fermionic gases and subject to a gauge field represent a promising environment for the investigation of quantum Hall physics with ultracold atoms. Using density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we study how the quantum Hall-like chiral edge currents are affected by repulsive atom-atom interactions. We relate the properties of such currents to the asymmetry of the spin resolved momentum distribution function, a quantity which is easily addressable in state-of-art experiments. We show that repulsive interactions significantly stabilize the quantum Hall-like helical region and enhance the chiral currents. Our numerical simulations are performed for atoms with two and three internal spin states.

abstract: We show how the elusive toroidal dipole moment appears as a radiative excitation eigenmode in a metamolecule resonator that is formed by pairs of plasmonic nanorods. We analyze one such nanorod configuration - a toroidal metamolecule. We find that the radiative interactions in the toroidal metamolecule can be qualitatively represented by a theoretical model based on an electric point dipole arrangement. Both a finite-size rod model and the point dipole approximation demonstrate how the toroidal dipole moment is subradiant and difficult to excite by incident light. By means of breaking the geometric symmetry of the metamolecule, the toroidal mode can be excited by linearly polarized light and we provide simple optimization protocols for maximizing the toroidal dipole mode excitation. This opens up possibilities for simplified control and driving of metamaterial arrays consisting of toroidal dipole unit-cell resonators.

abstract: Scalable implementation of the optics required to control trapped atomic ions' quantum states will be required to construct large-scale ion trap quantum information processors. All experiments in ion traps so far have employed approaches cumbersome to scale to even a few tens of qubits, with the majority relying on manipulation of free space beams with bulk optics. Here we demonstrate lithographically defined nanophotonic dielectric waveguides integrated within a linear surface-electrode ion trap chip, and qubit addressing at multiple locations via focusing grating couplers that emit through openings in the trap electrodes to an ion trapped 50 $\mu$m above the chip. We perform quantum coherent operations using visible light routed in and emitted from silicon nitride waveguides and couplers, on the optical qubit transition in individual $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions. The addressing beam is focused near the ion position with a 2 $\mu$m 1/$e^2$-radius along the trap axis, and we measure crosstalk errors between $10^{-2}$ and $4\times10^{-4}$ at distances 7.5-15 $\mu$m from the beam center. This is the first realization of optical functionality for trapped ions with nanofabricated integrated optics; owing to the scalability of the planar fabrication employed, together with the tight focusing and stable alignment afforded by optics integration within the trap chip, this approach presents a path towards large-scale quantum information processing with trapped ions

abstract: Dynamics of wavepackets in fractional Schrodinger equation is still an open problem. The difficulty stems from the fact that the fractional Laplacian derivative is essentially a nonlocal operator. We investigate analytically and numerically the propagation of optical beams in fractional Schr\"odinger equation with a harmonic potential. We find that the propagation of one- and two-dimensional (1D, 2D) input chirped Gaussian beams is not harmonic. In 1D, the beam propagates along a zigzag trajectory in the real space, which corresponds to a modulated anharmonic oscillation in the momentum space. In 2D, the input Gaussian beam evolves into a breathing ring structure in both real and momentum spaces, which forms a filamented funnel-like aperiodic structure. The beams remain localized in propagation, but with increasing distance display increasingly irregular behavior, unless both the linear chirp and the transverse displacement of the incident beam are zero.

abstract: The Yang-Baxter equation has long been recognised as the masterkey to integrability, providing the basis for exactly solved models which capture the fundamental physics of a number of realistic classical and quantum systems. In this article we provide an introductory overview of the impact of Yang-Baxter integrable models on experiments in condensed matter physics and ultracold atoms. A number of prominent examples are mentioned, including the hard-hexagon model, the Heisenberg spin chain, the transverse quantum Ising chain, a spin ladder model, the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the Gaudin-Yang Fermi gas and the two-site Bose-Hubbard model. The review concludes by pointing to some other recent developments with promise for further progress.

abstract: We study a system coupled to external degrees of freedom, called bath, where we assume that the total system, consisting of system and bath is in equilibrium. An expansion in the coupling between system and bath leads to a general form of the reduced density matrix of the system as a function of the bath selfenergy. The coupling to the bath results in a renormalization of the energies of the system and in a change of the eigenbasis. This theory is applicable to quantum emulators in thermal equilibrium. Undesired external degrees of freedom can affect their reliability. We study the influence of bosonic degrees of freedom on the state of a six qubit system.

abstract: We numerically analyse the behavior of the full distribution of collective observables in quantum spin chains. While most of previous studies of quantum critical phenomena are limited to the first moments, here we demonstrate how quantum fluctuations at criticality lead to highly non-Gaussian distributions thus violating the central limit theorem. Interestingly, we show that the distributions for different system sizes collapse after scaling on the same curve for a wide range of transitions: first and second order quantum transitions and transitions of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. We propose and carefully analyse the feasibility of an experimental reconstruction of the distribution using light-matter interfaces for atoms in optical lattices or in optical resonators.

abstract: When a system is driven across a quantum critical point at a constant rate its evolution must become non-adiabatic as the relaxation time $\tau$ diverges at the critical point. According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the emerging post-transition excited state is characterized by a finite correlation length $\hat\xi$ set at the time $\hat t=\hat \tau$ when the critical slowing down makes it impossible for the system to relax to the equilibrium defined by changing parameters. This observation naturally suggests a dynamical scaling similar to renormalization familiar from the equilibrium critical phenomena. We provide evidence for such KZM-inspired spatiotemporal scaling by investigating an exact solution of the transverse field quantum Ising chain in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: From the steam engine to current nano-devices, the design of efficient thermal machines has been instrumental in modern societies. In its essence a thermal engine can be thought as a working substance, in contact with two or more baths, undergoing a cyclic transformation. What happens if the working substance is on the verge of a phase transition? Already in 1902 the latent heat was identified as a key to improve the efficiency of steam engines Despite this early observation, the impact of phase transitions on the performance of thermal machines has not been addressed. By combining the tools of non-equilibrium and quantum thermodynamics with finite-size-scaling and information theory, we unveil an unnoticed mechanism, triggered by the vicinity to a phase transition, to boost the performance of an engine. This result sheds new light on the so called power-efficiency dilemma and could be used to realise powerful and, at the same time, efficient engines. Specific implementations with trapped ions and superconducting nano-circuits will be discussed.

abstract: We report a new version of fermion coupled coherent states (FCCS-II) method to simulate two-electron systems based on a self-symmetrized six-dimensional (6D) coherent states grid. Unlike the older fermion coupled coherent states (FCCS-I) method, FCCS-II does not need any new equations in comparison with the coupled coherent states method. FCCS-II uses a simpler and more efficient approach for symmetrizing the spatial wave function in the simulation of fermionic systems. This method, has significantly increased the speed of computations and give us capability to simulate the quantum systems with the larger CS grids. We apply FCCS-II to simulate the Helium atom and the Hydrogen molecule based on grids with a large numbers of coherent states. Moreover, we have derived all the important equations of the FCCS-I by an exact attitude.

abstract: The existence of a minimal length is a common prediction of various theories of quantum gravity. This minimal length leads to a modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Various studies showed that a GUP modifies the Hawking radiation of black holes. In this paper, we propose a modification of the Schwarzschild metric based on the modified Hawking temperature derived from the GUP. Based on this modified metric, we calculate corrections to the deflection of light, time delay of light, perihelion precession, and gravitational redshift. We compare our results with gravitational measurements to set an upper bound on the GUP parameter.

abstract: The D-Wave adiabatic quantum annealer solves hard combinatorial optimization problems leveraging quantum physics. The newest version features over 1000 qubits and was released in August 2015. We were given access to such a machine, currently hosted at NASA Ames Research Center in California, to explore the potential for hard optimization problems that arise in the context of databases. In this paper, we tackle the problem of multiple query optimization (MQO). We show how an MQO problem instance can be transformed into a mathematical formula that complies with the restrictive input format accepted by the quantum annealer. This formula is translated into weights on and between qubits such that the configuration minimizing the input formula can be found via a process called adiabatic quantum annealing. We analyze the asymptotic growth rate of the number of required qubits in the MQO problem dimensions as the number of qubits is currently the main factor restricting applicability. We experimentally compare the performance of the quantum annealer against other MQO algorithms executed on a traditional computer. While the problem sizes that can be treated are currently limited, we already find a class of problem instances where the quantum annealer is three orders of magnitude faster than other approaches.

abstract: In this paper, we are in a further exploration of metastable states constructed by Soffer and Weinstein in [15]. These metastable states are the outcome of instabilities of excited states for Klein-Gordon equations under nonlinear Fermi golden rule. In [15], Soffer and Weinstein derived an upper bound ($1/(1+t)^{1/4}$) for an anomalously slow decay rate of these states. We derive the asymptotic behavior (including a lower bound $1/(1+t)^{1/4}$) and prove asymptotic completeness for current cases. This means that at very late stage ($t$ goes to $+\infty$) the solutions to this nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation could be written as the sum of free waves and error terms; and the $L^2_x$ norm of error terms will vanish eventually ($t$ goes to $+\infty$). Therefore, even though there is a lower bound for the anomalously slow decay rate for these states, asymptotic completeness still holds.

abstract: Artificial gauge fields for neutral particles such as photons, recently attracted a lot of attention in various fields ranging from photonic crystals to ultracold atoms in optical lattices to optomechanical arrays. Here we point out that, among all implementations of gauge fields, the optomechanical setting allows for the most natural extension where the gauge field becomes dynamical. The mechanical oscillation phases determine the effective artificial magnetic field for the photons, and once these phases are allowed to evolve, they respond to the flow of photons in the structure. We discuss a simple three-site model where we identify four different regimes of the gauge-field dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to a two-dimensional lattice. Our proposed scheme could for instance be implemented using optomechanical crystals.

abstract: We performed high-temperature luminescence studies of silicon-vacancy color centers obtained by ion implantation in single crystal diamond. We observed reduction of the integrated fluorescence upon increasing temperature, ascribable to a transition channel with an activation energy of 180 meV that populates a shelving state. Nonetheless, the signal decreased only 50% and 75% with respect to room temperature at 500 K and 700 K, respectively. In addition, the color center is found highly photostable at temperatures exceeding 800 K. The luminescence of this color center is thus extremely robust even at large temperatures and it holds promise for novel diamond-based light-emitting devices.

abstract: Crowdscience games may hold unique potentials as learning opportunities compared to games made for fun or education. They are part of an actual science problem solving process: By playing, players help scientists, and thereby interact with real continuous research processes. This mixes the two worlds of play and science in new ways. During usability testing we discovered that users of the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game terms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations.We then examined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational and grounded theory analysis. This essay presents the core ideas of crowdscience games as learning opportunities, and reports how a group of players used "game", "science" and "conceptual" frames to interpret their experience. Our results suggest that oscillating between the frames instead of sticking to just one led to the largest number of correct science interpretations, as players could participate legitimately and autonomously at multiple levels of understanding.

abstract: We construct a low-energy effective theory of topological $s$-wave pairing superconductors, focusing on the mean-field model of superconductor $\mbox{Cu}_{x}\mbox{Bi}_{2}\mbox{Se}_{3}$. Our approach is second-order perturbation with respect to the inverse of the mass (i.e., large-mass expansion) in the Dirac-type electron dispersion from topological insulator $\mbox{Bi}_{2}\mbox{Se}_{3}$. Since the Dirac-type dispersion with a large mass describes non-relativistic electrons, the large-mass expansion corresponds to a low-energy theory with respect to the original setup. We show that the effective gap function has not only a $p$-wave-like component as the primary contribution, but also an $s$-wave-like one as higher-order corrections. The mixture of $p$- and $s$-wave explains the numerical results [Phys. Rev. B 89 (2014) 214506] of the non-magnetic impurity effects.

abstract: In this paper we discuss the topics concerning the local excitation and coherent state in 2D CFT. It is shown that the local excitation of primary operator can be taken as a coherent state of the global conformal group. We also discuss the entanglement property of such state. For rational CFT the entanglement entropy between the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sector of the local excitation of some primary operator is related to the quantum dimension of the operator, consistent with previous approach, but by a differentmethod. We comment on the possible application of so-defined group coherent state in the holographic view. We also study the coherent state in the free massless boson field, their time evolution and entanglement property. We introduce the deformed local excitation and the entangled state constructed by them. It is shown the violation of Bell inequality for such entangled state.

abstract: We report on the generation of single-photon pulse trains at a repetition rate of up to 1 GHz. We achieve this high speed by modulating the external voltage applied on an electrically contacted quantum dot microlens, which is optically excited by a continuous-wave laser. By modulating the photoluminescence of the quantum dot microlens using a square-wave voltage, single-photon emission is triggered with a response time as short as 270 ps being 6.5 times faster than the radiative lifetime of 1.75 ns. This large reduction in the characteristic emission time is enabled by a rapid capacitive gating of emission from the quantum dot placed in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n-junction biased below the onset of electroluminescence. Here, the rising edge of the applied voltage pulses triggers the emission of single photons from the optically excited quantum dot. The non-classical nature of the photon pulse train generated at GHz-speed is proven by intensity autocorrelation measurements. Our results combine optical excitation with fast electrical gating and thus show promise for the generation of indistinguishable single photons at high rates, exceeding the limitations set by the intrinsic radiative lifetime.

abstract: A definition for the entanglement entropy in a gauge theory was given recently in arXiv:1501.02593. Working on a spatial lattice, it involves embedding the physical state in an extended Hilbert space obtained by taking the tensor product of the Hilbert space of states on each link of the lattice. This extended Hilbert space admits a tensor product decomposition by definition and allows a density matrix and entanglement entropy for the set of links of interest to be defined. Here, we continue the study of this extended Hilbert space definition with particular emphasis on the case of Non-Abelian gauge theories. We extend the electric centre definition of Casini, Huerta and Rosabal to the Non-Abelian case and find that it differs in an important term. We also find that the entanglement entropy does not agree with the maximum number of Bell pairs that can be extracted by the processes of entanglement distillation or dilution, and give protocols which achieve the maximum bound. Finally, we compute the topological entanglement entropy which follows from the extended Hilbert space definition and show that it correctly reproduces the total quantum dimension in a class of Toric code models based on Non-Abelian discrete groups.

abstract: We study the spin currents induced by topological screw dislocation and cosmic dispiration. By using the extended Drude model, we find that the spin dependent forces are modified by the nontrivial geometry. For the topological screw dislocation, only the direction of spin current is bended by deforming the spin polarization vector. In contrast, the force induced by cosmic dispiration could affect both the direction and magnitude of the spin current. As a consequence, the spin-Hall conductivity doesn't receive corrections from screw dislocation.

abstract: We extend the generalize conservation law of light propagating in a one-dimensional $\cal PT$-symmetric system, i.e., $|T-1|=\sqrt{R_LR_R}$ for the transmittance $T$ and the reflectance $R_{L,R}$ from the left and right, to a multimode waveguide with either $\cal PT$ or $\cal RT$ symmetry, in which higher dimensional investigations are necessary. These conservation laws exist not only in a matrix form for the transmission and reflection matrices; they also exist in a scalar form for real-valued quantities by defining generalized transmittance and reflectance. We then discuss, for the first time, how a multimode $\cal PT$-symmetric waveguide can be used to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking of the scattering matrix, which typically requires tuning the non-hermiticity of the system (i.e. the strength of gain and loss). Here the advantage of using a multimode waveguide is the elimination of tuning any system parameters: the transverse mode order $m$ plays the role of the symmetry breaking parameter, and one observes the symmetry breaking by simply performing scattering experiment in each waveguide channel at a single frequency and fixed strength of gain and loss.

abstract: We describe the Quantum Test of the Equivalence principle and Space Time (QTEST), a concept for an atom interferometry mission on the International Space Station (ISS). The primary science objective of the mission is a test of Einstein's equivalence principle with two rubidium isotope gases at a precision of better than 10$^{-15}$. Distinct from the classical tests is the use of quantum wave packets and their expected large spatial separation in the QTEST experiment. This dual species atom interferometer experiment will also be sensitive to time-dependent equivalence principle violations that would be signatures for ultralight dark-matter particles. In addition, QTEST will be able to perform photon recoil measurements to better than 10$^{-11}$ precision. This improves upon terrestrial experiments by a factor of 100, enabling an accurate test of the standard model of particle physics and contributing to mass measurement, in the proposed new international system of units (SI), with significantly improved precision. The predicted high measurement precision of QTEST comes from the microgravity environment on ISS, offering extended free fall times in a well-controlled environment. Suppression of systematic errors by use of symmetric interferometer configurations and rejection of common-mode errors drives the QTEST design. It uses Bragg interferometry with a single laser beam at the "magic" wavelength, where the two isotopes have the same polarizability, for mitigating sensitivities to vibrations and laser noise, imaging detection for correcting cloud initial conditions and maintaining contrast, modulation of the atomic hyperfine states for reduced sensitivity to magnetic field gradients, two source regions for simultaneous time reversal measurements and redundancy, and modulation of the gravity vector using a rotating platform to reduce otherwise difficult systematics to below 10$^{-16}$.

We then build two-dimensional second-order correlated function patterns for achieving higher amplification factor and discuss the signal-to-noise ratio influence. Several advantages can be obtained by our proposal. For instance, detectors with high resolution are not necessary. Moreover, detectors with low saturation intensity are available in WVA setup. Finally, type-one technical noise can be effectively suppressed.

abstract: We show that the bipartite logarithmic entanglement negativity (EN) of quantum spin models obeys an area law at all nonzero temperatures. We develop numerical linked cluster (NLC) expansions for the `area-law' logarithmic entanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters. For one-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC results are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse-field Ising models. In all cases, we find a sudden onset (or sudden death) of negativity at a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset (or sudden death). The onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical finite-temperature phase transitions, supporting the argument for absence of any role of quantum mechanics at such transitions. On approach to a quantum critical point at $T=0$, negativity shows critical scaling in size and temperature.

abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of Rydberg interactions on Autler-Townes spectra of ultracold gases of atomic strontium. Realizing two-photon Rydberg excitation via a long-lived triplet state allows us to probe the thus far unexplored regime where Rydberg state decay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism. The effects of Rydberg interactions are observed in shifts, asymmetries, and broadening of the measured atom-loss spectra. The experiment is analyzed within a one-body density matrix approach, accounting for interaction-induced level shifts and dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations due to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our experimental observations for short excitation times. For longer excitation times, the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van der Waals interactions.

abstract: Vacuum magnetic birefringence was predicted long time ago and is still lacking a direct experimental confirmation. Several experimental efforts are striving to reach this goal, and the sequence of results promises a success in the next few years. This measurement generally is accompanied by the search for hypothetical light particles that couple to two photons. The PVLAS experiment employs a sensitive polarimeter based on a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. In this paper we report on the latest experimental results of this experiment. The data are analysed taking into account the intrinsic birefringence of the dielectric mirrors of the cavity. Besides the limit on the vacuum magnetic birefringence, the measurements also allow the model-independent exclusion of new regions in the parameter space of axion-like and milli-charged particles. In particular, these last limits hold also for all types of neutrinos, resulting in a laboratory limit on their charge.

abstract: We develop generalization of the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo method for Hamiltonians which explicitly depend on particle spins such as for spin-orbit interactions. The method is formulated in zero variance manner and is similar to treatment of nonlocal operators in commonly used static- spin calculations. Tests on atomic and molecular systems show that it is very accurate, on par with the fixed-node method. This opens electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methods to a vast research area of quantum phenomena in which spin-related interactions play an important role.

abstract: The holographic duality relates a field theory to a theory of (quantum) gravity in one dimension more. The extra dimension represents the scale of the RG transformation in the field theory. It has been conjectured that the tensor networks which arise during the real space renormalization procedure like the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) are a discretized version of the background of the gravity theory. We strive to contribute to make this conjecture testable by considering an explicit and tractable example, namely the dual network of the toric code, for which MERA can be performed analytically. We examine how this construction can be extended to include excited states. Furthermore, we show how to calculate topological entanglement entropy from the geometry of MERA. This method is expected to generalize to systems with generic entanglement structure.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine stochastic Markovian models for circuits in phase space for which the drift term is equivalent to the standard circuit equations. In particular we include dissipative components corresponding to both a resistor and a memristor in series. We obtain a dilation of the problem for which is canonical in the sense that the underlying Poisson Brackets structure is preserved under the stochastic flow. We do this first of all for standard Wiener noise, but also treat the problem using a new concept of symplectic noise where the Poisson structure is extended to the noise as well as the circuit variables, and in particular where we have canonically conjugate noises. Finally we construct a dilation which describes the quantum mechanical analogue.

abstract: The Quantum Oracle Classification (QOC) problem is to classify a function, given only quantum black box access, into one of several classes without necessarily determining the entire function. Generally, QOC captures a very wide range of problems in quantum query complexity. However, relatively little is known about many of these problems. In this work, we analyze the a subclass of the QOC problems where there is a group structure. That is, suppose the range of the unknown function A is a commutative group G, which induces a commutative group law over the entire function space. Then we consider the case where A is drawn uniformly at random from some subgroup A of the function space. Moreover, there is a homomorpism f on A, and the goal is to determine f(A). This class of problems is very general, and covers several interesting cases, such as oracle evaluation; polynomial interpolation, evaluation, and extrapolation; and parity. These problems are important in the study of message authentication codes in the quantum setting, and may have other applications. We exactly characterize the quantum query complexity of every instance of QOC with group structure in terms of a particular counting problem. That is, we provide an algorithm for this general class of problems whose success probability is determined by the solution to the counting problem, and prove its exact optimality. Unfortunately, solving this counting problem in general is a non-trivial task, and we resort to analyzing special cases. Our bounds unify some existing results, such as the existing oracle evaluation and parity bounds. In the case of polynomial interpolation and evaluation, our bounds give new results for secret sharing and information theoretic message authentication codes in the quantum setting.

abstract: The 2d CP(N-1) models share a number of features with QCD, like asymptotic freedom, a dynamically generated mass gap and topological sectors. They have been formulated and analysed successfully in the framework of the so-called D-theory, which provides a smooth access to the continuum limit. In that framework, we propose an experimental set-up for the quantum simulation of the CP(2) model. It is based on ultra-cold Alkaline-Earth Atoms (AEAs) located on the sites of an optical lattice, where the nuclear spins represent the relevant degrees of freedom. We present numerical results for the correlation length and for the real time decay of a false vacuum, to be compared with such a future experiment. The latter could also enable the exploration of theta-vacua and of the phase diagram at finite chemical potentials, since it does not suffer from any sign problem.

abstract: We determine by two related methods the invariance algebra $\g$ of the \emph{`pseudo-diffusion equation'} (PSDE) $$ L~Q \equiv \left[\frac {\partial}{\partial t} -\frac 1 4 \left(\frac {\partial^2}{\partial x^2} -\frac 1 {t^2} \frac {\partial^2}{\partial p^2}\right)\right]~Q(x,p,t)=0, $$ which describes the behavior of the $Q$ functions in the $(x,p)$-phase space as a function of a squeeze parameter $y$, where $t=e^{2y}$. The algebra turns out to be isomorphic to that of its constant coefficient version. Relying on this isomorphism we construct a local point transformation which maps the factor $t^{-2}$ to 1. We show that any generalized version $u_t-u_{xx}+ b(t) u_{yy}=0$ of PSDE has a smaller symmetry algebra than $\g$, except for $b(t)$ equals to a constant or it is proportional to $t^{-2}$. We apply the group elements $G_i(\ga) := \exp[\ga A_i]$ and obtain new solutions of the PSDE from simple ones, and interpret the physics of some of the results. We make use of the `factorization property' of the PSDE to construct its \textit{`2-sided kernel'}, because it has to depend on two times, $t_0 < t < t_1$. We include a detailed discussion of the identification of the Lie algebraic structure of the symmetry algebra $\g$, and its contraction from $\su(1,1)\oplus\so(3,1)$.

abstract: Lyapunov exponents play an important role in the evolution of quantum chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. We conjecture the existence of an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponents that contribute to the quantum motion. This is a universal feature in any quantum system or quantum field theory, including those with a gravity dual, at zero or finite temperature. It has its origin in the finite size of the Hilbert space that is available to an initial quasi-classical configuration. An important consequence of this result is a universal quantum bound on the maximum growth rate of the entanglement entropy.

abstract: We consider a quantum self-contained fridge consisting of three qubits interacting with three separate heat reservoirs, respectively, and functioning without any external controls. Applying the methods of endoreversible thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions of cooling load versus efficiency of this fridge, which demonstrate behaviors of trade-off between those two quantities and thus enable to discuss the thermoeconomic optimization of performance. We also discuss a possibility for the amplification of cooling load briefly in a simple modification from the original architecture of fridge.

abstract: Memory effects can lead to history-dependent behavior of a system, and they are ubiquitous in our daily life and have broad applications. Here we explore possibilities of generating memory effects in simple isolated quantum systems. By utilizing geometrical effects from a class of lattices supporting flat-bands consisting of localized states, memory effects could be observed in ultracold atoms in optical lattices. As the optical lattice continuously transforms from a triangular lattice into a kagome lattice with a flat band, history-dependent density distributions manifest quantum memory effects even in noninteracting systems, including fermionic as well as bosonic systems in the proper ranges of temperatures. Rapid growth in ultracold technology predicts a bright future for quantum memory-effect systems, and here two prototypical applications of geometry-induced quantum memory effects are proposed: An accelerometer recording the mechanical change rate in a coupled system and a rate-controlled memvalve where the rate of ramping the lattice potential acts as a control of the remnant density in the lattice.

abstract: The entanglement renormalization flow of a (1+1) free boson is formulated as a path integral over some auxiliary scalar fields. The resulting effective theory for these fields amounts to the dilaton term of non-critical string theory in two spacetime dimensions. A connection between the scalar fields in the two theories is provided, allowing to acquire novel insights into how a theory of gravity emerges from the entanglement structure of another one without gravity.

abstract: The dispersion relation of ultracold atoms in variably shaped optical lattices can be tuned to resemble that of a relativistic particle, i.e. be linear instead of the usual nonrelativistic quadratic dispersion relation of a free atom. Cold atoms in such a lattice can be used to carry out quantum simulations of relativistic wave equation predictions. We begin this article by describing a Raman technique that allows to selectively load atoms into a desired Bloch band of the lattice near a band crossing. Subsequently, we review two recent experiments with quasirelativistic rubidium atoms in a bichromatic lattice, demonstrating the analogs of Klein tunneling and Veselago lensing with ultracold atoms respectively.

abstract: Ambiguity and ambiguity aversion have been widely studied in decision theory and economics both at a theoretical and an experimental level. After Ellsberg's seminal studies challenging subjective expected utility theory (SEUT), several (mainly normative) approaches have been put forward to reproduce ambiguity aversion and Ellsberg-type preferences. However, Machina and other authors have pointed out some fundamental difficulties of these generalizations of SEUT to cope with some variants of Ellsberg's thought experiments, which has recently been experimentally confirmed. Starting from our quantum modeling approach to human cognition, we develop here a general probabilistic framework to model human decisions under uncertainty. We show that our quantum theoretical model faithfully represents different sets of data collected on both the Ellsberg and the Machina paradox situations, and is flexible enough to describe different subjective attitudes with respect to ambiguity. Our approach opens the way toward a quantum-based generalization of expected utility theory (QEUT), where subjective probabilities depend on the state of the conceptual entity at play and its interaction with the decision-maker, while preferences between acts are determined by the maximization of this 'state-dependent expected utility'.

abstract: Giant impurity excitations with large binding energies are powerful probes for exploring new regimes of far out of equilibrium dynamics in few- and many-body quantum systems, as well as for in-situ observations of correlations. Motivated by recent experimental progress in spectroscopic studies of Rydberg excitations in ensembles of ultracold atoms, we develop a new theoretical approach for describing multiscale dynamics of Rydberg excitations in quantum Bose gases. We find that the crossover from few- to many-body dynamics manifests in a dramatic change in spectral profile from resolved molecular lines to broad Gaussian distributions representing a superpolaronic state in which many atoms bind to the Rydberg impurity. We discuss signatures of this crossover in the temperature and density dependence of the spectra.
