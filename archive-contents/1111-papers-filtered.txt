abstract: Though classical random walks have been studied for many years, research concerning their quantum analogues, quantum random walks, has only come about recently. Numerous simulations of both types of walks have been run and analyzed, and are generally well-understood. Research pertaining to one of the more important properties of classical random walks, namely, their ability to build fractal structures in diffusion-limited aggregation, has been particularly noteworthy. However, only now has research begun in this area in regards to quantum random motion. The study of random walks and the structures they build has various applications in materials science. Since all processes are quantum in nature, it is important to consider the quantum variant of diffusion-limited aggregation. Recognizing that Schr\"odinger equation and a classical random walk are both diffusion equations, it is possible to connect and compare them. Using similar parameters for both equations, we ran various simulations aggregating particles. Our results show that particles moving according to Schr\"odinger equation can create fractal structures, much like the classical random walk. Furthermore, the fractal dimensions of these quantum diffusion-limited aggregates vary between 1.43 and 2, depending on the size of the initial wave packet.

abstract: We study the dynamics of systems on networks from a linear algebraic perspective. The control theoretic concept of controllability describes the set of states that can be reached for these systems. Under appropriate conditions, there is a connection between the quantum (Lie theoretic) property of controllability and the linear systems (Kalman) controllability condition. We investigate how the graph theoretic concept of a zero forcing set impacts the controllability property. In particular, we prove that if a set of vertices is a zero forcing set, the associated dynamical system is controllable. The results open up the possibility of further exploiting the analogy between networks, linear control systems theory, and quantum systems Lie algebraic theory. This study is motivated by several quantum systems currently under study, including continuous quantum walks modeling transport phenomena. Additionally, it proposes zero forcing as a new notion in the analysis of complex networks.

abstract: Surprisingly the looking natural random walk leading to Brownian motion occurs to be often biased in a very subtle way: usually refers to only approximate fulfillment of thermodynamical principles like maximizing uncertainty. Recently, a new philosophy of stochastic modeling was introduced, which by being mathematically similar to euclidean path integrals, finally fulfills these principles exactly. Their local behavior is usually similar, but may lead to completely different global properties. In contrast to Brownian motion leading to nearly uniform stationary density, this recent approach turns out in agreement with having strong localization properties thermodynamical predictions of quantum mechanics, like thermalizing to dynamical equilibrium state having probability density as the quantum ground state: squares of coordinates of the lowest energy eigenvector of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for single particle in discrete case, or of the standard Schrodinger operator while including potential and making infinitesimal limit. It also provides a natural intuition of the amplitudes' squares relating to probabilities. The present paper gathers, formalizes and extends these results. There are also introduced and discussed some new generalizations, like considering multiple particles with thermodynamical analogue of Pauli exclusion principle or time dependent cases, which allowed to introduce thermodynamical analogues of momentum operator, Ehrenfest equation and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

abstract: Linear optics quantum computing (LOQC) is a promising approach to implementing scalable quantum computation (QC). However, this approach has very demanding physical resource requirements. Recently, Aaronson & Arkhipov showed that a simplified model, which avoids the requirement for fast feed-forward and post-selection, while likely not capable of solving BQP-complete problems efficiently, can solve an interesting sampling problem, believed to be classically hard. Loss and mode-mismatch are the dominant sources of error in such systems. We provide evidence that even lossy systems, or systems with mode-mismatch, are likely to be classically hard to simulate. This is of practical interest to experimentalists wishing to demonstrate such systems, since it suggests that even with errors in their implementation, they are likely implementing an algorithm which is classically hard to simulate. Our results also equivalently apply to the multi-walker quantum walk model.

abstract: We analyze continuous-time quantum walks on necklace graphs - cyclical graphs consisting of many copies of a smaller graph (pearl). Using a Bloch-type ansatz for the eigenfunctions, we block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian, reducing the effective size of the problem to the size of a single pearl. We then present a general approach for showing that the mixing time scales (with growing size of the necklace) similarly to that of a simple walk on a cycle. Finally, we present results for mixing on several necklace graphs.

abstract: Quantum versions of cylindric phase space, like for the motion of a particle on the circle, are obtained through different families of coherent states. The latter are built from various probability distributions of the action variable. The method is illustrated with Gaussian distributions and uniform distributions on intervals, and resulting quantizations are explored.

abstract: We consider the effects of plane-wave states scattering off finite graphs, as an approach to implementing single-qubit unitary operations within the continuous-time quantum walk framework of universal quantum computation. Four semi-infinite tails are attached at arbitrary points of a given graph, representing the input and output registers of a single qubit. For a range of momentum eigenstates, we enumerate all of the graphs with up to $n=9$ vertices for which the scattering implements a single-qubit gate. As $n$ increases, the number of new unitary operations increases exponentially, and for $n>6$ the majority correspond to rotations about axes distributed roughly uniformly across the Bloch sphere. Rotations by both rational and irrational multiples of $\pi$ are found.

abstract: We study the dynamics of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) on networks with highly degenerate eigenvalue spectra of the corresponding connectivity matrices. In particular, we consider the two cases of a star graph and of a complete graph, both having one highly degenerate eigenvalue, while displaying different topologies. While the CTQW spreading over the network - in terms of the average probability to return or to stay at an initially excited node - is in both cases very slow, also when compared to the corresponding classical continuous-time random walk (CTRW), we show how the spreading is enhanced by randomly adding bonds to the star graph or removing bonds from the complete graph. Then, the spreading of the excitations may become very fast, even outperforming the corresponding CTRW. Our numerical results suggest that the maximal spreading is reached halfway between the star graph and the complete graph. We further show how this disorder-enhanced spreading is related to the networks' eigenvalues.

abstract: The continuous limit of one dimensional discrete-time quantum walks with time- and space-dependent coefficients is investigated. A given quantum walk does not generally admit a continuous limit but some families (1-jets) of quantum walks do. All families (1-jets) admitting a continuous limit are identified. The continuous limit is described by a Dirac-like equation or, alternately, a couple of Klein-Gordon equations. Variational principles leading to these equations are also discussed, together with local invariance properties.

abstract: We exhibit a way to associate a quantum walk (QW) on the non-negative integers to any probability measure on the unit circle. This forces us to consider one step transitions that are not traditionally allowed. We illustrate this in the case of a very interesting measure, originally proposed by F. Riesz for a different purpose.
