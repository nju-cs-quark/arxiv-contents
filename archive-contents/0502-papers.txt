abstract: Taking the excess electron spin in a unit cell of semiconductor multiple quantum-dot structure as a qubit, we can implement scalable quantum computation without resorting to spin-spin interactions. The technique of single electron tunnelings and the structure of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) are used to create a charge entangled state of two electrons which is then converted into spin entanglement states by using single spin rotations. Deterministic two-qubit quantum gates can also be manipulated using only single spin rotations with help of QCA. A single-short read-out of spin states can be realized by coupling the unit cell to a quantum point contact.

abstract: Multi-dimensional entangled states have been proven to be more powerful in some quantum information process. In this paper, down-converted photons from spontaneous parametric down conversion(SPDC) are used to engineer multi-dimensional entangled states. A kind of multi-degree multi-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state can also be generated. The hyper-entangled photons, which are entangled in energy-time, polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is proved to be useful to increase the dimension of systems and investigate higher-dimensional entangled states.

abstract: The propagation by continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on one-dimensional lattices shows structures in the transition probabilities between different sites reminiscent of quantum carpets. For a system with periodic boundary conditions, we calculate the transition probabilities for a CTQW by diagonalizing the transfer matrix and by a Bloch function ansatz. Remarkably, the results obtained for the Bloch function ansatz can be related to results from (discrete) generalized coined quantum walks. Furthermore, we show that here the first revival time turns out to be larger than for quantum carpets.

abstract: A pair of atoms interacting successively with the field of the same cavity and exchanging a single photon, leave the cavity in an entangled state of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type (see, for example, [S.J.D. Phoenix, and S.M. Barnett, J. Mod. Opt. \textbf{40} (1993) 979]). By implementing the model with the translational degrees of freedom, we show in this letter that the entanglement with the translational atomic variables can lead, under appropriate conditions, towards the separability of the internal variables of the two atoms. This implies that the translational dynamics can lead, in some cases, to difficulties in observing the Bell's inequality violation for massive particles.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Two typical entanglements will be shown to stand on opposite sides on the issue of \emph{instrumental realism}, the issue of whether (as for EPR in the original form or EPRB, Bohm's versions using spin) or not (as for GHZ) observables have values that preexist measurement. Instrumental realism in the EPR context helps us prove that in some special circumstances, one can get simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities, which in particular make sense together. This shatters the axiomatic presentation of Quantum Mechanics. This simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities elaborates on 1935 work by Schr{\"o}dinger, hence the name, \emph{Schr{\"o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem}, given to the second main result that is easily deduced from the result on instrumental realism. Once the axiomatic edifice of Quantum Mechanics is broken, we can let go the completeness of the wave function as suggested in EPR, and hold fast on locality. The EPR paper of mid-1935 gets here contrasted, from a new point of view, with a 1936 text where Einstein avoids using counterfactuals. Counterfactuals get a precise definition and the corresponding concept is used all along, but may be new under an old name. We provide a short critical review of Bell's 1964 paper. Then, a small modification of arguments for the Schr{\"o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem will let appear a simple conservation law, combined with the Malus Law, as the origin of the correlation in Bell's version of EPRB: this is our third main result. As the fourth main result, a last use of the concept of counterfactual yields the decay of geometry at small enough scale. This opens a new world of interpretation of aspects of Quantum Mechanics, aspects that range from measurement and the need of classical physics to views on what realism should mean in microphysics.

abstract: Maximally entangled states are of utmost importance to quantum communication, dense coding, and quantum teleportation. With a trapped ion placed inside a high finesse optical cavity, interacting with field of an external laser and quantized cavity field, a scheme to generate a maximally entangled three qubit GHZ state, is proposed. The dynamics of tripartite entanglement is investigated, using negativity as an entanglement measure and linear entropy as a measure of mixedness of a state. It is found that (a) the number of modes available to the subsystem determines the maximum entanglement of a subsystem, b) at entanglement maxima and minima, linear entropy and negativity uniquely determine the nature of state, but the two measures do not induce the same ordering of states, and c) for a special choice of system parameters maximally entangled tripartite two mode GHZ state is generated. The scheme presented for GHZ state generation is a single step process and is reduction free. PACS: 03.67.-a, 42.50.-p, 03.67.Dd

By using this model, we prove that pure state Quantum Threshold Schemes (QTS) can be constructed from quantum MDS codes and vice versa. In particular, we consider stabilizer codes and give a constructive proof of their relation with QTS. Furthermore, we reformulate the Monotone Span Program (MSP) construction according to the information theoretical model and check the recoverability and secrecy requirement. Finally, we consider QSS schemes which are based on quantum teleportation.

abstract: We explore the effect of a system's symmetries on fidelity decay behavior. Chaos-like exponential fidelity decay behavior occurs in non-chaotic systems when the system possesses symmetries and the applied perturbation is not tied to a classical parameter. Similar systems without symmetries exhibit faster-than-exponential decay under the same type of perturbation. This counter-intuitive result, that extra symmetries cause the system to behave in a chaotic fashion, may have important ramifications for quantum error correction.

abstract: We analyze the performance of adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) under the effect of decoherence. To this end, we introduce an inherently open-systems approach, based on a recent generalization of the adiabatic approximation. In contrast to closed systems, we show that a system may initially be in an adiabatic regime, but then undergo a transition to a regime where adiabaticity breaks down. As a consequence, the success of AQC depends sensitively on the competition between various pertinent rates, giving rise to optimality criteria.

abstract: The unitary braiding operators describing topological entanglements can be viewed as universal quantum gates for quantum computation. With the help of the Brylinskis's theorem, the unitary solutions of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation can be also related to universal quantum gates. This paper derives the unitary solutions of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation via Yang--Baxterization from the solutions of the braided relation. We study Yang--Baxterizations of the non-standard and standard representations of the six-vertex model and the complete solutions of the non-vanishing eight-vertex model. We construct Hamiltonians responsible for the time-evolution of the unitary braiding operators which lead to the Schr{\"o}dinger equations.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: By implicitly assuming that all possible Bell-measurements occur simultaneously, all proofs of Bell's Theorem violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. This assumption is made in the original form of Bell's inequality, in Wigner's probability inequalities, and in the ``nonlocality without inequalities'' arguments. The introduction of time into derivations of these variants of Bell's theorem results in extra terms related to the time order of the measurements used in constructing correlation coefficients. Since the same locality assumptions are made in the Heisenberg-compliant derivations of this paper, only time-independent classical local hidden variable theories are forbidden by violations of the original Bell inequalities; time-dependent quantum local hidden variable theories can satisfy this new bound and agree with experiment. We further point out that factorizable wavefunctions have been used to describe some EPR experiments and can be used to describe others. These will generate local de Broglie-Bohm trajectories in the description of the data. This second, independent, line of argument also shows that violation of Bell's inequality is only evidence that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle cannot be ignored.

abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in spin gases. A spin gas consists of a (large) number of interacting particles whose random motion is described classically while their internal degrees of freedom are described quantum-mechanically. We determine the entanglement that occurs naturally in such systems for specific types of quantum interactions. At the same time, these systems provide microscopic models for non--Markovian decoherence: the interaction of a group of particles with other particles belonging to a background gas are treated exactly, and differences between collective and non--collective decoherence processes are studied. We give quantitative results for the Boltzmann gas and also for a lattice gas, which could be realized by neutral atoms hopping in an optical lattice. These models can be simulated efficiently for systems of mesoscopic sizes (N ~ 10^5).

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A heat engine is a machine which uses the temperature difference between a hot and a cold reservoir to extract work. Here both reservoirs are quantum systems and a heat engine is described by a unitary transformation which decreases the average energy of the bipartite system. On the molecular scale, the ability of implementing such a unitary heat engine is closely connected to the ability of performing logical operations and classical computing. This is shown by several examples: (1) The most elementary heat engine is a SWAP-gate acting on 1 hot and 1 cold two-level systems with different energy gaps. (2) An optimal unitary heat engine on a pair of 3-level systems can directly implement OR and NOT gates, as well as copy operations. The ability to implement this heat engine on each pair of 3-level systems taken from the hot and the cold ensemble therefore allows universal classical computation. (3) Optimal heat engines operating on one hot and one cold oscillator mode with different frequencies are able to calculate polynomials and roots approximately. (4) An optimal heat engine acting on 1 hot and n cold 2-level systems with different level spacings can even solve the NP-complete problem KNAPSACK. Whereas it is already known that the determination of ground states of interacting many-particle systems is NP-hard, the optimal heat engine is a thermodynamic problem which is NP-hard even for n non-interacting spin systems. This result suggest that there may be complexity-theoretic limitations on the efficiency of molecular heat engines.

abstract: We measure the rates of elastic and inelastic two-body collisions of cold spin-polarized neon atoms in the metastable 3P2 state for 20^Ne and 22^Ne in a magnetic trap. From particle loss, we determine the loss parameter of inelastic collisions beta=6.5(18)x10^{-12} cm^3s^{-1} for 20^Ne and beta=1.2(3)x10^{-11}cm^3{s}^{-1} for 22^Ne. These losses are caused by ionizing (i.e. Penning) collisions %to more than and occur less frequently than for unpolarized atoms. This proves the suppression of Penning ionization due to spin-polarization. From cross-dimensional relaxation measurements, we obtain elastic scattering lengths of a=-180(40) a_0 for 20^Ne and a=+150(+80/-50) a_0 for 22^Ne, where a_0=0.0529 nm.

abstract: A modified version of Young's experiment by Shahriar Afshar demonstrates that, prior to what appears to be a ``which-way'' measurement, an interference pattern exists. Afshar has claimed that this result constitutes a violation of the Principle of Complementarity. This paper discusses the implications of this experiment and considers how Cramer's Transactional Interpretation easily accomodates the result. It is also shown that the Afshar experiment is analogous in key respects to a spin one-half particle prepared as ``spin up along $\bf x$'', subjected to a nondestructive confirmation of that preparation, and post-selected in a specific state of spin along $\bf z$. The terminology ``which-way'' or ``which-slit'' is critiqued; it is argued that this usage by both Afshar and his critics is misleading and has contributed to confusion surrounding the interpretation of the experiment. Nevertheless, it is concluded that Bohr would have had no more problem accounting for the Afshar result than he would in accounting for the aforementioned pre- and post-selection spin experiment, in which the particle's preparation state is confirmed by a nondestructive measurement prior to post-selection. In addition, some new inferences about the interpretation of delayed choice experiments are drawn from the analysis.

These problems, which we respectively call SES and SESSP, are specified in terms of pure slightly-entangled quantum states of n qubits, and rigorous mathematical proofs that they belong to the NP-Complete complexity class are presented. Both SES and SESSP are, therefore, computationally equivalent to the relevant 3-SAT problem, for which an efficient algorithm is yet to be discovered.

abstract: We consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of elementary subsystems with nearest neighbor interactions and assume that the total system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyze under what condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices with respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the same temperature $T$. While in classical mechanics the validity of this procedure only depends on the size of the groups $n$, in quantum mechanics the minimum group size $n_{\text{min}}$ also depends on the temperature $T $! As examples, we apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and an Ising spin chain. We discuss various features that show up due to the characteristics of the models considered. For the harmonic chain, which successfully describes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first quantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can exist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the Debye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below.

We discuss the limitations of these methods when applied to all dimensions, shedding some light on the difficulty of obtaining tight bounds for the remaining dimensions that have the form d=16n^2, where n can be any number. We additionally give a simpler, alternative proof that there can be at most d/2+1 real mutually unbiased bases in dimension d instead of invoking the known results on extremal Euclidean line sets by Cameron and Seidel, Delsarte, and Calderbank et al.

abstract: A comparative study is performed on two heterodyne systems of photon detectors expressed in terms of a signal annihilation operator and an image band creation operator called Shapiro-Wagner and Caves' frame, respectively. This approach is based on the introduction of a convenient operator $\hat \psi$ which allows a unified formulation of both cases. For the Shapiro-Wagner scheme, where $[\hat \psi, \hat \psi^{\dag}] =0$, quantum phase and amplitude are exactly defined in the context of relative number state (RNS) representation, while a procedure is devised to handle suitably and in a consistent way Caves' framework, characterized by $[\hat \psi, \hat \psi^{\dag}] \neq 0$, within the approximate simultaneous measurements of noncommuting variables. In such a case RNS phase and amplitude make sense only approximately.

abstract: Moir\'e patterns are produced when two periodic structures with different spatial frequencies are superposed. The transmission of the resulting structure gives rise to spatial beatings which are called moir\'e fringes. In classical optics, the interest in moir\'e fringes comes from the fact that the spatial beating given by the frequency difference gives information about details(high spatial frequency) of a given spatial structure. We show that moir\'e fringes can also arise in the spatial distribution of the coincidence count rate of twin photons from the parametric down-conversion, when spatial structures with different frequencies are placed in the path of each one of the twin beams. In other words,we demonstrate how moir\'e fringes can arise from quantum images.

The scheme is based on the cluster expansion and the time dependent perturbation theory implemented numerically. This approach offers a dramatic advantage in numerical efficiency, and it is also more convenient than the commonly used Magnus expansion, especially when dealing with higher order terms. We illustrate the scheme by designing 2nd-order pi-pulses and a 6th-order 8-pulse refocusing sequence for a chain of qubits with nearest-neighbor couplings. We also discuss the performance of soft-pulse refocusing sequences in suppressing decoherence due to low-frequency environment.

Oblivious transfer the security of which is information-theoretic for both parties is known impossible to achieve from scratch. - The joint behavior of certain bi-partite quantum states is non-local, i.e., cannot be explained by shared classical information. In order to better understand such behavior, which is classically explainable only by communication, but does not allow for it, Popescu and Rohrlich have described a "non-locality machine": Two parties both input a bit, and both get a random output bit the XOR of which is the AND of the input bits. - We show a close connection, in a cryptographic sense, between OT and the "PR primitive." More specifically, unconditional OT can be achieved from a single realization of PR, and vice versa. Our reductions, which are single-copy, information-theoretic, and perfect, also lead to a simple and optimal protocol allowing for inverting the direction of OT.

abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a primitive used in quantum information processing to capture the principle of complementarity. While constructions of maximal sets of d+1 such bases are known for systems of prime power dimension d, it is unknown whether this bound can be achieved for any non-prime power dimension. In this paper we demonstrate that maximal sets of MUBs come with a rich combinatorial structure by showing that they actually are the same objects as the complex projective 2-designs with angle set {0,1/d}. We also give a new and simple proof that symmetric informationally complete POVMs are complex projective 2-designs with angle set {1/(d+1)}.

abstract: In a recent letter, Barbosa et al [PRL 90, 227901(2003)] claim that secure communication is possible with bright coherent pulses, by using quantum noise to hide the data from an eavesdropper. We show here that the secrecy in the scheme of Barbosa et al is unrelated to quantum noise, but rather derives from the secret key that sender and receiver share beforehand.

abstract: We predict a new spatial quantum correlation in light propagating through a multiple scattering random medium. The correlation depends on the quantum state of the light illuminating the medium, is infinite range, and dominates over classical mesoscopic intensity correlations. The spatial quantum correlation is revealed in the quantum fluctuations of the total transmission or reflection through the sample and should be readily observable experimentally.

abstract: The aim of the present article is to study in detail the so-called spin equation (SE) and present both the methods of generating new solution and a new set of exact solutions. We recall that the SE with a real external field can be treated as a reduction of the Pauli equation to the (0+1)-dimensional case. Two-level systems can be described by an SE with a particular form of the external field. In this article, we also consider associated equations that are equivalent or (in one way or another) related to the SE. We describe the general solution of the SE and solve the inverse problem for this equation. We construct the evolution operator for the SE and consider methods of generating new sets of exact solutions. Finally, we find a new set of exact solutions of the SE.

abstract: Often, one would like to determine some observable A, but can only measure some (hopefully related) observable M. This can arise, for example, in quantum eavesdropping, or when the research lab budget isn't large enough for that 100% efficient photodetector. It also arises whenever one tries to jointly determine two complementary observables via some measurement M. This raises three natural questions: (i) What is the best possible estimate of A from M ? ; (ii) How 'noisy' is such an estimate ? ; and (iii) Are there any universally valid uncertainty relations for joint estimates ? Quite general answers, and applications to heterodyne detection and EPR joint measurements, are briefly reviewed.

authors: G. Sampath
comments: 7 pages, 1 figure
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502037
abstract: Summary. A modified version of the two-slit experiment is proposed in which the moveable detector/counter used to obtain the fringe distribution by counting single photons at different positions on the screen plane is replaced with a mirror positioned at an angle to the screen plane. A single photon arriving at the mirror through one of the slits is reflected at one of two angles along one of two divergent paths. It is then detected by one of two detectors, one on each of the paths, for different positions of the mirror on the screen plane. This modification results in the ability to generate which way information based on the path taken by the reflected photon as well as the distribution of photon counts on the screen plane, one for each slit. Since the photon does not experience any change other than the reflection at the mirror the question whether fringes are also present because of a priori interference effects when no mirror is present can be answered by examining the two a posteriori distributions. Three possible outcomes are considered and explanations proposed for them. The experiment is shown to be feasible with existing technology and can be performed in most physics laboratories.

The average profit of each partner is equal to the average profit obtained in the quantum game with two noncommuting operators for the spin one half system with strategies defined by the wave function. Nash equilibria in the macroscopic game coincide with Nash equilibria of the quantum game.

abstract: Light propagation and storing in a medium of atoms in the tripod configuration driven by two control pulses are investigated theoretically in terms of two polaritons and numerically. It is shown that a magnetic field switched on at the pulse storage stage changes the phase relations between the atomic coherences due to the stored pulse, which leads to an essential modification of the released pulse. Quantitative relations concerning the released pulse and the coherences are given. A general situation when the two control fields are not proportional at the pulse release stage is also examined. It is shown that in both cases a single dark state polariton is not sufficient to account for the pulse evolution, which is connected with the fact that a part of the signal remains in the medium after the release stage.

abstract: The notion of entangling power of unitary matrices was introduced by Zanardi, Zalka and Faoro [PRA, 62, 030301]. We study the entangling power of permutations, given in terms of a combinatorial formula. We show that the permutation matrices with zero entangling power are, up to local unitaries, the identity and the swap. We construct the permutations with the minimum nonzero entangling power for every dimension. With the use of orthogonal latin squares, we construct the permutations with the maximum entangling power for every dimension. Moreover, we show that the value obtained is maximum over all unitaries of the same dimension, with possible exception for 36. Our result enables us to construct generic examples of 4-qudits maximally entangled states for all dimensions except for 2 and 6. We numerically classify, according to their entangling power, the permutation matrices of dimension 4 and 9, and we give some estimates for higher dimensions.

An enriched menu of prospective phenomenological models is then obtainable via the mere changes of variables. We pay thorough attention to the harmonic oscillator example with a fractional screening and emphasize the role of the existence and invariance of its quasi-exact states for different tobogganic C(s).

abstract: We calculate the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation for arbitrary mixtures of the zero spin states on an arbitrary-dimensional bipartite Hilbert space. Such states are relevant to quantum black holes and to decoherence-free subspaces based communication. The two measures of entanglement are equal and scale logarithmically with the system size. We discuss its relation to the black hole entropy law. Moreover, these states are locally distinguishable but not locally orthogonal, thus violating a conjecture that the entanglement measures coincide only on locally orthogonal states. We propose a slightly weaker form of this conjecture. Finally, we generalize our entanglement analysis to any unitary group.

Then we derive the probabilities of Quantum Measurement from the deterministic Schroedinger equation by the usual techniques of Classical Statistical Mechanics.

abstract: We propose a quantum secret sharing protocol between multi-party ($m$ members in group 1) and multi-party ($n$ members in group 2) using a sequence of single photons. These single photons are used directly to encode classical information in a quantum secret sharing process. In this protocol, all members in group 1 directly encode their respective keys on the states of single photons via unitary operations, then the last one (the $m^{th}$ member of group 1) sends $1/n$ of the resulting qubits to each of group 2. Thus the secret message shared by all members of group 1 is shared by all members of group 2 in such a way that no subset of each group is efficient to read the secret message, but the entire set (not only group 1 but also group 2) is. We also show that it is unconditionally secure. This protocol is feasible with present-day techniques.

abstract: We consider travelling-wave parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime and present the experimental demonstration of the quantum character of the spatial fluctuations in the system. In addition to showing the presence of sub-shot noise fluctuations in the intensity difference, we demonstrate that the peak value of the normalized spatial correlations between signal and idler lies well above the line marking the boundary between the classical and the quantum domain. This effect is equivalent to the apparent violation of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, predicted by some of us years ago, which represents a spatial analogue of photon antibunching in time. Finally, we analyse numerically the transition from the quantum to the classical regime when the gain is increased and we emphasize the role of the inaccuracy in the determination of the symmetry center of the signal/idler pattern in the far-field plane.

abstract: Once considered essential to the explanation of electromagnetic phenomena, the ether was eventually discarded after the advent of special relativity. The lack of empirical signature of realist interpretative schemes of quantum mechanics, like Bohmian trajectories, has led some to conclude that, just like the ether, they can be dispensed with, replaced by the corresponding emergence of the concept of information. Although devices like Bohmian trajectories and the ether do present important analogies, I argue that there is also a crucial difference, related to distinct explanatory functions of quantum mechanics.

For quantum computers Hilbert spaces of dimension $2^{100}$ or larger will be typical and therefore this effect may contribute significantly to reduce the problems of scaling of quantum computers to a useful number of qubits.

When the system is macroscopic, the perfect correlation assumption substitutes the noninvasive measurability hypothesis advanteousgely. The new inequalities are violated quantically. This violation is clearly more severe than the similar violation in the case of ordinary Bell inequalities. Some microscopic and macroscopic situations in which these inequalities could be tested are considered.

In particular, Dirac's bra-ket formalism is fully implemented by the rigged Hilbert space rather than just by the Hilbert space. In this paper, we provide a pedestrian introduction to the role the rigged Hilbert space plays in Quantum Mechanics, by way of a simple, exactly solvable example. The procedure will be constructive and based on a recent publication. We also provide a thorough discussion on the physical significance of the rigged Hilbert space.

abstract: We study the approximation of the smallest eigenvalue of a Sturm-Liouville problem in the classical and quantum settings. We consider a univariate Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with a nonnegative function $q$ from the class $C^2([0,1])$ and study the minimal number $n(\e)$ of function evaluations or queries that are necessary to compute an $\e$-approximation of the smallest eigenvalue. We prove that $n(\e)=\Theta(\e^{-1/2})$ in the (deterministic) worst case setting, and $n(\e)=\Theta(\e^{-2/5})$ in the randomized setting. The quantum setting offers a polynomial speedup with {\it bit} queries and an exponential speedup with {\it power} queries. Bit queries are similar to the oracle calls used in Grover's algorithm appropriately extended to real valued functions. Power queries are used for a number of problems including phase estimation. They are obtained by considering the propagator of the discretized system at a number of different time moments. They allow us to use powers of the unitary matrix $\exp(\tfrac12 {\rm i}M)$, where $M$ is an $n\times n$ matrix obtained from the standard discretization of the Sturm-Liouville differential operator. The quantum implementation of power queries by a number of elementary quantum gates that is polylog in $n$ is an open issue.

abstract: We analyze the quantum binary adder channel, i.e. the quantum generalization of the classical, and well-studied, binary adder channel: in this model qubits rather than classical bits are transmitted. This of course is as special case of the general theory of quantum multiple access channels, and we may apply the established formulas for the capacity region to it. However, the binary adder channel is of particular interest classically, which motivates our generalizing it to the quantum domain. It turns out to be a very nice case study not only of multi-user quantum information theory, but also on the role entanglement plays there. It turns out that the analogous classical situation, the multi-user channel supported by shared randomness, is not distinct from the channel without shared randomness, as far as rates are concerned. However, we discuss the effect the new resource has on error probabilities, in an appendix. We focus specially on the effect entanglement between the senders as well as between senders and receiver has on the capacity region. Interestingly, in some of these cases one can devise rather simple codes meeting the capacity bounds, even in a zero-error model, which is in marked difference to code construction in the classical case.

abstract: Decoherence effects on quantum and classical dynamics in reactive scattering are examined using a Caldeira-Leggett type model. Through a study of dynamics of the collinear H+H2 reaction and the transmission over simple one-dimensional barrier potentials, we show that decoherence leads to improved agreement between quantum and classical reaction and transmission probabilities, primarily by increasing the energy dispersion in a well defined way. Increased potential nonlinearity is seen to require larger decoherence in order to attain comparable quantum-classical agreement.

abstract: The entanglement of general pure Gaussian two-mode states is examined in terms of the coefficients of the quadrature components of the wavefunction. The entanglement criterion and the entanglement of formation are directly evaluated as a function of these coefficients, without the need for deriving local unitary transformations. These reproduce the results of other methods for the special case of symmetric pure states which employ a relation between squeezed states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. The modification of the quadrature coefficients and the corresponding entanglement due to application of various optical elements is also derived.

The problem reduces to that of a two-level system interacting with a single mode field, but with an effective Rabi frequency that depends upon the fundamental and third harmonic fields. The resultant analytic control solution is explored for a variety of parameters, with emphasis on the dependence of control on the relative phase of the lasers. The generalization to off-resonant cases is noted.

abstract: The obtention of ultracold samples of dipolar molecules is a current challenge which requires an accurate knowledge of their electronic properties to guide the ongoing experiments. In this paper, we systematically investigate the ground state and the lowest triplet state of mixed alkali dimers (involving Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on pseudopotentials for atomic core representation, gaussian basis sets, and effective terms for core polarization effects. We emphasize on the convergence of the results for permanent dipole moments regarding the size of the gaussian basis set, and we discuss their predicted accuracy by comparing to other theoretical calculations or available experimental values. We also revisit the difficulty to compare computed potential curves among published papers, due to the differences in the modelization of core-core interaction.

abstract: We obtain a collection of necessary (sufficient) conditions for a bipartite system of qubits to be separable (entangled), which are based on the Landau-Pollak formulation of the uncertainty principle. These conditions are tested, and compared with previously stated criteria, by applying them to states whose separability limits are already known. Our results are also extended to multipartite and higher-dimensional systems.

abstract: The coherence of a hyperfine-state superposition of a trapped $^{9}$Be$^+$ ion in the presence of off-resonant light is experimentally studied. It is shown that Rayleigh elastic scattering of photons that does not change state populations also does not affect coherence. Coherence times exceeding the average scattering time of 19 photons are observed. This result implies that, with sufficient control over its parameters, laser light can be used to manipulate hyperfine-state superpositions with very little decoherence.

abstract: We present a new technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. It is based on direct information-theoretic arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze the BB84, the six-state, and the B92 protocol with one-way error correction and privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more robust against noise in the quantum channel.

abstract: In the optical Stern-Gerlach effect the two branches in which the incoming atomic packet splits up can display interference pattern outside the cavity when a field measurement is made which erases the which-way information on the quantum paths the system can follow. On the contrary, the mere possibility to acquire this information causes a decoherence effect which cancels out the interference pattern. A phase space analysis is also carried out to investigate on the negativity of the Wigner function and on the connection between its covariance matrix and the distinguishability of the quantum paths.

Taking into account, for a fair comparison, all inefficiencies of state-of-the-art set-up, the experimental implementation outperforms the best classical protocol, making it the candidate for multi-party quantum communication applications.

abstract: We investigate the influence of environmental noise on polarization entangled light generated by parametric emission in a cavity. By adopting a recently developed separability criterion, we show that: i) self-stimulation may suppress the detrimental influence of noise on entanglement; ii) when self-stimulation becomes effective, a classical model of parametric emission incorporating noise provides the same results of quantum theory for the expectation values involved in the separability criterion. Moreover we show that, in the macroscopic limit, it is impossible to observe violations of local realism with measurements of $n$-particle correlations, whatever n but finite. These results provide an interesting example of the emergence of macroscopic local realism in the presence of strong entanglement even in the absence of decoherence.

abstract: Each classical public-coin protocol for coin flipping is naturally associated with a quantum protocol for weak coin flipping. The quantum protocol is obtained by replacing classical randomness with quantum entanglement and by adding a cheat detection test in the last round that verifies the integrity of this entanglement. The set of such protocols defines a family which contains the protocol with bias 0.192 previously found by the author, as well as protocols with bias as low as 1/6 described herein. The family is analyzed by identifying a set of optimal protocols for every number of messages. In the end, tight lower bounds for the bias are obtained which prove that 1/6 is optimal for all protocols within the family.

comments: 10 pages, to be published in Phys. Rev. A
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502069
abstract: A Markovian wave function collapse model is presented where the collapse-inducing operator, constructed from quantum fields, is a manifestly covariant generalization of the mass density operator utilized in the nonrelativistic Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function collapse model. However, the model is not Lorentz invariant because two such operators do not commute at spacelike separation, i.e., the time-ordering operation in one Lorentz frame, the "preferred" frame, is not the time-ordering operation in another frame. However, the characteristic spacelike distance over which the commutator decays is the particle's Compton wavelength so, since the commutator rapidly gets quite small, the model is "almost" relativistic. This "QRCSL" model is completely finite: unlike previous, relativistic, models, it has no (infinite) energy production from the vacuum state. QRCSL calculations are given of the collapse rate for a single free particle in a superposition of spatially separated packets, and of the energy production rate for any number of free particles: these reduce to the CSL rates if the particle's Compton wavelength is small compared to the model's distance parameter. One motivation for QRCSL is the realization that previous relativistic models entail excitation of nuclear states which exceeds that of experiment, whereas QRCSL does not: an example is given involving quadrupole excitation of the $^{74}$Ge nucleus.

comments: 29 pages, arxiv abstract slightly abridged to meet length constraints
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502070
abstract: What is the minimal size quantum circuit required to exactly implement a specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a suitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli geodesics of exponential length.

abstract: We demonstrate the existence of stable non-dispersing two-electron Trojan-like wave packets in the helium atom in combined magnetic and circularly polarized microwave fields. These packets follow circular orbits and we show that they can also exist in quantum dots. Classically the two electrons follow trajectories which resemble orbits discovered by Langmuir and which were used in attempts at a Bohr-like quantization of the helium atom. Eigenvalues of a generalized Hessian matrix are computed to investigate the classical stability of these states. Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the quantum stability of these two-electron wave packets in the helium atom and quantum dot helium with an impurity center.

The section on soap bubbles even includes some "experimental" results. While I do not believe that any of the proposals will let us solve NP-complete problems efficiently, I argue that by studying them, we can learn something not only about computation but also about physics.

abstract: As was shown in quant-ph/0405028, the state of a tunneling particle can be uniquely presented as a coherent superposition of two states to describe alternative sub-processes, transmission and reflection. In this paper, on the basis of the stationary wave functions for these sub-processes, we give new definitions of the dwell times for transmission and reflection. In the case of rectangular potential barriers the dwell times are obtained explicitly. In contrast with the well-known B\"{u}ttiker's dwell-time, our dwell time for transmission increases exponentially, for the under-barrier tunneling, with increasing the barrier's width. By our approach the well-known Hartman effect is rather an artifact resulted from an improper interpretation of the wave-packet tunneling and experimental data, but not a real physical effect accompanying the tunneling phenomenon.

The procedure is applied to the exactly solvable Morse potential introducing in this way the corresponding nonhermitic Morse problem. A possible application is to molecular diffraction in evanescent waves over nanostructured surfaces

The state B is coupled to a set of continuum states C. We investigate the time evolution of A when it decays into C via B, and find that frequent measurements on A leads to both the quantum Zeno effect and the anti-Zeno effects depending on the frequency of measurements. We show that it is the presence of B which allows for the anti-Zeno effect.

For dilute media, it implies the atom-mirror interaction of the Casimir-Polder type at large and of the Coulomb type at small atom-mirror distances of which the sign is insensitive to the polarizability type (electric or magnetic) of the atom.

The same type of experiment, but in different limits, can also provide other non positive-definite versions of the kinetic energy density. A connection with quantum arrival time distributions is discussed.

abstract: The three-wave mixing processes in a second-order nonlinear medium can be used for imaging protocols, in which an object field is injected into the nonlinear medium together with a reference field and an image field is generated. When the reference field is chaotic, the image field is also chaotic and does not carry any information about the object. We show that a clear image of the object be extracted from the chaotic image field by measuring the spatial intensity correlations between this field and one Fourier component of the reference. We experimentally verify this imaging protocol in the case of frequency downconversion.

abstract: We provide an analysis of basic quantum information processing protocols under the effect of intrinsic non-idealities in cluster states. These non-idealities are based on the introduction of randomness in the entangling steps that create the cluster state and are motivated by the unavoidable imperfections faced in creating entanglement using condensed-matter systems. Aided by the use of an alternative and very efficient method to construct cluster state configurations, which relies on the concatenation of fundamental cluster structures, we address quantum state transfer and various fundamental gate simulations through noisy cluster states. We find that a winning strategy to limit the effects of noise, is the management of small clusters processed via just a few measurements. Our study also reinforces recent ideas related to the optical implementation of a one-way quantum computer.

We prove analytically that, for any dimension d>2, every Werner state, separable or nonseparable, belongs to this class.

abstract: We prove that the entangling capacity of a two-qubit unitary operator without local ancillas, both with and without the restriction to initial product states, as quantified by the maximum attainable concurrence, is directly related to the distinguishability of a closely related pair of two-qubit unitary operators. These operators are the original operator transformed into its canonical form and the adjoint of this canonical form. The distinguishability of these operators is quantified by the minimum overlap of the output states over all possible input probe states. The entangling capacity of the original unitary operator is therefore directly related to the degree of non-Hermiticity of its canonical form, as quantified in an operationally satisfactory manner in terms of the extent to which it can be distinguished, by measurement, from its adjoint. Furthermore, the maximum entropy of entanglement, again without local ancillas, that a given two-qubit unitary operator can generate, is found to be closely related to the classical capacities of certain quantum channels.

Finally, we provide two specific examples of quantum LDPC codes of rate 1/2 obtained by our methods, together with a numerical simulation of their performance over the depolarizing channel.

Several decoherence times are estimated: $10^{-13}-$ $10^{-15}s$ for microscopic systems, and $10^{-37}-10^{-39}s$ for macroscopic bodies. For the particular case of a thermal bath, our results agree with those obtained by the einselection (environment-induced decoherence) approach.

We generalize the partial time reversal transformation to a partial scaling transformation and re-examine the problem using a tomographic description of the continuous variable quantum system. The limits of applicability of the entanglement criteria obtained from partial scaling and partial time reversal are explored.

Conventionally, a so-called multi-loop approach is used to remove the dynamical phase accumulated in the operation process for geometric quantum gates. More intriguingly, we here illustrate in detail how to use a special single-loop method to remove the dynamical phase and thus to construct a set of universal quantum gates based on the nonadiabatic geometric phase shift. The present scheme is applicable to NMR systems and may be feasible in other physical systems.

abstract: In the above paper, it is claimed that with a particular use of the Bell inequality a simple single photon experiment could be performed to show the impossibility of any deterministic hidden variable theory in quantum optics. A careful analysis of the concept of probability for hidden variables and a detailed discussion of the hidden variable model of de Broglie-Bohm show that the reasoning and main conclusion of this paper are not correct.

abstract: Other than scattering problems where perturbation theory is applicable, there are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics. Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics, including entanglement and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group which can be represented by the group of two-by-two matrices commonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can play the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. It is therefore possible to relate the current issues of physics to the Lorentz-covariant formulation of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We provide simple examples of closed-form Gaussian wavepacket solutions of the free-particle Schrodinger equation in one dimension which exhibit the most general form of the time-dependent spread in position, namely (Delta x_t)^2 = (Delta x_0)^2 + At + (Delta p_0)^2t^2/m^2, where A = <(xhat - <xhat>_0)(phat - <phat>_0) + (phat - <phat>_0)(xhat - <xhat>_0)>_0 contains information on the position-momentum correlation structure of the initial wave packet. We exhibit straightforward examples corresponding to squeezed states, as well as quasi-classical cases, for which A < 0 so that the position spread can (at least initially) decrease in time because of such correlations. We discuss how the initial correlations in these examples can be dynamically generated (at least conceptually) in various bound state systems. Finally, we focus on providing different ways of visualizing the x-p correlations present in these cases, including the time-dependent distribution of kinetic energy and the use of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution. We discuss similar results, both for the time-dependent Delta x_t and special correlated solutions, for the case of a particle subject to a uniform force.

abstract: We review the higher-order supersymmetric quantum mechanics (H-SUSY QM), which involves differential intertwining operators of order greater than one. The iterations of first-order SUSY transformations are used to derive in a simple way the higher-order case. The second order technique is addressed directly, and through this approach unexpected possibilities for designing spectra are uncovered. The formalism is applied to the harmonic oscillator: the corresponding H-SUSY partner Hamiltonians are ruled by polynomial Heisenberg algebras which allow a straight construction of the coherent states.

abstract: Standard quantum mechanics unquestionably violates the separability principle that classical physics (be it point-like analytic, statistical, or field-theoretic) accustomed us to consider as valid. In this paper, quantum nonseparability is viewed as a consequence of the Hilbert-space quantum mechanical formalism, avoiding thus any direct recourse to the ramifications of Kochen-Specker's argument or Bell's inequality. Depending on the mode of assignment of states to physical systems (unit state vectors versus non-idempotent density operators) we distinguish between strong/relational and weak/deconstructional forms of quantum nonseparability. The origin of the latter is traced down and discussed at length, whereas its relation to the all important concept of potentiality in forming a coherent picture of the puzzling entangled interconnections among spatially separated systems is also considered. Finally, certain philosophical consequences of quantum nonseparability concerning the nature of quantum objects, the question of realism in quantum mechanics, and possible limitations in revealing the actual character of physical reality in its entirety are explored.

abstract: We investigate the large-N behaviour of simple examples of supersymmetric interactions for fermions on a lattice. Witten's supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the BCS model appear just as two different aspects of one and the same model. For the BCS model, supersymmetry is only respected in a coherent superposition of Bogoliubov states. In this coherent superposition mesoscopic observables show better stability properties than in a Bogoliubov state.

abstract: We calculate the error threshold for the linear optics quantum computing proposal by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [Nature 409, pp. 46--52 (2001)] under an error model where photon detectors have efficiency <100% but all other components -- such as single photon sources, beam splitters and phase shifters -- are perfect and introduce no errors. We make use of the fact that the error model induced by the lossy hardware is that of an erasure channel, i.e., the error locations are always known. Using a method based on a Markov chain description of the error correction procedure, our calculations show that, with the 7 qubit CSS quantum code, the gate error threshold for fault tolerant quantum computation is bounded below by a value between 1.78% and 11.5% depending on the construction of the entangling gates.

abstract: We demonstrate the surprising integrability of the classical Hamiltonian associated to a spin 1/2 system under periodic external fields. The one-qubit rotations generated by the dynamical evolution is, on the one hand, close to that of the rotating wave approximation (RWA), on the other hand to two different ``average'' systems, according to whether a certain parameter is small or large. Of particular independent interest is the fact that both the RWA and the averaging theorem are seen to hold well beyond their expected region of validity. Finally we determine conditions for the realization of the quantum NOT operation by means of classical stroboscopic maps.

abstract: We solve the problem of the optimal cloning of pure entangled two-qubit states with a fixed degree of entanglement using local operations and classical communication. We show, that amazingly, classical communication between the parties can improve the fidelity of local cloning if and only if the initial entanglement is higher than a certain critical value. It is completely useless for weakly entangled states. We also show that bound entangled states with positive partial transpose are not useful as a resource to improve the best local cloning fidelity.

abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that optimal control algorithms can be used to speed up the implementation of modules of quantum algorithms or quantum simulations in networks of coupled qubits. The gain is most prominent in realistic cases, where the qubits are not all mutually coupled. Thus the shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls {\em vs} non-local ({\em i.e.} coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown, time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the usual gate complexity. In the limit of fast local controls (as {\em e.g.} in NMR), time-optimised realisations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply controlled {\sc not}-gate ({\sc c$^{n-1}$not}) in various coupling topologies of $n$ qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the quantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard and {\sc swap} gates, while the {\sc c$^{n-1}$not}-gate for completely coupled network of six qubits is nearly seven times faster.

abstract: Exact solution of Dirac equation for a particle whose potential energy and mass are inversely proportional to the distance from the force centre has been found. The bound states exist provided the length scale $a$ which appears in the expression for the mass is smaller than the classical electron radius $e^2/mc^2$. Furthermore, bound states also exist for negative values of $a$ even in the absence of the Coulomb interaction. Quasirelativistic expansion of the energy has been carried out, and a modified expression for the fine structure of energy levels has been obtained. The problem of kinetic energy operator in the Schr\"odinger equation is discussed for the case of position-dependent mass. In particular, we have found that for highly excited states the mutual ordering of the inverse mass and momentum operator in the non-relativistic theory is not important.

abstract: We present a general model for quantum channels with memory, and show that it is sufficiently general to encompass all causal automata: any quantum process in which outputs up to some time t do not depend on inputs at times t' > t can be decomposed into a concatenated memory channel. We then examine and present different physical setups in which channels with memory may be operated for the transfer of (private) classical and quantum information. These include setups in which either the receiver or a malicious third party have control of the initializing memory. We introduce classical and quantum channel capacities for these settings, and give several examples to show that they may or may not coincide. Entropic upper bounds on the various channel capacities are given. For forgetful quantum channels, in which the effect of the initializing memory dies out as time increases, coding theorems are presented to show that these bounds may be saturated. Forgetful quantum channels are shown to be open and dense in the set of quantum memory channels.

In this protocol, a secret message is split among several parties in a way that its reconstruction require the collaboration of the participating parties. In the proposed scheme the parties solve the problem by a sequential communication of a single qubit. Moreover we show that our scheme is equivalent to the use of a multiparty entangled GHZ state but easier to realize and better scalable in practical applications.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics is a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics in which particles describe trajectories guided by the wave function. The dynamics in the vicinity of nodes of the wave function, usually called vortices, is regular if they are at rest. However, vortices generically move during time evolution of the system. We show that this movement is the origin of chaotic behavior of quantum trajectories. As an example, our general result is illustrated numerically in the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

abstract: Both unitary evolution and the effects of dissipation and decoherence for a general three-level system are of widespread interest in quantum optics, molecular physics, and elsewhere. A previous paper presented a technique for solving the time-dependent operator equations involved but under certain restrictive conditions. We now extend our results to a general three-level system with arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonians and Lindblad operators. Analytical handling of the SU(3) algebra of the eight operators involved leaves behind a set of coupled first-order differential equations for classical functions. Solution of this set gives a complete solution of the quantum problem, without having to invoke rotating-wave or other approximations. Numerical illustrations are given.

Restricting randomness in different ways allows us to probe connections between entanglement and randomness. We comment on which properties affect entanglement generation and discuss ways of efficiently producing random states on a quantum computer.

Unlike previous works which formulate a modified Schr\"odinger equation or an explicit modified Hamiltonian, or more complicated mechanisms for reduction and decoherence to introduce transition to classical stochasticity, we propose the novel use of couplings to the environment, and random walks in the product Hilbert space of the combined system, with first passage stopping rules, which seem intuitively simple, as quantum weights and related stochasticity is a commonality that must be preserved under the widest range of applications, independent of the measured quantity and the specific properties of the measuring device.

abstract: We analyze a novel method that uses fixed, minimal physical resources to achieve generation and nested purification of quantum entanglement for quantum communication over arbitrarily long distances, and discuss its implementation using realistic photon emitters and photonic channels. In this method, we use single photon emitters with two internal degrees of freedom formed by an electron spin and a nuclear spin to build intermediate nodes in a quantum channel. State-selective fluorescence is used for probabilistic entanglement generation between electron spins in adjacent nodes. We analyze in detail several approaches which are applicable to realistic, homogeneously broadened single photon emitters. Furthermore, the coupled electron and nuclear spins can be used to efficiently implement entanglement swapping and purification. We show that these techniques can be combined to generate high-fidelity entanglement over arbitrarily long distances. We present a specific protocol that functions in polynomial time and tolerates percent-level errors in entanglement fidelity and local operations. The scheme has the lowest requirements on physical resources of any current scheme for fully fault-tolerant quantum repeaters.

abstract: The interaction of mesoscopic interference devices with nonclassical electromagnetic fields is studied. The external quantum fields induce a phase factor on the electric charges. This phase factor, which is a generalization of the standard Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, is in the case of nonclassical electromagnetic fields a quantum mechanical operator. Its expectation value depends on the density matrix describing the nonclassical photons and determines the interference. Several examples are discussed, which show that the quantum noise of the nonclassical photons destroys slightly the electron interference fringes. An interesting application arises in the context of distant electron interference devices, irradiated with entangled photons. In this case the interfering electrons in the two devices become entangled. The same ideas are applied in the context of SQUID rings irradiated with nonclassical electromagnetic fields. It is shown that the statistics of the Cooper pairs tunneling through the Josephson junction depend on the statistics of the photons.

abstract: The topological phase factor induced on interfering electrons by external quantum electromagnetic fields has been studied. Two and three electron interference experiments inside distant cavities are considered and the influence of correlated photons on the phase factors is investigated. It is shown that the classical or quantum correlations of the irradiating photons are transferred to the topological phases. The effect is quantified in terms of Weyl functions for the density operators of the photons and illustrated with particular examples. The scheme employs the generalized phase factor as a mechanism for information transfer from the photons to the electric charges. In this sense, the scheme may be useful in the context of flying qubits (corresponding to the photons) and stationary qubits (electrons), and the conversion from one type to the other.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502115
abstract: Based on the photon-exciton Hamiltonian a microscopic theory of the Casimir problem for dielectrics is developed. Using well-known many-body techniques we derive a perturbation expansion for the energy which is free from divergences. In the continuum limit we turn off the interaction at a distance smaller than a cut-off distance $a$ to keep the energy finite. We will show that the macroscopic theory of the Casimir effect with hard boundary conditions is not well defined because it ignores the finite distance between the atoms, hence is including infinite self-energy contributions. Nevertheless for disconnected bodies the latter do not contribute to the force between the bodies. The Lorentz-Lorenz relation for the dielectric constant that enters the force is deduced in our microscopic theory without further assumptions. The photon Green's function can be calculated from a Dyson type integral equation. The geometry of the problem only enters in this equation through the region of integration which is equal to the region occupied by the dielectric. The integral equation can be solved exactly for various plain and spherical geometries without using boundary conditions. This clearly shows that the Casimir force for dielectrics is due to the forces between the atoms. Convergence of the perturbation expansion and the metallic limit are discussed. We conclude that for any dielectric function the transverse electric (TE) mode does not contribute to the zero-frequency term of the Casimir force.

abstract: We investigate generalized measurements, based on positive-operator-valued measures, and von Neumann measurements for the unambiguous discrimination of two mixed quantum states that occur with given prior probabilities. In particular, we derive the conditions under which the failure probability of the measurement can reach its absolute lower bound, proportional to the fidelity of the states. The optimum measurement strategy yielding the fidelity bound of the failure probability is explicitly determined for a number of cases. One example involves two density operators of rank d that jointly span a 2d-dimensional Hilbert space and are related in a special way. We also present an application of the results to the problem of unambiguous quantum state comparison, generalizing the optimum strategy for arbitrary prior probabilities of the states.

abstract: Systematic errors in spin rotation operations using simple RF pulses place severe limitations on the usefulness of the pulsed magnetic resonance methods in quantum computing applications. In particular, the fidelity of quantum logic operations performed on electron spin qubits falls well below the threshold for the application of quantum algorithms. Using three independent techniques, we demonstrate the use of composite pulses to improve this fidelity by several orders of magnitude. The observed high-fidelity operations are limited by pulse phase errors, but nevertheless fall within the limits required for the application of quantum error correction.

The required computational overhead scales efficiently both with $1/p$ and $n$, where $n$ is the number of qubits in the computation. This approach provides an efficient way to combat noise in a class of quantum computation implementation schemes, where the dominant noise leads to probabilistic signaled errors with an error probability $1-p$ far beyond any threshold requirement.

The groundstate concurrences between any two sites are obtained analytically and numerically. It shows that the summation of all possible pairwise concurrences is an appropriate candidate to depict the phase transition. We also investigate the role that the momentum takes in the jump of concurrence at the critical points. We find that an abrupt momentum change rusults in the maximal concurrence difference of two degenerate ground states.

abstract: We investigate multipartite entanglement in a non-interacting fermion gas, as a function of fermion separation, starting from the many particle fermion density matrix. We prove that all multiparticle entanglement can be built only out of two-fermion entanglement. Although from the Pauli exclusion principle we would always expect entanglement to decrease with fermion distance, we surprisingly find the opposite effect for certain fermion configurations. The von Neumann entropy is found to be proportional to the volume for a large number of particles even when they are arbitrarily close to each other. We will illustrate our results using different configurations of two, three, and four fermions at zero temperature although all our results can be applied to any temperature and any number of particles.

Our results provide the first direct evidence of the skin-depth effect on the Casimir force between metallic surfaces.

abstract: We derive the probabilities of measurement results from Schroedinger's equation plus a definition of macroscopic as a particular kind of thermodynamic limit. Bohr's insight that a measurement apparatus must be classical in nature and classically describable is made precise in a mathematical sense analogous to the procedures of classical statistical mechanics and the study of Hamiltonian heat baths.

abstract: The ideal anti-Zeno effect means that a perpetual observation leads to an immediate disappearance of the unstable system. We present a straightforward way to derive sufficient conditions under which such a situation occurs expressed in terms of the decaying states and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian. They show, in particular, that the gap between Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is in fact very narrow.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502126
abstract: In this paper we prove that every pure-state $\Psi ^{(N)}$ of N (N$\geqslant 3)$ continuous variables corresponds to a pair of convex rigid covers (CRCs) structures in the continuous-dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt space. Next we strictly define what are the partial separability and ordinary separability, and discuss how to use CRCs to describe various separability. We discuss the problem of the classification of $\Psi ^{(N)}$ and give a kinematical explanation of the local unitary operations acting upon $\Psi ^{(N)}$. Thirdly, we discuss the invariants of classes and give a possible physical explanation.

title: A self-consistent theory of liquid He-4
authors: I. O. Vakarchuk
comments: 28 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502127
abstract: A new method is proposed for the calculation of full density matrix and thermodynamic functions of a many-boson system. Explicit expressions are obtained in the pair correlations approximation for an arbitrary temperature. The theory is self-consistent in the sence that the calculated properties at low temperatures coincide with that of Bogoliubov theory and in the high-temperature limit lead to the results for classical non-ideal gas in the random phase approximation. The phase transition is also revealed as a concequence of Bose-Einstein condensation deformed by interatomic interactions. All the final formulae are written solely via the liquid structure factor taken as a source information instead of the interatomic potential and, therefore, interconnect only observable quantities. This gives also a possibility to study such a strongly non-ideal system as liquid He-4.

abstract: We discuss adiabatic quantum phenomena at a level crossing. Given a path in the parameter space which passes through a degeneracy point, we find a criterion which determines whether the adiabaticity condition can be satisfied. For paths that can be traversed adiabatically we also derive a differential equation which specifies the time dependence of the system parameters, for which transitions between distinct energy levels can be neglected. We also generalize the well-known geometric connections to the case of adiabatic paths containing arbitrarily many level-crossing points and degenerate levels.

abstract: Interactions among qubits are essential for performing two-qubit quantum logic operations. However, nature gives us only nearest neighbor interactions in simple and controllable settings. Here we propose a strategy to induce interactions among two atomic entities that are not necessarily neighbors of each other through their common coupling with a cavity field. This facilitates fast multiqubit quantum logic operations through a set of two-qubit operations. The ideas presented here are applicable to various quantum computing proposals for atom based qubits such as, trapped ions, atoms trapped in optical cavities and optical lattices.

abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a protocol to split a message into several parts so that no subset of parts is sufficient to read the message, but the entire set is. In the scheme, three parties Alice, Bob and Charlie first share a three-photon entangled state, Charlie can then force Alice and Bob to cooperate to be able to establish the secret key with him by performing proper polarization measurements on his photon and announcing which polarization basis he has chosen. In a similar manner, in third-man quantum cryptography (TQC) the third-man, Charlie, can control whether Alice and Bob can communicate in a secure way while he has no access whatsoever on the content of the communication between Alice and Bob. Although QSS and TQC are essential for advanced quantum communication, the low intensity multi-photon entanglement source has made their realization an extreme experimental challenge. Here, exploiting a high intensity four-photon entanglement source we report an experimental realization of QSS and TQC . In the experiment, a key of low quantum bit error rate (QBER) 0.35% is obtained using a simple error reduction scheme.

abstract: Newtonian adiabatics is the consistent truncation of the adiabatic approximation to second order in small velocities. To be complete it must unify two hitherto disjoint intellectual streams in the study of adiabatic motion. The newer stream focuses on Berry's induced vector potential, or geometric magnetism, and Provost and Vallee's induced scalar potential, reflecting geometry in Hilbert space. The older stream focuses on Inglis' induced inertia, influencing the geometry of adiabatic-parameter space. Starting with the Hamiltonian of the newer stream, unification is simple: A naive or primitive inertia, whose inverse appears in two terms of that Hamiltonian, is replaced by the convention-independent sum of primitive and induced inertia tensors.

abstract: We deduce Levinson\'{}s theorem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics in one dimension as a sum rule for the spectral density constructed from asymptotic data. We assume a self-adjoint hamiltonian which guarantees completeness; the potential needs not to be isotropic and a zero-energy resonance is automatically taken into account. Peculiarities of this one-dimension case are explained because of the ``critical'' character of the free case $u(x) = 0$, in the sense that any atractive potential forms at least a bound state. We believe this method is more general and direct than the usual one in which one proves the theorem first for single wave modes and performs analytical continuation.

abstract: Present schemes involving the quantum non-demolition interaction between atomic samples and off-resonant light pulses allow us to store quantum information corresponding to a single harmonic oscillator (mode) in one multiatomic system. We discuss the possibility to involve several coherences of each atom so that the atomic sample can store information contained in several quantum modes. This is achieved by the coupling of different magnetic sublevels of the relevant hyperfine level by additional Raman pulses. This technique allows us to design not only the quantum non-demolition coupling, but also beam splitterlike and two-mode squeezerlike interactions between light and collective atomic spin.

comments: 
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502137
abstract: The goals of this paper are to show the following. First, Grover's algorithm can be viewed as a digital approximation to the analog quantum algorithm proposed in "An Analog Analogue of a Digital Quantum Computation", by E. Farhi and S. Gutmann, Phys.Rev. A 57, 2403 - 2406 (1998), quant-ph/9612026. We will call the above analog algorithm the Grover-Farhi-Gutmann or GFG algorithm. Second, the propagator of the GFG algorithm can be written as a sum-over-paths formula and given a sum-over-path interpretation, i.e., a Feynman path sum/integral. We will use nonstandard analysis to do this. Third, in the semi-classical limit $\hbar\to 0$, both the Grover and the GFG algorithms (viewed in the setting of the approximation in this paper) must run instantaneously. Finally, we will end the paper with an open question. In "Semiclassical Shor's Algorithm", by P. Giorda, et al, Phys. Rev.A 70, 032303 (2004), quant-ph/0303037, the authors proposed building semi-classical quantum computers to run Shor's algorithm because the success probability of Shor's algorithm does not change much in the semi-classical limit. We ask the open questions: In the semi-classical limit, does Shor's algorithm have to run instantaneously?

abstract: The Mean King's problem asks to determine the outcome of a measurement that is randomly selected from a set of complementary observables. We review this problem and offer a combinatorial solution. More generally, we show that whenever an affine resolvable design exists, then a state reconstruction problem similar to the Mean King's problem can be defined and solved. As an application of this general framework we consider a problem involving three qubits in which the outcome of nine different measurements can be determined without using ancillary qubits. The solution is based on a measurement derived from Hadamard designs.

The mapping of the real two-dimensional vector phasor to the complex plane permits this to satisfy the standard time-dependent Schroedinger equation. This model is extended to provide an intuitive physical picture of electron spin. Implications of this model are discussed.

We give sufficient conditions for a considerable improvement of the key generation rates and the security thresholds of well-known QKD protocols such as Bennett-Brassard 1984, Phoenix-Barnett-Chefles 2000, and the six-state protocol. This analysis is applicable to other QKD protocols like Bennett 1992. We examine two scenarios: a sender using a perfect single-photon source and a sender using a Poissonian source.

abstract: The connection between many-body theory (MBPT)--in perturbative and non-perturbative form--and quantum-electrodynamics (QED) is reviewed for systems of two fermions in an external field. The treatment is mainly based upon the recently developed covariant-evolution-operator method for QED calculations [Lindgren et al. Phys. Rep. 389, 161 (2004)], which has a structure quite akin to that of many-body perturbation theory. At the same time this procedure is closely connected to the S-matrix and the Green's-function formalisms and can therefore serve as a bridge between various approaches. It is demonstrated that the MBPT-QED scheme, when carried to all orders, leads to a Schroedinger-like equation, equivalent to the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. A Bloch equation in commutator form that can be used for an "extended" or quasi-degenerate model space is derived. It has the same relation to the BS equation as has the standard Bloch equation to the ordinary Schroedinger equation and can be used to generate a perturbation expansion compatible with the BS equation also for a quasi-degenerate model space.

journal: Fizika A 14, 29 (2005)

abstract: We discuss some implications of a very recently obtained result for the force on a slab in a planar cavity based on the calculation of the vacuum Lorentz force [C. Raabe and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 71, 013814 (2005)]. We demonstrate that, according to this formula, the total force on the slab consists of a medium-screened Casimir force and, in addition to it, a medium-assisted force. The sign of of the medium-assisted force is determined solely by the properties of the cavity mirrors. In the Lifshitz configuration, this force is proportional to 1/d at small distances and is very small compared with the corresponding van der Waals force. At large distances, however, it is proportional to 1/d^4 and is comparable with the Casimir force, especially for denser media. The exponents in these power laws decrease by 1 in the case of a thin slab. The formula for the medium-assisted force also describes the force on a layer of the cavity medium, which has similar properties. For dilute media, it implies an atom-mirror interaction of the Coulomb type at small and of the Casimir-Polder type at large atom-mirror distances. For a perfectly reflecting mirror, the latter force is effectively only three-times smaller than the Casimir-Polder force.

Here, we report the experimental realization of synchronized generation of independent entangled photon pairs. The quality of synchronization is confirmed by observing a violation of Bell's inequality with 3.2 standard deviations in an entanglement swapping experiment. The techniques developed in our experiment will be of great importance for future linear optical realization of quantum repeaters and quantum computation.

abstract: Perfect state transfer is possible in modulated spin chains, imperfections however are likely to corrupt the state transfer. We study the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder both in the exchange couplings between the spins and in the local magnetic field. The degradation of the fidelity can be suitably expressed, as a function of the level of imperfection and the length of the chain, in a scaling form. In addition the time signal of fidelity becomes fractal. We further characterize the state transfer by analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian of the spin chain.

abstract: On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the revolutionary contributions to physics by Einstein, I am happy to respond to a problem posed by him in 1905. He said: In this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically-visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope, on account of the molecular motions of heat....that is, Brownian molecular motion. In this article I provide incontrovertible evidence against molecular-kinetic conception of heat, and a regularization of the Brownian movement that differs from all the statistical procedures and/or analyses that exist in the archival literature to date. The regularization is based on either of two distinct but intimately interrelated revolutionary conceptions of thermodynamics, one is purely thermodynamic and the other is quantum mechanical.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502151
abstract: On a two-level quantum system driven by an external field, we consider the population transfer problem from the first to the second level, minimizing the time of transfer, with bounded field amplitude. On the Bloch sphere (i.e. after a suitable Hopf projection), this problem can be attacked with techniques of optimal syntheses on 2-D manifolds. Let $(-E,E)$ be the two energy levels, and $|\Omega(t)|\leq M$ the bound on the field amplitude. For each values of $E$ and $M$, we provide the explicit expression of the time optimal trajectory steering the state one to the state two in terms of a parameter that should be computed numerically. For $M<<E$, every time optimal trajectory is periodic (and in particular bang-bang) with frequency of the order of the resonance frequency $\omega_R=2E$. On the other side, for $M>E$ the time optimal trajectory steering the state one to the state two is bang-bang with exactly one switching. Fixed $E$ we also prove that for $M\to\infty$ the time needed to reach the state two tends to zero. Finally we compare these results with some known results of Khaneja, Brockett and Glaser and with those obtained in the Rotating Wave Approximation.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The Heisenberg evolution of a given unitary operator corresponds classically to a fixed canonical transformation that is viewed through a moving coordinate system. The operators that form the bases of the Weyl representation and its Fourier transform, the chord representation, are, respectively, unitary reflection and translation operators. Thus, the general semiclassical study of unitary operators allows us to propagate arbitrary operators, including density operators, i.e. the Wigner function. The various propagation kernels are different representations of the superoperators which act on the space of operators of a closed quantum system. We here present the mixed semiclassical propagator, that takes translation chords to reflection centres, or vice versa. In contrast to the centre-centre propagator that directly evolves Wigner functions, it is guaranteed to be caustic free, having a simple WKB-like universal form for a finite time, whatever the number of degrees of freedom. Special attention is given to the near-classical region of small chords, since this dominates the averages of observables evaluated through the Wigner function.

abstract: In the study of d-dimensional quantum channels $(d \geq 2)$, an assumption which is not very restrictive, and which has a natural physical interpretation, is that the corresponding Kraus operators form a representation of a Lie algebra. Physically, this is a symmetry algebra for the interaction Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all $n$, but for most other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also derive numerical estimates on the size of a generalized ``Bloch sphere'' for certain channels. There remain many open questions which are indicated at various points through the paper.

The realization of a universal set of quantum logic gates, which is composed of single-bit operations and a two-bit controlled-NOT gate, is presented. The readout method is also discussed.

abstract: We exploit the separation of the filtering and control aspects of quantum feedback control to consider the optimal control as a classical stochastic problem on the space of quantum states. We derive the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations using the elementary arguments of classical control theory and show that this is equivalent, in the Stratonovich calculus, to a stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin setup. We show that, for cost functionals that are linear in the state, the theory yields the traditional Bellman equations treated so far in quantum feedback.

abstract: Recent experiments have shown that fullerene and fluorofullerene molecules can produce interference patterns. These molecules have both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. This leads one to ask whether these internal motions can play a role in degrading the interference pattern. We study this by means of a simple model. Our molecule consists of two masses a fixed distance apart. It scatters from a potential with two or several peaks, thereby mimicking two or several slit interference. We find that in some parameter regimes the entanglement between the internal states and the translational degrees of freedom produced by the potential can decrease the visibility of the interference pattern. In particular, different internal states correspond to different outgoing wave vectors, so that if several internal states are excited, the total interference pattern will be the sum of a number of patterns, each with a different periodicity. The overall pattern is consequently smeared out. In the case of two different peaks, the scattering from the different peaks will excite different internal states so that the path the molecule takes become entangled with its internal state. This will also lead to degradation of the interference pattern. How these mechanisms might lead to the emergence of classical behavior is discussed.

By its explicit calculations for three-qubit pure states, we show that the partial tangle is closely related to the faithfulness of a teleportation scheme over a three-qubit pure state.

abstract: We propose a scheme for subwavelength localization of an atom conditioned upon the absorption of a weak probe field at a particular frequency. Manipulating atom-field interaction on a certain transition by applying drive fields on nearby coupled transitions leads to interesting effects in the absorption spectrum of the weak probe field. We exploit this fact and employ a four-level system with three driving fields and a weak probe field, where one of the drive fields is a standing-wave field of a cavity. We show that the position of an atom along this standing wave is determined when probe field absorption is measured. We find that absorption of the weak probe field at a certain frequency leads to subwavelength localization of the atom in either of the two half-wavelength regions of the cavity field by appropriate choice of the system parameters. We term this result as sub-half-wavelength localization to contrast it with the usual atom localization result of four peaks spread over one wavelength of the standing wave. We observe two localization peaks in either of the two half-wavelength regions along the cavity axis.

abstract: We show that, by simple modifications of the usual three-level $\Lambda$-type scheme used for obtaining electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), phase dependence in the response of the atomic medium to a weak probe field can be introduced. This gives rise to phase dependent susceptibility. By properly controlling phase and amplitudes of the drive fields we obtain variety of interesting effects. On one hand we obtain phase control of the group velocity of a probe field passing through medium to the extent that continuous tuning of the group velocity from subluminal to superluminal and back is possible. While on the other hand, by choosing one of the drive fields to be a standing wave field inside a cavity, we obtain sub-wavelength localization of moving atoms passing through the cavity field.

abstract: We present a continuous time quantum search algorithm analogous to Grover's. In particular, the optimal search time for this algorithm is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the database size. This search algorithm can be implemented using any Hamiltonian with a discrete energy spectrum through excitation of resonances between an initial and the searched state. This algorithm is robust and, as in the case of Grover's, it allows for an error $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in the determination of the searched state. A discrete time version of this continuous time search algorithm is built, and the connection between the search algorithms with discrete and continuous times is established.

It is argued that the experiment is intimately connected to a double-slit interference experiment where, the which-path information exists. The reason for not observing first order interference behind the double-slit, is clarified.It is shown that the underlying mechanism for the appearance of ghost interference is, the more familiar, quantum erasure.

abstract: A non-perturbative quantization of a paraxial electromagnetic field is achieved via a generalized dispersion relation imposed on the longitudinal and the transverse components of the photon wave vector. The theoretical formalism yields a seamless transition between the paraxial- and the Maxwell-equation solutions. This obviates the need to introduce either "ad hoc" or perturbatively-defined field operators. In the limit of narrow beam-like fields, the theory is in agreement with approximated quantization schemes provided by other authors.

abstract: Recently the problem of Unambiguous State Discrimination (USD) of mixed quantum states has attracted much attention. So far, bounds on the optimum success probability have been derived [1]. For two mixed states they are given in terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds. Moreover we construct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies. With this result, we provide analytical solutions for unambiguous discrimination of a class of generic mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to some pure state case. Additionally, we show that examples exist where the bounds cannot be reached.

abstract: By the early eighties, Fredkin, Feynman, Minsky and others were exploring the notion that the laws of physics could be simulated with computers. Feynman's particular contribution was to bring quantum mechanics into the discussion and his ideas played a key role in the development of quantum computation. It was shown in 1995 by Barenco et al that all quantum computation processes could be written in terms of local operations and CNOT gates. We show how one of the most important of all physical systems, the quantized bosonic oscillator, can be rewritten in precisely those terms and therefore described as a quantum computational process, exactly in line with Feynman's ideas. We discuss single particle excitations and coherent states.

abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), which are such that the inner product between two vectors in different orthogonal bases is constant equal to the inverse $1/\sqrt{d}$, with $d$ the dimension of the finite Hilbert space, are becoming more and more studied for applications such as quantum tomography and cryptography, and in relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil group of quantum optics. Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality $d+1$ have been derived for prime power dimensions $d=p^m$ using the tools of abstract algebra (Wootters in 1989, Klappenecker in 2003). Presumably, for non prime dimensions the cardinality is much less. The bases can be reinterpreted as quantum phase states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those introduced by Pegg & Barnett in 1989. The MUB states are related to additive characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and of Galois rings (in characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in vectors of the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative characters and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary properties of the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We also study the phase probability distribution and variance for physical states and find them related to the Gauss sums, which are sums over all elements of the field (or of the ring) of the product of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally we relate the concepts of mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This allows to use well studied algebraic concepts as efficient tools in our quest of minimal uncertainty in quantum information primitives.

abstract: The theory of geometric phase is generalized to a cyclic evolution of the eigenspace of an invariant operator with $N$-fold degeneracy. The corresponding geometric phase is interpreted as a holonomy inherited from the universal connection of a Stiefel U(N)-bundle over a Grassmann manifold. Most significantly, for an arbitrary initial state, this geometric phase captures the inherent geometric feature of the state evolution. Moreover, the geometric phase in the evolution of the eigenspace of an adiabatic action operator is also addressed, which is elaborated by a pullback U(N)-bundle. Several intriguing physical examples are illustrated.

Under which conditions on the spectrum has A a positive partial transpose (is PPT) with respect to any partition H_n \otimes H_m of the space H_{nm} as a tensor product of an n-dimensional and an m-dimensional Hilbert space? We show that the necessary and sufficient conditions can be expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities on the eigenvalues of A.

abstract: We propose a fault tolerant loading scheme to produce an array of fermions in an optical lattice of the high fidelity required for applications in quantum information processing and the modelling of strongly correlated systems. A cold reservoir of Fermions plays a dual role as a source of atoms to be loaded into the lattice via a Raman process and as a heat bath for sympathetic cooling of lattice atoms. Atoms are initially transferred into an excited motional state in each lattice site, and then decay to the motional ground state, creating particle-hole pairs in the reservoir. Atoms transferred into the ground motional level are no longer coupled back to the reservoir, and doubly occupied sites in the motional ground state are prevented by Pauli blocking. This scheme has strong conceptual connections with optical pumping, and can be extended to load high-fidelity patterns of atoms.

These results are of fundamental interest in geometric control theory and have applications to control of coupled spins in solid state NMR spectroscopy.

abstract: In this paper we construct a non-commutative version of the Hopf bundle by making use of Jaynes-Commings model and so-called Quantum Diagonalization Method. The bundle has a kind of Dirac strings. However, they appear in only states containing the ground one (${\cal F}\times \{\ket{0}\} \cup \{\ket{0}\}\times {\cal F} \subset {\cal F}\times {\cal F}$) and don't appear in remaining excited states. This means that classical singularities are not universal in the process of non-commutativization. Based on this construction we moreover give a non-commutative version of both the Veronese mapping which is the mapping from $\fukuso P^{1}$ to $\fukuso P^{n}$ with mapping degree $n$ and the spin representation of the group SU(2). We also present some challenging problems concerning how classical (beautiful) properties can be extended to the non-commutative case.

Our precision measurement and state reconstruction system has the capability to distinguish over 3 million states, all of which can be reproducibly generated using our state creation apparatus. In order to complete the triumvirate of single qubit control, there must be a way to not only manipulate single qubits after creation and before measurement, but a way to characterize the manipulations \emph{themselves}. We present a general representation of arbitrary processes, and experimental techniques for generating a variety of single qubit manipulations, including unitary, decohering, and (partially) polarizing operations.

abstract: The problem of dipole-dipole decoherence of nuclear spins is considered for strongly entangled spin cluster. Our results show that its dynamics can be described as the decoherence due to interaction with a composite bath consisting of fully correlated and uncorrelated parts. The correlated term causes the slower decay of coherence at larger times. The decoherence rate scales up as a square root of the number of spins giving the linear scaling of the resulting error. Our theory is consistent with recent experiment reported in decoherence of correlated spin clusters.

In particular, lowering the central well provides a peak arbitrarily close to zero velocity having a minimum but finite width. The low-energy atomic scattering off this laser device is parameterized and approximate formulae are found to describe and explain its behaviour.

abstract: We investigate the decoherence of a spin 1/2 subsystem weakly coupled to an environment of many spins 1/2 with and without mutual coupling. The total system is closed, its state is pure and evolves under Schroedinger dynamics. Nevertheless, the considered spin typically reaches a quasi-stationary equilibrium state. Here we show that this state depends strongly on the coupling to the environment on the one hand and on the coupling within the environmental spins on the other. In particular we focus on spin star and spin ring-star geometries to investigate the effect of intra-environmental coupling on the central spin. By changing the spectrum of the environment its effect as a bath on the central spin is changed also and may even be adjustable to some degree. We find that the relaxation behavior is related to the distribution of the energy eigenstates of the total system. For each of these relaxation modes there is a dual mode for which the resulting subsystem approaches an inverted state occupation probability (negative temperature).

abstract: We suggest a scheme that allows arbitrarily perfect state transfer even in the presence of random fluctuations in the couplings of a quantum chain. The scheme performs well for both spatially correlated and uncorrelated fluctuations if they are relatively weak (say 5%). Furthermore, we show that given a quite arbitrary pair of quantum chains, one can check whether it is capable of perfect transfer by only local operations at the ends of the chains, and the system in the middle being a "black box". We argue that unless some specific symmetries are present in the system, it will be capable of perfect transfer when used with dual-rail encoding. Therefore our scheme puts minimal demand not only on the control of the chains when using them, but also on the design when building them.

abstract: We have analyzed the interaction of a dissipative two level quantum system with high and low frequency excitation. The system is continuously and simultaneously irradiated by these two waves. If the frequency of the first signal is close to the level separation and the second one is tuned to the Rabi frequency, it is shown that the response of the system exhibits an undamped low frequency oscillation. The method can be useful for low frequency Rabi spectroscopy in various physical systems which are described by a two level Hamiltonian, such as nuclei spins in NMR, double well quantum dots, superconducting flux and charge qubits, etc. As an example, the application of the method to the readout of a flux qubit is considered.

abstract: We present measurements of the second-order coherence function on emission from single GaN quantum dots. In some cases a large degree of photon antibunching is observed, demonstrating isolation of a single quantum system. For a selected quantum dot, we study the dependence of photon antibunching on excitation power and temperature. Using pulsed excitation, we demonstrate an ultraviolet triggered single-photon source operating at a wavelength of 358 nm.

abstract: We consider a regular chain of elementary quantum systems with nearest neighbor interactions and assume that the total system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyze under what condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices with respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the same temperature $T$. While in classical mechanics the validity of this procedure only depends on the size of the groups $n$, in quantum mechanics the minimum group size $n_{\text{min}}$ also depends on the temperature $T $! As examples, we apply our analysis to different types of Heisenberg spin chains.

abstract: A nonperturbative theory is presented for the creation by an oscillating potential of spin-entangled electron-hole pairs in the Fermi sea. In the weak potential limit, considered earlier by Samuelsson and Buttiker, the entanglement production is much less than one bit per cycle. We demonstrate that a strong potential oscillation can produce an average of one Bell pair per two cycles, making it an efficient source of entangled flying qubits.

abstract: We propose a scheme based on using the singlet ground state of an electron spin pair in a double quantum dot nanostructure as a suitable set-up for detecting entanglement between electron spins via the measurement of an optimal entanglement witness. Using time-dependent gate voltages and magnetic fields the entangled spins are separated and coherently rotated in the quantum dots and subsequently detected at spin-polarized quantum point contacts. We analyze the coherent time evolution of the entangled pair and show that by counting coincidences in the four exits an entanglement test can be done. This set-up is close to present-day experimental possibilities and can be used to produce pairs of entangled electrons ``on demand''.

abstract: We construct a series of 2+1-dimensional models whose quasiparticles obey non-Abelian statistics. The adiabatic transport of quasiparticles is described by using a correspondence between the braid matrix of the particles and the scattering matrix of 1+1-dimensional field theories. We discuss in depth lattice and continuum models whose braiding is that of SO(3) Chern-Simons gauge theory, including the simplest type of non-Abelian statistics, involving just one type of quasiparticle. The ground-state wave function of an SO(3) model is related to a loop description of the classical two-dimensional Potts model. We discuss the transition from a topological phase to a conventionally-ordered phase, showing in some cases there is a quantum critical point.

abstract: This paper investigates the basic behavior and performance of simulated quantum annealing (QA) in comparison with classical annealing (CA). Three simple one dimensional case study systems are considered, namely a parabolic well, a double well, and a curved washboard. The time dependent Schr\"odinger evolution in either real or imaginary time describing QA is contrasted with the Fokker Planck evolution of CA. The asymptotic decrease of excess energy with annealing time is studied in each case, and the reasons for differences are examined and discussed. The Huse-Fisher classical power law of double well CA is replaced with a different power law in QA. The multi-well washboard problem studied in CA by Shinomoto and Kabashima and leading classically to a logarithmic annealing even in the absence of disorder, turns to a power law behavior when annealed with QA. The crucial role of disorder and localization is briefly discussed.

abstract: Classical and quantum annealing is discussed for a kinetically constrained chain of $N$ non-interacting asymmetric double wells, represented by Ising spins in a longitudinal field $h$. It is shown that in certain cases, where the kinetic constraints may arise from infinitely high but vanishingly narrow barriers appearing in the relaxation path of the system, quantum annealing exploiting the quantum-mechanical penetration of sufficiently narrow barriers may be far more efficient than its thermal counterpart. We have used a semiclassical picture of scattering dynamics to do our simulation for the quantum system.

We analytically evaluate the geometric phase that correspond to the ground and excited states of the anisotropic XY model in the presence of a transverse magnetic field when the direction of the anisotropy is adiabatically rotated. Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices are presented as a possible physical realization.

abstract: We study a model of frustration of decoherence in an open quantum system. Contrary to other dissipative ohmic impurity models, such as the Kondo model or the dissipative two-level system, the impurity model discussed here never presents overdamped dynamics even for strong coupling to the environment. We show that this unusual effect has its origins in the quantum mechanical nature of the coupling between the quantum impurity and the environment. We study the problem using analytic and numerical renormalization group methods and obtain expressions for the frequency and temperature dependence of the impurity susceptibility in different regimes.

abstract: We analyze correlations between subsystems for an extended Hubbard model exactly solvable in one dimension, which exhibits a rich structure of quantum phase transitions (QPTs). The T=0 phase diagram is exactly reproduced by studying singularities of single-site entanglement. It is shown how comparison of the latter quantity and quantum mutual information allows one to recognize whether two-point or shared quantum correlations are responsible for each of the occurring QPTs. The method works in principle for any number D of degrees of freedom per site. As a by-product, we are providing a benchmark for direct measures of bipartite entanglement; in particular, here we discuss the role of negativity at the transition.

abstract: We describe the gas of ultracold fermionic atoms by a functional integral for atom and molecule fields. The crossover from Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) to BCS-type superfluidity shows universal features in terms of a concentration parameter for the ratio between scattering length and average interatomic distance. We discuss the relevance of the Yukawa coupling between atoms and molecules, establish an exact narrow resonance limit and show that renormalized quantities are independent of the Yukawa coupling for the broad resonance, BCS and BEC limits. Within our functional integral formalism we compute the atom scattering in vacuum and the molecular binding energy. This connects the universal concentration parameter to the magnetic field of a given experiment. Beyond mean field theory we include the fluctuations of the molecule field and the renormalization effects for the atom-molecule coupling. We find excellent agreement with the observed fraction of bare molecules in fermionic lithium and qualitative agreement with the condensate fraction in fermionic lithium and potassium. In addition to the phase diagram and condensate fraction we compute the correlation length for molecules, the in-medium scattering length for molecules and atoms and the sound velocity.

This proposal relies neither on spin-orbit coupling nor on control over electron-electron interactions. The quantum correlation of microwave polarisations is obtained from orbital degrees of freedom in an external magnetic field. We calculate the concurrence of emitted microwave photon pairs, and show that a maximally entangled Bell pair is obtained in the limit of weak inter-dot coupling.

abstract: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are nano-to-micrometer scale mechanical resonators coupled to electronic devices of similar dimensions. NEMS show promise for fast, ultrasensitive force microscopy and for deepening our understanding of how classical dynamics arises by approximation to quantum dynamics. This article begins with a survey of NEMS and then describes certain aspects of their classical dynamics. In particular, we show that for weak coupling the action of the electronic device on the mechanical resonator can be effectively that of a thermal bath, this despite the device being a driven, far-from-equilibrium system.

abstract: A pure spin current injector is proposed based on adiabatic pumping and crossed normal/Andreev reflection. The device consists of a three-terminal ferromagnet-superconductor-semiconductor system in which the injection of a pure spin current is into the semiconductor which is coupled to the superconductor within a coherence length away from the ferromagnet enabling the phenomena of crossed normal /Andreev reflection to operate. Quantum pumping is induced by adiabatically modulating two independent parameters of the ferromagnetic lead, namely the magnetization strength and the strength of coupling between the ferromagnet and the superconductor. The competition between the normal/Andreev reflection and the crossed normal/Andreev reflection, both induced by pumping, leads to non-local injection of a pure spin current into the semiconductor. The experimental realization of the proposed device is also discussed.

The measurement process is well characterized and quantitatively understood. The qubit coherence time is determined to be larger than 500 ns in a measurement of Ramsey fringes.

abstract: This paper discusses the use of computer-aided verification as a practical means for analysing quantum information systems; specifically, the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution is examined using this method. This protocol has been shown to be unconditionally secure against all attacks in an information-theoretic setting, but the relevant security proof requires a thorough understanding of the formalism of quantum mechanics and is not easily adaptable to practical scenarios. Our approach is based on probabilistic model-checking; we have used the PRISM model-checker to show that, as the number of qubits transmitted in BB84 is increased, the equivocation of the eavesdropper with respect to the channel decreases exponentially. We have also shown that the probability of detecting the presence of an eavesdropper increases exponentially with the number of qubits. The results presented here are a testament to the effectiveness of the model-checking approach for systems where analytical solutions may not be possible or plausible.

abstract: The first-order, infinite-component field equations we proposed before for non-relativistic anyons (identified with particles in the plane with noncommuting coordinates) are generalized to accommodate arbitrary background electromagnetic fields. Consistent coupling of the underlying classical system to arbitrary fields is introduced; at a critical value of the magnetic field, the particle follows a Hall-like law of motion. The corresponding quantized system reveals a hidden nonlocality if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous. In the quantum Landau problem spectral as well as state structure (finite vs. infinite) asymmetry is found. The bound and scattering states, separated by the critical magnetic field phase, behave as further, distinct phases.

The first one concerns the proof that the cocycle condition uniquely defines the Schwarzian derivative. This is equivalent to show that the infinitesimal variation of the stress tensor "exponentiates" to the Schwarzian derivative. The cocycle condition naturally defines the higher dimensional version of the Schwarzian derivative suggesting a role in the transformation properties of the stress tensor in higher dimensional CFT. The other theorem shows that energy quantization is a direct consequence of the existence of the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation under duality transformations as implied by the EP.

abstract: The Dirac equation for an electron in the central Coulomb field of a point-like nucleus with the charge greater than 137 is considered. This singular problem, to which the fall-down onto the centre is inherent, is addressed using a new approach, based on a black-hole concept of the singular centre and capable of producing cut-off-free results. To this end the Dirac equation is presented as a generalized eigenvalue boundary problem of a self-adjoint operator. The eigenfunctions make complete sets, orthogonal with a singular measure, and describe particles, asymptotically free and delta-function-normalizable both at infinity and near the singular centre $r=0$. The barrier transmission coefficient for these particles responsible for the effects of electron absorption and spontaneous electron-positron pair production is found analytically as a function of electron energy and charge of the nucleus. The singular threshold behaviour of the corresponding amplitudes substitutes for the resonance behaviour, typical of the conventional theory, which appeals to a finite-size nucleus.

abstract: Neutrices are additive groups of negligible functions that do not contain any constants except 0. Their calculus was developed by van der Corput and Hadamard in connection with asymptotic series and divergent integrals. We apply neutrix calculus to quantum field theory, obtaining finite renormalizations in the loop calculations. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we recover all the usual physically observable results. One possible advantage of the neutrix framework is that effective field theories can be accommodated. Quantum gravity theories appear to be more manageable.

abstract: The structure of the spin interaction operator (SI) (the interaction that remains after space variables are integrated out) in the first order S-matrix element of the elastic scattering of a Dirac particle in a general helicity-conserving vector potential is investigated.It is shown that the conservation of helicity dictates a specific form of the SI regardless of the explicit form of the vector potential. This SI closes the SU(2) algebra with other two operators in the spin space of the particle. The directions of the momentum transfer vector and the vector bisecting the scattering angle seem to define some sort of "intrinsic" axes at this order that act as some symmetry axes for the whole spin dynamics . The conservation of helicity at this order can be formulated as the invariance of the component of the helicity of the particle along the bisector of the scattering angle in the transition.

Exact bounded solutions are found in closed form by imposing boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions which ensure that the effective Hamiltonian is Hermitian for all the points of the space. The nonrelativistic limit of our results adds a new support to the conclusion that even-parity solutions to the nonrelativistic one-dimensional hydrogen atom do not exist.

The self-consistency of the operator algebra is proved for the product of three operators. Some properties of the non-associative quantum mechanics are considered. It is proposed that some generalization of the non-associative algebra of quantum operators can be helpful for understanding of the algebra of field operators with a strong interaction.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a model of a quantum space-time in which the global symmetries of space-time are unified in a coherent manner with the internal symmetries associated with the state space of quantum-mechanics. If we take into account the fact that these distinct families of symmetries should in some sense merge and become essentially indistinguishable in the unified regime, our framework may provide an approximate description of or elementary model for the structure of the universe at early times.

abstract: For integers $m\geq 3$, we study the non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problems $-u^{\prime\prime}(x)+(x^m+P(x))u(x)=E u(x)$, $0\leq x<+\infty$, with the boundary conditions $u(+\infty)=0$ and $\alpha u(0)+\beta u^{\prime}(0)=0$ for some $\alpha, \beta\in\C$ with $|\alpha|+|\beta|\not=0$, where $P(x)=a_1 x^{m-1}+a_2 x^{m-2}+...+a_{m-1} x$ is a polynomial. We provide asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalue counting function and the eigenvalues $E_{n}$. Then we apply these to the inverse spectral problem, reconstructing some coefficients of polynomial potentials from asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues.

abstract: This paper is a sequel to math.AG/0411110. Let P denote the projective space of degree d forms in n+1 variables. Let e denote an integer < d/2, and consider the subvariety X of forms which factor as L^{d-e} M^e for some linear forms L,M. In the language of our earlier paper, this is the Brill-Gordan locus associated to the partition (d-e,e). In this paper we calculate the Castelnuovo regularity of X precisely, and moreover show that X is r-normal for r at least 3. In the case of binary forms, we give a classical invariant-theoretic description of the defining equations of this locus in terms of covariants of d-ics. Modulo standard cohomological arguments, the proof crucially relies upon showing that certain 3j-symbols from the quantum theory of angular momentum are nonzero.

abstract: Level fluctuations in quantum system have been used to characterize quantum chaos using random matrix models. Recently time series methods were used to relate level fluctuations to the classical dynamics in the regular and chaotic limit. In this we show that the spectrum of the system undergoing order to chaos transition displays a characteristic $f^{-\gamma}$ noise and $\gamma$ is correlated with the classical chaos in the system. We demonstrate this using a smooth potential and a time-dependent system modeled by Gaussian and circular ensembles respectively of random matrix theory. We show the effect of short periodic orbits on these fluctuation measures.

abstract: We investigate dynamical properties of chaotic trajectories in mushroom billiards. These billiards present a well-defined simple border between a single regular region and a single chaotic component. We find that the stickiness of chaotic trajectories near the border of the regular region occurs through an infinite number of marginally unstable periodic orbits. These orbits have zero measure, thus not affecting the ergodicity of the chaotic region. Notwithstanding, they govern the main dynamical properties of the system. In particular, we show that the marginally unstable periodic orbits explain the periodicity and the power-law behavior with exponent $\gamma=2$ observed in the distribution of recurrence times.

abstract: The information entropies in coordinate and momentum spaces and their sum ($S_r$, $S_k$, $S$) are evaluated for many nuclei using "experimental" densities or/and momentum distributions. The results are compared with the harmonic oscillator model and with the short-range correlated distributions. It is found that $S_r$ depends strongly on $\ln A$ and does not depend very much on the model. The behaviour of $S_k$ is opposite. The various cases we consider can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we use or by the values of $S$, i.e., the increase of the quality of the density and of the momentum distributions leads to an increase of the values of $S$. In all cases, apart from the linear relation $S=a+b\ln A$, the linear relation $S=a_V+b_V \ln V$ also holds. V is the mean volume of the nucleus. If $S$ is considered as an ensemble entropy, a relation between $A$ or $V$ and the ensemble volume can be found. Finally, comparing different electron scattering experiments for the same nucleus, it is found that the larger the momentum transfer ranges, the larger the information entropy is. It is concluded that $S$ could be used to compare different experiments for the same nucleus and to choose the most reliable one.

abstract: The connection between the time-dependent physical spectrum of light and the phase space overlap of Wigner functions is investigated for optical pulses. Time and frequency properties of optical pulses with chirp are analyzed using the phase space Wigner and Ambiguity distribution functions. It is shown that optical pulses can exhibit interesting phenomena, very much reminiscent of quantum mechanical interference, quantum entanglement of wave packets, and quantum sub-Planck structures of the time and frequency phase space.
