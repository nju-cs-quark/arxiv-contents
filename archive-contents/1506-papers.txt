title: Thermoelectric generators as self-oscillating heat engines

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.00094
abstract: In the previous paper of Alicki et.al. a model of a solar cell has been proposed in which the non-periodic source of energy - photon flux - drives the collective periodic motion of electrons in a form of plasma oscillations. Subsequently, plasma oscillations are rectified by the p-n junction diode into the direct current (work). This approach makes a solar cell similar to standard macroscopic heat motors or turbines which always contain two heat baths, the working medium and the periodically moving piston or rotor. Here, a very similar model is proposed in order to describe the operation principles of thermoelectric generators based either on bimetallic or semiconductor p-n junctions. Again plasma oscillation corresponds to a piston and sunlight is replaced by a hot bath. The mathematical formalism is based on the Markovian master equations which can be derived in a rigorous way from the underlying Hamiltonian models and are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.

abstract: In absence of currents and charges the quantized electromagnetic field can be described by wave functions which for each individual wave vector are normalized to one. The resulting formalism involves reducible representations of the Canonical Commutation Relations. The corresponding paradigm is a space-time filled with two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators. Mathematically, this is equivalent with two additional dimensions penetrated by the electromagnetic waves.

abstract: In the present paper we give a physical motivation for Born--Jordan quantization for arbitrary observables; it corrects previous unsuccessful attempts involving path integral arguments, and justifies earlier work by Garrod and Kerner and Sutcliffe, which was rebuked by Cohen. For this purpose we use correct short-time approximations to the solutions of Schr\"odinger's equation, extending previous constructions of Makri and Miller, and the present author. Our constructions make clear that the formula proposed (but not justified) by Kerner and Sutcliffe coincides with the modern pseudo-differential form of Born and Jordan operators, as used in quantum mechanics and time-frequency analysis.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.00117
abstract: For gravitational-wave interferometric detectors, there is a tradeoff between the detector bandwidth and peak sensitivity when focusing on the shot noise level. This has to do with the frequency-dependent propagation phase lag (positive dispersion) of the signal. We consider embedding an active unstable filter---a cavity-assisted optomechanical device operating in the instability regime---inside the interferometer to compensate the phase, and using feedback control to stabilize the entire system. We show that this scheme in principle can enhance the bandwidth without sacrificing the peak sensitivity. However, there is one practical difficulty for implementing it due to the thermal fluctuation of the mechanical oscillator in the optomechanical filter, which puts a very stringent requirement on the environmental temperature and the mechanical quality factor.

abstract: We theoretically and numerically study the quantum dynamics of two degenerate optical parametric oscillators with mutual injections. The cavity mode in the optical coupling path between the two oscillator facets is explicitly considered. Stochastic equations for the oscillators and mutual injection path based on the positive $P$ representation are derived. The system of two gradually pumped oscillators with out-of-phase mutual injections is simulated, and its quantum states is investigated. When the incoherent loss of the oscillators other than the mutual injections is small, the squeezed quadratic amplitudes $\hat{p}$ in the oscillators are positively correlated near the oscillation threshold. It indicates finite quantum correlation, estimated via Gaussian quantum discord, and the entanglement between the intracavity subharmonic fields. When with a small loss of the injection path, each oscillator around the phase transition point forms macroscopic superposition even under a small pump noise. It suggests that the squeezed field stored in the low-loss injection path weakens the decoherence in the oscillators.

abstract: Polymer Quantization (PQ) is a background independent quantization scheme that is deployed in Loop Quantum Gravity. This framework leads to a new short-distance (discretized) structure characterized by a fundamental length. In this paper we use PQ to analyze the problem of a particle bouncing on a perfectly reflecting surface under the influence of Earth's gravitational field, what we have called "\textit{The Polymer Bouncer}". In this scenario, deviations from the usual quantum effects are induced by the spatial discreteness, but not by a new short-range gravitational interaction. We solve the polymer Schr\"odinger equation in an analytical fashion, and we evaluate numerically the corresponding energy levels. We find that the polymer energy spectrum exhibits a negative shift compared to the obtained for the quantum bouncer. The comparison of our results with those obtained in the GRANIT experiment leads to an upper bound for the fundamental length scale, namely $\lambda \ll 0.6 \buildrel _{\circ} \over {\mathrm{A}}$. We find polymer corrections to the probability of transitions between levels, induced by small vibrations, together with the probability of spontaneous emission in the quadrupole approximation.

abstract: Geurdes (2014, Results in Physics) outlines a probabilistic construction of a counterexample to Bell's theorem. He gives a procedure to repeatedly sample from a specially constructed "pool" of local hidden variable models (depending on a table of numerically calculated parameters) and select from the results one LHV model, determining a random value S of the usual CHSH combination of four (theoretical) correlation values. He claims Prob(|S| > 2) > 0. We expose a fatal flaw in the analysis: the procedure generates a non-local hidden variable model. To disprove this claim, Geurdes should program his procedure and generate random LHV's till he finds one violating the CHSH inequality.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.00267
abstract: Dispersion of matter waves, such as electrons, is commonly described by the Gaussian wave packet solution to the Schroedinger equation. However quantum trajectories for a free Gaussian wave packet, given by x(t)=u(0)t+x(0)[1+(ht/4{pi}m{sigma(0)}^2)^2]^(1/2), indicate that the components of the wave packet starting off at different initial positions and initial speeds can intersect after a short time. This reflects a shock-like behavior associated with the dispersion of Gaussian wave packets. Here we explore this effect using an exact shock wave analysis of the basic equations of quantum dynamics. Calculations for the Riemann invariants of the system are performed, and the precise timing and the position for the formation of quantum shocks in an atomic system modeled by Gaussian wave packets are derived. The relation of this effect to some recent experiments on atomic and electron matter waves is indicated. It is also indicated that in the free particle case only localized quantum density waves [B. M. Mirza, Mod. Phys. Lett. B 28 (32) (2014) 1450253] do not form such quantum shock discontinuities.

abstract: We analyze the tunneling time problem via the presence time formalism. With this method we reproduce previous results for very long wavepackets and we are able to calculate the tunneling time for general wavepackets of arbitrary shape and length. The tunneling time for a general wavepacket is equal to the average over the energy components of the standard phase time. With this approach we can also calculate the time uncertainty. We have checked that the results obtained with this approach agree extremely well with numerical simulations of the wavepacket evolution.

abstract: In quantum physics, measurement error and disturbance were first naively thought to be simply constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Later, more rigorous analysis showed that the error and disturbance satisfy more subtle inequalities. Several versions of universally valid error-disturbance relations (EDR) have already been obtained and experimentally verified in the regimes where naive applications of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation failed. However, these EDRs were formulated for discrete measurements. In this paper, we consider continuous measurement processes and obtain new EDR inequalities in the Fourier space: in terms of the power spectra of the system and probe variables. By applying our EDRs to a linear optomechanical system, we confirm that a tradeoff relation between error and disturbance leads to the existence of an optimal strength of the disturbance in a joint measurement. Interestingly, even with this optimal case, the inequality of the new EDR is not saturated because of doublely existing standard quantum limits in the inequality.

abstract: In quantum theory every state can be diagonalized, i.e. decomposed as a convex combination of perfectly distinguishable pure states. This elementary structure plays an ubiquitous role in quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and quantum statistical mechanics, where it provides the foundation for the notions of majorization and entropy. A natural question then arises: can we reconstruct these notions from purely operational axioms? We address this question in the framework of general probabilistic theories, presenting a set of axioms that guarantee that every state can be diagonalized. The first axiom is Causality, which ensures that the marginal of a bipartite state is well defined. Then, Purity Preservation states that the set of pure transformations is closed under composition. The third axiom is Purification, which allows to assign a pure state to the composition of a system with its environment. Finally, we introduce the axiom of Pure Sharpness, stating that for every system there exists at least one pure effect occurring with unit probability on some state. For theories satisfying our four axioms, we show a constructive algorithm for diagonalizing every given state. The diagonalization result allows us to formulate a majorization criterion that captures the convertibility of states in the operational resource theory of purity, where random reversible transformations are regarded as free operations.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ with attachment of one-length path periodically. This small modification to $\mathbb{Z}$ provides localization of the quantum walk. The eigenspace causing this localization is generated by finite length round trip paths. We find that the localization is due to the eigenvalues of an underlying random walk. Moreover we find that the transience of the underlying random walk provides a slow down of the pseudo velocity of the induced quantum walk and a different limit distribution from the Konno distribution.

abstract: Quantum theory was discovered in an adventurous way, under the urge to solve puzzles-like the spectrum of the blackbody radiation-that haunted the physics community at the beginning of the 20th century. It soon became clear, though, that quantum theory was not just a theory of specific physical systems, but rather a new language of universal applicability. Can this language be reconstructed from first principles? Can we arrive at it from logical reasoning, instead of ad hoc guesswork? A positive answer was provided in Refs. [1, 2], where we put forward six principles that identify quantum theory uniquely in a broad class of theories. We first defined a class of "theories of information", constructed as extensions of probability theory in which events can be connected into networks. In this framework, we formulated the six principles as rules governing the control and the accessibility of information. Directly from these rules, we reconstructed a number of quantum information features, and eventually, the whole Hilbert space framework. In short, our principles characterize quantum theory as the theory of information that allows for maximal control of randomness.

abstract: Discord and entanglement characterize two kinds of quantum correlations, and discord captures more correlation than entanglement in the sense that even separable states may have nonzero discord. In this paper, we propose a new kind of quantum correlation we call it oblique discord. A zero-discord state corresponds to an orthonormal basis, while a zero-oblique-discord state corresponds to a basis which is not necessarily orthogonal. Under this definition, the set of zero-discord states is properly contained inside the set of zero-oblique-discord states, and the set of zero-oblique-discord states is properly contained inside the set of separable states. We give a characterization of zero-oblique-discord states via quantum operation, provide a geometric measure for oblique discord, and raise a conjecture with it holds we can define an information-theoretic measure for oblique discord. Also, we point out that, the definition of oblique discord can be properly extended to some different versions just as the case of quantum discord.

abstract: If quantum mechanics were to be applicable to macroscopic objects, classical mechanics would have to be a limiting case of quantum mechanics. Then the category Set that packages classical mechanics has to be in some sense a 'limiting case' of the category Hilb packaging quantum mechanics. Following from this assumption, quantum-classical correspondence can be considered as a mapping of the category Hilb to the category Set, i.e., a functor from Hilb to Set, taking place in the macroscopic limit. As a procedure, which takes us from an object of the category Hilb (i.e., a Hilbert space) in the macroscopic limit to an object of the category Set (i.e., a set of values that describe the configuration of a system), this functor must take a finite number of steps in order to make the equivalence of Hilb and Set verifiable. However, as it is shown in the present paper, such a constructivist requirement cannot be met in at least one case of an Ising model of a spin glass. This could mean that it is impossible to demonstrate the emergence of classicality totally from the formalism of standard quantum mechanics.

abstract: A qualitative but formalized representation of microstates is first established quite independently of the quantum mechanical mathematical formalism, exclusively under epistemological-operational-methodological constraints. Then, using this representation as a reference-and-imbedding-structure, the foundations of an intelligible reconstruction of the Hilbert-Dirac formulation of Quantum Mechanics is developed. Inside this reconstruction the measurement problem as well as the other major problems raised by the quantum mechanical formalism, dissolve. This is a concise and improved English version of the French text appearing in arXiv:1310:1728v3

abstract: Quantum simulation represents an efficient solution to a certain classically intractable problem in various research area including quantum chemistry. The central problem of quantum chemistry is to determine the electronic structure and the ground-state energy of atoms and molecules. The exact classical calculation of the problem is demanding even for molecules with moderate size due to the "exponential catastrophe." To deal with such quantum chemistry problem, the coupled-cluster methods have been successfully developed, which are considered to be the current "gold standard" in classical computational chemistry. However, the coupled-cluster ansatz is built with non-unitary operation, which leads to drawbacks such as lacking variational bound of ground-state energy. The unitary version of the coupled-cluster methods would perfectly address the problem, whereas it is classically inefficient without proper truncation of the infinite series expansion. It has been a long-standing challenge to build an efficient computational scheme for the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz. Here we report an experimental realization of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz based on quantum simulation. The experiments are performed in a scalable platform containing a trapped multi-level \Yb ion for simulating the electronic structure of a molecular ion (HeH$^+$); we experimentally compute ground-state the energy curve and simulate chemical-bond softening non-perturbatively, which clearly shows the quantum implementation of the unitary coupled-cluster method yields better ground-states energies than classical implementations with truncations. Furthermore, the energy measurements, one most time consuming part in the experiments, can be parallelized. Our experimental results provide a new and solid evidence of how quantum simulation can advance the field of quantum chemistry.

abstract: Coherence can be induced or stimulated in parametric down-conversion using two or three crystals when, for example, the idler modes of the crystals are aligned. Previous experiments with induced coherence [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 053601 (2015)] focused on which-path information and the role of vacuum fields in realizing complementarity via reduced visibility in single-photon interference. Here we describe experiments comparing induced and stimulated coherence. Different single-photon interference experiments were performed by blocking one of the pump beams in a three-crystal setup. Each counted photon is emitted from one of two crystals and which-way information may or not be available, depending on the setup. Distinctly different results are obtained in the induced and stimulated cases, especially when a variable transmission filter is inserted between the crystals. A simplified theoretical model accounts for all the experimental results and is also used to address the question of whether the phases of the signal and idler fields in parametric down-conversion are correlated.

abstract: Two-photon processes have so far been considered only as resulting from frequency-matched second-order expansions of light-matter interaction, with consequently small coupling strengths. However, a variety of novel physical phenomena arises when such coupling values become comparable with the system characteristic frequencies. Here, we propose a realistic implementation of two-photon quantum Rabi and Dicke models in trapped-ion technologies. In this case, effective two-phonon processes can be explored in all relevant parameter regimes. In particular, we show that an ion chain under bichromatic laser drivings exhibits a rich dynamics and highly counterintuitive spectral features, such as interaction-induced spectral collapse.

abstract: We present a unified axiomatic approach to contextuality and non-locality based on the fact that both are resource theories. In those theories the main objects are consistent boxes, which can be transformed by certain operations to achieve certain tasks. The amount of resource is quantified by appropriate measures of the resource. Following recent paper [J.I. de Vicente, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 47}, 424017 (2014)], and recent development of abstract approach to resource theories, such as entanglement theory, we propose axioms and welcome properties for operations and measures of resources. As one of the axioms of the measure we propose the asymptotic continuity: the measure should not differ on boxes that are close to each other by more than the distance with a factor depending logarithmically on the dimension of the boxes. We prove that relative entropy of contextuality is asymptotically continuous. Considering another concept from entanglement theory---the convex roof of a measure---we prove that for some non-local and contextual polytopes, the relative entropy of a resource is upper bounded up to a constant factor by the cost of the resource. Finally, we prove that providing a measure $X$ of resource does not increase under allowed class of operations, such as e.g. wirings, the maximal distillable resource which can be obtained by these operations is bounded from above by the value of $X$ up to a constant factor. We show explicitly which axioms are used in the proofs of presented results, so that analogous results may remain true in other resource theories with analogous axioms. We also make use of the known distillation protocol of bipartite nonlocality to show how contextual resources can be distilled.

A second control qubit may be employed to trigger the magnetic field rotation, thus allowing several implementation choices for a controlled NOT gate for x-ray photons.

abstract: Quantum cryptography allows confidential information to be communicated between two parties, with secrecy guaranteed by the laws of nature alone. However, upholding guaranteed secrecy over quantum communication networks poses a further challenge, as classical receive-and-resend routing nodes can only be used conditional of trust by the communicating parties. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a quantum relay over 1 km of optical fiber, which teleports a sequence of photonic quantum bits to a receiver by utilizing entangled photons emitted by a semiconductor LED. The average relay fidelity of the link is 0.90+/-0.03, exceeding the classical bound of 0.75 for the set of states used, and sufficiently high to allow error correction. The fundamentally low multi-photon emission statistics and the integration potential of the source present an appealing platform for future quantum networks.

abstract: We consider temporal correlations of particles with arbitrary spin. We show that the Leggett-Garg inequality can be maximally violated irrespective of the value of spin, thus improving upon an earlier result by Kofler and Brukner [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{99}, 180403 (2007)]. Our proof is accomplished through a suitable adoption of a measurement scheme which has previously been employed for studying the spatial correlation in a system with arbitrary spin. We next consider generalized or unsharp measurements as a method for coarse graining in a quantitative manner, and show that classicality emerges below a precise value of the sharpness parameter. Satisfaction of the Leggett-Garg inequality is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for macroscopic realism.

abstract: Broadband single photons are usually considered not to couple efficiently to atomic gases because of the large mismatch in bandwidth. Contrary to this intuitive picture, here we demonstrate that the interaction of ultrashort single photons with a dense resonant atomic sample deeply modifies the temporal shape of their wavepacket mode without degrading their non-classical character, and effectively generates zero-area single-photon pulses. This is a clear signature of strong transient coupling between single broadband (THz-level) light quanta and atoms, with intriguing fundamental implications and possible new applications to the storage of quantum information.

abstract: We consider a class of decoding algorithms that are applicable to error correction for both Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. This class includes multiple algorithms that have recently attracted attention, including the Bravyi-Haah RG decoder. They are applied to both the problem of single shot error correction (with perfect syndrome measurements) and that of active error correction (with noisy syndrome measurements). For Abelian models we provide a threshold proof in both cases, showing that there is a finite noise threshold under which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed when any decoder in this class is used. For non-Abelian models such a proof is found for the single shot case. The means by which decoding may be performed for active error correction of non-Abelian anyons is studied in detail. Differences with the Abelian case are discussed.

abstract: The concept of entanglement was originally introduced to explain correlations existing between two spatially separated systems, that cannot be described using classical ideas. Interestingly, in recent years, it has been shown that similar correlations can be observed when considering different degrees of freedom of a single system, even a classical one. Surprisingly, it has also been suggested that entanglement might be playing a relevant role in certain biological processes, such as the functioning of pigment-proteins that constitute light-harvesting complexes of photosynthetic bacteria. The aim of this work is to show that the presence of entanglement in all of these different scenarios should not be unexpected, once it is realized that the very same mathematical structure can describe all of them. We show this by considering three different, realistic cases in which the only condition for entanglement to exist is that a single excitation is coherently delocalized between the different subsystems that compose the system of interest.

abstract: We study optimal and nearly-optimal quantum strategies for non-local XOR games. First, we prove the following general result: for every non-local XOR game, there exists a set of relations with the properties: (1) a quantum strategy is optimal for the game if and only if it satisfies the relations, and (2) a quantum strategy is nearly optimal for the game if and only if it approximately satisfies the relations. Next, we focus attention on a specific infinite family of XOR games: the CHSH(n) games. This family generalizes the well-known CHSH game. We describe the general form of CHSH(n) optimal strategies. Then, we adapt the concept of intertwining operator from representation theory and use that to characterize nearly-optimal CHSH(n) strategies.

abstract: We discuss basic expressions and interrelations between various physical quantities describing the fluctuation-electromagnetic interaction of a small polarizable particle during relativistic motion relative to the blackbody radiation, namely tangential radiation force, rate of heating, intensity of thermal radiation/absorption, the change of the rest mass of a particle, and acceleration. We obtain an explicit formula for the frictional force acting on the particle in its rest frame and discuss its connection with the particle acceleration and the tangential force given in the reference frame of background radiation. The criticism of our previous results in recent paper by A. I. Volokitin (Phys. Rev. A81, 2015, 032505) is refuted.

abstract: Auxiliary matrix exponential method is used to derive simple and numerically efficient general expressions for the following, historically rather cumbersome and hard to compute, theoretical methods: (1) average Hamiltonian theory following interaction representation transformations; (2) Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness theory of nuclear and electron relaxation; (3) gradient ascent pulse engineering version of quantum optimal control theory. In the context of spin dynamics, the auxiliary matrix exponential method is more efficient than methods based on matrix factorizations and also exhibits more favourable complexity scaling with the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix.

We show that the index of cyclicy of a generator of evolution, which receives much attention in the stroboscopic tomography, can be defined and computed by referring to the Jordan decomposition of a square matrix. The result presented in this work shows a relation between terminology from quantum tomography and linear algebra.

abstract: In 1924 David Hilbert conceived a paradoxical tale involving a hotel with an infinite number of rooms to illustrate some aspects of the mathematical notion of "infinity". In continuous-variable quantum mechanics we routinely make use of infinite state spaces: here we show that such a theoretical apparatus can accommodate an analog of Hilbert's hotel paradox. We devise a protocol that, mimicking what happens to the guests of the hotel, maps the amplitudes of an infinite eigenbasis to twice their original quantum number in a coherent and deterministic manner, producing infinitely many unoccupied levels in the process. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by experimentally realising it on the orbital angular momentum of a paraxial field. This new non-Gaussian operation may be exploited for example for enhancing the sensitivity of N00N states, for increasing the capacity of a channel or for multiplexing multiple channels into a single one.

abstract: We investigate potential schemes to reinvigorate coherences between excited states in a $V$ level system under various excitation conditions. Coherent pulsed, cw and noisy pulsed excitation are considered and the existence of a trap state is shown to allow for the resurgence of excited state coherence in the two pulsed scenarios. With a short trap time (strong decoherence), it is possible to restart excited state coherence in the pulsed scenarios. In the case of cw excitation with relaxation back to the ground state, the coherences between the excited states do not vanish in the long time limit but instead approach a non-zero value.

abstract: The speed of a quantum random number generator is essential for practical applications, such as high-speed quantum key distribution systems. Here, we push the speed of a quantum random number generator to 68 Gbps by operating a laser around its threshold level. To achieve the rate, not only high-speed photodetector and high sampling rate are needed, but also a very stable interferometer is required. A practical interferometer with active feedback instead of common temperature control is developed to meet requirement of stability. Phase fluctuations of the laser are measured by the interferometer with a photodetector, and then digitalized to raw random numbers with a rate of 80 Gbps. The min-entropy of the raw data is evaluated by modeling the system and is used to quantify the quantum randomness of the raw data. The bias of the raw data caused by other signals, such as classical and detection noises, can be removed by Toeplitz-matrix hashing randomness extraction. The final random numbers can pass through the standard randomness tests. Our demonstration shows that high-speed quantum random number generators are ready for practical usage.

abstract: Conserved quantities are crucial in quantum physics. Here we discuss a general scenario of Hamiltonians. All the Hamiltonians within this scenario share a common conserved quantity form. For unitary parametrization processes, the characteristic operator of this scenario is analytically provided, as well as the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI). As the application of this scenario, we focus on two classes of Hamiltonians: su(2) category and canonical category. Several specific physical systems in these two categories are discussed in detail. Besides, we also calculate an alternative form of QFI in this scenario.

abstract: This paper presents a simple model that mimics quantum mechanics (QM) results in terms of probability fields of free particles subject to self-interference, without using Schroedinger equation or complex wavefunctions. Unlike the standard QM picture, the proposed model only uses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic operations. In particular, it assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of an euclidean lattice. The proposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks. Transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation, or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk. Non-relativistic QM predictions, particularly selfinterference, are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly-prepared ensembles of particles. Extension to interacting particles is discussed but not detailed in this paper.

abstract: In this article we propose a metric on the space of quantum channels which can be efficiently computed using semi-definite programming and show how this metric determines the prefect discrimination between quantum channels and the ultimate precision limit for quantum parameter estimation. This metric thus provides a unified framework for these two related, but so far largely separated fields. New insights can then be gained for studies in both fields, which we demonstrate with two examples: first we derive a lower bound on the minimum number of uses needed for perfect discrimination between two quantum channels, which, we show, is closely related to the Heisenberg limit in quantum parameter estimation; second we show that sequential strategy has advantage over parallel strategy in quantum parameter estimation by providing an example inspired by studies in quantum channel discrimination.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, predictions are made by way of calculating expectation values of observables, which take the form of Hermitian operators. It is far less common to exploit non-Hermitian operators to perform measurements. Here, we show that the expectation values of a particular set of non-Hermitian matrices, which we call column operators, directly yield the complex coefficients of a quantum state vector. We provide a definition of the state vector in terms of measurable quantities by decomposing the column operators into observables. The technique we propose renders very-large-scale quantum states significantly more accessible in the laboratory, as we demonstrate by experimentally characterising a 100 000-dimensional entangled state. This represents an improvement of two orders of magnitude with respect to previous characterisations of discrete entangled states. Furthermore, we show that we can reliably extract the most significant contribution to a quantum state, even in the presence of substantial noise. We anticipate that our method will prove to be a useful asset in the quest for understanding and manipulating large-scale quantum systems.

abstract: The eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator are complex and provide not only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. They show non-analytical variations at singular (exceptional) points (EPs). The eigenfunctions are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. They may be mixed due to their coupling to the common environment. The so-called phase rigidity of the wavefunctions is a quantitative measure for the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality. It is reduced at and near to an EP. The lifetimes of two eigenstates of a realistic quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an EP. When the point of maximum width bifurcation is parametrically approached (by keeping fixed the coupling strength between system and environment), the phase rigidity suddenly increases up to its maximum value, meaning that the eigenfunctions become almost orthogonal at this point. This unexpected result is very robust as shown by numerical results for different classes of systems. When two states are neighboring in energy or lifetime, they cause an irreversible stabilization of the system by creating local structures that can be described well by a Hermitian Hamilton operator. In these structures, the relation between time and energy involved in the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian operator, is hidden. This result agrees fully with our experience obtained in quantum mechanical studies during very many years. Interesting non-trivial features of open quantum systems appear only in the parameter range in which a clustering of EPs causes a dynamical phase transition. An example is the relation between reduced phase rigidity and enhanced transmission through a quantum dot.

abstract: In this paper, we obtain the analytical solutions of two kinds of transcendental equations with numerous applications in college physics by means of Lagrange inversion theorem, and rewrite them in the form of ratio of rational polynomials by second order Pad\'e approximant afterwards from a practical and instructional perspective. Our method is illustrated in a pedagogical manner for the purpose that students at the undergraduate level will be beneficial. The approximate formulas introduced in the paper can be applied to abundant examples in physics textbooks, such as Fraunhofer single slit diffraction, Wien's displacement law and Schr\"odinger equation with single or double $\delta$ potential. These formulas, consequently, can reach considerable accuracies according to the numerical results, therefore they promise to act as valuable ingredients in the standard teaching curriculum.

abstract: The glass phase and its quantum analog are prominent challenges of current non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. As a model system to study the transition from classical to quantum glassy dynamics, we propose a setup of laser driven three-level atoms trapped in an optical lattice. Tuning the strength of the laser driving to the intermediate level allows one to study the transition from a classical Kinetically Constrained Model to the coherent regime. For strong driving, Rydberg excitations evolve analogously to defects in the One-Spin Facilitated Model, a minimal model known to exhibit glassy dynamics. In our setup, the constraints result from the interplay between Rydberg interactions and the laser detuning from the Rydberg state. The emerging heterogeneous relaxation timescales are tuneable over several orders of magnitudes. In the opposite limit of weak driving of the intermediate level, we find an effective cluster model which describes the dynamics in a reduced subspace of the allowed number and positions of Rydberg excitations. This subspace is uniquely determined by the initial state and is characterized by a fixed number of clusters of Rydberg excitations. In addition, we investigate the influence of random fields on the classical relaxation. We find that the glassy dynamics can relax faster in the presence of weak random fields.

abstract: This paper introduces "swiveled R\'enyi entropies" as an alternative to the R\'enyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Physical Review A 91, 022333 (2015)]. What distinguishes the swiveled R\'enyi entropies from the prior proposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an optimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases (swivels). A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled R\'enyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the R\'enyi family of entropies. The swiveled R\'enyi entropies are however generally discontinuous at $\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in the limit as $\alpha \rightarrow 1$, instead bounding them from above and below. Particular variants reduce to known R\'enyi entropies, such as the R\'enyi relative entropy or the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered R\'enyi conditional mutual informations and ordered R\'enyi generalizations of a relative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a consequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled R\'enyi entropies. Due to the lack of convergence at $\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the swiveled R\'enyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so that the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.

abstract: We review and discuss the potential of using measurement-based elements in quantum communication schemes, where certain tasks are realized with the help of entangled resource states that are processed by measurements. We consider long-range quantum communication based on the transmission of encoded quantum states, where encoding, decoding and syndrome read-out are implemented using small-scale resource states. We also discuss entanglement-based schemes and consider measurement-based quantum repeaters. An important element in these schemes is entanglement purification, which can also be implemented in a measurement-based way. We analyze the influence of noise and imperfections in these schemes, and show that measurement-based implementation allows for very large error thresholds of the order of 10\% noise per qubit and more. We show how to obtain optimal resource states for different tasks, and discuss first experimental realizations of measurement-based quantum error correction using trapped ions and photons.

abstract: We introduce novel algorithms for the quantum simulation of molecular systems which are asymptotically more efficient than those based on the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. We present the first application of a recently developed technique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution using a truncated Taylor series to obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision, an exponential improvement over all prior methods. The two algorithms developed in this work rely on a second quantized encoding of the wavefunction in which the state of an $N$ spin-orbital system is encoded in ${\cal O}(N)$ qubits. Our first algorithm requires at most $\widetilde{\cal O}(N^8 t)$ gates. Our second algorithm involves on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals, in a way that is exponentially more precise than classical sampling methods, by using the truncated Taylor series simulation technique. Our second algorithm has the lowest gate count of any approach to second quantized quantum chemistry simulation in the literature, scaling as $\widetilde{\cal O}(N^{5} t)$. The approaches presented here are readily applicable to a wide class of fermionic models, many of which are defined by simplified versions of the chemistry Hamiltonian.

abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for the simulation of molecular systems that is asymptotically more efficient than all previous algorithms in the literature in terms of the main problem parameters. As in the first paper of this series (arXiv:1506.01020), we employ a recently developed technique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution using a truncated Taylor series to obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision. The algorithm of this paper involves simulation under an oracle for the sparse, first quantized representation of the Hamiltonian known as the configuration interaction (CI) matrix. We construct and query the CI matrix oracle to allow for on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals in a way that is exponentially more efficient than classical numerical methods. Whereas second quantized representations of the wavefunction require $\widetilde{\cal O}(N)$ qubits, where $N$ is the number of single-particle spin-orbitals, the CI matrix representation requires $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$ qubits where $\eta \ll N$ is the number of electrons in the molecule of interest. We show that the gate count of our algorithm scales at most as $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta^2 N^3 t)$.

abstract: The entangled behavior for different dimensional systems driven by classical external random field are investigated. The amount of the survival entanglement between the components of each system is quantified. There are different behaviors of entanglement are come into view, as decay, sudden death, sudden birth and long-lived of entanglement. The maximum entangled states which can be generated from any of theses suggested systems are much fragile than the partially entangled ones. The larger dimensional systems are more robust than the smaller dimensional systems, where the entanglement decay smoothly, gradually and may vanishes for a very short time. For the class of $2\times 3$ dimensional system, the one parameter family is more robust then the two parameters family class. Although the entanglement between systems of $ 2 \times 3$ dimensional is very sensitive to the classical external random field, one can generate long-lived entanglement.

abstract: For more than twenty years, the spatial entanglement of photon pairs have been used to uncover interesting aspects of quantum physics. A key advantage of spatial variables of single photons relates to the intrinsic high dimensionality of its state space, which allows for the investigation of multi-dimensional entanglement and the efficient encoding and processing of quantum information. As a drawback, the characterization of the spatial correlations over a wide range of spatial modes can be costly, implying a large number of measurements. Here we develop and experimentally test novel entanglement criteria based on a periodic discretization of the spatial variables. This discretization allows for the definition of $d$-outcome measurements of arbitrary dimensionality that we experimentally implement using a finite set of $d$ periodic spatial masks as mode analysers. Our entanglement criteria are computable from $2d^2$ joint projective measurements, required to characterize the correlation of the photons over the spatial masks positioned in the image plane and the far-field of the two photon source. Spatial entanglement can then be identified with as few as $8$ different measurements. We study the spatial correlations and entanglement detection as a function of the dimensionality $d$ and periodicity of the spatial masks, the latter working as a free parameter that can be used to independently tune the measured correlations and optimize the entanglement detection. Our results are useful for characterizing spatial entanglement, and have applications in quantum cryptography and imaging.

abstract: Quantum theory is known to be nonlocal in the sense that separated parties can perform measurements on a shared quantum state to obtain correlated probability distributions which cannot be achieved if the parties share only classical randomness. Here we find that the set of distributions compatible with sharing quantum states subject to some sufficiently restricted dimension is neither convex nor a superset of the classical distributions. We examine the relationship between quantum distributions associated with a dimensional constraint and classical distributions associated with limited shared randomness. We prove that quantum correlations are convex for certain finite dimension in certain Bell scenarios and that they sometimes offer a dimensional advantage in realizing local distributions. We also consider if there exist Bell scenarios where the set of quantum correlations is never convex with finite dimensionality.

abstract: An accurate non-gradient-expansion based correction to Thomas--Fermi is developed using solvable model. The used model is a system of $N$ non-interacting electrons moving independently in the Coulomb field of the nuclear charge. The presented correction is applicable for atoms and should be extendable beyond that. The method exploits the fact that the difference between the Thomas--Fermi approximation and the non-interacting kinetic energy is comparable to the difference between the same values inside the proposed solvable model. The numerical experiments show that by adding this correction factor, the precision of Thomas--Fermi approximation is enhanced by an order of magnitude.

abstract: Adiabatic methods are potentially important for quantum information protocols because of their robustness against many sources of technical and fundamental noise. They are particularly useful for quantum transport, and in some cases elementary quantum gates. Here we explore the extension of a particular protocol, dark state adiabatic passage, where a spin state is transported across a branched network of initialised spins, comprising one `input' spin, and multiple leaf spins. We find that maximal entanglement is generated in systems of spin-half particles, or where the system is limited to one excitation.

abstract: Systems with purely off-diagonal disorder have peculiar features such as the localization-delocalization transition and long-range correlations in their wavefunctions. To motivate possible experimental studies of the physics of off-diagonal disorder, we study in detail disordered discrete-time quantum walk in a finite chain, where the diagonal disorder can be set to zero by construction. Starting from a transfer matrix approach, we show, both theoretically and computationally, that the dynamics of the quantum walk with disorder manifests all the main features of off-diagonal disorder. We also propose how to prepare a remarkable delocalized zero-mode from a localized and easy-to-prepare initial state using an adiabatic protocol that increases the disorder strength slowly. Numerical experiments are also performed with encouraging results.

abstract: Based on a microscopic approach, we propose a Lagrangian for the combined system of a rotating dielectric nanoparticle above a plane surface in the presence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. In the framework of canonical quantization, the electromagnetic vacuum field is quantized in the presence of dielectric fields describing the nanoparticle and a semi-infinite dielectric with planar interface. The radiative heat power absorbed by the rotating nanoparticle is obtained and the result is in agreement with previous results when the the rotational frequency of the nanoparticle is zero or much smaller than the relaxation frequency of the dielectrics. The well known near field effect is reexamined and discussed in terms of the rotational frequency. The radiative heat power absorbed by the nanoparticle for well-known peak frequencies, is plotted in terms of the rotational frequency showing an interesting effect resembling a phase transition around a critical frequency, determined by the relaxation frequency of the dielectrics.

The idea is to replace the classical irreversible attractor dynamics driven by an Ising model with pattern-dependent weights by the reversible rotation of an input quantum state onto an output quantum state consisting of a linear superposition with probability amplitudes peaked on the stored pattern closest to the input in Hamming distance, resulting in a high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to the input. The unitary operator implementing this transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit elementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum Ising model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions, exactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use of postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the famed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they permit to completely {\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}. The number of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature, the accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious temperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the complexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of patterns polynomial in the number of qubits. These models solve thus the capacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing a {\it polynomial improvement} in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic nature of information retrieval.

abstract: We propose a scheme of investigating topological photonics in superconducting quantum circuits. There are two major ingredients. The first is the synthesization of an artificial gauge field on a circuit quantum electrodynamics lattice through the developed dynamic modulation approach. The flexibility of such parametric method leads to the effective \textit{in situ} tunable magnetic field for photons on a square lattice. The second, which is the main new ingredient of this paper, considers the detection of the topological phases of the photons. Our idea employs the exotic properties of the edge state modes which result in novel steady states of the lattice under the driving-dissipation competition. Through the pumping and the photon-number measurements of merely few sites, not only the spatial and the spectral characters, but also the momentums and even the integer topological quantum numbers of the edge states can be directly probed, which reveal unambiguously the topological nature of the photons on the proposed lattice. The physical implementation of our scheme is discussed in detail, where our results pinpoint the feasibility based on current level of experimental technology.

abstract: The growing recognition that entanglement is not exclusively a quantum property, and does not even originate with Schr\"odinger's famous remark about it [Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 31, 555 (1935)], prompts examination of its role in marking the quantum-classical boundary. We have done this by subjecting correlations of classical optical fields to new Bell-analysis experiments, and report here values of the Bell parameter greater than ${\cal B} = 2.54$. This is many standard deviations outside the limit ${\cal B} = 2$ established by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality [Phys. Rev. Lett. 23, 880 (1969)], in agreement with our theoretical classical prediction, and not far from the Tsirelson limit ${\cal B} = 2.828...$. These results cast a new light on the standard quantum-classical boundary description, and suggest a reinterpretation of it.

abstract: In standard optical tomographic methods, the off-diagonal elements of a density matrix $\rho$ are measured indirectly. Thus, the reconstruction of $\rho$, even if it is based on linear inversion, typically magnifies small errors in the experimental data. Recently, an optimal tomography [Phys. Rev. A 90, 062123 (2014)] has been proposed theoretically to measure one-by-one all the elements of $\rho$. Thus, the relative errors in the reconstructed state can be the same as those in the experimental data. We implemented this method for two-qubit polarization states performing both local and global measurements. For comparison, we also experimentally implemented other well-known tomographic protocols based solely on local measurements (of, e.g., the Pauli operators and James-Kwiat-Munro-White projectors) and those with mutually unbiased bases requiring both local and global measurements. We reconstructed seventeen of two-qubit polarization states including separable, partially and maximally entangled. Our experiments show the highest stability against errors of our method in comparison to the other quantum tomographies. In particular, we demonstrate that each optimally-reconstructed state} is embedded in the uncertainty circle of the smallest radius, both in terms of the trace distance and disturbance. We explain how to estimate experimentally the uncertainty radii for all the implemented tomographies and show that, for each reconstructed state, the relevant uncertainty circles intersect indicating the approximate location of the corresponding physical density matrix.

By determining the time evolution of the density matrix of the collective system, we explore how an incident laser field may cause transient optical field enhancement close to the surface of such nanoparticles. Our results provide further evidence that excitonic materials can be used to good effect in nanophotonics.

abstract: We give a protocol for the delegation of quantum computation on encrypted data. More specifically, we show that in a client-server scenario, where the client holds the encryption key for an encrypted quantum register held by the server, it is possible for the server to perform a universal set of quantum gates on the quantum data. All Clifford group gates are non-interactive, while the remaining non-Clifford group gate that we implement (the p/8 gate) requires the client to prepare and send a single random auxiliary qubit (chosen among four possibilities), and exchange classical communication. This construction improves on previous work, which requires either multiple auxiliary qubits or two-way quantum communication. Using a reduction to an entanglement-based protocol, we show privacy against any adversarial server according to a simulation-based security definition.

abstract: We show that all $n$-qubit entangled states, with the exception of tensor products of single-qubit and bipartite maximally-entangled states, admit Hardy-type proofs of non-locality without inequalities or probabilities. More precisely, we show that for all such states, there are local, one-qubit observables such that the resulting probability tables are logically contextual in the sense of Abramsky and Brandenburger, this being the general form of the Hardy-type property. Moreover, our proof is constructive: given a state, we show how to produce the witnessing local observables. In fact, we give an algorithm to do this. Although the algorithm is reasonably straightforward, its proof of correctness is non-trivial. A further striking feature is that we show that $n+2$ local observables suffice to witness the logical contextuality of any $n$-qubit state: two each for two for the parties, and one each for the remaining $n-2$ parties.

abstract: Time plays a crucial role in the intuitive understanding of the world around us. Within quantum mechanics, however, time is not usually treated as an observable quantity; it enters merely as a parameter in the laws of motion of physical systems. Here we take an operational approach to time. Towards this goal we consider quantum clocks, i.e., quantum systems that generate an observable time scale. We then study the quality of quantum clocks in terms of their ability to stay synchronised. To quantify this, we introduce the "Alternate Ticks Game" and analyse a few strategies pertinent to this game.

abstract: We propose examples of a hybrid quantum-classical simulation where a classical computer assisted by a small quantum processor can efficiently simulate a larger quantum system. First we consider sparse quantum circuits such that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any sparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Secondly, we study Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are non-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The computation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state. This model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show that any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Finally, we propose a purely classical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time $2^{c n} poly(n)$ where $c\approx 0.94$. This improves upon the brute-force simulation method which takes time $2^n poly(n)$. Our algorithm exploits the fact that n-fold tensor products of magic states admit a low-rank decomposition into n-qubit stabilizer states.

abstract: We introduce a theory that exposes the fundamental connection between the correlation among electrons and the degree of quantum coherence of electronic states in molecules and materials. Specifically, we show that the electronic interactions $V^{S}$ that lead to correlation strongly modulate the electronic decoherence and that, conversely, the electron-nuclear interactions $H^{SB}$ that lead to decoherence influence the correlation energy. The effects only decouple when $[V^{S},H^{SB}]=[H^{S},H^{SB}]=0$, where $H^{S}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian. We quantitatively illustrate this connection via numerically exact simulations of a Hubbard-Holstein molecule.

abstract: Quantum systems often exhibit fundamental incapability to entertain vortex. The Meissner effect, a complete expulsion of the magnetic field (the electromagnetic vorticity), for instance, is taken to be the defining attribute of the superconducting state. Superfluidity is another, close-parallel example; fluid vorticity can reside only on topological defects with a limited (quantized) amount. Recent developments in the Bose-Einstein condensates produced by particle traps further emphasize this characteristic. We show that the challenge of imparting vorticity to a quantum fluid can be met through a nonlinear mechanism operating in a hot fluid corresponding to a thermally modified Pauli-Schroedinger spinor field. In a simple field-free model, we show that the thermal effect, represented by a nonlinear, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, in conjunction with spin vorticity, leads to new interesting quantum states; a spiral solution is explicitly worked out.

The electron properties of graphene are described in the single $p_z$-orbital tight-binding approximation, in which the model is reduced to the effective two-level pseudo-spin $1/2$ system. For each level we introduce the electron transfer rate of escape into a continuum. We demonstrate that, under some conditions, the superradiance experiences the maximal quantum coherent escape to the continuum.

abstract: We present observable lower bounds for several entanglement measures including entanglement of formation, geometric measure of entanglement, concurrence, and convex-roof extended negativity. The lower bounds facilitate estimates of these entanglement measures for arbitrary finite-dimensional bipartite states. Moreover, these lower bounds can be easily obtained from the expectation value of a single observable, and the optimal lower bounds relate to fully entangled fraction. Based on our results, we use the real experimental measurement data reported by Tonolini \textit{et al.} [Sci. Rep. \textbf{4}, 6542 (2014)] to get the lower bounds of entanglement measures for their experimentally realized state. In addition, we also study the relations between entanglement measures.

abstract: Inspired by recent work [A. W. Carr and M. Saffman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 033607 (2013)], we propose a simplified scheme to prepare the two-atom maximally entangled states via dissipative Rydberg pumping. Compared with the former scheme, the simplified one involves less classical laser fields and Rydberg interactions, and the asymmetric Rydberg interactions are avoided. Master equation simulations demonstrate that the fidelity and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt correlation of the maximally entangled state could reach up to 0.999 and 2.821, respectively, under certain conditions. Furthermore, we extend the physical thoughts to prepare the three-dimensional entangled state, the numerical simulations show that, in theory, both the fidelity and the Negativity of the desired entanglement could be very close to unity under certain conditions.

abstract: Spatially entangled twin photons provide a test of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in its original form of position (image plane) versus impulsion (Fourier plane). We show that recording a single pair of images in each plane is sufficient to safely demonstrate an EPR paradox. On each pair of images, we have retrieved the fluctuations by subtracting the fitted deterministic intensity shape and then have obtained an intercorrelation peak with a sufficient signal to noise ratio to safely distinguish this peak from random fluctuations. A 95% confidence interval has been determined, confirming a high degree of paradox whatever the considered single pairs. Last, we have verified that the value of the variance of the difference between twin images is always below the quantum (poissonian) limit, in order to ensure the particle character of the demonstration. Our demonstration shows that a single image pattern can reveal the quantum and non-local behavior of light, without any need of averaging after repeating the experiment.

Although QFTs are defined without reference to particles, computations are done in terms of Feynman diagrams, which are explicitly interpreted in terms of interacting particles. Similarly, the easiest QCA to construct are Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA). A natural question then is, "are all nontrivial QCA QLGA?". Here we show by construction that the answer is "no"; thus there are QCA, even in $1+1$ dimensions, that have no particle interpretation.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is arguably among the most counter-intuitive phenomena predicted by quantum theory. In recent years, the development of an abstract theory of nonlocality has brought a much deeper understanding of the subject. In parallel, experimental progress allowed for the demonstration of quantum nonlocality in a wide range of physical systems, and brings us close to a final loophole-free Bell test. Here we combine these theoretical and experimental developments in order to explore the limits of quantum nonlocality. This approach represents a thorough test of quantum theory, and could provide evidence of new physics beyond the quantum model. Using a versatile and high-fidelity source of pairs of polarization entangled photons, we explore the boundary of quantum correlations, present the most nonlocal correlations ever reported, demonstrate the phenomenon of more nonlocality with less entanglement, and show that non-planar (and hence complex) qubit measurements can be necessary to reproduce the strong qubit correlations that we observed. Our results are in remarkable agreement with quantum predictions.

This is achieved by rapidly ionizing an exciton in an InGaAs quantum dot with very low fine-structure splitting at zero magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the hole spin fidelity of an arbitrary quantum dot can be increased by optical Stark effect tuning of the fine-structure splitting close to zero.

abstract: Within the unified framework of exploiting the relative entropy as a distance measure of quantum correlations, we make explicit the hierarchical structure of quantum coherence, quantum discord and quantum entanglement in multipartite systems. On this basis, we introduce a new measure of quantum coherence, the basis-free quantum coherence and prove that this quantity is exactly equivalent to quantum discord. Furthermore, since the original relative entropy of coherence is a basis-dependent quantity, we investigate the local and nonlocal unitary creation of quantum coherence, focusing on the two-qubit unitary gates. Intriguingly, our results demonstrate that nonlocal unitary gates do not necessarily outperform the local unitary gates. Finally, the additivity relationship of quantum coherence in tripartite systems is discussed in detail, where the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy plays an essential role.

abstract: We study a tripartite quantum system consisting of a coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonator and a nanomechanical resonator (NAMR) connected by a flux qubit, where the flux qubit has a large detuning from both resonators. By a unitray transformation and a second-order approximation, we obtain a strong and controllable (i.e., magnetic-field-dependent) effective coupling between the NAMR and the CPW resonator. Due to the strong coupling, vacuum Rabi splitting can be observed from the voltage-fluctuation spectrum of the CPW resonator. We further study the properties of single photon transport as inferred from the reflectance or equivalently the transmittance. We show that the reflectance and the corresponding phase shift spectra both exhibit doublet of narrow spectral features due to vacuum Rabi splitting. By tuning the external magnetic field, the reflectance and the phase shift can be varied from 0 to 1 and $-\pi$ to $\pi$, respectively. The results indicate that this hybrid quantum system can act as a quantum router.

In a non-excessive protocol, the gain of entanglement is bounded by the amount of entanglement being communicated between the remote parties, while excessive protocols violate such bound. We first present examples of excessive protocols that achieve a significant entanglement gain. Next we consider their use in noisy scenarios, showing that they improve entanglement achieved in other ways and for some situations excessive distribution is the only possibility of gaining entanglement.

abstract: Quantum theory introduces a cut between the observer and the observed system, but does not provide a definition of what is an observer. Based on an informational definition of observer, Grinbaum has recently predicted an upper bound on bipartite correlations in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell scenario equal to 2.82537, which is slightly smaller than the Tsirelson bound of standard quantum theory, but is consistent with all the available experimental results. Not being able to exceed Grinbaum's limit would support that quantum theory is only an effective description of a more fundamental theory and would have a deep impact in physics and quantum information processing. Here we present a test of the CHSH Bell inequality on photon pairs in maximally entangled states of polarization in which a value 2.82759+-0.00051 is observed, violating Grinbaum's bound by 4.3 standard deviations and providing the smallest distance with respect to Tsirelson's bound ever reported, namely, 0.00084+-0.00051. This sets a new lower experimental bound for Tsirelson's bound, strengthening the value of principles that predict Tsirelson's bound as possible explanations of all natural limits of correlations, and has important consequences for cryptographic security, randomness certification, characterization of physical properties in device-independent scenarios, and certification of quantum computation.

Encrypting a message for secure transmission might be performed by combining it with controlled noise as performed in Spread-Spectrum communication that are presently used in Telecommunication systems. Quantum communication using entanglement is another route for secure communications as demonstrated by several important experiments. Classical and Quantum noise are compared and discussed as a major constituent of secure communication.

It is demonstrated that oscillations of the occupation probabilities $\rho_{11}, \rho_{22}, \rho_{33}$ and $\rho_{44}$ are equivalent to the case of the spontaneous emission. The occupation probability $\rho_{11}$ reaches the case of sudden death, when the detuning parameters $\Delta_{2}$ equals zero.

abstract: Measurement and estimation of parameters are essential for science and engineering, where the main quest is to find out the highest achievable precision with given resources and design schemes that attain that precision. In this article we present a general framework for quantum metrology which relates the ultimate precision limit directly to the underlying dynamics, our framework provides efficient methods for computing the ultimate precision limit and optimal probe states. We further demonstrate the power of the framework by deriving a sufficient condition on when ancillary systems are not useful for improving the precision limit.

abstract: When confined to a topological environment consisting of a cycle coupled with a half-line, quantum walks exhibit long-term statistical tendencies which differ dramatically from the tendencies of classical random walks in the same environment. In particular, as suggested by numerical simulations, the probability distribution of the walker's position resolves, in part, into a non-vanishing distribution on the cycle and, in part, into a ballistic distribution on the half-line. By contrast, for a classical random walk, the probability distribution of the walker's position tends always to vanish on the cycle and to migrate completely to the half-line as a purely diffusive process.

abstract: In the quantum version of a Trojan-horse attack, photons are injected into the optical modules of a quantum key distribution system in an attempt to read information direct from the encoding devices. To stop the Trojan photons, the use of passive optical components has been suggested. However, to date, there is no quantitative bound that specifies such components in relation to the security of the system. Here, we turn the Trojan-horse attack into an information leakage problem. This allows us quantify the system security and relate it to the specification of the optical elements. The analysis is supported by the experimental characterization, within the operation regime, of reflectivity and transmission of the optical components most relevant to security.

abstract: This article discusses and explains the Hamiltonian formulation for a class of simple gauge invariant mechanical systems consisting of point masses and idealized rods. The study of these models may be helpful to advanced undergraduate or graduate students in theoretical physics to understand, in a familiar context, some concepts relevant to the study of classical and quantum field theories. We use a geometric approach to derive the Hamiltonian formulation for the model considered in the paper: four equal masses connected by six ideal rods. We obtain and discuss the meaning of several important elements, in particular, the constraints and the Hamiltonian vector fields that define the dynamics of the system, the constraint manifold, gauge symmetries, gauge orbits, gauge fixing, and the reduced phase space.

abstract: Since quantum field theories do not possess proper position observables, Unruh-DeWitt detector models serve as a key theoretical tool for extracting localized spatio-temporal information from quantum fields. Most studies have been limited, however, to Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that are coupled linearly to a scalar bosonic field. Here, we investigate UDW detector models that probe fermionic as well as bosonic fields through both linear and quadratic couplings. In particular, we present a renormalization method that cures persistent divergencies of prior models. We then show how perturbative calculations with UDW detectors can be streamlined through the use of extended Feynman rules that include localized detector-field interactions.Our findings pave the way for the extension of previous studies of the Unruh and Hawking effects with UDW detectors, and provide new tools for studies in relativistic quantum information, for example, regarding relativistic quantum communication and studies of the entanglement structure of the fermionic vacuum.

abstract: We devise a scalable scheme for simulating a quantum phase transition from paramagnetism to frustrated magnetism in a superconducting flux-qubit network, and we show how to characterize this system experimentally both macroscopically and microscopically simultaneously. Macroscopic characterization of the quantum phase transition is based on the expected sudden transition of the probability distribution for the spin-network net magnetic moment with this transition quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between measured and theoretical distributions for a given quantum phase. Microscopic characterization of the quantum phase transition is performed using the standard local-entanglement-witness approach. Simultaneous macro and micro characterizations of quantum phase transitions would serve to verify in two ways a quantum phase transition and provide empirical data for revisiting the foundational emergentist-reductionist debate regarding reconciliation of macroscopic thermodynamics with microscopic statistical mechanics especially in the quantum realm for the classically intractable case of frustrated quantum magnetism.

We establish their basic properties, and show that already known quantum entropies such as von Neumann, and quantum versions of R\'enyi, Tsallis, and unified entropies, constitute particular classes of the present general quantum Salicr\'u form. We give a characterization of the $(h,\phi)$-quantum entropies under the action of quantum operations, and study their properties for compound systems. We apply these generalized entropies to the problem of detection of quantum entanglement.

abstract: Quantum entanglement can be used in a communication scheme to establish a correlation between successive channel inputs that is impossible by classical means. It is known that the classical capacity of quantum channels can be enhanced by such entangled encoding schemes, but this is not always the case. In this paper, we prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of an entanglement-breaking channel even when it is assisted by a classical feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. In doing so, we identify a bound on the strong converse exponent, which determines the exponentially decaying rate at which the success probability tends to zero when the communication rate exceeds the capacity. Proving a strong converse, along with an achievability theorem, shows that the classical capacity is a sharp boundary between reliable and unreliable communication regimes. One of the main tools in our proof is the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy. The same method of proof is used to derive an exponential bound on the success probability when communicating over an arbitrary quantum channel assisted by classical feedback, provided that the transmitter does not use entangled encoding schemes.

abstract: Electromagnetic waves are ideal candidates for transmitting information in a quantum network as they can be routed rapidly and efficiently between locations using optical fibers or microwave cables. Yet linking quantum-enabled devices with cables has proved difficult because most cavity or circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems used in quantum information processing can only absorb and emit signals with a specific frequency and temporal envelope. Here we show that the temporal and spectral content of microwave-frequency electromagnetic signals can be arbitrarily manipulated with a flexible aluminum drumhead embedded in a microwave circuit. The aluminum drumhead simultaneously forms a mechanical oscillator and a tunable capacitor. This device offers a way to build quantum microwave networks using separate and otherwise mismatched components. Furthermore, it will enable the preparation of non-classical states of motion by capturing non-classical microwave signals prepared by the most coherent circuit QED systems.

abstract: We introduce the concepts of cohering and de-cohering power of quantum channels. Using the axiomatic definition of coherence measure, we show that the optimizations required for calculations of these measures can be restricted to pure input states and hence greatly simplified. We then use two examples of this measure, one based on the skew information and the other based on $l-1$ norm, we find the cohering and de-cohering measures of a number of one, two and n-qubit channels. Contrary to a view at first sight, it is seen that quantum channels can have cohering power. It is also shown that a specific property of a qubit unitary map, is that it has equal cohering and de-cohering power in any basis. Finally we derive simple relations between cohering and de-cohering powers of unitary qubit gates and their tensor products, results which have physically interesting implications.

Here, we show that at the nano and quantum scale, this law needs to be revised in the sense that more information about the bath other than its temperature is required to decide whether maximum efficiency can be achieved. In particular, we derive new fundamental limitations of the efficiency of heat engines at the nano and quantum scale that show that the Carnot efficiency can only be achieved under special circumstances, and we derive a new maximum efficiency for others.

abstract: We report on the generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs from a semiconductor quantum dot via pulsed resonant biexciton generation. Based on theoretical modeling we optimized the duration of the excitation pulse to minimize the laser-induced dephasing and increase the biexciton-to-background single exciton occupation probability. This results in a high degree of entanglement with a concurrence of up to 0.78(6) and a 0.88(3) overlap with a maximally entangled state. Theoretical simulations also indicate a power dependent nature of the dephasing during the laser excitation that limits the coherence of the excitation process.

abstract: A new approach to quantum walks is presented. Considering a quantum system undergoing some unitary discrete-time evolution in a directed graph G, we think of the vertices of G as sites that are occupied by the quantum system, whose internal state is described by density operators. To formulate the unitary evolution, we define reflections in the tensor product of an internal Hilbert space and a spatial Hilbert space. We then construct unitary channels that govern the evolution of the system in the graph. The discrete dynamics of the system (called quantum walks) is obtained by iterating the unitary channel on the density operator of the quantum system. It turns out that in this framework, the action of the unitary channel on a density operator is described by the usual matrix multiplication.

abstract: We use a R\'enyi entropy method to prove strong converse theorems for certain information-theoretic tasks which involve local operations and quantum (or classical) communication between two parties. These include state redistribution, coherent state merging, quantum state splitting, measurement compression with quantum side information, randomness extraction against quantum side information, and data compression with quantum side information. The method we employ in proving these results extends ideas developed by Sharma [arXiv:1404.5940], which he used to give a new proof of the strong converse theorem for state merging. For state redistribution, we prove the strong converse property for the boundary of the entire achievable rate region in the $(e,q)$-plane, where $e$ and $q$ denote the entanglement cost and quantum communication cost, respectively. In the case of measurement compression with quantum side information, we prove a strong converse theorem for the classical communication cost, which is a new result extending the previously known weak converse. For the remaining tasks, we provide new proofs for strong converse theorems previously established using smooth entropies. For each task, we obtain the strong converse theorem from explicit bounds on the figure of merit of the task in terms of a R\'enyi generalization of the optimal rate. Hence, we identify candidates for the strong converse exponents for each task discussed in this paper. To prove our results, we establish various new entropic inequalities, which might be of independent interest. These involve conditional entropies and mutual information derived from the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. In particular, we obtain novel bounds relating these quantities, as well as the R\'enyi conditional mutual information, to the fidelity of two quantum states.

abstract: The study of non-locality is fundamental to the understanding of quantum mechanics. The past 50 years have seen a number of non-locality proofs, but its fundamental building blocks, and the exact role it plays in quantum protocols, has remained elusive. In this paper, we focus on a particular flavour of non-locality, generalising Mermin's argument on the GHZ state. Using strongly complementary observables, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for Mermin non-locality in abstract process theories. We show that the existence of more phases than classical points (aka eigenstates) is not sufficient, and that the key to Mermin non-locality lies in the presence of certain algebraically non-trivial phases. This allows us to show that fRel, a favourite toy model for categorical quantum mechanics, is Mermin local. We show Mermin non-locality to be the key resource ensuring the device-independent security of the HBB CQ (N,N) family of Quantum Secret Sharing protocols. Finally, we challenge the unspoken assumption that the measurements involved in Mermin-type scenarios should be complementary (like the pair X,Y), opening the doors to a much wider class of potential experimental setups than currently employed. In short, we give conditions for Mermin non-locality tests on any number of systems, where each party has an arbitrary number of measurement choices, where each measurement has an arbitrary number of outcomes and further, that works in any abstract process theory.

Using techniques recently developed for the analysis of SU(2) transformations, we fully characterize the reachable sets of the system, and the optimal control strategies for any possible target transformation.

abstract: We explore quantum signatures of classical chaos by studying the rate of information gain in quantum tomography. The tomographic record consists of a time series of expectation values of a Hermitian operator evolving under application of the Floquet operator of a quantum map that possesses (or lacks) time reversal symmetry. We find that the rate of information gain, and hence the fidelity of quantum state reconstruction, depends on the symmetry class of the quantum map involved. Moreover, we find an increase in information gain and hence higher reconstruction fidelities when the Floquet maps employed increase in chaoticity. We make predictions for the information gain and show that these results are well described by random matrix theory in the fully chaotic regime. We derive analytical expressions for bounds on information gain using random matrix theory for different class of maps and show that these bounds are realized by fully chaotic quantum systems.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is one of the most striking predictions to emerge from quantum theory, and has not been demonstrated unambiguously. Beyond its fundamental interest, a loophole-free Bell test would enable powerful "device independent" information protocols, guaranteed by the impossibility of faster-than-light communication. Current efforts to simultaneously close the detection, locality, and freedom of choice (FoC) loopholes require random number generation (RNG) with an unprecedented combination of speed, unpredictability, and confidence. Here we combine ultra-fast RNG by accelerated laser phase diffusion with real-time randomness extraction and metrological randomness assurances to produce a RNG suitable for loophole-free Bell tests. Under paranoid assumptions we infer error rates below 1e-8 at 5{\sigma} statistical confidence for output based on spontaneous emission events less than 50 ns old. Tb- scale statistical analysis supports the metrological assessment of extreme unpredictability. The method will enable definitive nonlocality experiments and secure communications without need of trusted devices.

abstract: In the direct communication quantum channels the authorized recipient (Bob) and the non-authorized recipient (Eve) have different abilities for verification of received information. Bob can apply the feedback to commit the sender (Alice) to perform verification. Eve has to use for verification an indirect method based on the measurement of a set of incompatible observables enough for determination of the coding basis used by Alice. In the protocol of direct communication regular modification of coding basis and masking it with an equilibrium in average information carrier density matrix prevents reconstruction of coding basis by the results of Eve's measurements of an arbitrary set of observables. This provides unconditional security of the channel.

abstract: Photonic chip based time-bin entanglement has attracted significant attention because of its potential for quantum communication and computation. Useful time-bin entanglement systems must be able to generate, manipulate and analyze entangled photons on a photonic chip for stable, scalable and reconfigurable operation. Here we report the first time-bin entanglement photonic chip that integrates time-bin generation, wavelength demultiplexing and entanglement analysis. A two-photon interference fringe with an 88.4% visibility is measured (without subtracting any noise), indicating the high performance of the chip. Our approach, based on a silicon nitride photonic circuit, which combines the low-loss characteristic of silica and tight integration features of silicon, paves the way for scalable real-world quantum information processors.

abstract: The ability to distribute secret keys between two parties with information-theoretic security, that is, regardless of the capacities of a malevolent eavesdropper, is one of the most celebrated results in the field of quantum information processing and communication. Indeed, quantum key distribution illustrates the power of encoding information on the quantum properties of light and has far reaching implications in high-security applications. Today, quantum key distribution systems operate in real-world conditions and are commercially available. As with most quantum information protocols, quantum key distribution was first designed for qubits, the individual quanta of information. However, the use of quantum continuous variables for this task presents important advantages with respect to qubit based protocols, in particular from a practical point of view, since it allows for simple implementations that require only standard telecommunication technology. In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution, focusing in particular on protocols based on coherent states. We discuss the security of these protocols and report on the state-of-the-art in experimental implementations, including the issue of side-channel attacks. We conclude with promising perspectives in this research field.

abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage process for the collective cooling of a non-interacting atomic gas in a slightly anharmonic, asymmetric trap inside a relatively leaky optical cavity. During the first stage, the displacement stage, the atoms accumulate a small distance away from the trap centre. During the second stage, the cooling stage, a short laser pulse is applied which translates the initial displacement of the particles into a reduction of their vibrational energy with a collectively enhanced cooling rate. If this is followed by another displacement stage and both stages of the proposed cooling process are continuously repeated, the atomic gas is expected to reach a very low temperature.

abstract: Quantum mechanics is derived from the principle that the universe contain as much variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of each subsystem. The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an ensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar preparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst such similar subsystems which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by extremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers of similar subsystems this interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result the probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger equation. The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems appear statistical because they are members of large ensembles of similar systems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not members of any ensembles of similar systems. Consequently their collective coordinates may evolve deterministically. This proposal could be tested by constructing quantum devices from entangled states of a modest number of quits which, by its combinatorial complexity, can be expected to have no natural copies.

abstract: Quantum protocols for secret sharing usually rely on multi-party entanglement which with present technology is very difficult to achieve. Recently it has been shown that sequential manipulation and communication of a single $d-$ level state can do the same task of secret sharing between $N$ parties, hence alleviating the need for entanglement. However the suggested protocol which is based on using mutually unbiased bases, works only when $d$ is a prime number. We propose a new sequential protocol which is valid for any $d$.

abstract: We describe a method for initializing an ensemble of qubits in a pure ground state by applying collective cavity cooling techniques in the presence of local dephasing noise on each qubit. To solve the dynamics of the ensemble system we introduce a method for dissipative perturbation theory that applies average Hamiltonian theory in an imaginary-time dissipative interaction frame to find an average effective dissipator for the system dynamics. We use SU(4) algebra generators to analytically solve the first order perturbation for an arbitrary number of qubits in the ensemble. We find that to first order the effective dissipator describes local $T_1$ thermal relaxation to the ground state of each qubit in the ensemble at a rate equal to the collective cavity cooling dissipation rate. The proposed technique should permit the parallel initialization of high purity states in large ensemble quantum systems based on solid-state spins.

abstract: In the counterfactual cryptography scheme proposed by Noh (2009), the sender Alice probabilistically transmits classical information to the receiver Bob without the physical travel of a particle. Here we generalize this idea to the distribution of quantum entanglement. The key insight is to replace their classical input choices with quantum superpositions. We further show that the scheme can be generalized to counterfactually distribute multi-partite cat states.

abstract: The ZX calculus is a diagrammatic language for quantum mechanics and quantum information processing. We prove that the ZX-calculus is not complete for Clifford+T quantum mechanics. The completeness for this fragment has been stated as one of the main current open problems in categorical quantum mechanics. The ZX calculus was known to be incomplete for quantum mechanics, on the other hand, it has been proved complete for Clifford quantum mechanics (a.k.a. stabilizer quantum mechanics), and for single-qubit Clifford+T quantum mechanics. The question of the completeness of the ZX calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics is a crucial step in the development of the ZX calculus because of its (approximate) universality for quantum mechanics (i.e. any unitary evolution can be approximated using Clifford and T gates only). We exhibit a property which is know to be true in Clifford+T quantum mechanics and prove that this equation cannot be derived in the ZX calculus by introducing a new sound interpretation of the ZX calculus in which this particular property does not hold. Finally, we propose to extend the language with a new axiom.

abstract: The complementarity of signaling and local randomness in the resources required to simulate singlet statistics is a fundamental feature of quantum nonlocality, that unifies a number results. Here we generalize the complementarity by relaxing the assumption of free will in the choice of measurement settings. The complementarity implies that under the assumption of full free will, simulation resources with reduced randomness will be signaling. It would appear at first sight that an ontological extension based on such a simulation protocol would contradict no-signaling and free will. We prove that this is not so, by constructing such an extension through the "oblivious embedding" of the protocol in a Newtonian spacetime. Relativistic or other intermediate spacetimes are ruled out as the locus of the embedding because they would permit the violation of no-signaling at the operational level by virtue of hidden influence inequalities. This implies that predictively superior extensions of quantum mechanics (QM) must be Lorentz non-covariant. However, the operational theory reproduced by the extensions will be compatible with no-signaling and Lorentz covariance. This clarifies why in principle there is no obstacle to the compatibility of extensions of QM such as Bohmian mechanics and GRW-type collapse theories with special relativity. Certain arguments against the extendability of QM, due to Conway and Kochen (2009) and Colbeck and Renner (2012), are attributed to their assumption that the spacetime of the extensions has Minkowskian causal structure.

abstract: We analyze the harvesting of entanglement and classical correlations from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors. We assess the impact on the detectors' harvesting ability of the spacetime dimensionality, the suddenness of the detectors' switching, their physical size and their internal energy structure. Our study reveals several interesting dependences on these parameters that can be used to optimize the harvesting of classical and quantum correlations. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to previous belief, smooth switching is much more efficient than sudden switching in order to harvest vacuum entanglement, especially when the detectors remain spacelike separated. Additionally, we show that the reported phenomenology of spacelike entanglement harvesting is not altered by subleading order perturbative corrections.

abstract: We examine the time dependent amplitude $ \phi_{i}\left( t\right)$ at each vertex of a continuous-time quantum walk on a variety of connected graphs. The Lissajous curve of the real vs. imaginary parts of each $ \phi_{i}\left( t\right)$ often reveals an interesting shape of the "space of accessible amplitudes." We find that, depending on the graph and initial state of the walker, the time evolution of the quantum walk can result in a static probability distribution over the vertices or have the walker never visit some connected vertices. We also find two invariants of continuous-time quantum walks. First, considering the rate at which each amplitude changes in time we find the scalar quantity $T = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \|\dfrac{d \phi_{i}\left( t\right) }{d t}\|^{2}$ is invariant. Second, the vector area of a continuous patch of contingent amplitude space at each vertex is time dependent; however the total vector area is invariant.

We employ an optomechanical system in which a single optical cavity mode driven by a suitably chosen two-tone field is coupled to the two resonators. Significantly large mechanical entanglement can be achieved, which is extremely robust with respect to temperature.

abstract: This paper is concerned with linear quantum networks of $N$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs), with $N$ up to 6, which are interconnected in a coherent feedback chain. Each network connects two communicating parties (Alice and Bob) over two transmission channels. In previous work we have shown that a dual-NOPA coherent feedback network generates better Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement (i.e., more two-mode squeezing) between its two outgoing Gaussian fields than a single NOPA, when the same total pump power is consumed and the systems undergo the same transmission losses over the same distance. This paper aims to analyze stability, EPR entanglement between two outgoing fields of interest, and bipartite entanglement of two-mode Gaussian states of cavity modes of the $N$-NOPA networks under the effect of transmission and amplification losses, as well as time delays. It is numerically shown that, in the absence of losses and delays, the network with more NOPAs in the chain requires less total pump power to generate the same degree of EPR entanglement. Moreover, we report on the internal entanglement synchronization that occurs in the steady state between certain pairs of Gaussian oscillator modes inside the NOPA cavities of the networks.

abstract: Quantum coherence is a key resource like entanglement and discord in quantum information theory. Wigner-Yanase skew information, which was shown to be the quantum part of the uncertainty, has recently been projected as a measure of quantum coherence. On the other hand, the quantum speed limit has been established as an important notion for developing the ultra-speed quantum computer and communication channel. Here, we show that both of these quantities are related and thus, cast coherence as a resource to control the speed of quantum communication. We also showed that the product of the time bound and the coherence or the quantum part of the uncertainty behaves in a geometric way satisfying a relation under partial elimination and classical mixing of states. These relations give a new insight to the quantum speed limit. We also show that our bound is experimentally measurable and is tighter than various existing bounds in the literature.

abstract: The notion that the electromagnetic field is quantised is usually inferred from observations such as the photoelectric effect and the black-body spectrum. However accounts of the quantisation of this field are usually mathematically motivated and begin by introducing a vector potential, followed by the imposition of a gauge that allows the manipulation of the solutions of Maxwell's equations into a form that is amenable for the machinery of canonical quantisation. By contrast, here we quantise the electromagnetic field in a less mathematically and more physically-motivated way. Starting from a direct description of what one sees in experiments, we show that the usual expressions of the electric and magnetic field observables follow from Heisenberg's equation of motion. In our treatment, there is no need to invoke the vector potential in a specific gauge and we avoid the commonly-used notion of a fictitious cavity that applies boundary conditions to the field.

abstract: We derive a dynamical bound on the propagation of correlations in local random quantum circuits - lattice spin systems where piecewise quantum operations - in space and time - occur with classical probabilities. Correlations are quantified by the Frobenius norm of the commutator of two positive operators acting on space-like separated local Hilbert spaces. For times $t=O(L)$ correlations spread to distances $\mathcal{D}=t$ growing, at best, diffusively for any distance within that radius with extensively suppressed distance dependent corrections whereas for $t=o(L^2)$ all parts of the system get almost equally correlated with exponentially suppressed distance dependent corrections and approach the maximum amount of correlations that may be established asymptotically.

abstract: In most theoretical descriptions of collective strong coupling of organic molecules to a cavity mode, the molecules are modeled as simple two-level systems. This picture fails to describe the rich structure provided by their internal rovibrational (nuclear) degrees of freedom. We investigate a first-principles model that fully takes into account both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, allowing an exploration of the phenomenon of strong coupling from an entirely new perspective. First, we demonstrate the limitations of applicability of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strongly coupled molecule-cavity structures. For the case of two molecules, we also show how dark states, which within the two-level picture are effectively decoupled from the cavity, are indeed affected by the formation of collective strong coupling. Finally, we discuss ground-state modifications in the ultra-strong coupling regime and show that some molecular observables are affected by the collective coupling strength, while others only depend on the single-molecule coupling constant.

abstract: We propose and develop the thesis that the quantum theoretical description of experiments emerges from the desire to organize experimental data such that the description of the system under scrutiny and the one used to acquire the data are separated as much as possible. Application to the Stern-Gerlach and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments are shown to support this thesis. General principles of logical inference which have been shown to lead to the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equation and the probabilistic descriptions of the Stern-Gerlach and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments, are used to demonstrate that the condition for the separation procedure to yield the quantum theoretical description is intimately related to the assumptions that the observed events are independent and that the data generated by these experiments is robust with respect to small changes of the conditions under which the experiment is carried out.

abstract: In the paper we discuss possible applications of the so-called stroboscopic tomography (stroboscopic observability) to selected decoherence models of 2-level quantum systems. The main assumption behind our reasoning claims that the time evolution of the analyzed system is given by a master equation of the form $\dot{\rho} = \mathbb{L} \rho$ and the macroscopic information about the system is provided by the mean values $m_i (t_j) = Tr(Q_i \rho(t_j))$ of certain observables $\{Q_i\}_{i=1} ^r $ measured at different time instants $\{t_j\}_{j=1}^p$. The goal of the stroboscopic tomography is to establish the optimal criteria for observability of a quantum system, i.e. minimal value of $r$ and $p$ as well as the properties of the observables $\{Q_i\}_{i=1} ^r $.

abstract: I explore the possibility that a quantum system S may be described completely by the combination of its standard quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ and a (hidden) quantum state $|\phi\rangle$ (that lives in the same Hilbert space), such that the outcome of any standard projective measurement on the system S is determined once the two quantum states are specified. I construct an algorithm that retrieves the standard quantum-mechanical probabilities, which depend only on $|\psi\rangle$, by assuming that the (hidden) quantum state $|\phi\rangle$ is drawn at random from some fixed probability distribution Pr(.) and by averaging over Pr(.). Contextuality and Bell nonlocality turn out to emerge automatically from this algorithm as soon as the dimension of the Hilbert space of S is larger than 2. If $|\phi\rangle$ is not completely random, subtle testable deviations from standard quantum mechanics may arise in sequential measurements on single systems.

abstract: The Casimir--Polder interaction between an anisotropic particle and a surface is orientation dependent. We study novel orientational effects that arise due to curvature of the surface for distances much smaller than the radii of curvature by employing a derivative expansion. For nanoparticles we derive a general short distance expansion of the interaction potential in terms of their dipolar polarizabilities. Explicit results are presented for nano-spheroids made of SiO$_2$ and gold, both at zero and at finite temperatures. The preferred orientation of the particle is strongly dependent on curvature, temperature, as well as material properties.

abstract: A recent experiment [Lanting et al., PRX, (2014)] claimed to provide evidence of up to $8$-qubit entanglement in a D-Wave quantum annealing device. However, entanglement was measured using qubit tunneling spectroscopy, a technique that provides indirect access to the state of the system at intermediate times during the anneal by performing measurements at the end of the anneal with a probe qubit. Because the state is effectively classical at the end of the anneal, it is important to test whether a classical or semiclassical description of the device can somehow reproduce the experimental signature. To check this, we consider a recently proposed classical rotor model with classical Monte Carlo updates, which has been successfully employed in describing features of earlier experiments involving the device. We also consider simulated quantum annealing with quantum Monte Carlo updates, a semiclassical algorithm that samples from the instantaneous Gibbs state of the device Hamiltonian. As our quantum model, we use an adiabatic master equation, which cannot be efficiently simulated classically and which has previously been used to successfully capture the open system quantum dynamics of the device. We find that only the master equation is able to reproduce the features of the tunneling spectroscopy experiment, while both the classical rotor model and simulated quantum annealing fail to reproduce the experimental results. This bolsters the evidence for the reported entanglement.

abstract: We present an universal protocol, capable of compressing $N$ copies of a completely unknown mixed state into $O(\log N)$ qubits in a lossless fashion. Our result demonstrates that the exponential compression of identically prepared pure states, recently implemented in a prototype experiment by Rozema et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 160504 (2014)], can be extended to arbitrary mixed states, despite the fact that the latter cover an exponentially large space. Furthermore, we highlight a striking difference between the pure and the mixed state case, showing that, if the spectrum is known with sufficient precision, the number of qubits needed for compression of a mixed state will drop down discontinuously as soon as a small recovery error is allowed.

abstract: In this paper, we show how to use low-fidelity operations to control the dynamics of quantum systems. Noisy operations usually drive a system to evolve into a mixed state and damage the coherence. Sometimes frequent noisy operations result in the coherent evolution of a subsystem, and the dynamics of the subsystem is controlled by tuning noisy operations. Based on this, we find that universal quantum computation can be carried out by low-fidelity (fidelity $<90\%$) operations.

The diagrammatic calculus that we are concerned with here is not merely an illustrative tool, but it has both (i) a conceptual physical backbone, which allows it to act as a foundation for diverse physical theories, and (ii) a genuine mathematical underpinning, permitting one to relate it to standard mathematical structures.

abstract: We have generalised the concept of graph states to what we have called mixed graph states, which we define in terms of mixed graphs, that is graphs with both directed and undirected edges, as the density matrix stabilized by the associated stabilizer matrix defined by the mixed graph. We can interpret this matrix as a quantum object by making it part of a larger fully commuting matrix, i.e. where we choose the environment appropriately, and this will imply that our quantum object is a mixed state. We prove that, in the same way as (pure) graph states, the density matrix of a parent of mixed graph state can be written as sum of a few Pauli matrices, well defined from the mixed graph. We have proven that the set of matrices that appear in this sum is fully pair-wise commuting, and form a multiplicative group up to global constants, which is always of maximum size. Furthermore, the cardinality of the set depends solely of the miminum possible number of extension columns/rows, and the number of nodes of the mixed graph. We prove a formula for this cardinality. Finally, in the case of purely undirected graphs, this corresponds to the usual pure graph state. Also, we have developed a way of finding maximal commutative group of such Pauli matrices as a linear subspace problem, for any given mixed graph. We also have proven how the structure of maximal commutative groups is independent of the direction of the arrows of the mixed graph, and also of the undirected edges; this allows the simplification of the problem of finding these groups in general to finding them for a much smaller set of graphs.

abstract: We propose and investigate bounds on quantum process fidelity of quantum filters, i.e. probabilistic quantum operations represented by a single Kraus operator K. These bounds generalize the Hofmann bounds on quantum process fidelity of unitary operations [H.F. Hofmann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 160504 (2005)], and are based on probing the quantum filter by pure states forming two mutually unbiased bases. Determination of these bounds therefore requires much less measurements than full quantum process tomography. We find that it is particularly suitable to construct one of the probe basis from the right eigenstates of K, because in this case the bounds are tight in the sense that if the actual filter coincides with the ideal one then both the lower and upper bounds are equal to one. We theoretically investigate application of these bounds to a two-qubit optical quantum filter formed by interference of two photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter. For experimentally convenient choice of factorized input states and measurements we study the tightness of the bounds. We show that more stringent bounds can be obtained by more sophisticated processing of the data using convex optimization and we compare our methods for different choice of the input probe states.

abstract: We study the generation of entangled light in planar semiconductor microcavities. The focus is on a particular pump configuration where the dissipative internal polariton dynamics leads to the emission of entangled light in a W-state. Our study is based on the nonlinear equations of motion for the polariton operators derived within the dynamics-controlled truncation formalism. They include the losses through the cavity mirrors, the interaction with lattice vibrations, and the external laser driving in a Langevin approach. We find that the generated entanglement is robust against decoherence under realistic experimental conditions. The results show that pair correlations in solid-state devices can be used to stabilize the nonlocal properties of the emitted radiation.

abstract: We develop a very simple necessary condition for the perfect distinguishability of any set of maximally entangled states in a $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$ system. This condition places constraints on the starting measurement of the LOCC protocol, and, by doing so, reduces the the complexity of the distinguishability problem, particularly for any set of $d$ maximally entangled states (MES). To test the strength of this necessary condition we use it for the perfect distinguishability of all sets of four generalized Bell basis states in $\mathbb{C}^4 \otimes \mathbb{C}^4$. To do this we first partition all $\binom{16}{4}$ such sets into $122$ equivalent classes, such that any two sets within an equivalence class are related by action of a local unitary performed by Alice or Bob. Thus establishing whether any such set is perfectly distinguishable by LOCC merely requires one to know if any other set from the same equivalence class is perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. After this partitioning, we proceed to establish whether each of the $122$ sets are distinguishable by LOCC by testing some representative set from each equivalence class for the necessary condition we developed earlier on. Those sets which do not pass the test are not perfectly distinguishable by LOCC and are hence isolated from the remaining. Surprisingly, all sets which pass the test are found to be perfectly distinguishable by LOCC implying that the necessary condition is sufficient for sets of four generalized Bell States in $\mathbb{C}^4 \otimes \mathbb{C}^4$. Even more, the sets which pass the necessary test, can be distinguished by a one-way LOCC protocol using projective measurements. For each set that passes the test, we give the one-way LOCC protocol employing rank-one projective measurements for the perfect distinguishability of states in the set.

abstract: We propose and analyse the use of a three-well Bose-Hubbard model for the creation of two spatially separated entangled atomic samples. Our three wells are in a linear configuration, with all atoms initially in the middle well, which gives some spatial separation of the two end wells. The evolution from the initial quantum state allows for the development of entanglement between the atomic modes in the two end wells. Using inseparability criteria developed by Hillery and Zubairy, we show how the detected entanglement is time dependent, oscillating with the well occupations. We suggest and analyse a method for preserving the entanglement by turning off the different interactions when it reaches its first maximum. We analyse the system with both Fock and coherent initial states, showing that the violations of the Hillery-Zubairy inequality exist only for initial Fock states and that the collisional nonlinearity degrades them. This system is an early step towards producing entangled atomic samples that can be spatially separated and thus close the locality loophole in tests of non-local quantum correlations.

abstract: We report entanglement swapping with time-bin entangled photon pairs, each constituted of a 795 nm photon and a 1533 nm photon, that are created via spontaneous parametric down conversion in a non-linear crystal. After projecting the two 1533 nm photons onto a Bell state, entanglement between the two 795 nm photons is verified by means of quantum state tomography. As an important feature, the wavelength and bandwidth of the 795 nm photons is compatible with Tm:LiNbO3-based quantum memories, making our experiment an important step towards the realization of a quantum repeater.

abstract: In this paper we have investigated different classes of maximally and non-maximally entangled mixed states from the view point of Bell -violation, entanglement and mixedness. We have shown that mixedness and entanglement of Werner state is parameter independent whereas that of Ishizaka class, Munro class of maximally entangled mixed states and our proposed class of non- maximally entangled mixed states are dependent on certain parameter ranges. We have also shown that our non maximally entangled class of mixed states have structural similarity with the rank -$2$ form of Ishizaka class of maximally entangled mixed states.

The analytical model of the basic operating principle is supplemented by detailed numerical studies that demonstrate the high degree of selectivity and the robustness against static and dynamic control field errors of this scheme. We exemplify our protocol with an NV center-based sensor to demonstrate that it enables the identification of individual nuclear spins that form part of a large spin ensemble.

abstract: Our common understanding of the physical world deeply relies on the notion that events are ordered with respect to some time parameter, with past events serving as causes for future ones. Nonetheless, it was recently found that it is possible to formulate quantum mechanics without any reference to a global time or causal structure. The resulting framework includes new kinds of quantum resources that allow performing tasks - in particular, the violation of causal inequalities - which are impossible for events ordered according to a global causal order. However, no physical implementation of such resources is known. Here we show that a recently demonstrated resource for quantum computation - the quantum switch - is a genuine example of "indefinite causal order". We do this by introducing a new tool - the causal witness - which can detect the causal nonseparability of any quantum resource that is incompatible with a definite causal order. We show however that the quantum switch does not violate any causal nequality.

abstract: We demonstrate continuous tuning of the squeezing level generated in a double-ring optical parametric oscillator by externally controlling the coupling condition using electrically controlled integrated microheaters. We accomplish this by utilizing the avoided crossing exhibited by a pair of coupled silicon nitride microring resonators. We directly detect a change in the squeezing level from 0.5 dB in the undercoupled regime to 2 dB in the overcoupled regime, which corresponds to a change in the generated on-chip squeezing factor from 0.9 dB to 3.9 dB. Such wide tunability in the squeezing level can be harnessed for on-chip quantum enhanced sensing protocols which require an optimal degree of squeezing.

abstract: We investigate how the efficiency of the quantum teleportation protocol is affected when the qubits involved in the protocol are subjected to noise or decoherence. We study all types of noise usually encountered in real world implementations of quantum communication protocols, namely, the bit flip, phase flip (phase damping), depolarizing, and amplitude damping noise. Several realistic scenarios are studied in which a part or all of the qubits employed in the execution of the quantum teleportation protocol are subjected to the same or different types of noise. We find noise scenarios not yet known in which more noise or less entanglement lead to more efficiency. Furthermore, we show that if noise is unavoidable it is better to subject the qubits to different noise channels in order to obtain an increase in the efficiency of the protocol.

abstract: We present a construction of Hermitian operators and quantum states labelled by strings from a finite field. The distance between these operators or states is then simply related (typically, proportional) to the Hamming distance between their corresponding strings. This allows a straightforward application of classical coding theory to find arrangements of operators or states with a given distance distribution. Using the simplex or extended Reed-Solomon code in our construction recovers the discrete Wigner function, which has important applications in quantum information theory.

abstract: Classically simulating the dynamics of anyonic excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems is likely intractable in general because such dynamics are sufficient to implement universal quantum computation. However, processes of interest for the study of quantum error correction in anyon systems are typically drawn from a restricted class that displays significant structure over a wide range of system parameters. We exploit this structure to classically simulate, and thereby demonstrate the success of, an error-correction protocol for a quantum memory based on the universal Fibonacci anyon model. We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of the system and noise processes on lattice sizes of up to 128x128 sites, and find a lower bound on the error-correction threshold of approximately 12.5%, which is comparable to those previously known for abelian and (non-universal) nonabelian anyon models.

We show that equilibration in this context indeed takes place and does so very rapidly, in a time comparable to the time for the initial wave packet to reach the edges of the box. We also show that, for this situation, the equilibration behaviour is relatively insensitive to the precise choice of position measurements or initial condition.

abstract: We study photon blockade and anti-bunching in the cavity of an optomechanical system in which the mechanical resonator is coupled to a two-level system (TLS). In particular, we analyze the effects of the coupling strength (to the mechanical mode), transition frequency, and decay rate of TLS on the photon blockade. The statistical properties of the cavity field are affected by the TLS, because the TLS changes the energy-level structure of the optomechanical system via dressed states formed by the TLS and the mechanical resonator. We find that the photon blockade and tunneling can be significantly changed by the transition frequency of the TLS and the coupling strength between the TLS and the mechanical resonator. Therefore, our study provides a method to tune the photon blockade and tunneling using a controllable TLS.

abstract: This paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, the inverse spectral problem for tight-binding hamiltonians is studied. This problem is shown to have an infinite number of solutions for properly chosen energies. The space of such solutions is characterized by a hypersurface in the space of hopping amplitudes (i.e. couplings), whose dimension is half the number of sites in the array. Low dimensional examples for short chains are carefully studied and a table of exactly solvable inverse problems is provided in terms of Lie algebraic structures. With the aim of providing a method to generate lattice configurations, a set of equations for coupling constants in terms of energies is obtained; this is done by means of a new formula for the calculation of characteristic polynomials. Two examples with randomly generated spectra are studied numerically, leading to peaked distributions of couplings. In the second part of the paper, our results are applied to the design of bent waveguides, reproducing specific spectra below propagation threshold. As a demonstration, the Dirac and the finite oscillator are realized in this way. A few partially isospectral configurations are also presented.

abstract: A reconfigurable, multi-party quantum key distribution scheme is experimentally demonstrated by utilizing a poled fiber-based source of broadband polarization-entangled photon pairs and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). The large bandwidth (> 90 nm centered about 1555 nm) and highly spectrally-correlated nature of the entangled source is exploited to allow for the generation of more than 25 frequency-conjugate entangled pairs when aligned to the standard 200-GHz ITU grid. Such a network can serve more than 50 users simultaneously, allowing any one user on the network to establish a QKD link with any other user through wavelength-selective switching. The entangled pairs are delivered over 40 km of actual fiber (equivalent to 120 km of fiber based on channel-loss experienced), and a secure key rate of more than 20 bits/s per bi-party is observed.

abstract: Our goal is to extend information geometry to situations where statistical modeling is not obvious. The setting is that of modeling experimental data. Quite often the data are not of a statistical nature. Sometimes also the model is not a statistical manifold. An example of the former is the description of the Bose gas in the grand canonical ensemble. An example of the latter is the modeling of quantum systems with density matrices. Conditional expectations in the quantum context are reviewed. The border problem is discussed: through conditioning the model point shifts to the border of the differentiable manifold.

abstract: Casimir friction between a polarizable particle and a semi-infinite space is a delicate physical phenomenon, as it concerns the interaction between a microscopic quantum particle and a semi-infinite reservoir. Not unexpectedly, results obtained in the past about the friction force obtained via different routes are sometimes, at least apparently, wildly different from each other. Recently, we considered the Casimir friction force for two dielectric semi-infinite plates moving parallel to each other [J. S. H{\o}ye and I. Brevik, Eur. Phys. J. D {\bf 68}, 61 (2014)], and managed to get essential agreement with results obtained by Pendry (1997), Volokitin and Persson (2007), and Barton (2011). Our method was based upon use of the Kubo formalism. In the present paper we focus on the interaction between a polarizable particle and a dielectric half-space again, and calculate the friction force using the same basic method as before. The new ingredient in the present analysis is that we take into account radiative damping, and derive the modifications thereof. Some comparisons are also made with works from others. Essential agreement with the results of Intravaia, Behunin, and Dalvit can also be achieved using the modification of the atomic polarizability by the metallic plate.

abstract: Bell inequality violations can be used to certify private randomness for use in cryptographic applications. In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of the data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably contains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness can be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to proper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in principle be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as long as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all the information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of extracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it reduces the computational time of the extraction. Besides, a pre-processing of the data may capture features that an analysis based on global frequencies only may miss, thus leading to certify more randomness. Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices and the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies. We show that indeed almost all the randomness is present in the pair of outcomes for which at least one detection happened. We further show that in some case more randomness can be certified by discarding no-detection events compared to a naive strategy that takes all the events into account. We then briefly consider non-i.i.d strategies and provide an explicit example of such a strategy that is more powerful than any i.i.d. one even in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many measurement rounds, something that was not reported before in the context of Bell inequalities.

abstract: Experimental detection of entanglement of an arbitrary state of a given bipartite system is crucial for exploring many areas of quantum information, and even to judge the quality of entanglement producing source. We combine here the ideas of Branciard et al.'s measurement device independent protocol \cite{Gisin-mdiew} and Augusiak et al.'s universal entanglement witness scheme for two-qubit case \cite{augusiak}, and aim at generalizing it for the case of two-qudits. We provide a set of universal witness operators to check NPT-ness (negative under partial transpose) of two-qudit states in a measurement device independent way. We conjecture that no such entanglement witness exists for PPT (positive under partial transpose) entangled states. We also analyze the robustness of a entanglement witnessing process in the presence of noise in the inputs as well as in the measurement operators.

abstract: We apply a simple analytical method based on a unitary transformation to calculate the Bloch-Siegert (BS) shift over the entire driving-strength range. In quantitative comparison with the numerically exact BS shift obtained by Floquet formalism as well as the previous BS results, we confirm that our calculated results are not only accurate in the weak-driving regime but also correct in strong-driving limit. In the intermediate strong-driving regime, the calculated values of the BS shift are nearly the same as the exact ones. It turns out that our calculation for the BS shift is beyond perturbation. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the signatures caused by the BS shift by monitoring the excited-state population and the probe-pump spectrum under the experiment accessible conditions. In particular, we find that when the driving frequency is fixed at the transition frequency of the system, the lineshape of the probe-pump spectrum becomes asymmetric with the increase of the driving strength, which may be verified experimentally.

abstract: Estimation of the minimum eigenvalue of a quantum Hamiltonian can be formalised as the Local Hamiltonian problem. We study the natural special case of the Local Hamiltonian problem where the same 2-local interaction, with differing weights, is applied across each pair of qubits. First we consider antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic interactions, where the weights of the terms in the Hamiltonian are restricted to all be of the same sign. We show that for symmetric 2-local interactions with no 1-local part, the problem is either QMA-complete or in StoqMA. In particular the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and antiferromagnetic XY interactions are shown to be QMA-complete. We also prove StoqMA-completeness of the antiferromagnetic transverse field Ising model. Second, we study the Local Hamiltonian problem under the restriction that the interaction terms can only be chosen to lie on a particular graph. We prove that nearly all of the QMA-complete 2-local interactions remain QMA-complete when restricted to a 2D square lattice. Finally we consider both restrictions at the same time and discover that, with the exception of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, all of the interactions which are QMA-complete with positive coefficients remain QMA-complete when restricted to a 2D triangular lattice.

abstract: We consider a time dependent trap externally manipulated in such a way that one of its bound states is brought up towards the continuum threshold, and then down again. We evaluate the probability $P^{stay}$ for a particle, initially in a bound state of the trap, to continue in it at the end of the passage. We use the Sturmian representation, whereby the problem is reduced to evaluating the reflecting coefficient of an absorbing potential. In the slow passage limit, $P^{stay}$ goes to $1$ for a state turning before reaching the continuum threshold, and vanishes if the bound state crosses into the continuum. For a slowly moving state just "touching" the threshold $P^{stay}$ tends to a universal value of about $38\%$, for a broad class of potentials. In the rapid passage limit, $P^{stay}$ depends on the choice of the potential. Various types of trapping potentials are considered, with an analytical solution obtained in the special case of a zero-range well.

This construction results in two-dimensional quantum codes whose tradeoff of encoding rate versus protection is more favorable than for the surface code. These surface codes would require variable length connections between qubits, as determined by the hyperbolic geometry. We provide numerical estimates of the value of the noise threshold and logical error probability of these codes against independent X or Z noise, assuming noise-free error correction.

abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a framework for realising quantum network algorithms with the use of prior knowledge about the structure of the network. In particular, we consider a network that consists of different types of edges, such that the transitions between nodes result in extra edge-dependent phase shift. We combine amplitude amplification and phase estimation to develop an algorithm for exploring such networks. We show that in such model one is able to perform quantum search algorithms with exponential speed-up compared to the quantum search that neglects the extra phase shift. Finally, in the layered neural network inspired case we obtain logarithmic increase of the search complexity with exponential growth of the nodes number.

This approach provides a product form for the wavefunction components and allows an explicit connection with recent results obtained for the wavefunction in terms of truncated confluent Heun functions. Other approaches are also compared. For particular parameter values the exceptional part of the eigenspectrum consists of doubly degenerate crossing points. We give a proof for the number of roots of the constraint polynomials and discuss the number of crossing points.

abstract: We propose and theoretically investigate an unambiguous Bell measurement of atomic qubits assisted by multiphoton states. The atoms interact resonantly with the electromagnetic field inside two spatially separated optical cavities in a Ramsey-type interaction sequence. The qubit states are postselected by measuring the photonic states inside the resonators. We show that if one is able to project the photonic field onto two coherent states on opposite sites of phase space, an unambiguous Bell measurement can be implemented. Thus our proposal may provide a core element for future components of quantum information technology.

abstract: We investigate the entanglement patterns of photon-added and -subtracted four-mode squeezed vacuum states. Entanglements in different scenarios are analyzed by varying the number of photons added or subtracted in certain modes, which are referred to as the "player" modes, the others being "spectators." We find that the photon-subtracted state can give us higher entanglement than the photon-added state which is in contrast of the two-mode situation. We also study the logarithmic negativity of the two-mode reduced density matrix obtained from the four-mode state which again shows that the state after photon subtraction can possess higher entanglement than that of the photon-added state, and we then compare it to that of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state. Moreover, we examine the non-Gaussianity of the photon-added and -subtracted states to find that the rich features provided by entanglement cannot be captured by the measure of non-classicality.

abstract: The Kochen-Specker theorem demonstrates that it is not possible to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory in terms of a hidden variable model where the hidden variables assign a value to every projector deterministically and noncontextually. A noncontextual value-assignment to a projector is one that does not depend on which other projectors - the context - are measured together with it. Using a generalization of the notion of noncontextuality that applies to both measurements and preparations, we propose a scheme for deriving inequalities that test whether a given set of experimental statistics is consistent with a noncontextual model. Unlike previous inequalities inspired by the Kochen-Specker theorem, we do not assume that the value-assignments are deterministic and therefore in the face of a violation of our inequality, the possibility of salvaging noncontextuality by abandoning determinism is no longer an option. Our approach is operational in the sense that it does not presume quantum theory: a violation of our inequality implies the impossibility of a noncontextual model for any operational theory that can account for the experimental observations, including any successor to quantum theory.

abstract: Contextuality is the leading notion of non-classicality for a single system. However, experimental demonstrations of contextuality have generally been limited by conceptual difficulties. Here I focus on the simplest non-trivial case, four preparations and two tomographically complete binary measurements. Exploiting a subtle connection to the CHSH scenario gives eight non-linear inequalities which are together necessary and sufficient for the experimental statistics to admit a preparation noncontextual model. No fixed "operational equivalences" are required. Violating such an inequality is therefore arguably the most direct route to an experimental refutation of noncontextuality.

abstract: Classical chemical kinetics use rate-equation models to describe how a reaction proceeds in time. Such models are sufficient for describing state transitions in a reaction where coherences between different states do not arise, or in other words, a reaction which contain only incoherent transitions. A prominent example reaction containing coherent transitions is the radical-pair model. The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called reaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of intermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum walks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for describing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only on two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied to derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction. Our reaction operator predicts a recombination dephasing rate consistent with recent experiments [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 139}, 234309 (2013)], in contrast to previous work by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. {\bf 488}, 90 (2010)]. The standard radical-pair reaction has conventionally been described by either a normalised density operator incorporating both the radical pair and reaction products, or by a trace-decreasing density operator that considers only the radical pair. We demonstrate a density operator that is both normalised and refers only to radical-pair states. Generalisations to include additional dephasing processes and an arbitrary number of sites are also discussed.

abstract: In circuit electromechanics, the coupling strength is usually very small. Here, replacing the capacitor in circuit electromechanics by a superconducting flux qubit, we show that the coupling among the qubit and the two resonators can induce effective electromechanical coupling which can attain the strong coupling regime at the single photon level with feasible experimental parameters. We use dispersive couplings among two resonators and the qubit while the qubit is also driven by an external classical field. These couplings form a three-wave mixing configuration among the three elements where the qubit degree of freedom can be adiabatically eliminated, and thus results in the enhanced coupling between the two resonators. Therefore, our work constitutes the first step towards studying quantum nonlinear effect in circuit electromechanics.

abstract: The mechanism of the transition of a dynamical system from quantum to classical mechanics is one of the remaining challenges of quantum theory. Currently, it is considered to occur via decoherence caused by entanglement and/or stochastic interaction with a quantum environment. Here we prove that, in the absence of de-phasing environmental interaction, the asymptotic spatial wave function of any quantum system, propagating over distances and times large on an atomic scale but still microscopic, and subject to arbitrary deterministic fields, becomes proportional to the initial momentum wave function, \emph{where the particle positions and momenta are related by classical mechanics.} This implies that detection of particle positions and momenta at different times will yield results in accordance with classical mechanics, without the need to postulate decoherence of the wave function.

abstract: We propose a novel scheme for high fidelity photonic controlled phase gates using Rydberg blockade in an ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity. The gate operation is obtained by first storing a photonic pulse in the ensemble and then scattering a second pulse from the cavity, resulting in a phase change depending on whether the first pulse contained a single photon. We show that the combination of Rydberg blockade and optical cavities effectively enhances the optical non-linearity created by the strong Rydberg interaction and thereby reduces the requirements for photonic quantum gates. The resulting gate can be implemented with cavities of moderate finesse which allows for highly efficient processing of quantum information encoded in photons. As a particular example of this, we show how the gate can be employed to increase the communication rate of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles.

abstract: It is by now well understood that quantum dissipative processes can be harnessed and turned into a resource for quantum-information processing tasks. In this paper we demonstrate yet another way in which this is true by providing a dissipation-assisted protocol for the simulation of general Markovian dynamics. More precisely, we show how a suitable coherent coupling of a quantum system to a set of Markovian dissipating qubits allows one to enact an effective Liouvillian generator of any Lindbladian form. This effective dynamical generator arises from high-order virtual-dissipative processes and governs the system dynamics exactly in the limit of infinitely fast dissipation. Applications to the simulation of collective decoherence are discussed as an illustration.

abstract: The nonlinear optical Galton board (NLOGB), a quantum walk like (but nonlinear) discrete time quantum automaton, is shown to admit a complex evolution leading to long time thermalized states. The continuous limit of the Galton Board is derived and shown to be a nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE). The (Galerkin truncated) NLDE evolution is shown to thermalize toward states qualitatively similar to those of the NLOGB. The NLDE conserved quantities are derived and used to construct a stochastic differential equation converging to grand canonical distributions that are shown to reproduce the (micro canonical) NLDE thermalized statistics. Both the NLOGB and the Galerkin-truncated NLDE are thus demonstrated to exhibit spontaneous thermalization.

abstract: It is a recent realization that many of the concepts and tools of causal discovery in machine learning are highly relevant to problems in quantum information, in particular quantum nonlocality. The crucial ingredient in the connection between both fields is the tool of Bayesian networks, a graphical model used to reason about probabilistic causation. Indeed, Bell's theorem concerns a particular kind of a Bayesian network and Bell inequalities are a special case of linear constraints following from such models. It is thus natural to look for generalized Bell scenarios involving more complex Bayesian networks. The problem, however, relies on the fact that such generalized scenarios are characterized by polynomial Bell inequalities and no current method is available to derive them beyond very simple cases. In this work, we make a significant step in that direction, providing a general and practical method for the derivation of polynomial Bell inequalities in a wide class of scenarios, applying it to a few cases of interest. We also show how our construction naturally gives rise to a notion of non-signalling in generalized networks.

abstract: The discrepancy between maximally entangled states and maximally non-classical quantum correlations is well-known but still not well understood. We aim to investigate the relation between quantum correlations and entanglement in a family of N-setting generalizations of the CGLMP inequality for d-outcome systems. Using analytical as well as numerical techniques, we derive both maximal quantum violations and violations obtained from maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we study the most non-classical quantum states in terms of their entanglement entropy for large values of d and many measurement settings. Interestingly, we find that the entanglement entropy behaves very differently depending on whether N=2 or N>2: when N=2 the entanglement entropy is a monotone function of d and the most non-classical state is far from maximally entangled, whereas when N>2 the entanglement entropy is a non-monotone function of d and the most non-classical state converges to the maximally entangled state in the limit of large d.

Correlated two-photon states were generated with automatic conservation of energy and momentum in two given spatial modes. These states have a wide spectral range, even under small variations in crystal temperature, which consequently results in higher discreteness. Frequency entanglement was confirmed by measuring two-photon quantum interference fringes without any spectral filtering.

abstract: Although quant mech is linear, there are nevertheless quant sys with multiple interacting particles in which the effective evo of a single particle is governed by a nonlinear eq. This includes Bose-Einstein condensates, which are gov by the Gross-Pitaevskii eq (GPE), which is a cubic nonlin Schrodinger eq (NLSE) with a term propto $|\psi|^2\psi$. Evo by this eq solves the unstruct search prob in const time, but at the novel expense of increasing the time-measurement precision. Jointly optimizing these resources results in an overall scaling of $N^{1/4}$, which is a significant, but not unreasonable, improvement over the $N^{1/2}$ scaling of Grover's algo. Since the GPE effectively approx the multi-particle Schrodinger eq, for which Grover's algo is optimal, our result leads to a quant info-theoretic bound on the num of particles needed for this approx to hold, asymp. The GPE is not the only nonlin of the form $f(|\psi|^2)\psi$ that arises in effective eqs for the evo of real quant phys sys, however: The cubic-quintic NLSE describes light propagation in nonlin Kerr media with defocusing corrections, and the log NLSE describes Bose liquids under certain cond. Analysis of comput with such sys yields some surprising results; e.g., when time-measurement precision is included in the resource accounting, searching a "database" when there is a single correct ans may be easier than searching when there are multiple correct ans. These results lead to quant info-theoretic bounds on the phys resources required for these effective nonlin theories to hold, asymp. Further, strongly reg graphs, which have no global sym, are sufficiently complete for quant search on them to asymp behave like unstruct search. Certain suff complete graphs retain the improved runtime and resource scalings for some nonlin, so our scheme for nonlin, analog quant comput retains its benefits even when some struct is introduced.

abstract: Although many of works have been done in multivalued quantum logic synthesis, the question whether multivalued quantum circuits are more efficient than the conventional binary quantum circuits is still open. In this article we devote to the optimization of generic multivalued quantum circuits. The multivalued quantum Shannon decompositions (QSD) are improved so that the circuits obtained are asymptotically optimal for all dimensionality d. The syntheses of uniformly multifold controlled $R_y$ rotations are also optimized to make the circuits further simplified. Moreover, the theoretical lower bound of complexity for multivalued quantum circuits is investigated, and a quantity known as efficiency index is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of synthesis of various quantum circuits. The algorithm for qudit circuits given here is an efficient synthesis routine which produces best known results for all dimensionality d, and for both cases the number of qudit n is small and that is asymptotic. The multivalued quantum circuits are indeed more efficient than the binary quantum circuits. The facts, the leading factor of the lower bound of complexity for qudit circuits is small by a factor of d-1 in comparison to that for qubit circuits and the asymptotic efficiency index is increased with the increase of dimensionality d, reveal the potential advantage of qudit circuits over generic qubit circuits. The generic n-qudit circuits with $d\geq5$ and generic two-ququart circuits synthesized by the algorithm given here are practical circuits which are more efficient than the most efficient qubit circuits.

abstract: We extend the recent gravitational decoherence analysis of Pikovski et al. to an individual mesoscopic system with internal state characterized by a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates. We express the Pikovski et al. effect directly in terms of the energy variance, and show that the interferometric visibility is bounded from below. Hence unlike collisional decoherence, the visibility does not approach zero at large times. The Pikovski et al. effect is thus a ${\it dephasing}$ without a fully decoherent large time limit.

abstract: We determine the shared information that can be extracted from time-bin entangled photons using frame encoding. We consider photons generated by a general down-conversion source and also model losses, dark counts and the effects of multiple photons within each frame. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for including other imperfections such as after-pulsing, detector dead-times and jitter. The results are illustrated by deriving analytic expressions for the maximum information that can be extracted from high-dimensional time-bin entangled photons generated by a spontaneous parametric down conversion. A key finding is that under realistic conditions and using standard SPAD detectors one can still choose frame size so as to extract over 10 bits per photon. These results are thus useful for experiments on high-dimensional quantum-key distribution system.

abstract: Photon-based quantum information processing promises new technologies including optical quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and distributed quantum networks. Polarization-encoded photons at telecommunication wavelengths provide a compelling platform for practical realization of these technologies. However, despite important success towards building elementary components compatible with this platform, including sources of entangled photons, efficient single photon detectors, and on-chip quantum circuits, a missing element has been atomic quantum memory that directly allows for reversible mapping of quantum states encoded in the polarization degree of a telecom-wavelength photon. Here we demonstrate the quantum storage and retrieval of polarization states of heralded single-photons at telecom-wavelength by implementing the atomic frequency comb protocol in an ensemble of erbium atoms doped into an optical fiber. Despite remaining limitations in our proof-of-principle demonstration such as small storage efficiency and storage time, our broadband light-matter interface reveals the potential for use in future quantum information processing.

abstract: Superfluidity is an emergent quantum phenomenon which arises due to strong interactions between elementary excitations in liquid helium. These excitations have been probed with great success using techniques such as neutron and light scattering. However measurements to-date have been limited, quite generally, to average properties of bulk superfluid or the driven response far out of thermal equilibrium. Here, we use cavity optomechanics to probe the thermodynamics of superfluid excitations in real-time. Furthermore, strong light-matter interactions allow both laser cooling and amplification of the thermal motion. This provides a new tool to understand and control the microscopic behaviour of superfluids, including phonon-phonon interactions, quantised vortices and two-dimensional quantum phenomena such as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The third sound modes studied here also offer a pathway towards quantum optomechanics with thin superfluid films, including femtogram effective masses, high mechanical quality factors, strong phonon-phonon and phonon-vortex interactions, and self-assembly into complex geometries with sub-nanometre feature size.

In this work, we generalize it to multipartite case, we call the generalized version multipartite fully entangled fraction (MFEF). MFEF measures the closeness of a state to GHZ states. The analytical expressions of MFEF are very difficult to obtain except for very special states, however, we show that, the MFEF of any state is determined by a system of finite-order polynomial equations. Therefore, the MFEF can be efficiently numerically computed.

abstract: In this work, a physical system described by Hamiltonian $\mathbf{H}_\omega = \mathbf{H}_0 + \mathbf{V}_\omega(\mathbf{x},t)$ consisted of a solvable model $\mathbf{H}$ and external random and time-dependent potential $\mathbf{V}_\omega(\mathbf{x},t)$ is investigated. Under the conditions that the average external potential with respect to the configuration $\omega$ is constant in time, and, for each configuration, the potential changes smoothly that the evolution of the system follows Schr\"odinger dynamics, the mean-dynamics can be derived from taking average of the equation with respect to configuration parameter $\omega$. It provides extra contributions from the deviations of the Hamiltonian and evolved state along the time to the Heisenberg and Liouville-von Neumann equations. Consequently, the Kubo's formula and the fluctuation-dissipation relation obtained from the construction is modified in the sense that the contribution from the information of randomness and memory effect from time-dependence are present.

abstract: Quantum properties of optical modes are typically assessed by observing their photon statistics or the distribution of their quadratures. Both particle- and wave-like behaviours deliver important information, and each may be used as a resource in quantum-enhanced technologies. Weak-field homodyne detection provides a scheme which combines the wave- and particle-like descriptions. Here we show that it is possible to observe a wave-like property such as the optical coherence across Fock basis states in the detection statistics derived from discrete photon counting. We experimentally demonstrate these correlations using two weak-field homodyne detectors on each mode of two classes of two-mode entangled states. Furthermore, we theoretically describe the response of weak-field homodyne detection on a two-mode squeezed state in the context of generalised Bell inequalities. Our work demonstrates the potential of this technique as a tool for hybrid continuous/discrete-variable protocols on a phenomenon that explicitly combines both approaches.

abstract: The implementation of quantum gates with fidelities that exceed the threshold for reliable quantum computing requires robust gates whose performance is not limited by the precision of the available control fields. The performance of these gates also should not be affected by the noisy environment of the quantum register. Here we use randomized benchmarking of quantum gate operations to compare the performance of different families of gates that compensate errors in the control field amplitudes and decouple the system from the environmental noise. We obtain average fidelities of up to 99.8\%, which exceeds the threshold value for some quantum error correction schemes as well as the expected limit from the dephasing induced by the environment.

abstract: In quantum optimal control theory the success of an optimization algorithm is highly influenced by how the figure of merit to be optimized behaves as a function of the control field, i.e. by the control landscape. Constraints on the control field introduce local minima in the landscape --traps-- which might prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem. The Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimal control algorithm is constructed to improve the optimization efficiency by introducing an expansion of the control field onto a truncated basis, that is, it works with a limited control field bandwidth. We study the influence of traps on the success probability of CRAB and extend the original algorithm to engineer the landscape in order to eliminate the traps; we demonstrate that this development exploits the advantages of both (unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods. Finally, we characterize the behavior of the extended CRAB under additional constraints and show that for reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained.

abstract: In 1985, David Deutsch challenged the Church-Turing thesis by stating that his quantum model of computation "could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine". While this is thought to be true in general, there is usually no way of knowing that the corresponding classical algorithms are the best possible solutions. Here we provide an efficient classical simulation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which was one of the first examples of quantum computational speed-up. Our conclusion is that the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm owes its speed-up to resources that are not necessarily quantum-mechanical, and when compared with the classical simulation offers no speed-up at all.

abstract: This paper is concerned with variational methods for nonlinear open quantum systems with Markovian dynamics governed by Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The latter are driven by quantum Wiener processes of the external boson fields and are specified by the system Hamiltonian and system-field coupling operators. We consider the system response to perturbations of these energy operators and introduce a transverse Hamiltonian which encodes the propagation of the perturbations through the unitary system-field evolution. This provides a tool for the infinitesimal perturbation analysis and development of optimality conditions for coherent quantum control problems. We apply the transverse Hamiltonian variational technique to a mean square optimal coherent quantum filtering problem for a measurement-free cascade connection of quantum systems.

We show how they immediately lead to closed-form expressions for both fidelity susceptibility characterizing the quantum critical point and the coefficients of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian enabling arbitrarily quick adiabatic driving of the system. Our results generalize and extend the sums presented in the popular Gradshteyn and Ryzhik Table of Integrals, Series, and Products.

abstract: We study the entanglement of a pure state of a composite quantum system consisting of several subsystems with $d$ levels each. It can be described by the R\'enyi-Ingarden-Urbanik entropy $S_q$ of a decomposition of the state in a product basis, minimized over all local unitary transformations. In the case $q=0$ this quantity becomes a function of the rank of the tensor representing the state, while in the limit $q \to \infty$ the entropy becomes related to the overlap with the closest separable state and the geometric measure of entanglement. For any bipartite system the entropy $S_1$ coincides with the standard entanglement entropy. We analyze the distribution of the minimal entropy for random states of three and four-qubit systems. In the former case the distributions of $3$-tangle is studied and some of its moments are evaluated, while in the latter case we analyze the distribution of the hyperdeterminant. The behavior of the maximum overlap of a three-qudit system with the closest separable state is also investigated in the asymptotic limit.

abstract: We demonstrate that, with a fair comparison, the secret key rate of discrete-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (DV-MDI-QKD) with high-efficiency single-photon detectors and good system alignment is typically rather high and thus highly suitable for not only long distance communication but also metropolitan networks. The previous reservation on the key rate and suitability of DV-MDI-QKD for metropolitan networks expressed by Pirandola et al. [Nature Photon. 9, 397 (2015)] was based on an unfair comparison with low-efficiency detectors and high quantum bit error rate, and is, in our opinion, unjustified.

abstract: We experimentally resolve several weakly coupled nuclear spins in diamond using a series of novelly designed dynamical decoupling controls. Some nuclear spin signals, hidden by decoherence under ordinary dynamical decoupling controls, are shifted forward in time domain to the coherence time range and thus rescued from the fate of being submerged by the noisy spin bath. In this way, more and remoter single nuclear spins are resolved. Additionally, the field of detection can be continuously tuned on sub-nanoscale. This method extends the capacity of nanoscale magnetometry and may be applicable in other systems for high-resolution noise spectroscopy.

abstract: Quantum mechanics represents one of the greatest triumphs of human intellect and, undoubtedly, is the most successful physical theory we have to date. However, since its foundation about a century ago, it has been uninterruptedly the center of harsh debates ignited by the counterintuitive character of some of its predictions. The subject of one of these heated discussions is the so-called "retrodiction paradox", namely a deceptive inconsistency of quantum mechanics which is often associated with the "measurement paradox" and the "collapse of the wave function"; it comes from the apparent time-asymmetry between state preparation and measurement. Actually, in the literature one finds several versions of the retrodiction paradox; however, a particularly insightful one was presented by Sir Roger Penrose in his seminal book \emph{The Road to Reality}. Here, we address the question to what degree Penrose's retrodiction paradox occurs in the classical and quantum domain. We achieve a twofold result. First, we show that Penrose's paradox manifests itself in some form also in classical optics. Second, we demonstrate that when information is correctly extracted from the measurements and the quantum-mechanical formalism is properly applied, Penrose's retrodiction paradox does not manifest itself in quantum optics.

abstract: Optical control of nanoscale objects has recently developed into a thriving field of research with far-reaching promises for precision measurements, fundamental quantum physics and studies on single-particle thermodynamics. Here, we demonstrate the optical manipulation of silicon nanorods in high vacuum. Initially, we sculpture these particles into a silicon substrate with a tailored geometry to facilitate their launch into high vacuum by laser-induced mechanical cleavage. We manipulate and trace their center-of-mass and rotational motion through the interaction with an intense intra-cavity field. Our experiments show optical forces on nanorotors three times stronger than on silicon nanospheres of the same mass. The optical torque experienced by the spinning rods will enable cooling of the rotational motion and torsional opto-mechanics in a dissipation-free environment.

abstract: We study the relation between single-mode nonclassicality and two-mode entanglement in a beam-splitter. We show that not all of the nonclassicality (entanglement potential) is transformed into two-mode entanglement for an incident single-mode light. Some of the entanglement potential remains as single-mode nonclassicality in the two entangled output modes. Two-mode entanglement generated in the process can be equivalently quantified as the increase in the minimum uncertainty widths (or decrease in the squeezing) of the output states compared to the input states. We use the nonclassical depth and logarithmic negativity as single-mode nonclassicality and entanglement measures, respectively. We realize that a conservation relation between the two quantities can be adopted for Gaussian states, if one works in terms of uncertainty width. This conservation relation is extended to many sets of beam-splitters.

This can be done even when such pointer states are a priori unknown. The possibility of measuring the expectation value of any observable, without any prior knowledge of the state, points to the objective existence of such states.

abstract: The boson sampling problem has brought a lot of attention in the quantum information field because it is not efficiently solvable with a classical computer; nonetheless it can be implemented with linear optical interferometers with single-boson sources. Recently, we introduced a more general problem, the multi-boson correlation sampling problem, which allows us to take advantage of the multi-mode spectral distribution of the bosonic sources together with time-correlated measurements in order to achieve sampling not only over the output ports of the interferometer but also over the joint detection times. This problem was analyzed for both single-photon sources and thermal sources. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to use single qubit bosonic sources in order to sample not only over the described "space-time" degree of freedom but also over all the possible exponential number of multi-qubit output states.

abstract: A model for a controlled single-photon beam-splitter is proposed and analysed. It consists of two crossed optical-cavities with overlapping waists, dynamically coupled to a single flying atom. The system is shown to route a single photon with near-unity efficiency in an effective "weak-coupling" regime. Furthermore, two such nodes, forming a segment of a quantum network, are shown to perform several controlled quantum operations. All one-qubit operations involve a transfer of a photon from one cavity to another in a single node, while two-qubit operations involve transfer from one node to a next one, coupled via an optical fiber. Novel timing protocols for classical optical fields are found to simplify possible experimental realizations along with achievable effective parameter regime. Though our analysis here is restricted to a cavity-QED scenario, basic features of the model can be extended to various other physical systems including gated quantum dots, circuit-QED or opto-mechanical elements.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality is a widely used test of the "quantumness" of a system, and involves correlations between measurements realized at different times. According to its widespread interpretation, a violation of the Legget-Garg inequality disproofs macroscopic realism and non-invasiveness. Nevertheless, recent results point out that macroscopic realism is a model dependent notion and that one should always be able to attribute to invasiveness a violation of a Legget-Garg inequality. This opens some natural questions: how to provide such an attribution in a systematic way? How can apparent macroscopic realism violation be recast into a dimensional independent invasiveness model? The present work answers these questions by introducing an operational model where the effects of invasiveness are controllable through a parameter associated to what is called the measurability of the physical system. Such a parameter leads to different generalized measurements that can be associated to the dimensionality of a system, to measurement errors or to back action.

abstract: In the dispersive regime of qubit-cavity coupling, classical cavity drive populates the cavity, but leaves the qubit state unaffected. However, the dispersive Hamiltonian is derived after both a frame transformation and an approximation. Therefore, to connect to external experimental devices, the inverse frame transformation from the dispersive frame back to the lab frame is necessary. In this work, we show that in the lab frame the system is best described by an entangled state known as the dressed coherent state, and thus even in the dispersive regime, entanglement is generated between the qubit and the cavity. Also, we show that further qubit evolution depends on both the amplitude and phase of the dressed coherent state, and use the dressed coherent state to calculate the measurement contrast of a recently developed dispersive readout protocol.

We conclude our journey by proving that fRel is local, but not without some unexpected twists.

abstract: Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill have formulated a way of encoding a qubit into an oscillator such that the qubit is protected against small shifts (translations) in phase space. The idea underlying this encoding is that error processes of low rate can be expanded into small shift errors. The qubit space is defined as an eigenspace of two mutually commuting displacement operators $S_p$ and $S_q$ which act as large shifts/translations in phase space. We propose and analyze the approximate creation of these qubit states by coupling the oscillator to a sequence of ancilla qubits. This preparation of the states uses the idea of phase estimation where the phase of the displacement operator, say $S_p$, is approximately determined. We consider several possible forms of phase estimation. We analyze the performance of repeated and adapative phase estimation as the simplest and experimentally most viable schemes given a realistic upper-limit on the number of photons in the oscillator. We propose a detailed physical implementation of this protocol using the dispersive coupling between a transmon ancilla qubit and a cavity mode in circuit-QED. We provide an estimate that in a current experimental set-up one can prepare a good code state from a squeezed vacuum state using $8$ rounds of adapative phase estimation, lasting in total about $4 \mu$ sec., with $80\%$ (heralded) chance of success.

abstract: Radiative two-photon cascades from biexcitons in semiconductor quantum dots under resonant two-photon excitation are promising candidates for the generation of photon pairs. In this work, we propose a scheme to obtain two-photon emission that allows to operate under very intense driving fields. This approach relies on the Purcell enhancement of two-photon virtual transitions between states of the biexciton dressed by the laser. The richness provided by the biexcitonic level structure allows to reach a variety of regimes, from antibunched and bunched photon pairs with polarization orthogonal to the driving field, to polarization entangled two-photon emission. This evidences that the general paradigm of two-photon emission from a ladder of dressed states can find interesting, particular implementations in a variety of systems.

abstract: One of the most intriguing discoveries regarding quantum non-local correlations in recent years was the establishment of a direct correspondence between the quantum value of non-local games and the strength of the fine-grained uncertainty relations in \textit{Science, vol. 330, no. 6007, 1072 (2010)}. It was shown that while the degree of non-locality in any theory is generally determined by a combination of two factors - the strength of the uncertainty principle and the degree of steering allowed in the theory, the most paradigmatic games in quantum theory have degree of non-locality purely determined by the uncertainty principle alone. In this context, the fundamental question arises: is this a universal property of optimal quantum strategies for all non-local games? Indeed, the above mentioned feature occurs in surprising situations, even when the optimal strategy for the game involves non-maximally entangled states. However, here we definitively prove that the answer to the question is negative, by presenting explicit counter-examples of non-local games and fully analytical optimal quantum strategies for these, where a definite trade-off between steering and uncertainty is absolutely necessary. We provide an intuitive explanation in terms of the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters theorem for when the relationship between the uncertainty principle and the quantum game value breaks down.

abstract: Measuring entanglement is a demanding task that usually requires full tomography of a quantum system, involving a number of observables that grows exponentially with the number of parties. Recently, it was suggested that adding a single ancillary qubit would allow for the efficient measurement of concurrence, and indeed any entanglement monotone associated to antilinear operations. Here, we report on the experimental implementation of such a device---an embedding quantum simulator---in photonics, encoding the entangling dynamics of a bipartite system into a tripartite one. We show that bipartite concurrence can be efficiently extracted from the measurement of merely two observables, instead of fifteen, without full tomographic information.

abstract: Confined quantum systems involving $N$ identical interacting fermions are found in many areas of physics, including condensed matter, atomic, nuclear and chemical physics. In a previous series of papers, a manybody perturbation method that is applicable to both weakly and strongly-interacting systems of bosons has been set forth by the author and coworkers. A symmetry invariant perturbation theory was developed which uses group theory coupled with the dimension of space as the perturbation parameter to obtain an analytic correlated wave function through first order for a system under spherical confinement with a general two-body interaction. In the present paper, we extend this formalism to large systems of fermions, circumventing the numerical demands of applying the Pauli principle by enforcing the Pauli principle on paper. The method does not scale in complexity with $N$ and has minimal numerical cost. We apply the method to a unitary Fermi gas and compare to recent Monte Carlo values.

abstract: One of the main applications of future quantum computers will be the simulation of quantum models. While the evolution of a quantum state under a Hamiltonian is straightforward (if sometimes expensive), using quantum computers to determine the ground state phase diagram of a quantum model and the properties of its phases is more involved. Using the Hubbard model as a prototypical example, we here show all the steps necessary to determine its phase diagram and ground state properties on a quantum computer. In particular, we discuss strategies for efficiently determining and preparing the ground state of the Hubbard model starting from various mean-field states with broken symmetry. We present an efficient procedure to prepare arbitrary Slater determinants as initial states and present the complete set of quantum circuits needed to evolve from these to the ground state of the Hubbard model. We show that, using efficient nesting of the various terms each time step in the evolution can be performed with just $\mathcal{O}(N)$ gates and $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ circuit depth. We give explicit circuits to measure arbitrary local observables and static and dynamic correlation functions, both in the time and frequency domain. We further present efficient non-destructive approaches to measurement that avoid the need to re-prepare the ground state after each measurement and that quadratically reduce the measurement error.

abstract: We demonstrate the tunable enhancement of the zero phonon line of a single nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond at cryogenic temperature. An open cavity fabricated using focused ion beam milling provides mode volumes as small as 1.24 $\mu$m$^3$. In-situ tuning of the cavity resonance is achieved with piezoelectric actuators. At optimal coupling of the full open cavity the signal from individual zero phonon line transitions is enhanced by about a factor of 10 and the overall emission rate of the NV$^-$ center is increased by 40% compared with that measured from the same center in the absence of cavity field confinement. This result is important for the realization of efficient spin-photon interfaces and scalable quantum computing using optically addressable solid state spin qubits.

abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem lies at the heart of the foundations of quantum mechanics. It establishes impossibility of explaining predictions of quantum theory by any noncontextual ontological model. Spekkens generalized the notion of KS contextuality in [Phys. Rev. A 71, 052108 (2005)] for arbitrary experimental procedures (preparation, measurement, and transformation procedure). Interestingly, later on it was shown that preparation contextuality powers parity-oblivious multiplexing [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010401 (2009)], a two party information theoretic game. Thus, using resources of a given operational theory, the maximum success probability achievable in such a game suffices as a \emph{bona-fide} measure of preparation contextuality for the underlying theory. In this work we show that preparation contextuality in quantum theory is more restricted compared to a general operational theory known as \emph{box world}. Moreover, we find that this limitation of quantum theory implies the quantitative bound on quantum nonlocality as depicted by the Cirel'son bound.

abstract: We investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of a Gaussian probe pulse propagating through a four-level $N$-type atomic medium. At two-photon resonance of probe-and control fields, weaker probe pulses may propagate through the medium with low absorption and pulse shape distortion. In contrast, we find that increasing the probe pulse intensity leads to a splitting of the initially Gaussian pulse into a sequence of subpulses in the time domain. The number of subpulses arising throughout the propagation can be controlled via a suitable choice of the probe and control field parameters. Employing a simple theoretical model for the nonlinear pulse propagation, we conclude that the splitting occurs due to an interplay of Kerr nonlinearity and group velocity dispersion.

We propose the way to solve the problem of violation of the equivalence principle in a rotationally invariant noncommutative space.

Also we construct the extension of these systems to mixed states using Werner like states. For the states constructed, we study the dependence of the entanglement and quantum discord upon the deformation and mixed parameters.

abstract: Readout of the state of a superconducting qubit by homodyne detection of the output signal from a dispersively coupled microwave resonator is a common technique in circuit quantum electrodynamics, and is often claimed to be quantum non-demolition (QND) up to the same order of approximation as in the dispersive approximation. However, in this work we show that only in the limit of infinite measurement time is this protocol QND, as the formation of a dressed coherent state in the qubit-cavity system applies an effective rotation to the qubit state. We show how this rotation can be corrected by a coherent operation, leading to improved qubit initialization by measurement and coherent feedback.

abstract: We consider the continuous-variable protocol of Pirandola et al. [Nature Photonics 9, 397-402 (2015), see also arXiv.1312.4104] where the secret-key is established by the measurement of an untrusted relay. In this network protocol, two authorized parties are connected to an untrusted relay by insecure quantum links. Secret correlations are generated by a continuous-variable Bell detection performed on incoming coherent states. In the present work we provide a detailed study of the symmetric configuration, where the relay is midway between the parties. We analyze symmetric eavesdropping strategies against the quantum links explicitly showing that, at fixed transmissivity and thermal noise, two-mode coherent attacks are optimal, manifestly outperforming one-mode collective attacks based on independent entangling cloners. Such an advantage is shown both in terms of security threshold and secret-key rate.

abstract: We develop rigorous notions of causality and causal separability in the process framework introduced in [Oreshkov, Costa, Brukner, Nat. Commun. 3, 1092 (2012)], which describes correlations between separate local experiments without a prior assumption of causal order between them. We consider the general multipartite case and take into account the possibility for dynamical causal order between the local experiments. Starting from a general definition of causality, we derive an iteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal processes, and show that for a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each party, the respective probabilities form a polytope whose facets define causal inequalities. In the case of quantum processes, we investigate the link between causality and the theory-dependent notion of causal separability, which we here extend to the multipartite case based on concrete principles. We show that causality and causal separability are not equivalent in the multipartite case by giving an example of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal but not causally separable. We also show that there exist causally separable (and hence causal) quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by supplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly causally separable processes, for which the respective property remains invariant under extension. We fully characterize the class of extensibly causally separable processes in terms of simple conditions on the form of the process matrix, which generalize the form of bipartite causally separable process matrices. We show that the processes realizable by classically controlled quantum circuits are extensibly causally separable and conjecture that the reverse also holds.

abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV-) color centers in diamond are a prime candidate for use in quantum information devices, owing to their spin-1 ground state, straightforward optical initialization and readout, and long intrinsic coherence times in a room-temperature solid. While the 13C nuclear spin is often a dominant source of magnetic noise, we observe transitions between electron-nuclear hyperfine states of NV- centers in 99% 13C diamond that are robust to decoherence. At magnetic field strengths ranging from 550 - 900 G, these transitions are observable by optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), and exhibit linewidths narrowed by factors as high as ~130 at room temperature over typical electron-type transitions observed from this spin system. We anticipate the use of these decoherence-protected transitions, in combination with dynamical decoupling methods, for storage of quantum information.

abstract: A PhD student is locked inside a box, imitating a quantum system by mimicking the measurement statistics of any viable observable nominated by external observers. Inside a second box lies a genuine quantum system. Either box can be used to pass a test for contextuality - and from the perspective of an external observer, be operationally indistinguishable. There is no way to discriminate between the two boxes based on the output statistics of any contextuality test. This poses a serious problem for contextuality tests to be used as viable tests for device independent quantumness, and severely limits realistic use of contextuality as an operational resource. Here we rectify this problem by building experimental techniques for distinguishing a contextual system that is genuinely quantum, and one that mimics it through clever use of hidden variables.

abstract: Quantum mechanics, one of the most successful theories in the history of science, was created to account for physical systems not describable by classical physics. Though it is consistent with all experiments conducted thus far, many of its core concepts (amplitudes, global phases, etc.) can not be directly accessed and its interpretation is still the subject of intense debate, more than 100 years since it was introduced. So, a fundamental question is why this particular mathematical model is the one that nature chooses, if indeed it is the correct model. In the past two decades there has been a renewed effort to determine what physical or informational principles define quantum mechanics. In this paper, recent attempts at establishing reasonable physical principles are reviewed and their degree of success is tabulated. An alternative approach using joint quasi-probability distributions is shown to provide a common basis of representing most of the proposed principles. It is argued that having a common representation of the principles can provide intuition and guidance to relate current principles or advance new principles. The current state of affairs, along with some alternative views are discussed.

The criterion involves only local measurements on some complementary observables and can be experimentally implemented. It is also a necessary condition for fully separability of multiqubit states. Moreover, by proving the optimality of teleportation witnesses, we solve the open problem in [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 86}, 032315 (2012)].

abstract: A conventional quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs not only at zero temperature, but also exhibits finite-temperature quantum criticality. Motivated by the discovery of the pseudo-Hermiticity of non-Hermitian systems, we explore the finite-temperature quantum criticality in a non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Ising model. We present the complete set of exact eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, based on which the mixed-state fidelity in the context of biorthogonal bases is calculated. Analytical and numerical results show that the fidelity approach to finite-temperature QPT can be extended to the non-Hermitian Ising model. This paves the way for experimental detection of quantum criticality in a complex-parameter plane.

abstract: The study of optomechanical systems has attracted much attention, most of which are concentrated in the physics in the small-amplitude regime. While in this article, we focus on optomechanics in the extremely-large-amplitude regime and consider both classical and quantum dynamics. Firstly, we study classical dynamics in a membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system in which a partially reflecting and flexible membrane is suspended inside an optical cavity. We show that the membrane can present self-sustained oscillations with limit cycles in the shape of sawtooth-edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability. Then, we study the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around the classical orbits. By using the logarithmic negativity, we calculate the evolution of the quantum entanglement between the optical cavity mode and the membrane during the mechanical oscillation. We show that there is some synchronism between the classical dynamical process and the evolution of the quantum entanglement.

abstract: We propose a scheme in which broadband nanostructures allow to generate squeezed light and entanglement of quantum emitters that are extremely far detuned. It is shown that the reduced fluctuations of the electromagnetic field arising from collective resonance fluorescence provide also a means to detect the entanglement between the emitters. Due to the near-field enhancement in the proposed hybrid systems, these nonclassical effects can be encountered outside both the extremely close separations limiting the observation in free space and narrow frequency bands in high-Q cavities. Our approach permits to overcome the limitations of noninteracting single emitters and is more robust against phase decoherence induced by the environment.

abstract: We simulate the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to the single resonating mode of a metal nano-particle. Systems like this are known as metamolecules. In this study, we consider a time-dependent driving field acting onto the metamolecule. We use the Heisenberg equations of motion for the entire system, while representing the resonating mode in Wigner phase space. A time-dependent basis is adopted for the quantum dot. We integrate the dynamics of the metamolecule for a range of coupling strengths between the quantum dot and the driving field, while restricting the coupling between the quantum dot and the resonant mode to weak values. By monitoring the average of the time variation of the energy of the metamolecule model, as well as the coherence and the population difference of the quantum dot, we observe distinct non-linear behavior in the case of strong coupling to the driving field.

abstract: In this paper we describe a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the language of quantum optics. We go on to model the Fabry-Perot interferometer as a beam splitter having frequency dependent transmissivity and reflectivity coefficients. The antibunching, a totally non-classical effect, is to be expected if one excites this interferometer with carefully frequency-selected single photons arriving simultaneously from opposite directions. Contrary to a normal beam splitter, even slightly different frequency single photons should be able to show this effect, as long as the photon counters are not frequency selective.

abstract: We consider the coupling of a qubit in a pure state to an environment in an arbitrary state, and characterize the possibility of qubit-environment entanglement generation during the evolution of the joint system, that leads to pure dephasing of the qubit. We give a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the initial density matrix of the environment together with the properties of the interaction, for appearance of qubit-environment entanglement. Any entanglement created turns out to be detectable by the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Furthermore, we show that for a large family of initial environmental states, the appearance of nonzero entanglement with the environment is necessarily accompanied by a change in the state of the environment (i.e. by the back-action of the qubit).

abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are useful in a number of research areas. The symmetry of MUB is an elusive and interesting subject. A (complete set of) MUB in dimension $d$ is sharply covariant if it can be generated by a group of order $d(d+1)$ from a basis state. Such MUB, if they exist, would be most appealing to theoretical studies and practical applications. Unfortunately, they seem to be quite rare. Here we prove that no MUB in odd prime dimensions is sharply covariant, by virtue of clever applications of Mersenne primes, Galois fields, and Frobenius groups. This conclusion provides valuable insight about the symmetry of MUB and the geometry of quantum state space. It complements and strengthens the earlier result of the author that only two stabilizer MUB are sharply covariant. Our study leads to the conjecture that no MUB other than those in dimensions 2 and 4 is sharply covariant.

abstract: The question whether global entanglement of a multiparticle quantum system can be inferred from local properties is of great relevance for the theory of quantum correlations as well as for experimental implementations. We present a method to systematically find quantum states, for which the two- or three-body marginals do not contain any entanglement, nevertheless, the knowledge of these reduced states is sufficient to prove genuine multiparticle entanglement of the global state. Our method shows that the emergence of global entanglement from separable local quantum states occurs frequently in various scenarios. Finally, we present examples where global entanglement can be proven from marginals, even if entanglement cannot be localized in the marginals with measurements on the other parties.

They also assert that Bell presented these two different versions at different times. This view is clearly at odds with the detailed explanation that Bell himself gave in his later writings. A careful examination of the historic 1964 paper in context shows clearly that Bell's own later interpretation is the correct one.

abstract: Optomechanics concerns with the coupling between optical cavities and mechanical resonators. Most early works are concentrated in the physics of optomechanics in the small-displacement regime and consider one single optical cavity mode participating in the optomechanical coupling. In this paper, we focus on optomechanics in the extremely-large-amplitude regime in which a mechanical resonator is coupled with multiple optical cavity modes during the oscillation. We explicitly show that the mechanical resonator can present self-sustained oscillations in a novel way with limit cycles in the shape of sawtooth-edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability. By analyzing the mechanical oscillation process and the accompanied variation of the optical cavity occupation, we develop an energy-balanced condition to ensure the stability of self-sustained oscillation. The effect of the mechanical nonlinearities on the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is also investigated.

Two of them are based on complex rotation of the coordinates and diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix (CRLM and CRCH). The other one is based on the Riccati equations for the logarithmic derivatives of factors of the wavefunction (RPM). The latter approach enabled us to obtain the most accurate results and extremely sharp resonances.

We implement this in an array of three superconducting transmon qubits coupled to a single cavity mode; the transmons represent lattice sites and their excitation quanta embody bosonic particles. Our cooling protocol preserves particle number--realizing a canonical ensemble-- and also affords the efficient preparation of dark states which, due to symmetry, cannot be prepared via coherent drives on the cavity. Furthermore, by applying continuous microwave radiation, we also realize autonomous feedback to indefinitely stabilize particular eigenstates of the array.

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has approached the limit of single molecule sensitivity, however the spectral resolution is currently insufficient to obtain detailed information on chemical structure and molecular interactions. Here we demonstrate more than two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolution by performing correlation spectroscopy with shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetic sensors in diamond. In principle, the resolution is sufficient to observe chemical shifts in $\sim$1 T magnetic fields, and is currently limited by molecular diffusion at the surface. We measure oil diffusion rates of $D = 0.15 - 0.2$\,nm$^2/\mathrm{\mu}$s within (5 nm)$^3$ volumes at the diamond surface.

We model the lineshape and our results imply a large state-dependent coupling to the trapping potential. Rydberg ions are of great interest for future applications in quantum computing and simulation, in which large dipolar interactions are combined with the superb experimental control offered by Paul traps.

abstract: We extend the theory of matter-wave interferometry of point-like particles to non-spherical objects by taking the orientational degrees of freedom into account. In particular, we derive the grating transformation operator, that maps the impinging state onto the outgoing state, for a general, orientation-dependent interaction potential between the grating and the molecule. The grating operator is then worked out for the diffraction of symmetric top molecules from standing light waves, and the resulting interference pattern is calculated in the near-field. This allows us to identify a signature of the orientational degrees of freedom in near-field matter-wave experiments.

abstract: Strong interactions between single spins and photons are essential for quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. They provide the necessary interface for entanglement distribution, non-destructive quantum measurements, and strong photon-photon interactions. Achieving a spin-photon interface in a solid-state device could enable compact chip-integrated quantum circuits operating at gigahertz bandwidths. Many theoretical works have suggested using nanophotonic structures to attain this high-speed interface. These proposals exploit strong light-matter interactions to coherently switch a photon with a single spin embedded in a nanoscale cavity or waveguide. However, to date such an interface has not been experimentally realized using a solid-state spin system. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a nanophotonic spin-photon quantum interface operating on picosecond timescales, where a single solid-state spin controls the quantum state of a photon and a single photon controls the state of the spin. We utilize an optical nano-cavity strongly coupled to a charged quantum dot containing a single trapped spin. We show that the spin-state strongly modulates the cavity reflection coefficient, which conditionally flips the polarization state of a reflected photon. We also demonstrate the complementary effect where a single photon applies a \pi\ phase shift on one of the spin-states, thereby coherently rotating the spin. These results demonstrate a spin-photon quantum phase gate that retains phase coherence, an essential requirement for quantum information applications. Our results open up a promising direction for solid-state implementations of quantum networks and quantum computers operating at gigahertz bandwidths.

abstract: Cavity-based large scale quantum information processing (QIP) may involve multiple cavities and require performing various quantum logic operations on qubits distributed in different cavities. Geometric-phase-based quantum computing has drawn much attention recently, which offers advantages against inaccuracies and local fluctuations. In addition, multiqubit gates are particularly appealing and play important roles in QIP. We here present a simple and efficient scheme for realizing a multi-target-qubit unconventional geometric phase gate in a multi-cavity system. This multiqubit phase gate has a common control qubit but different target qubits distributed in different cavities, which can be achieved using a single-step operation. The gate operation time is independent of the number of qubits and only two levels for each qubit are needed. This multiqubit gate is generic, e.g., by performing single-qubit operations, it can be converted into two types of significant multi-target-qubit phase gates useful in QIP and quantum Fourier transform. The proposal is quite general, which can be used to accomplish the same task for a general type of qubits such as atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, and qubits.

In particular, we illustrate with numerical simulations on a semiconductor device how this technique can be used to engineer and characterize arbitrary states of the frequency and time degrees of freedom.

abstract: Important tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics include the generation and control of quantum states of spatially-separated particles distributed in different cavities. An interesting question in this context is how to prepare entanglement among particles located in different cavities, which are important for large-scale quantum information processing. We here consider a multi-cavity system where cavities are coupled to a superconducting (SC) qubit and each cavity hosts many SC qubits. We show that all intra-cavity SC qubits plus the coupler SC qubit can be prepared in an entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, by using a single operation and without the need of measurements. The GHZ state is created without exciting the cavity modes; thus greatly suppressing the decoherence caused by the cavity-photon decay and the effect of unwanted inter-cavity crosstalk on the operation. We also introduce two simple methods for entangling the intra-cavity SC qubits in a GHZ state. As an example, our numerical simulations show that it is feasible, with current circuit-QED technology, to prepare high-fidelity GHZ states, for up to nine SC qubits by using SC qubits distributed in two cavities. This proposal can in principle be used to implement a GHZ state for {\it an arbitrary number} of SC qubits distributed in multiple cavities. The proposal is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems, with the intra-cavity qubits being either atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, or various SC qubits.

abstract: Photons of a laser beam driving the upper motional sideband of an optomechanical cavity can decay into photon-phonon pairs by means of an optomechanical parametric process. The phononic state can subsequently be mapped to a photonic state by exciting the lower sideband, hence creating photon-photon pairs out of an optomechanical system. We here demonstrate that these pairs can violate a Bell inequality when they are measured with photon counting techniques preceded by small displacement operations in the phase space. Our results show how to detect non-local light-mechanical correlations and open the way for device-independent quantum optomechanics where non-classical light-mechanical correlations can be certified without assumptions on the state structure or on the measurement devices.

abstract: We consider estimating the parameter associated with the qubit depolarizing channel when the available initial states that might be employed are mixed. We use quantum Fisher information as a measure of the accuracy of estimation to compare protocols which use collections of qubits in product states to one in which the qubits are in a correlated state. We show that, for certain parameter values and initial states, the correlated state protocol can yield a greater accuracy per channel invocation than the product state protocols. We show that, for some parameters and initial states, using more than two qubits and channel invocations is advantageous. These results stand in contrast to the known optimal case that uses pure initial states and a single channel invocation on a pair of entangled qubits.

abstract: Random unitary matrices find a number of applications in quantum information science, and are central to the recently defined boson sampling algorithm for photons in linear optics. We describe an operationally simple method to directly implement Haar random unitary matrices on optical circuits, with no requirement for prior or explicit matrix calculations. Our physically-motivated and compact representation directly maps independent probability density functions for parameters in Haar random unitary matrices, to optical circuit components. We go on to extend the results to the case of random unitaries for qubits.

abstract: In the present study, time evolution of quantum Cramer-Rao bound of entangled N00N state, as phase sensitivity, is determined by the aid of quantum estimation theory in the presence decoherence channels. Also, the dynamic quantum process as decoherence approach is characterized by quantum fisher information flow and entanglement amount in order to distinguish between Markovian and Non-Markovian process. The comparison between quantum fisher information and quantum fisher information flow assists to comprehend the phase sensitivity evolution corresponding to Non-Markovian and Markovian process. Furthermore, as result of backflow of information from the environment to system, the phase sensitivity corresponding memory effect of environment are revived after complete decay and increase in the few times.

abstract: We show that, Four wave mixing (FWM) processes of grating can be controlled by the presence of interactions with a quantum dot or a molecule made by coupled quantum dots. By choosing the appropriate level spacing for the quantum emitter, one can either suppress or enhance the Four wave mixing process. We revel theoretically the underlying mechanism for this effect. (i) Suppression in FWM intensity occurs simply because induced Electromagnetic Induced Transparency does not allow the excitation at converted FWM frequency. (ii) Enhancement emerges since FWM process can be brought to resonance. Path interference effect cancels the nonresonant frequency terms. Furthermore, we have also shown that in case of coupled quantum dots enhancement increases significantly as compared to the case of a single quantum dot.

abstract: Exploring the fundamental quantum behaviour of optomechanical resonators is of great interest recently but requires the realization of the strong coupling regime. We study the optical photon-phonon coupling of the so-called membrane in the middle (MITM) optomechanical system. Using coupled-mode theory we find that the optomechanical coupling is proportional to the electric susceptibility of the membrane. By considering the doping atoms or spins into the membrane and driving these appropriately we induce a tunable ultra-large refractive index without absorption which enhances the optomechanical coupling. Using this we predict an ultra-strong single-optical photon strong coupling with large quantum cooperativity for Er3+ dopants at low temperature, while Cr3+ in a Ruby membrane may display ultra-large quantum cooperativity at room temperature. Our scheme also can tune the strength of the coupling over a wide range and can also control whether the optomechanical force is attractive or repulsive. Our work opens a door for fundamental physics and applications relying on the realization of the strong coupling regime in quantum optomechanical systems.

abstract: Detecting a single photon without absorbing it is a long standing challenge in quantum optics. All experiments demonstrating the nondestructive detection of a photon make use of a high quality cavity. We present a cavity free scheme for nondestructive single-photon detection. By pumping a nonlinear medium we implement an inter-field Rabi-oscillation which leads to a ?pi phase shift on weak probe coherent laser field in the presence of a single signal photon without destroying the signal photon. Our cavity-free scheme operates with a fast intrinsic time scale in comparison with similar cavity-based schemes. We implement a full real-space multimode numerical analysis of the interacting photonic modes and confirm the validity of our nondestructive scheme in the multimode case.

abstract: In modern circuit QED architectures, superconducting transmon qubits are measured via the state-dependent phase and amplitude shift of a microwave field leaking from a coupled resonator. Determining this shift requires integrating the field quadratures for a nonzero duration, which can permit unwanted concurrent evolution. Here we investigate such dynamical degradation of the measurement fidelity caused by a detuned neighboring qubit. We find that in realistic parameter regimes, where the qubit ensemble-dephasing rate is slower than the qubit-qubit detuning, the joint qubit-qubit eigenstates are better discriminated by measurement than the bare states. Furthermore, we show that when the resonator leaks much more slowly than the qubit-qubit detuning, the measurement tracks the joint eigenstates nearly adiabatically. However, the measurement process also causes rare quantum jumps between the eigenstates. The rate of these jumps becomes significant if the resonator decay is comparable to or faster than the qubit-qubit detuning, thus significantly degrading the measurement fidelity in a manner reminiscent of energy relaxation processes.

abstract: Complex quantum systems consisting of large numbers of strongly coupled states exhibit characteristic level repulsion, leading to a non-Poisson spacing distribution which can be described by Random Matrix Theory. Scattering resonances observed in ultracold atomic and molecular systems exhibit similar features as a consequence of their energy level structure. We study how the overlap between Feshbach resonances affects the distribution of resonance spacings. The spectrum of strongly overlapping resonances turns out to be non-Poisson even when the assumptions of Random Matrix Theory are not fulfilled, but the spectrum is also not completely chaotic and tends towards being semi-Poisson.

abstract: Scattering of beams of light and matter from multi-electron atomic targets is formulated in the position representation of quantum mechanics. This yields expressions for the probability amplitude, a(b), for a wide variety of processes. Here the spatial parameter b is the distance of closest approach of incoming particles traveling on a straight line with the center of the atomic target. The correlated probability amplitude, a(b), reduces to a relatively simple product of single electron probability amplitudes in the widely used independent electron approximation limit, where the correlation effects of the Coulomb interactions between the atomic electrons disappear. As an example in which a(b} has an explicit dependence on b}, we consider transversely finite vortex beams of twisted photons that lack the translational invariance of infinite plane-wave beams. Some experimental considerations and future applications are briefly considered.

abstract: It has been shown that there are not only transverse but also longitudinal couplings between microwave fields and a superconducting qubit with broken inversion symmetry of the potential energy. Using multiphoton processes induced by longitudinal coupling fields and frequency matching conditions, we design a universal algorithm to produce arbitrary superpositions of two-mode photon states of microwave fields in two separated transmission line resonators, which are coupled to a superconducting qubit. Based on our algorithm, we analyze the generation of evenly-populated states and NOON states. Compared to other proposals with only single-photon process, we provide an efficient way to produce entangled microwave states when the interactions between superconducting qubits and microwave fields are in the ultrastrong regime.

abstract: Several important measures of quantum correlations of a state of a finite-dimensional composite system are defined as linear combinations of marginal entropies of this state. This paper is devoted to the infinite-dimensional generalizations of such quantities and to the analysis of their properties. We introduce the notion of faithful extension of a linear combination of marginal entropies and consider several concrete examples starting with the quantum mutual information and the quantum conditional entropy. Then we show that the conditional mutual information can be uniquely defined as a lower semicontinuous function on the set of all states of a tripartite infinite-dimensional system possessing all the basic properties valid in finite dimensions. Infinite-dimensional generalizations of some other measures of quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems are also considered. It is shown that almost all of these generalized measures are globally lower semicontinuous and possess local continuity properties which essentially simplify their use in analysis of quantum systems. In the second part of the paper we consider applications of the general results of its first part, in particular, to the theory of infinite-dimensional quantum channels and their capacities. We also show the existence of the Fawzi-Renner recovery channel reproducing marginal states for all tripartite states (including states with infinite marginal entropies) starting with the corresponding finite-dimensional result.

abstract: We show a lower bound on expected communication cost of interactive entanglement assisted quantum state redistribution protocols and a slightly better lower bound for its special case, quantum state transfer. Our bound implies that the expected communication cost of interactive protocols is not significantly better than worst case communication cost, in terms of scaling of error. Furthermore, the bound is independent of the number of rounds. This is in contrast with the classical case, where protocols with expected communication cost significantly better than worst case communication cost are known.

abstract: We present experimental results on two-qubit Rydberg blockade quantum gates and entanglement in a two-dimensional qubit array. Without post selection against atom loss we achieve a Bell state fidelity of $0.73\pm 0.05$, the highest value reported to date. The experiments are performed in an array of single Cs atom qubits with a site to site spacing of $3.8 ~ \mu\rm m$. Using the standard protocol for a Rydberg blockade C$_Z$ gate together with single qubit operations we create Bell states and measure their fidelity using parity oscillations. We analyze the role of AC Stark shifts that occur when using two-photon Rydberg excitation and show how to tune experimental conditions for optimal gate fidelity.

abstract: We show that the class QMA does not change even if we restrict Arthur's computing ability to only Clifford gate operations (plus classical XOR gate). The idea is to use the fact that the preparation of certain single-qubit states, so called magic states, plus any Clifford gate operations are universal for quantum computing. If Merlin is honest, he sends the witness plus magic states to Arthur. If Merlin is malicious, he might send other states to Arthur, but Arthur can verify the correctness of magic states by himself. We also generalize the result to QIP[3]: we show that the class QIP[3] does not change even if the computational power of the verifier is restricted to only Clifford gate operations (plus classical XOR gate).

abstract: We study an analog of the well-known Gel'fand Pinsker Channel which uses quantum states for the transmission of the data. We consider the case where both the sender's inputs to the channel and the channel states are to be taken from a finite set (cq-channel with state information at the sender). We distinguish between causal and non-causal channel state information at the sender. The receiver remains ignorant, throughout. We give a single-letter description of the capacity in the first case. In the second case we present two different regularized expressions for the capacity. The direct part of this coding theorem is based on a special class of POVMs which are derived from orthogonal projections onto certain representations of the symmetric groups. This approach supports a reasoning that is inspired by the classical method of types.

abstract: We explore conditions on the covariance matrices of a consistent chain of mean zero finite mode Gaussian states in order that the chain may be exchangeable or stationary. For an exchangeable chain our conditions are necessary and sufficient. Every stationary Gaussian chain admits an asymptotic entropy rate. Whereas an exchangeable chain admits a simple expression for its entropy rate, in our examples of stationary chains the same admits an integral formula based on the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for Toeplitz matrices. An example of a stationary entangled Gaussian chain is given.

abstract: Typical sources of ultracold atoms operate with a considerable delay between the delivery of ensembles due to sequential trapping and cooling schemes. Therefore, alternative schemes for the continuous generation of ultracold atoms are highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate the continuous loading of a magnetic trap from a quasi-continuous atom beam. We achieve a steady state with $3.8 \times 10^7$ magnetically trapped atoms and a temperature of $102 \mu$K. The ensemble is protected from laser light sources, a requirement for its application for metrological tasks or sympathetic cooling. The continuous scheme is robust and applicable to a wide range of particles and trapping potentials.

abstract: We obtain a formula for the determinant of a block Toeplitz matrix associated with a quadratic fermionic chain with complex coupling. Such couplings break reflection symmetry and/or charge conjugation symmetry. We then apply this formula to compute the Renyi entropy of a partial observation to a subsystem consisting of $X$ contiguous sites in the limit of large $X$. The present work generalizes similar results due to Its, Jin, Korepin and Its, Mezzadri, Mo. A striking new feature of our formula for the entanglement entropy is the appearance of a term scaling with the logarithm of the size of $X$. This logarithmic behaviour originates from certain discontinuities in the symbol of the block Toeplitz matrix. Equipped with this formula we analyse the entanglement entropy of a Dzyaloshinski-Moriya spin chain and a Kitaev fermionic chain with long range pairing.

abstract: Propagating quantum microwaves have been proposed and successfully implemented to generate entanglement, thereby establishing a promising platform for the realisation of a quantum communication channel. However, the implementation of quantum teleportation with photons in the microwave regime is still absent. At the same time, recent developments in the field show that this key protocol could be feasible with current technology, which would pave the way to boost the field of microwave quantum communication. Here, we discuss the feasibility of a possible implementation of microwave quantum teleportation in a realistic scenario with losses. Furthermore, we propose how to implement quantum repeaters in the microwave regime without using photodetection, a key prerequisite to achieve long distance entanglement distribution.

abstract: The quantum-optical notion of the classical/nonclassical divide among states of light is naturally described in terms of the Glauber-Sudarshan diagonal `weight' function. Analogously, a demarcation exits between quantum-optical processes that output only classical states and those that do not, i.e., the nonclassicality breaking/non-nonclassicality breaking divide for channels. We exploit these divisions at the level of states and channels to quantify the nonclassicality depth of a multimode quantum-optical channel in terms of the following: what is the `minimal' additive classical noise channel, characterised by a noise matrix $Y$, that when composed with a general channel results in a nonclassicality breaking channel? We then extract a suitable scalar from $Y$ that we define as the nonclassicality depth of a quantum-optical channel. The approach also provides an operational interpretation for the nonclassicality depth of general multimode states. We compute the nonclassicality depth of a few practically relevant channels which include amplifiers and attenuators.

abstract: In a comment, Xu, Curty, Qi, Qian, and Lo claimed that discrete-variable (DV) measurement device independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) would compete with its continuous-variable (CV) counterpart at metropolitan distances. Actually, Xu et al.'s analysis supports exactly the opposite by showing that the experimental rate of our CV protocol (achieved with practical room-temperature devices) remains one order of magnitude higher than their purely-numerical and over-optimistic extrapolation for qubits, based on nearly-ideal parameters and cryogenic detectors (unsuitable solutions for a realistic metropolitan network, which is expected to run on cheap room-temperature devices, potentially even mobile). The experimental rate of our protocol (expressed as bits per relay use) is confirmed to be two-three orders of magnitude higher than the rate of any realistic simulation of practical DV-MDI-QKD over short-medium distances. Of course this does not mean that DV-MDI-QKD networks should not be investigated or built, but increasing their rate is a non-trivial practical problem clearly beyond the analysis of Xu et al. Finally, in order to clarify the facts, we also refute a series of incorrect arguments against CV-MDI-QKD and, more generally, CV-QKD, which were made by Xu et al. with the goal of supporting their thesis.

abstract: In a recent paper [arXiv:1502.06856] the authors studied numerically the hydrogen ground state in stochastic electrodynamics (SED) within the the non-relativistic approximation. In quantum theory the leading non-relativistic corrections to the ground state energy dominate the Lamb shift related to the photon cloud that should cause the quantum-like behaviour of SED. The present work takes these corrections into account in the numerical modelling. It is found that they have little effect; the self-ionisation that occurs without them remains present. It is speculated that the point-charge approximation for the electron is the cause of the failure.

abstract: We derive new characterizations of the matrix $\Phi$-entropies introduced in [Electron.~J.~Probab., 19(20): 1--30, 2014}]. These characterizations help to better understand the properties of matrix $\Phi$-entropies, and are a powerful tool for establishing matrix concentration inequalities for matrix-valued functions of independent random variables. In particular, we use the subadditivity property to prove a Poincar\'e inequality for the matrix $\Phi$-entropies. We also provide a new proof for the matrix Efron-Stein inequality. Furthermore, we derive logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for matrix-valued functions defined on Boolean hypercubes and with Gaussian distributions. Our proof relies on the powerful matrix Bonami-Beckner inequality. Finally, the Holevo quantity in quantum information theory is closely related to the matrix $\Phi$-entropies. This allows us to upper bound the Holevo quantity of a classical-quantum ensemble that undergoes a special Markov evolution.

abstract: Resonance fluorescence arises from the interaction of an optical field with a two-level system and has played a fundamental role in the development of quantum optics and its applications. Despite its conceptual simplicity it entails a wide range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet emission spectrum and coherent photon emission. One fundamental aspect of resonance fluorescence, reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon stream from an atom in free space, was predicted more than 30 years ago. However, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together with the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection efficiencies, has continued to cast stringent experimental conditions for the observation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to sacrifice antibunching due to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic ensembles or multiphoton transitions inside optical cavities. Here, we use an artificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of the photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart and reach the necessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single resonance-fluorescence photons. Implementing phase-dependent homodyne intensity-correlation detection, we demonstrate that the electric field quadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is 3\% below the fundamental limit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon statistics remain antibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching simultaneously is a fully nonclassical outcome of the wave-particle duality of photons.

abstract: A traditional heterodyne detector, as a phase-insensitive device, suffers the well-known 3 dB noise penalty caused by image sideband vacuum. In contrast, a heterodyne detector with a bichromatic local oscillator, as a phase-sensitive device, should be exempted from the 3 dB noise penalty, in spite of the existence of the image sideband vacuum. Assuming coherent light at the input, we develop in this work a theory to describe the quantum nature of the phase-sensitive heterodyne detector, in a good agreement with experiment. The absence of the quantum noise of the image vacuum modes in the heterodyne detector may be explained by that the studied detector senses only a single field of light, i.e., the signal field, according to the theory developed.

abstract: The maximally entangled state can be the mixed state form beside the well-known pure state case. As quantified by the negativity, we study the entanglement dynamics of bipartite mixed maximally entangled state (MMES) in multipartite cavity-reservoir systems. It is found that the MMES can exhibit the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death, which is quite different to the asymptotic decay of pure state case. Moreover, we find that the maximal entanglement cannot guarantee the maximal nonlocality. The measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) of MMES is not always the maximal, and its value and dynamical behavior are dependent on the mixed probability. In addition, we investigate the distributions of negativity and MIN in the multipartite system, where the two types of correlations have different monogamous properties in the dynamical procedure.

abstract: We study the effect of mode-coupling on a single-photon device in which a dipole-quantum-emitter (DQE) is embedded in a bimodal whispering-gallery-mode cavity (WGMC). A scatterer is used to induce mode coupling between counter-clockwise and clockwise propagating light fields, which interact with the DQE. In contrast to models for the interaction between a DQE and a (one-mode or two-mode) cavity field, we find that strong photon antibunching can occur even for a weak DQE-field coupling and large dephasing of the DQE, when mode coupling is introduced. We also find that mode coupling can make the device robust against either the frequency mismatch between cavity modes and the DQE or the coupling strength mismatch between the DQE and each mode in the two-mode cavity. Moreover, we find that these mismatches can be used to generate better antibunching in the weak DQE-field coupling regime. Our study shows that mode coupling in a bimodal cavity is very important for the realization of a good single-photon device.

abstract: These two accompanying papers treat two mode entanglement for systems of identical massive bosons and the relationship to spin squeezing and other quantum correlation effects. Entanglement is a key quantum feature of composite systems where the probabilities for joint measurements on the composite sub-systems are no longer determined from measurement probabilities on the separate sub-systems. We focus on the meaning of entanglement, the quantum paradoxes associated with entangled states, and important tests that allow an experimentalist to determine whether a quantum state - in particular, one for massive bosons is entangled. Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the symmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive particles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the conclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously demonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of identical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators must satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection rules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing particle numbers. We fully justify these requirements. In the second quantisation approach, both the system and sub-systems are modes (or sets of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different mode occupancies. In the accompanying review paper (II), we consider spin squeezing and other tests for entanglement for two-mode bosonic systems. Starting from paper (I) we determine which tests are useful for detecting entanglement in massive bosonic (BEC), as opposed to photonic, systems. Several new inequalities are derived, and recent key experiments are analysed.

abstract: Since several years the preparation and manipulation of a small number of quantum systems in a controlled and coherent way is feasible in many experiments. In fact, these experiments are nowadays commonly used for quantum simulation and quantum computation. As recently shown, such a system can, however, also be utilized to simulate specific behaviors of exponentially larger systems. That is, certain quantum computations can be performed by an exponentially smaller quantum computer. This compressed quantum computation can be employed to observe for instance the quantum phase transition of the 1D XY-model using very few qubits. We extend here this notion to simulate the behavior of thermal as well as excited states of the 1D XY-model. In particular, we consider the 1D XY-model of a spin chain of n qubits and derive a quantum circuit processing only $\mathrm{log}(n)$ qubits which simulates the original system. We demonstrate how the behavior of thermal as well as any eigenstate of the system can be efficiently simulated in this compressed fashion and present a quantum circuit on $\mathrm{log}(n)$ qubits to measure the magnetization, the number of kinks, and correlations occurring in the thermal as well as any excited state of the original systems. Moreover we derive compressed circuits to study time evolutions.

abstract: The Coupled Cluster (CC) and full CI expansions are studied for three fermions with six and seven modes. Surprisingly the CC expansion is tailor made to characterize the usual SLOCC entanglement classes. It means that the notion of a SLOCC transformation shows up quite naturally as a one relating the CC and CI expansions, and going from the CI expansion to the CC one is equivalent to obtaining a form for the state where the structure of the entanglement classes is transparent. In this picture entanglement is characterized by the parameters of the cluster operators describing transitions from occupied states to singles, doubles and triples of non occupied ones. Using the CC parametrization of states in the seven mode case we give a simple formula for the unique SLOCC invariant $\mathcal{J}$. Then we consider a perturbation problem featuring a state from the unique SLOCC class characterized by $\mathcal{J}\neq 0$. For this state with entanglement generated by doubles we investigate the phenomenon of changing the entanglement type due to the perturbing effect of triples. We show that there are states with real amplitudes such that their entanglement encoded into configurations of clusters of doubles is protected from errors generated by triples.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of entanglement given by the concurrence of a two-qubit system in the non-Markovian setting. A quantum master equation is derived which is solved in the eigen basis of the system Hamiltonian for X-type initial states. A closed formula for time evolution of concurrence is presented for a pure state. It is shown that under the influence of dissipation that non-zero entanglement is created in unentangled two qubit states which decay in the same way as pure entangled states. We also show that under real circumstances, the decay rate of concurrence is strongly modified by the non-Markovinity of the evolution.

abstract: The ac Stark shift in the presence of spontaneous decay is typically considered to induce an effective dephasing with a scattering rate equal to $ \Gamma_s |\Omega|^2/\Delta^2 $, where $ \Gamma_s $ is the spontaneous decay rate, $ \Omega $ is the laser transition coupling, and $ \Delta $ is the detuning. We show that under realistic circumstances this dephasing rate may be strongly modifed due to non-Markovian behavior. The non-Markovian behavior arises due to an effective modification of the light-atom coupling in the presence of the ac Stark shift laser. An analytical formula for the non-Markovian ac Stark shift induced dephasing is derived. We obtain that for narrow laser linewidths the effective dephasing rate is suppressed by a factor of $ Q^2$, where $ Q $ is the quality factor of the laser.

abstract: In the absence of any efficient classical schemes for verifying a universal quantum computer, the importance of limiting the required quantum resources for this task has been highlighted recently. Currently, most of efficient quantum verification protocols are based on cryptographic techniques where an almost classical verifier executes her desired encrypted quantum computation remotely on an untrusted quantum prover. In this work we present a new protocol for quantum verification by incorporating existing techniques in a non-standard composition to reduce the required quantum communications between the verifier and the prover.

abstract: Robustness of edge states and non-Abelian excitations of topological states of matter promises quantum memory and quantum processing, which is naturally immune against microscopic imperfections such as static disorder. However, topological properties will not in general protect quantum system from time-dependent disorder or noise. Here we take the example of a network of Kitaev wires with Majorana edge modes storing qubits to investigate the effects of classical noise in the crossover from the quasi-static to the fast fluctuation regime. We present detailed results for the Majorana edge correlations, and fidelity of braiding operations for both global and local noise sources preserving parity symmetry, such as random chemical potentials and phase fluctuations. While in general noise will induce heating and dephasing, we identify examples of long-lived quantum correlations in presence of fast noise due to motional narrowing, where external noise drives the system rapidly between the topological and non-topological phases.

abstract: The 'disentanglement eraser' or 'entanglement restorer' scheme allows retrieving entanglement by erasing the information about the formation of a classical (or separable) state. It suggests an analogy between the pairs of properties: entangled-separable and wave-particle, the latter as described in the 'quantum eraser'. The scheme illustrates the physical importance of information in quantum systems, and it is also useful as a building block for quantum computation. An optical setup for its simple implementation using three-photon decay in a centro-symmetrical crystal is proposed.

abstract: We use a recently discovered constrained de Finetti reduction (aka "Post-Selection Lemma") to study the parallel repetition of multi-player non-local games under no-signalling strategies. Since the technique allows us to reduce general strategies to independent plays, we obtain parallel repetition (corresponding to winning all rounds) in the same way as exponential concentration of the probability to win a fraction larger than the value of the game. Our proof technique leads us naturally to a relaxation of no-signalling (NS) strategies, which we dub sub-no-signalling (SNOS). While for two players the two concepts coincide, they differ for three or more players. Our results are most complete and satisfying for arbitrary number of sub-no-signalling players, where we get universal parallel repetition and concentration for any game, while the no-signalling case is obtained as a corollary, but only for games with "full support".

abstract: When a non-relativistic particle interacts with a scalar quantum field, the standard perturbation theory leads to the dependence of the energy of its ground state on an undefined parameter---"momentum cut-off"---due to the ultraviolet divergence. We show that the use of non-asymptotic states of the system results in a calculation scheme in which all observable quantities remain finite and continuously depend on the coupling constant without any additional parameters. It is furthermore demonstrated that the divergence of traditional perturbation series is caused by the energy being a function with a logarithmic singularity for small values of the coupling constant.

abstract: We present an experiment using a sample of laser-cooled Rb atoms to show that cross-phase modulation schemes continue to benefit from electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) even as the transparency window is made narrower than the signal bandwidth (i.e., for signal pulses much shorter than the response time of the EIT system). Addressing concerns that narrow EIT windows might not prove useful for such applications, we show that while the peak phase shift saturates in this regime, it does not drop, and the time-integrated effect continues to scale inversely with EIT window width. This integrated phase shift is an important figure of merit for tasks such as the detection of single-photon-induced cross phase shifts.

abstract: Coupling light to Rydberg states of atoms under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leads to the formation of strongly interacting quasi-particles, termed Rydberg polaritons. We derive a one-dimensional model describing the time evolution of these polaritons under paraxial propagation conditions, which we verify by numerical two-excitation simulations. We determine conditions allowing for a description by an effective Hamiltonian of a single-species polariton, and calculate ground-state correlations by use of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Under typical stationary slow-light EIT conditions it is difficult to reach the strongly interacting regime where the interaction energy dominates the kinetic energy. We show that by employing time dependence of the control field the regime of strong interactions can be reached where the polaritons attain quasi crystalline order. We analyze the dynamics and resulting correlations for a translational invariant system in terms of a time-dependent Luttinger liquid theory and exact few-particle simulations and address the effects of nonadiabatic corrections and initial excitations.

abstract: A pseudo-telepathy game is a nonlocal game which can be won with probability one using some finite-dimensional quantum strategy but not using a classical one. Our central question is whether there exist two-party pseudo-telepathy games which cannot be won with probability one using a maximally entangled state. Towards answering this question, we develop conditions under which maximally entangled states suffice. In particular, we show that maximally entangled states suffice for weak projection games which we introduce as a relaxation of projection games. Our results also imply that any pseudo-telepathy weak projection game yields a device-independent certification of a maximally entangled state. In particular, by establishing connections to the setting of communication complexity, we exhibit a class of games $G_n$ for testing maximally entangled states of local dimension $\Omega(n)$. We leave the robustness of these self-tests as an open question.

abstract: We employ a more realistic treatment to investigate the entropy and the excitation-inversion of a coupled system that consists of a nanomechanical resonator and a superconducting Cooper pair box. The procedure uses the Buck-Sukumar model in the microwave domain, considers the nanoresonator with a time dependent frequency and both subsystems in the presence of losses. Interesting results were found for the temporal evolutions of the entropy of each subsystem and of the excitation-inversion in the Cooper pair box. A comparison was also performed about which of these two subsystems is more sensitive to the presence of losses. The results suggest that appropriate choices of the involved time dependent parameters allow us to monitor these two features of the subsystems and may offer potential applications, e.g., in the generation of nonclassical states, quantum communication, quantum lithography.

abstract: We consider two inertia frames, including the lab and moving frames, connected to each other by a Lorentz transformation. Thereinafter, we point to a one spin$-1/2$ particle system and study the effects of Lorentz transformation on its state. Moreover, we address the predictions made by Czachor's and the Pauli spin operators about the spin behavior and compare results with the behavior of system state under Lorentz transformation. This investigation shows that the predictions made by considering the Pauli spin operator about the spin of system are in better agreement with the system state compared with those of made by considering Czachor's spin operator. In continue, we focus on two-particle pure entangled systems including two spin$-1/2$ particles which moves away from each other. Once again, we investigate the behavior of system state under Lorentz transformation. We also point to the behavior of Bell's inequality, as a witness for non-locality, under Lorentz transformation. Our study shows that the Bell operator made by the Pauli operator has better consistency with the behavior of spin state of system under Lorentz transformation compared with the Bell operator made by Czachor's operator. Our approach may also be used to study the relation between the various spin operators and the effects of Lorentz transformation on system, helping us get some predictions about the outcome of a Stern-Gerlach type experiment in relativistic situations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.07108
abstract: We show that there exists a class of finite-range model potentials that may be useful for describing resonant interactions with large scattering length at low energy. They are expressed in terms of the effective range $r_0$ and the $s$-wave scattering length $a_s$. The mathematical expression of the potential $V_+(r)$ with positive $a_s$ is different from that of the potential $V_{-}(r)$ with negative $a_s$. However, both reduce to the same form $V_{\infty}$ in the unitarity limits $a_s \rightarrow \pm \infty$. We derive scattering and bound-sate solutions of these potentials. By writing $V_{\pm}(r) = V^{{\rm PT}}(r) + V_{\pm}^{\epsilon}(r)$, where $ V^{{\rm PT}}(r)$ is of the form of P\"{o}schl-Teller potential and $V_{\pm}^{\epsilon}$ is expressed as a power series of the small parameter $\epsilon = (\sqrt{1 - 2 r_0/a_s})^{-1} - 1 $ when $a_s$ is large, we derive Green function of $V^{{\rm PT}}(r)$ and thereby develop a perturbative method to obtain scattering solution of $V_{\pm}(r)$ as a power series in $\epsilon$. We describe the threshold behavior of scattering phase shift $\delta_0$ in the unitarity limits and establish the connection of $\delta_0$ with the strength of the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential. This study may be important for developing an accurate description or better understanding of physics of strongly interacting ultracold atomic gases with tunable interactions.

abstract: The uncertainty principle, which states that certain sets of quantum-mechanical measurements have a minimal joint uncertainty, has many applications in quantum cryptography. But in such applications, it is important to consider the effect of a (sometimes adversarially controlled) memory that can be correlated with the system being measured: The information retained by such a memory can in fact diminish the uncertainty of measurements. Uncertainty conditioned on a memory was considered in the past by Berta et al. (Ref. 1), who found a specific uncertainty relation in terms of the von Neumann conditional entropy. But this entropy is not the only measure that can be used to quantify conditional uncertainty. In the spirit of recent work by several groups (Refs. 2--6), here we develop a general operational framework that formalizes the concept of conditional uncertainty in a measure-independent form. Our formalism is built around a mathematical relation that we call conditional majorization. We define and characterize conditional majorization, and use it to develop tools for the construction of measures of the conditional uncertainty of individual measurements, and also of the joint conditional uncertainty of sets of measurements. We demonstrate the use of this framework by deriving measure-independent conditional uncertainty relations of two types: (1) A lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that two remote parties (Bob and Eve) have about the outcome of a given pair of measurements performed by a third remote party (Alice), conditioned on arbitrary measurements that Bob and Eve make on their own systems. This lower bound is independent of the initial state shared by the three parties; (2) An initial state--dependent lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that Bob has about Alice's pair of measurements in a bipartite setting, conditioned on Bob's quantum system.

abstract: Here, we study the capacity of a quantum channel, assuming linear optical encoding, as a function of available photons and optical modes. First, we observe that substantial improvement is made possible by not restricting ourselves to a rail-encoded qubit basis. Then, we derive an analytic formula for general channel capacity and show that this capacity is achieved without requiring the use of entangling operations typically required for scalable universal quantum computation, e.g. KLM measurement-assisted transformations. As an example, we provide an explicit encoding scheme using the resources required of standard dense coding using two dual-rail qubits (2 photons in 4 modes). In this case, our protocol encodes one additional bit of information. Greater gains are expected for larger systems.

Realization of such a concept requires precise control of the electron wave front. Based on a diffractive electron optical implementation, we demonstrate the feasibility of this new method by both experimental and numerical investigations.

abstract: We study the non-degenerate optical parametric oscillator in a planar interferometer near threshold, where critical phenomena are expected. These phenomena are associated with the dynamics of two non-commuting quadratures of each mode of the oscillator field. We obtain a universal form for the equation describing this system, which allows a comparison with other phase transitions. We find that the unsqueezed quadratures of this system correspond to a two-dimensional XY type model with a tricritical Lifshitz point. This leaves open the possibility of a controlled experimental investigation into this unusual class of statistical models. We evaluate the correlations of the unsqueezed quadrature using both an exact numerical simulation and a Gaussian approximation, and obtain an accurate numerical calculation of the non-Gaussian correlations.

abstract: Spectral measurements in the infrared (IR) optical range provide unique fingerprints of materials which are useful for material analysis, environmental sensing, and health diagnostics. Current IR spectroscopy techniques require the use of optical equipment suited for operation in the IR range, which faces challenges of inferior performance and high cost. Here we develop a spectroscopy technique, which allows spectral measurements in the IR range using visible spectral range components. The technique is based on nonlinear interference of infrared and visible photons, produced via Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC). The intensity interference pattern for a visible photon depends on the phase of an IR photon, which travels through the media. This allows determining properties of the media in the IR range from the measurements of visible photons. The technique can substitute and/or complement conventional IR spectroscopy techniques, as it uses well-developed optical components for the visible range.

abstract: Nonlinearity in macroscopic mechanical system plays a crucial role in a wide variety of applications, including signal transduction and processing, synchronization, and building logical devices. However, it is difficult to generate nonlinearity due to the fact that macroscopic mechanical systems follow the Hooke's law and response linearly to external force, unless strong drive is used. Here we propose and experimentally realize a record-high nonlinear response in macroscopic mechanical system by exploring the anharmonicity in deforming a single chemical bond. We then demonstrate the tunability of nonlinear response by precisely controlling the chemical bonding interaction, and realize a cubic elastic constant of \mathversion{bold}$2 \times 10^{18}~{\rm N}/{\rm m^3}$, many orders of magnitude larger in strength than reported previously. This enables us to observe vibrational bistate transitions of the resonator driven by the weak Brownian thermal noise at 6~K. This method can be flexibly applied to a variety of mechanical systems to improve nonlinear responses, and can be used, with further improvements, to explore macroscopic quantum mechanics.

An important feature of such an equation is that it allows to treat not only absorption and emission of quanta, but also scattering processes, which however had very few applications in physical modelling. Moreover, recent developments have shown that also some non-Markovian dynamics can be generated by suitable choices of the state of the quantum noises involved in the HP-equation. This paper is devoted to an application involving these two features, non-Markovianity and scattering process. We consider a micro-mirror mounted on a vibrating structure and reflecting a laser beam, a process giving rise to a radiation-pressure force on the mirror. We show that this process needs the scattering part of the HP-equation to be described. On the other side, non-Markovianity is introduced by the dissipation due to the interaction with some thermal environment which we represent by a phonon field, with a nearly arbitrary excitation spectrum, and by the introduction of phase noise in the laser beam. Finally, we study the full power spectrum of the reflected light and we show how the laser beam can be used as a temperature probe.

abstract: Under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), quantum-quenched systems equilibrate towards canonical, thermal ensembles. While at first glance the ETH might seem a very strong hypothesis, we show that it is indeed not only sufficient but also necessary for thermalization. More specifically, we consider systems coupled to baths with well-defined macroscopic temperature and show that whenever all product states thermalize then the ETH must hold.

abstract: Quantum theory is based on a mathematical structure totally different from conventional arithmetic. Due to the symmetric nature of bosonic particles, annihilation or creation of single particles translates a quantum state depending on how many bosons are already in the given quantum system. This proportionality results in a variety of non-classical features of quantum mechanics including the bosonic commutation relation. The annihilation and creation operations have recently been implemented in photonic systems. However, this feature of quantum mechanics does not preclude the possibility of realizing conventional arithmetic in quantum systems. We implement conventional addition and subtraction of single phonons for a trapped \Yb ion in a harmonic potential. In order to realize such operations, we apply the transitionless adiabatic passage scheme on the anti-Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the internal energy states and external motion states of the ion. By performing the operations on superpositions of Fock states, we realize the hybrid computation of classical arithmetic in quantum parallelism, and show that our operations are useful to engineer quantum states. Our single-phonon operations are nearly deterministic and robust against parameter changes, enabling handy repetition of the operations independently from the initial state of the atomic motion. We demonstrate the transform of a classical state to a nonclassical one of highly sub-Poissonian phonon statistics and a Gaussian state to a non-Gaussian state, by applying a sequence of the operations. The operations implemented here are the Susskind-Glogower phase operators, whose non-commutativity is also demonstrated.

abstract: We introduce a concept of a minimal sufficient positive-operator valued measure (POVM), which is the least redundant POVM among the POVMs that have the equivalent information about the measured quantum system. Assuming the system Hilbert space to be separable, we show that for a given POVM a sufficient statistic called a Lehmann-Scheff\'{e}-Bahadur statistic induces a minimal sufficient POVM. We also show that when the outcome space of a POVM is a standard Borel space, there exists an equivalent minimal sufficient POVM and that such a POVM is unique up to relabeling neglecting null sets. We apply these results to discrete POVMs and information conservation conditions proposed by the author.

abstract: Spatio-spectral properties of twin beams at their transition from low to high intensities are analyzed in parametric and paraxial approximations using the decomposition into paired spatial and spectral modes. Intensity auto- and cross-correlation functions are determined and compared in the spectral and temporal domains as well as the transverse wave-vector and crystal output planes. Whereas the spectral, temporal and transverse wave-vector coherence increases with the increasing pump intensity, coherence in the crystal output plane is practically independent on the pump intensity owing to the mode structure in this plane. The corresponding auto- and cross-correlation functions approach each other for larger pump intensities. Entanglement dimensionality of a twin beam is determined comparing several approaches.

abstract: We study the directional properties of a radiation field emitted by a geometrically small system composed of two identical two-level emitters located at short distances and driven by an optical vortex beam, a Laguerre-Gaussian beam which possesses a structured phase and amplitude. We find that the system may operate as a nanoantenna for controlled and tunable directional emission. Polar diagrams of the radiation intensity are presented showing that a constant phase or amplitude difference at the positions of the emitters plays an essential role in the directivity of the emission. We find that the radiation patterns may differ dramatically for different phase and amplitude differences at the positions of the emitters. As a result the system may operate as a two- or one-sided nanoantenna. In particular, a two-sided highly focused directional emission can be achieved when the emitters experience the same amplitude and a constant phase difference of the driving field. We find a general directional property of the emitted field that when the phase differences at the positions of the emitters equal an even multiple of \pi/4, the system behaves as a two-sided antenna. When the phase difference equals an odd multiple of \pi/4, the system behaves as an one-sided antenna. The case when the emitters experience the same phase but different amplitudes of the driving field is also considered and it is found that the effect of different amplitudes is to cause the system to behave as a uni-directional antenna radiating along the interatomic axis.

abstract: In classical physics, probabilistic or statistical knowledge has been always related to ignorance or inaccurate subjective knowledge about an actual state of affairs. This idea has been extended to quantum mechanics through a completely incoherent interpretation of the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics in terms of "strange" quantum particles. This interpretation, naturalized through a widespread "way of speaking" in the physics community, contradicts Born's physical account of {\Psi} as a "probability wave" which provides statistical information about outcomes that, in fact, cannot be interpreted in terms of 'ignorance about an actual state of affairs'. In the present paper we discuss how the metaphysics of actuality has played an essential role in limiting the possibilities of understating things differently. We propose instead a metaphysical scheme in terms of powers with definite potentia which allows us to consider quantum probability in a new light, namely, as providing objective knowledge about a potential state of affairs.

abstract: In a quantum network, distant observers sharing physical resources emitted by independent sources can establish strong correlations, which defy any classical explanation in terms of local variables. We discuss the characterization of nonlocal correlations in such a situation, when compared to those that can be generated in networks distributing independent local variables. We present an iterative procedure for constructing Bell inequalities tailored for networks: starting from a given network, and a corresponding Bell inequality, our technique provides new Bell inequalities for a more complex network, involving one additional source and one additional observer. The relevance of our method is illustrated on a variety of networks, for which we demonstrate significant quantum violations.

abstract: First, we consider the problem of deciding whether a nonlocal game admits a perfect entangled strategy that uses projective measurements on a maximally entangled shared state. Via a polynomial-time Karp reduction, we show that independent set games are the hardest instances of this problem. Secondly, we show that if every independent set game whose entangled value is equal to one admits a perfect entangled strategy, then the same holds for all symmetric synchronous games. Finally, we identify combinatorial lower bounds on the classical and entangled values of synchronous games in terms of variants of the independence number of appropriate graphs. Our results suggest that independent set games might be representative of all nonlocal games when dealing with questions concerning perfect entangled strategies.

abstract: We consider ultracold quantum gases of scalar bosons, assuming a coupling strength-density regime in which they constitute a twofold fragmented condensate trapped in a single well. It is shown that the corresponding quantum states are, in the appropriate Fock space basis, identical to the photon cat states familiar in quantum optics, which correspond to superpositions of coherent states of the light field with a phase difference of $\pi$. In marked distinction to photon cat states, the very existence of matter wave cat states however crucially depends on the many-body correlations of the constituent bosons. We consequently establish that the quadratures of the effective "photons," expressing the highly nonclassical nature of the macroscopic matter wave superposition state, can be experimentally accessed by measuring the density-density correlations of the fragmented condensate.

abstract: A central assumption in quantum key distribution (QKD) is that Eve has no knowledge about which rounds will be used for parameter estimation or key distillation. Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative sifting, a commonly used sifting procedure that has been em- ployed in both theoretical and experimental finite-size QKD. We show that iterative sifting leads to two problems: (1) some rounds are more likely to be key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past measurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two previously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit them, and find that the two problems are independent. We propose corrections to the protocol and prove that the resulting protocol, which we call the fixed round number sifting protocol, is secure and can thus replace iterative sifting in future QKD protocols. It outperforms other recently suggested protocols, increasing the efficiency by a factor of almost two. More generally, we present two formal criteria for a sifting protocol which ensure that they are secure. Our criteria may guide the design of future protocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected sifting-related attacks so far.

abstract: Quantum optomechanical system serves as an interface for coupling between photons and phonons due to mechanical oscillations. We used the Heisenberg-Langevin approach under Markovian white noise approximation to study a quadratically coupled optomechanical system which contains a thin dielectric membrane quadratically coupled to the cavity field. A decorrelation method is employed to solve for a larger number of coupled equations. Transient mean numbers of cavity photons and phonons that provide dynamical behaviour are computed for different coupling regime. We have also obtained the two-boson second-order correlation functions for the cavity field, membrane oscillator and their cross correlations that provide nonclassical properties governed by quadratic optomechanical system.

abstract: We address the problem of proper quantifying an informational content in quantum theory. Brukner and Zeilinger proposed the concept of an operationally invariant measure based on measurement statistics. Their measure of information is calculated with probabilities generated in a complete set of mutually complementary observations. This approach has later been criticized for several reasons. It is related to the problem of existence of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases. In general, this open problem seems to be very hard. Another serious question concerns an inevitable role of "no-click" events in real experiments. We aim to show that some critical points can essentially be overcome by means of natural extension or reformulation of the Brukner-Zeilinger approach. In particular, this approach is shown to be connected with symmetric informationally complete measurements. The "total information" of Brukner and Zeilinger can naturally be treated in the context of mutually unbiased measurements as well as general symmetric informationally complete measurements. We also study the Brukner-Zeilinger measure of information in the case of detection inefficiencies. It is shown to be decreasing under the action of bistochastic maps. This observation may be connected with the role of unitality as the condition for the physicality of reverse processes. Relations between the non-unitality operator and the Brukner-Zeilinger total information are discussed.

abstract: This paper is concerned with the coherent quantum filtering (CQF) problem, where a quantum observer is cascaded in a measurement-free fashion with a linear quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square error of estimating the plant variables of interest. Both systems are governed by Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by bosonic fields in vacuum state. These quantum dynamics are specified by the Hamiltonians and system-field coupling operators. We apply a recently proposed transverse Hamiltonian variational method to the development of first-order necessary conditions of optimality for the CQF problem in a larger class of observers. The latter is obtained by perturbing the Hamiltonian and system-field coupling operators of a linear coherent quantum observer along linear combinations of unitary Weyl operators, whose role here resembles that of the needle variations in the Pontryagin minimum principle. We show that if the observer is a stationary point of the performance functional in the class of linear observers, then it is also a stationary point with respect to the Weyl variations in the larger class of nonlinear observers.

abstract: We analyze the generation rates and preparation fidelities of photon triplet states in pulsed cascaded parametric down-conversion (PDC) under realistic experimental circumstances. As a model system, we assume a monolithically integrated device with negligible interface loss between the two consecutive PDC stages. We model the secondary down-conversion process in terms of a lossy channel and provide a detailed analysis of noise contributions. Taking variable pump powers into account, we estimate the impact of higher-order photon contributions and conversion processes on the achievable coincidence probabilities. At mean photon numbers of $\langle m\rangle\sim0.25$ photons per pulse behind the first PDC stage, we expect around $4.0$ genuine photon triplets per hour. Additionally, we discuss fundamental limitations of our model system as well as feasible improvements to the detectable photon triplet rate.

abstract: Nonclassicality cannot be a single-observable property since the statistics of any quantum observable is compatible with classical physics. We develop a general procedure to reveal nonclassical behavior from the joint measurement of multiple observables. This requires enlarged spaces and couplings with auxiliary degrees of freedom so it must be followed by an inversion procedure to infer system properties from the observed statistics. In particular this discloses nonclassical properties of standard examples of classical-like behavior, such as SU(2) and Glauber coherent states. Moreover, when combined with other criteria it would imply that every quantum state would be nonclassical.

The detection of photons allows the quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of quantum correlations of the atomic ensemble, distinguishing between different quantum states. We analyse the entanglement between light and matter and show how it can be exploited for realising multimode macroscopic quantum superpositions such as Schr\"odinger cat states, for both bosons and fermions. We provide examples utilising different measurement schemes, and study their robustness to decoherence. Finally, we address the regime where the optical lattice potential is a quantum dynamical variable and is modified by the atomic state, leading to novel quantum phases, and significantly altering the phase diagram of the atomic system.

This criterion is a direct consequence of the fact that separable states do not improve the accuracy upon estimating one-parameter family of quantum channels. Our result is a generalization of the previously known criterion for one-parameter unitary channel to any one-parameter quantum channel. We discuss several examples to illustrate our criterion. The proposed criterion is extended to the case of open quantum systems and we briefly discuss how to detect entangled states in the presence of decoherence.

abstract: We derive explicit bounds for the average entropy characterizing measurements of a pure quantum state of size $N$ in $L$ orthogonal bases. Lower bounds lead to novel entropic uncertainty relations, while upper bounds allow us to formulate universal certainty relations. For $L=2$ the maximal average entropy saturates at $\log N$ as there exists a mutually coherent state, but certainty relations are shown to be nontrivial for $L \ge 3$ measurements. In the case of a prime power dimension, $N=p^k$, and the number of measurements $L=N+1$, the upper bound for the average entropy becomes minimal for a collection of mutually unbiased bases. Analogous approach is used to study entanglement with respect to $L$ different splittings of a composite system, linked by bi-partite quantum gates. We show that for any two-qubit unitary gate $U\in \mathcal{U}(4)$ there exist states being mutually separable or mutually entangled with respect to both splittings (related by $U$) of the composite system. The latter statement follows from the fact that the real projective space $\mathbb{R}P^{3}\subset\mathbb{C}P^{3}$ is non-displacable. For $L=3$ splittings the maximal sum of $L$ entanglement entropies is conjectured to achieve its minimum for a collection of three mutually entangled bases, formed by two mutually entangling gates.

abstract: We investigate under which conditions a general mixed state on a finite-dimensional multipartite quantum system may be the unique, globally stable fixed point of frustration-free semigroup dynamics subject to specified quasi-locality constraints. Our central result is a linear-algebraic necessary and sufficient condition for a generic (full-rank) target state to be frustration-free quasi-locally stabilizable, along with an explicit procedure for constructing Markovian dynamics that achieve stabilization. If the target state is not full-rank, we establish sufficiency under an additional condition, which is naturally motivated by consistency with pure-state stabilization results yet provably not necessary in general. Several applications of our formalism are discussed, of relevance to both dissipative quantum engineering and non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, we show that a large class of graph product states (including arbitrary thermal graph states) as well as Gibbs states of commuting Hamiltonians are frustration-free quasi-locally stabilizable relative to natural quasi-locality constraints. In addition, we explicitly demonstrate how stabilization may still be achieved, including for target states exhibiting non-trivial multipartite entanglement, despite the lack of an underlying commuting structure, albeit scalability to arbitrary system size remains in this case an open question.

abstract: We investigate prospects of using counter-rotating vortex superposition states in non-equilibrium exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensates for the purposes of Sagnac interferometry. We first investigate the stability of vortex-antivortex superposition states, and show that they survive at steady-state in a variety of configurations. Counter-rotating vortex superpositions are of potential interest to gyroscope and seismometer applications for detecting rotations. Methods of improving the sensitivity are investigated by targeting high momentum states via metastable condensation, and the application of periodic lattices. The sensitivity of the polariton gyroscope is compared to its optical and atomic counterparts. Due to the large interferometer areas in optical systems and small de Broglie wavelengths for atomic BECs, the sensitivity per detected photon is found to be considerably less for the polariton gyroscope than with competing methods. However, polariton gyroscopes have an advantage over atomic BECs in a high signal-to-noise ratio, and have other practical advantages such as room-temperature operation and robust design. We estimate that the final sensitivities including signal-to-noise aspects are competitive with existing methods.

abstract: The coherence of a system can be ultimately related to the nature of its correlations with the surroundings (outside world). The system can be, for instance, the polarization of a photon, which forms part of a polarization-entangled two-photon state, or the spatial shape of a coherent beam, where each spatial mode bears different polarizations. Whereas a local unitary transformation of the system do not affect its coherence, global unitary transformations modifying both the system and its surroundings can enhance its coherence transforming mutual correlations into coherence. The question naturally arises of what is the best measure that quantifies the correlations that can be turned into coherence, and how much coherence can be extracted. We answer both questions, and illustrate its application for some typical simple systems, with the aim at illuminating the general concept of enhancing coherence by modifying correlations.

We give the expressions of eigenenergies and eigenfunctions and we study the dependence of these solutions according to the dipole moment D. The condition of reality for the energies E_{n,m} imposes that the dipole moment must not exceed a maximum value otherwise the corresponding bound state disappears. We have also found that the s states (m=0) can no longer exist in the system as soon as the dipole term is present.

abstract: If a quantum system is prepared and later post-selected in certain states, "paradoxical" predictions for intermediate measurements can be obtained. This is the case both when the intermediate measurement is strong, i.e. a projective measurements with L\"uders-von Neumann update rule, or with weak measurements where they show up in anomalous weak values. Leifer and Spekkens [quant-ph/0412178] identified a striking class of such paradoxes, known as logical pre- and post-selection paradoxes, and showed that they are indirectly connected with contextuality. By analysing the measurement-disturbance required in models of these phenomena, we find that the strong measurement version of logical pre- and post-selection paradoxes actually constitute a direct manifestation of quantum contextuality. The proof hinges on under-appreciated features of the paradoxes. In particular, we show by example that it is not possible to prove contextuality without L\"uders-von Neumann updates for the intermediate measurements, nonorthogonal pre- and post-selection, and 0/1 probabilities for the intermediate measurements. Since one of us has recently shown that anomalous weak values are also a direct manifestation of contextuality [arXiv:1409.1535], we now know that this is true for both realizations of logical pre- and post-selection paradoxes.

By carefully taking into account all the resources involved in the thermodynamic transformations in a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there exists a thermal machine that can come arbitrarily close to extracting all the coherence as work. The machine only needs to act on individual copies of a state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted as work. We provide explicit protocols extracting work from coherence when the resources of a thermal machine are bounded, a scenario potentially relevant for the thermodynamics at the nanoscale.

abstract: We consider the task of deterministically entangling two remote qubits using joint measurement and feedback, but no directly entangling Hamiltonian. In order to formulate the most effective experimentally feasible protocol, we introduce the notion of average sense locally optimal (ASLO) feedback protocols, which do not require real-time quantum state estimation, a difficult component of real-time quantum feedback control. We use this notion of optimality to construct two protocols which can deterministically create maximal entanglement: a semiclassical feedback protocol for low efficiency measurements and a quantum feedback protocol for high efficiency measurements. The latter reduces to direct feedback in the continuous-time limit, whose dynamics can be modeled by a Wiseman-Milburn feedback master equation which yields an analytic solution in the limit of unit measurement efficiency. Our formalism can smoothly interpolate between continuous-time and discrete-time descriptions of feedback dynamics, and we exploit this feature to then derive a superior hybrid protocol for arbitrary non-unit measurement efficiency that switches between quantum and semiclassical protocols. Finally, we show using simulations incorporating experimental imperfections that deterministic entanglement of remote superconducting qubits may be achieved with current technology using the continuous-time feedback protocol alone.

abstract: High-speed free-space quantum key distribution located in urban environment offers an interesting alternative to public key encryption - whose security strength is yet to be mathematically proven. To achieve this, three main objectives need to be accomplished: both the emitter and receiver have to be capable of transmitting and receiving at high speed - with the selection of the source's wavelength and detectors being of especial importance - the error rate needs to be kept at a minimum, especially that due to solar background radiation; and finally, a fast automatic tracking system, capable of compensating for atmospheric turbulence effects, is needed. Regarding to sky background and atmospheric turbulence, two different tracking techniques involving the beam wander compensation in the emitter or the receiver are presented and one of them is selected for our system, based on the link propagation distance and the atmospheric turbulence regime.

abstract: We predict that a charge under the influence of a quantum electrodynamic potential exhibits a force-free Aharonov-Bohm effect. The specific system considered in this study is a superconducting charge qubit nonlocally interacting with a cavity electromagnetic field. We find that this nonlocal interaction gives rise to remarkable quantum electrodynamic phenomena such as vacuum Rabi splitting and oscillation, and Lamb shift, under the condition that the qubit is located in an electromagnetic-field-free region. Our result can be verified in a realistic experimental setup, and provides a new approach of investigating the Aharonov-Bohm effect combined with quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: We establish an operational theory of coherence (or of superposition) in quantum systems. Namely, we introduce the two basic concepts - "coherence distillation" and "coherence cost" in the processing quantum states under so-called incoherent operations [Baumgratz/Cramer/Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113:140401 (2014)]. We then show that in the asymptotic limit of many copies of a state, both are given by simple single-letter formulas: the distillable coherence is given by the relative entropy of coherence (in other words, we give the relative entropy of coherence its operational interpretation), and the coherence cost by the coherence of formation, which is an optimization over convex decompositions of the state. An immediate corollary is that there exists no bound coherent state in the sense that one would need to consume coherence to create the state but no coherence could be distilled from it. Further we demonstrate that the coherence theory is generically an irreversible theory by a simple criterion that completely characterizes all reversible states.

abstract: We propose a quantum sensing scheme for measuring weak forces based on a symmetry-breaking adiabatic transition in the quantum Rabi model. We show that the system described by the Rabi Hamiltonian can serve as a sensor for extremely weak forces with sensitivity beyond the yN $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ range. We propose an implementation of this sensing protocol using a single trapped ion. A major advantage of our scheme is that the force detection is performed by projective measurement of the population of the spin states at the end of the transition, instead of the far slower phonon number measurement used hitherto.

abstract: A beam splitter is a basic linear optical element appearing in many optics experiments and is frequently used as a continuous-variable entangler transforming a pair of input modes from a separable Gaussian state into an entangled state. However, a beam splitter is a passive operation that can create entanglement from Gaussian states only under certain conditions. One such condition is that the input light is squeezed. We demonstrate experimentally that a beam splitter can create entanglement even from modes which do not possess such a squeezing provided that they are correlated to but not entangled with a third mode. Specifically, we show that a beam splitter can create three-mode entanglement by acting on two modes of a three-mode fully separable Gaussian state without entangling the two modes themselves. This beam splitter property is a key mechanism behind the performance of the protocol for entanglement distribution by separable states. Moreover, the property also finds application in collaborative quantum dense coding in which decoding of transmitted information is assisted by interference with a mode of the collaborating party.

abstract: Opto- and electromechanical systems offer an effective platform to test quantum theory and its predictions at macroscopic scales. To date, all experiments presuppose the validity of quantum mechanics, but could in principle be described by a hypothetical local statistical theory. Here we suggest a Bell test using the electromechanical Einstein-Podolski-Rosen entangled state recently generated by Palomaki et al., which would rule out any local and realistic explanation of the measured data without assuming the validity of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. The parameter regime required for our scheme has been demonstrated or is within reach of current experiments.

abstract: We report on a simple scheme that may present a non-trivial geometric Zak phase ($\Phi_{Zak}$) structure, which is based on a discrete-time quantum walk architecture. By detecting the Zak phase difference between two trajectories connecting adjacent Dirac points where the quasi-energy gap closes for opposite values of quasi-momentum ($k$), it is possible to identify geometric invariants. These geometric invariants correspond to $|\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}-\Phi_{Zak}^{-(+)}|=\pi$ and $|\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}-\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}|=0$, we argue that this effect can be directly measured.

abstract: Optimisation problems in science and engineering typically involve finding the ground state (i.e. the minimum energy configuration) of a cost function with respect to many variables. If the variables are corrupted by noise then this approach maximises the likelihood that the solution found is correct. An alternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the noise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem. The maximum entropy solution to the problem then takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution over the ground and excited states of the cost function. Here we use a programmable Josephson junction array for the information decoding problem which we simulate as a random Ising model in a field. We show experimentally that maximum entropy decoding at finite temperature can in certain cases give competitive and even slightly better bit-error-rates than the maximum likelihood approach at zero temperature, confirming that useful information can be extracted from the excited states of the annealing device. Furthermore we introduce a microscopic bit-by-bit analytical method which is agnostic to the specific application and use it to show that the annealing device samples from a highly Boltzmann-like distribution. Machines of this kind are therefore candidates for use in a wide variety of machine learning applications which exploit maximum entropy inference, including natural language processing and image recognition. We further show that the limiting factor for performance in our experiments is likely to be control errors rather than failure to reach equilibrium. Our work also provides a method for determining if a system is in equilibrium which can be easily generalized. We discuss possible applications of this method to spin glasses and probing the performance of the quantum annealing algorithm.

abstract: It is a central question in quantum thermodynamics to determine how much work can be gained by a process that transforms an initial state $\rho$ to a final state $\sigma$. For example, we might ask how much work can be obtained by thermalizing $\rho$ to a thermal state $\sigma$ at temperature $T$ of an ambient heat bath. Here, we show that for large systems, or when allowing slightly inexact catalysis, the amount of work is characterized by how reversible the process is. More specifically, the amount of work to be gained depends on how well we can return the state $\sigma$ to its original form $\rho$ without investing any work. We proceed to exhibit an explicit reversal operation in terms of the Petz recovery channel coming from quantum information theory. Our result establishes a quantitative link between the reversibility of thermodynamical processes and the corresponding work gain.

abstract: We propose a numerical method to solve the Wigner equation in quantum systems of spinless, non-relativistic particles. The method uses a spectral decomposition into $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ basis functions in momentum-space to obtain a system of first-order advection-reaction equations. The resulting equations are solved by splitting the reaction and advection steps so as to allow the combination of numerical techniques from quantum mechanics and computational fluid dynamics by identifying the skew-hermitian reaction matrix as a generator of unitary rotations. The method is validated for the case of particles subject to a one-dimensional (an-)harmonic potential using finite-differences for the advection part. Thereby, we verify the second order of convergence and observe non-classical behavior in the evolution of the Wigner function.

abstract: The promise of innovative applications has triggered the development of many modern technologies capable of exploiting quantum effects. But in addition to future applications, such quantum technologies have already provided us with the possibility of accessing quantum-mechanical scenarios that seemed unreachable just a few decades ago. With this spirit, in this work we show that modern optomechanical setups are mature enough to implement one of the most elusive models in the field of open system dynamics: degenerate parametric oscillation. The possibility of implementing it in nonlinear optical resonators was the main motivation for introducing such model in the eighties, which rapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose corresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found that the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to experimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition. In contrast, here we show that this long-awaited model can be implemented in the motion of a mechanical object dispersively coupled to the light contained in a cavity, when the latter is properly driven with multi-chromatic laser light. We focus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures of the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in state-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of studying spontaneous symmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative phase transitions.

We provide a pedagogical overview of the measurement process, when the qubit is dispersively coupled to a microwave frequency cavity, and the qubit state is encoded in the phase of a microwave tone that probes the cavity. A continuous measurement record is used to reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of the qubit state, and quantum state tomography is performed to verify that the state has been tracked accurately. Furthermore, we discuss ensembles of trajectories, time-symmetric evolution, two-qubit trajectories, and potential applications in measurement-based quantum error correction.

abstract: Despite being one of the hallmarks of quantum physics, there is a lack of operational interpretations of quantum coherence. Here we provide an operational interpretation of coherence of a quantum system, in terms of the amount of noise that is to be injected in order to fully decohere it. In particular, we show that in the asymptotic limit, the minimum amount of noise that is required to fully decohere a quantum system, is equal to the relative entropy of coherence. This quantifies the erasure cost of quantum coherence. We employ the entropy exchanged between system and environment during the decohering operation and the memory required to store the information about the decohering operation as the quantifiers of noise. We show that both the quantifiers yield the same cost of erasing coherence in the asymptotic limit. The relative entropy of coherence, hence, is endowed with a thermodynamical and operational interpretation.

abstract: We consider the phase stability of a local oscillator (or laser) locked to a cavity QED system comprised of atoms with an ultra-narrow optical transition. The atoms are cooled to millikelvin temperatures and then released into the optical cavity. Although the atomic motion introduces Doppler broadening, the standing wave nature of the cavity causes saturated absorption features to appear, which are much narrower than the Doppler width. These features can be used to achieve an extremely high degree of phase stabilization, competitive with the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity introduced by finite atomic velocities can cause optical bistability to disappear, resulting in no regions of dynamic instability and thus enabling a new regime accessible to experiments where optimum stabilization may be achieved.

abstract: Probabilistic quantum state transformations can be characterized by the degree of state separation they provide. This, in turn, sets limits on the success rate of these transformations. We consider optimum state separation of two known pure states in the general case where the known states have arbitrary a priori probabilities. The problem is formulated from a geometric perspective and shown to be equivalent to the problem of finding tangent curves within two families of conics that represent the unitarity constraints and the objective functions to be optimized, respectively. We present the corresponding analytical solutions in various forms. In the limit of perfect state separation, which is equivalent to unambiguous state discrimination, the solution exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking phase transition. We also propose a linear optics implementation of separation which is based on the dual rail representation of qubits and single-photon multiport interferometry.

abstract: We present a systematic method to introduce free parameters in sets of mutually unbiased bases. In particular, we demonstrate that any set of m real mutually unbiased bases in dimension N>2 admits the introduction of (m-1)N/2 free parameters which cannot be absorbed by a global unitary operation. As consequence, there are m=k+1 mutually unbiased bases in every dimension N=k^2 with k^3/2 free parameters, where k is even. We construct the maximal set of triplets of mutually unbiased bases for two-qubits systems and triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets of mutually unbiased bases with free parameters for three-qubits systems. Furthermore, we study the richness of the entanglement structure of such bases and we provide the quantum circuits required to implement all these bases with free parameters in the laboratory. Finally, we find the upper bound for the maximal number of real and complex mutually unbiased bases existing in every dimension. This proof is simple, short and it considers basic matrix algebra.

abstract: Controlling the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is essential in quantum information technology since it plays a crucial role in preserving quantum memory. Albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can simultaneously interact with composite environments, this condition remains little understood, particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between environmental parts. We analyze the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit interacting at the same time with two coupled single-mode cavities which in turn dissipate into memoryless or memory-keeping reservoirs. We show that increasing the control parameter, that is the two-mode coupling, allows for triggering and enhancing a non-Markovian dynamics for the qubit starting from a Markovian one in absence of coupling. Surprisingly, if the qubit dynamics is non-Markovian for zero control parameter, increasing the latter enables multiple transitions from non-Markovian to Markovian regimes. These results hold independently on the nature of the reservoirs. This work highlights that suitably engineering the coupling between parts of a compound environment can efficiently harness the quantum memory, stored in a qubit, based on non-Markovianity.

A common notion of time is defined for observers in similar observable universes by using the holographic principle. It is the time elapsed since the post-inflationary epoch. With this improvement, the cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics becomes a full interpretation of quantum mechanics where the unitary evolution of quantum states is preserved. Moreover, it is well suited for eternal inflation .

abstract: Nonselective quantum measurements, i.e., measurements without reading the results, are often considered as a resource for manipulating quantum systems. In this work, we investigate optimal acceleration of the Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions by non-selective quantum measurements. We use the measurements of a population of a diabatic state of the LZ system at certain time instants as control and find the optimal time instants which maximize the LZ transition. We find surprising nonmonotonic behavior of the maximal transition probability with increase of the coupling parameter when the number of measurements is large. This transition probability gives an optimal approximation to the fundamental quantum Zeno effect (which corresponds to continuous measurements) by a fixed number of discrete measurements. The difficulty for the analysis is that the transition probability as a function of time instants has a huge number of local maxima. We resolve this problem both analytically by asymptotic analysis and numerically by the development of efficient algorithms mainly based on the dynamic programming. The proposed numerical methods can be applied, besides this problem, to a wide class of measurement-based optimal control problems.

We use JC model with Lindblad master equation to estimate the dependence of the validity of C-Sign operator from the rate of photon leak and estimate the limitation, which this validity imposes to quantum computations.

abstract: Three distant labs A, B and C, having no prior entanglement can establish a shared GHZ state, when one of them say A sends two particles to B and C for their local actions. The mediating particles remain separable from each other and from the particles of A, B and C. We prove that in this way, GHZ states are shared with a probability $\frac{1}{7}$. We also show how separable particles can be mediated to establish arbitrary $d-$ dimensional Bell states between distant labs. Our method is constructive and allows generaization of GHZ sharing between any number of parties and in any dimension. The proposed method may facilitate the construction of multi-node quantum networks and many other processes which use multi-partite entangled states.

abstract: While a Hamiltonian can be both Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric, it is $PT$ symmetry that is the more general, as it can lead to real energy eigenvalues even if the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian. We discuss some specific ways in which $PT$ symmetry goes beyond Hermiticity and is more far reaching than it. We show that simply by virtue of being the generator of time translations, the Hamiltonian must always be $PT$ symmetric, regardless of whether or not it might be Hermitian. We show that the reality of the Euclidean time path integral is a necessary and sufficient condition for $PT$ symmetry of a quantum field theory, with Hermiticity only being a sufficient condition. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed for a path integral quantization one must impose $PT$ symmetry on each classical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity condition since Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the quantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been constructed. With the spacetime metric being $PT$ even we show that a covariant action must always be $PT$ symmetric. Unlike Hermiticity, $PT$ symmetry does not need to be postulated as it is derivable from Poincare invariance. Hermiticity is just a particular realization of $PT$ symmetry, one in which the eigenspectrum is real and complete.

By means of the usual quantization approach this kind of media would lead to the unphysical result of quantum noise squeezing. This problem is solved by means of generalized canonical transformations in a comoving frame. Under these transformations the generator of propagation is a physical Lewis-Ermakov invariant in space which is quantized and, accordingly, a propagator consistent with experiments is obtained. Finally, we show that the net effect produced by propagation in these media is a quantum Gouy's phase with application in quantum interferometry.

abstract: We propose here a quantum secret sharing scheme that works for both quantum and classical secrets. The proposed scheme is based on both entanglement swapping and teleportation together. It allows sender to encrypt his/her secret and simultaneously distribute decryption information of the encrypted secret among distant parties where decryption shares are nonlocally correlated with each other. Two-fold quantum non-local correlations, generated through entanglement swapping and then teleporting quantum states over swapped maximally entangled pairs, guarantee both authentication and secrecy of the secret from internal as well as external eavesdroppers. For classical secrets, we demonstrate a direct (2,2) quantum secret sharing scheme where neither pre-shared key nor physically secure quantum/classical channel are required. The same scheme turns out to be a (5,5) quantum secret sharing scheme for quantum secrets if sender and receivers have private quantum/classical channels among them.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum uncertainty in the beam width of transverse optical modes and, for this purpose, define a corresponding quantum operator. Single mode states are studied as well as multimode states with small quantum noise. General relations are derived, and specific examples of different modes and quantum states are examined. For the multimode case, we show that the quantum uncertainty in the beam width can be completely attributed to the amplitude quadrature uncertainty of one specific mode, which is uniquely determined by the field under investigation. This discovery provides us with a strategy for the reduction of the beam width noise by an appropriate choice of the quantum state.

abstract: A promising approach to solving hard binary optimization problems is quantum adiabatic annealing (QA) in a transverse magnetic field. An instantaneous ground state --- initially a symmetric superposition of all possible assignments of $N$ qubits --- is closely tracked as it becomes more and more localized near the global minimum of the classical energy. Regions where the energy gap to excited states is small (e.g. at the phase transition) are the algorithm's bottlenecks. Here I show rigorously that even if the gap at the quantum critical point (QCP) scales as an inverse power of $N$, the problem can still be intractable. The model considered is that of Ising spins on a complete graph, with the additional restriction that the random matrix of interaction strengths $J_{ik}$ has rank $p=2$ (Hopfield network with two patterns). Exact solution reveals $\log N$ additional (to QCP) bottlenecks where the gap scales as a stretched exponential. Qualitative comparison with the NP-hard Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (having full-rank $J_{ik}$) suggests that its annealing is adversely affected by the same phenomenon.

abstract: A single phonon in a nonlinear nanomechanical resonator (NAMR) can block the excitation of a second phonon [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032101 (2010)]. This intrinsically quantum effect is called phonon blockade, and is an analog of Coulomb blockade and photon blockade. Here we predict tunable multiphonon blockade in coupled nonlinear NAMRs, where nonlinearity is induced by two-level systems (TLSs) assuming dispersive (far off-resonance) interactions. Specifically, we derive an effective Kerr-type interaction in a hybrid system consisting of two nonlinearly-interacting NAMRs coupled to two TLSs and driven by classical fields. The interaction between a given NAMR and a TLS is described by a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. We show that by properly tuning the frequency of the driving fields one can induce various types of phonon blockade, corresponding to the entangled phonon states of either two qubits, qutrit and quartit, or two qudits. Thus, a $k$-phonon Fock state (with $k=1,2,3$) can impede the excitation of more phonons in a given NAMR, which we interpret as a $k$-phonon blockade (or, equivalently, phonon tunneling). Our results can be explained in terms of resonant transitions in the Fock space and via phase-space interference using the $s$-parametrized Cahill-Glauber quasiprobability distributions including the Wigner function. We study the nonclassicality, entanglement, and dimensionality of the blockaded phonon states during both dynamics and in the stationary limits.

abstract: Quantum computation provides great speedup over classical counterpart for certain problems, such as quantum simulations, prime factoring and machine learning. One of the key challenges for quantum computation is to realize precise control of the quantum system in the presence of noise. Recently, high fidelity control of qubits has been achieved in several quantum systems. However, control of the spin-qubits in solids with the accuracy required by the fault tolerant quantum computation under ambient conditions remains elusive. Herein, we quantitatively characterized the noises during the quantum gates and demonstrated the strategies to suppress the effect of these noises. A universal set of logic gates in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are reported with an average single-qubit gate fidelity of $0.99993$ and two-qubit gate fidelity of $0.992$. These high control fidelities have been achieved in the $^{13}$C naturally abundant diamonds at room temperature via composite pulses and optimal control method. This experimental implementation of quantum gates with fault-tolerant control fidelity sets an important stage towards the fault-tolerant quantum computation under ambient conditions.

abstract: This work analyses the temporal coherence and correlation of counterpropagating twin photons generated in a quasi-phase matched nonlinear cristal by spontaneous parametric-down conversion. We find out different pictures depending on the pump pulse duration relative to two characteristic temporal scales, determined respectively by the temporal separation between the counter-propagating and the co-propagating wavepackets. When the pump duration is intermediate between the two scales, we show a transition from a highly entangled state to an almost separable state, with strongly asymmetric spectral properties of the photons.

abstract: Correlations in photodetection signals from quantum light sources are conventionally calculated by application of the source master equation and the quantum regression theorem. In this article we show how the conditioned dynamics, associated with the quantum theory of measurements, allows calculations and offers interpretations of the behaviour of the same quantities. Our theory is illustrated for photon counting and field-amplitude measurements, and we show, in particular, how transient correlations between field-amplitude measurements and later photon counting events can be accounted for by a recently developed theory of past quantum states of a monitored quantum system.

abstract: An exact time-dependent solution for the wave function $\psi(r,t)$ of a particle moving in the presence of an asymmetric rectangular well/barrier potential varying in one dimension is obtained by applying a novel for this problem approach using multiple scattering theory (MST) for the calculation of the space-time propagator. This approach, based on the localized at the potential jumps effective potentials responsible for transmission through and reflection from the considered rectangular potential, enables considering these processes from a particle (rather than a wave) point of view. The solution describes these quantum phenomena as a function of time and is related to the fundamental issues (such as measuring time) of quantum mechanics. It is presented in terms of integrals of elementary functions and is a sum of the forward- and backward-moving components of the wave packet. The relative contribution of these components and their interference as well as of the potential asymmetry to the probability density $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ and particle dwell time is considered and numerically visualized for narrow and broad energy (momentum) distributions of the initial Gaussian wave packet. The obtained solution is also related to the kinetic theory of nanostructures due to the fact that the considered potential can model the spin-dependent potential profile of the magnetic multilayers used in spintronics devices.

abstract: We consider the orbital angular momentum of a free electron vortex moving in a uniform magnetic field. We identify three contributions to this angular momentum: the canonical orbital angular momentum associated with the vortex, the angular momentum of the cyclotron orbit of the wavefunction, and a diamagnetic angular momentum. The cyclotron and diamagnetic angular momenta are found to be separable according to the parallel axis theorem. This means that rotations can occur with respect to two or more axes simultaneously, which can be observed with superpositions of vortex states.

abstract: Classical optics can be used to efficiently implement certain quantum information processing tasks with a high degree of control, for example, one-dimensional quantum walks through the space of orbital angular momentum of light directed by its polarization. To explore the potential of quantum information processing with classical light, we here suggest a method to realize d-dimensional quantum walks with classical optics---an important step towards robust implementation of certain quantum algorithms. In this scheme, different degrees of freedom of light, such as frequency, orbital angular momentum, and time bins, represent different directions for the walker while the coin to decide which direction the walker takes is realized by employing the polarization combined with different light paths.

abstract: We show that the "practical" Bell inequalities, which use intensities as the observed variables, commonly used in quantum optics and widely accepted in the community, suffer from an inherent loophole, which severely limits the range of local hidden variable theories of light, which are invalidated by their violation. We present alternative inequalities which do not suffer from any (theoretical) loophole. The new inequalities use redefined correlation functions, which involve averaged products of local rates rather than intensities. Surprisingly, the new inequalities detect entanglement in situations in which the "practical" ones fail. Thus, we have two for the price on one: full consistency with Bell's Theorem, and better device-independent detection of entanglement.

abstract: Milz and Strunz recently reported substantial evidence to further support the previously conjectured separability probability of $\frac{8}{33}$ for two-qubit systems ($\rho$) endowed with Hilbert-Schmidt measure. Additionally, they found that along the radius ($r$) of the Bloch ball representing either of the two single-qubit subsystems, this value appeared constant (but for the locus of the pure states, $r=1$). Further, they also observed (personal communication) such separability probability $r$-invariance, when using, more broadly, random induced measure ($K=3,4,5,\ldots$), with $K=4$ corresponding to the (symmetric) Hilbert-Schmidt case. Among the findings here is that this invariance is maintained even after splitting the separability probabilities into those parts arising from the determinantal inequality $|\rho^{PT}| >|\rho|$ and those from $|\rho| > |\rho^{PT}| >0$, where the partial transpose is indicated. The nine-dimensional set of generic two-re[al]bit states endowed with Hilbert-Schmidt measure is also examined, with similar conclusions. Contrastingly, two-qubit separability probabilities based on the Bures (minimal monotone) measure diminish with $r$. Moreover, we study the forms that the separability probabilities take as joint (bivariate) functions of the radii of the Bloch balls of {\it both} single-qubit subsystems. Here, a form of Bloch radii {\it repulsion} for separable two-qubit systems emerges in {\it all} our several analyses. Separability probabilities tend to be smaller when the lengths of the two radii are closer. In Appendix A, we report certain companion results for the much-investigated, more analytically amenable (7-dimensional) $X$-states model.

We apply a Fisher information analysis to show that because of this effect, a closed quantum system should be probed as rarely as possible while a dissipative quantum systems should be probed at specifically determined intervals to yield the optimal estimation of parameters governing the sys- tem dynamics. With a Bayesian analysis we show that a few frequent measurements are needed to identify the parameter region within which the Fisher information analysis applies

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.08779
abstract: We present an approach for obtaining eigenfunctions of periodically driven time-dependent Hamiltonians. Assuming an approximate scale separation between two spatial regions where different potentials dominate, we derive an explicit expansion for scattering problems with mixed cylindrical and spherical symmetry, by matching wavefunctions of a periodic linear drive in the exterior region to solutions of an arbitrary interior potential expanded in spherical waves. Using this method we study quasi-bound states of a square-well potential in three dimensions subject to an axial driving force. In the nonperturbative regime we show how eigenfunctions develop an asymptotic dressing of different partial waves, accompanied by large periodic oscillations in the angular momentum and a nonmonotonous dependence of the decay rate on the drive strength. We extend these results to the strong driving regime near a resonant intersection of the quasi-energy surfaces of two bound states of different symmetry. Our approach can be applied to general quantum scattering problems of particles subject to periodic fields.

abstract: We propose a mechanism for testing the theory of continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) by examining the parametric heating rate of a trapped nanosphere. The random localizations of the centre of mass for a given particle predicted by the CSL model can be modelled as a stochastic force embodying a source of heating for the nanosphere. We show that by utilising a Paul trap to levitate the particle coupled with optical cooling, it is possible to reduce environmental decoherence to such a level that CSL dominates the dynamics and contributes the main source of heating. We show that this approach allows measurements to be made on the timescale of seconds, and that the full parameter ranges given by Adler [J. Phys. A {\bf 40} 2935 (2006)] and Bassi [EPL {\bf 92} 5006 (2010)] ought to be testable using this scheme.

abstract: We use analytic (current) density-potential maps of time-dependent (current) density functional theory (TD(C)DFT) to inverse engineer analytically solvable time-dependent quantum problems. In this approach the driving potential (the control signal) and the corresponding solution of the Schr\"odinger equation are parametrized analytically in terms of the basic TD(C)DFT observables. We describe the general reconstruction strategy and illustrate it with a number of explicit examples. First we consider the real space one-particle dynamics driven by a time-dependent electromagnetic field and recover, from the general TDDFT reconstruction formulas, the known exact solution for a driven oscillator with a time-dependent frequency. Then we use analytic maps of the lattice TD(C)DFT to control quantum dynamics in a discrete space. As a first example we construct a time-dependent potential which generates prescribed dynamics on a tight-binding chain. Then our method is applied to the dynamics of spin-1/2 driven by a time dependent magnetic field. We design an analytic control pulse that transfers the system from the ground to excited state and vice versa. This pulse generates the spin flip thus operating as a quantum NOT gate.

Previous investigations have shown that the list of "conventional" SI superpotentials that do not depend explicitly on Planck's constant $\hbar$ is complete. Additionally, a set of "extended" superpotentials has been identified, each containing a conventional superpotential as a kernel and additional $\hbar$-dependent terms. We use the partial differential equations satisfied by all SI superpotentials to find a SI extension of Morse with novel properties. It has the same eigenenergies as Morse but different asymptotic limits, and does not conform to the standard generating structure for isospectral deformations.

abstract: We study optimization programs given by a bilinear form over noncommutative variables subject to linear inequalities. Problems of this form include the entangled value of two-prover games, entanglement assisted coding for classical channels and quantum-proof randomness extractors. We introduce an asymptotically converging hierarchy of efficiently computable semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations for this quantum optimization. This allows us to give upper bounds on the quantum advantage for all of these problems. Compared to previous work of Pironio, Navascues and Acin, our hierarchy has additional constraints. By means of examples, we illustrate the importance of these new constraints both in practice and for analytical properties. Moreover, this allows us to give a hierarchy of SDP outer approximations for the completely positive semidefinite cone introduced by Laurent and Piovesan.

Unlike DPS, our hierarchy converges exactly at a finite number of rounds for any fixed input dimension. This yields an algorithm for separability testing which is singly exponential in dimension and polylogarithmic in accuracy. Our analysis makes use of tools from algebraic geometry, but our algorithm is elementary and differs from DPS only by one simple additional collection of constraints.

abstract: Quantum systems allow one to sense physical parameters beyond the reach of classical statistics---with resolutions greater than $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of constituent particles independently probing the parameter. In principle, the Heisenberg Limit $1/N^{2}$ may even be reached, which requires both the relative size of the largest entangled block and the geometric measure of entanglement to be non-vanishing as $N\!\to\!\infty$. Yet, we demonstrate that in the asymptotic $N$ limit any precision scaling arbitrarily close to the Heisenberg Limit ($1/N^{2-\varepsilon}$ with any $\varepsilon\!>\!0$) may be attained, even though the system gradually becomes noisier and separable, and both the above entanglement quantifiers asymptotically vanish. Our results thus show that quantum systems achieve nearly optimal resolution scaling despite arbitrarily small amount of entanglement present. In deriving these results, we also establish a continuity relation for the Quantum Fisher Information of independent interest.

We also analyze a key property of AME, namely their relation to tensors that can be understood as unitary transformations in every of its bi-partitions. We call this property multi-unitarity.

abstract: We consider wavefunctions which are non-negative in some tensor product basis. We study what possible teleportation can occur in such wavefunctions, giving a complete answer in some cases (when one system is a qubit) and partial answers elsewhere. We use this to show that a one-dimensional wavefunction which is non-negative and has zero correlation length can be written in a "coherent Gibbs state" form, as explained later. We conjecture that such holds in higher dimensions. Additionally, some results are provided on possible teleportation in general wavefunctions, explaining how Schmidt coefficients before measurement limit the possible Schmidt coefficients after measurement, and on the absence of a "generalized area law"\cite{genarealaw} even for Hamiltonians with no sign problem. One of the motivations for this work is an attempt to prove a conjecture about ground state wavefunctions which have an "intrinsic" sign problem that cannot be removed by any quantum circuit. We show a weaker version of this, showing that the sign problem is intrinsic for commuting Hamiltonians in the same phase as the double semion model under the technical assumption that TQO-2 holds\cite{tqo2}.

abstract: In a setting of noncommutative space with minimal length we confirm the general assertion that the more nonclassical an input state for a beam splitter is, the more entangled its output state becomes. By analysing various nonclassical properties we find that the odd Schr\"odinger cat states are more nonclassical than the even Schr\"odinger cat states, hence producing more entanglement, which in turn are more nonclassical than coherent states. Both the nonclassicality and the entanglement can be enhanced by increasing the noncommutativity of the underlying space. In addition we find as a by-product some rare explicit minimum uncertainty quadrature and number squeezed states, i.e. ideal squeezed states.

abstract: We demonstrate a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking chaos in optomechanical system (OMS), which features an ultralow driving threshold. In principle, this chaos will emerge once a driving laser is applied to the cavity mode and lasts for a period of time. The driving strength is inversely proportional to the starting time of chaos. This originally comes from the dynamical enhancement of nonlinearity by field localization in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking phase ($\mathcal{PT}$BP). Moreover, this chaos is switchable by tuning the system parameters so that a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition occurs. This work may fundamentally broaden the regimes of cavity optomechanics and nonlinear optics. It offers the prospect of exploring ultralow-power-laser triggered chaos and its potential applications in secret communication.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.08925
abstract: Wood and Spekkens (2015) argue that any causal model explaining the EPRB correlations and satisfying no-signalling must also violate the assumption that the model faithfully reproduces the statistical dependences and independences---a so-called "fine-tuning" of the causal parameters; this includes, in particular, retrocausal explanations of the EPRB correlations. I consider this analysis with a view to enumerating the possible responses an advocate of retrocausal explanations might propose. I focus on the response of N\"{a}ger (2015), who argues that the central ideas of causal explanations can be saved if one accepts the possibility of a stable fine-tuning of the causal parameters. I argue that, in light of this view, a violation of faithfulness does not necessarily rule out retrocausal explanations of the EPRB correlations, although it certainly constrains such explanations. I conclude by considering some possible consequences of this type of response for retrocausal explanations.

abstract: As opposed to traditional methods of multiple-quantum NMR spectroscopy authors of the article [G.A. Alvarez, D. Suter, Phys. Rev. A 84, 012320 (2011)] generated the effective double-quantum Hamiltonian, with the slight adding usual secular dipole-dipole Hamiltonian to the first one at the stage of the correlations preparing (so the perturbation appeared). At this framework the width of MQ spectra reveals tending to any constant amount with the growing up of the time. Also there were shown that the spectral width decreases with increasing perturbation strength. The growing up of the cluster size as it was supposed by G.A. Alvarez and D. Suter was restricted by mentioned perturbation. We are assuming an alternative explanation. The growing up of cluster size still goes on but the width of MQ spectrum becomes stable because of different decay rate of MQ-spectral components in dependence on theirs location in spectrum. Here we are calculating the widths of MQ spectra in dependence on the time of "preparation" for different values of the perturbation strength and by this way we get the dependence of stabilized amount of MQ-spectrum width on mentioned strength. So, the excellent compliance obtains with the analogues experimental relation observed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 84, 012320 (2011)].

title: Excluding the local hidden variable theory with time-reversal Bell test

abstract: A time-reversal Bell test protocol is proposed. The quantum states are prepared by faraway separated partners and transferred to the third partner who carries out Bell basis measurement on them to post-select the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. If some loopholes open, similar as that in normal Bell test, the Bell violation in the present protocol is apt to be interpreted with local hidden variable (lhv) theory. With some modifications on the protocol, the lhvs at both sides are prevented to exchange their information. Thus they only function locally and cannot affect the behaviors of the states at the other sides. However, Bell violation can still be obtained in this case. It means that Bell violation is realized with the lhv theory excluded. Because high detection efficiency is not compulsory, this protocol can be realized with present technology.

abstract: In this paper, we study a model of quantum Markov chains that is a quantum analogue of Markov chains and is obtained by replacing probabilities in transition matrices with quantum operations. We show that this model is very suited to describe hybrid systems that consist of a quantum component and a classical one, although it has the same expressive power as another quantum Markov model proposed in the literature. Indeed, hybrid systems are often encountered in quantum information processing; for example, both quantum programs and quantum protocols can be regarded as hybrid systems. Thus, we further propose a model called hybrid quantum automata (HQA) that can be used to describe these hybrid systems that receive inputs (actions) from the outer world. We show the language equivalence problem of HQA is decidable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we apply this result to the trace equivalence problem of quantum Markov chains, and thus it is also decidable in polynomial time. Finally, we discuss model checking linear-time properties of quantum Markov chains, and show the quantitative analysis of regular safety properties can be addressed successfully.

abstract: We analyse the role of the dynamical Casimir effect as a resource for quantum technologies, such as quantum cryptography and quantum metrology. In particular, we consider the generation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and Gaussian interferometric power, two useful forms of asymmetric quantum correlations, in superconducting waveguides modulated by superconducting quantum interferometric devices. We show that, while a certain value of squeezing is required to overcome thermal noise and give rise to steering, any non-zero squeezing produces interferometric power which in fact increases with thermal noise.

abstract: The connection between the concepts underlying Interaction-Free Evolutions (IFE) and Decoherence-Free Subspaces (DFS) is explored, bringing to light similarities and differences. It is shown that IFE states and DFS can exist independently, in spite of the fact that both classes of states are connected with the idea of an interaction which is not felt. Inspired by a generalization of DFS already known, we introduce the notion of generalized IFE and provide some very simple examples that allow to better understand the relevant idea.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We propose a scheme for performing an entanglement-swapping operation within a quantum communications hub (a Bell like measurement) using an NV centre's $|\pm 1\rangle \leftrightarrow | A_2 \rangle$ optical transition. This is based on the heralded absorption of a photon resonant with that transition. The quantum efficiency of a single photon absorption is low but can be improved by placing the NV center inside a micro cavity to boost the interaction time and further by recycling the leaked photon back into the cavity after flipping its phase and/or polarisation. Throughout this process, the NV is repeatedly monitored via a QND measurement that heralds whether or not the photon absorption has succeeded. Upon success we know a destructive Bell measurement has occurred between that photon and NV center. Given low losses and a high per-pass absorption probability, this scheme allows the total success probability to approach unity. With long electron spin coherence times possible at low temperatures, this component could be useful within a memory-based quantum repeater or relay.

abstract: We demonstrate the trapping of cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms in a toroidal geometry using a rf-dressed quadrupole magnetic trap formed by superposing a strong radio frequency (rf) field on a quadrupole trap. This rf-dressed quadrupole trap has minimum of the potential away from the quadrupole trap centre on a circular path which facilitates the trapping in the toroidal geometry. In the experiments, the laser cooled atoms were first trapped in the quadrupole trap, then cooled evaporatively using a weak rf-field, and finally trapped in the rf-dressed quadrupole trap. The radius of the toroid could be varied by varying the frequency of the dressing rf-field. It has also been demonstrated that a single rf source and an antenna can be used for the rf-evaporative cooling as well as for rf-dressing of atoms. The atoms trapped in the toroidal trap may have applications in realization of an atom gyroscope as well as in studying the quantum gases in low dimensions.

abstract: The existence problem for mutually unbiased bases is an unsolved problem in quantum information theory. A related question is whether every pair of bases admits vectors that are unbiased to both. Mathematically this translates to the question whether two Lagrangian Clifford tori intersect, and a body of results exists concerning it. These (deep!) results are however rather weak when viewed from the point of view of the first problem. We make a detailed study of how the intersections behave in the simplest non-trivial case, that of complex projective 2-space (the qutrit), for which the set of Clifford tori can be usefully parametrized by the unistochastic subset of Birkhoff's polytope. An interesting picture emerges. A foray into higher dimensions is included.

abstract: Atoms deeply trapped in magic wavelength optical lattices provide a Doppler- and collision-free dense ensemble of quantum emitters ideal for high precision spectroscopy. Thus, they are the basis of some of the best optical clock setups to date. However, despite their minute optical dipole moments the inherent long range dipole-dipole interactions in such lattices generate line shifts, dephasing and modified decay. We show that in a perfectly filled lattice these effects are resonantly enhanced depending on lattice constant, lattice geometry and excitation scheme inducing clock shifts of many atomic linewidths and reducing measurement precision via superradiance. However, under optimal conditions collective effects can be exploited to yield zero effective shifts and prolong dipole lifetimes beyond the single atom decay. In particular we identify 2D hexagonal or square lattices with lattice constants below the optical wavelength as most promising configurations for an accuracy and precision well below the independent ensemble limit. This geometry should also be an ideal basis for related applications such as superradiant lasers, precision magnetometry or long lived quantum memories.

abstract: Prospects for reaching persistent entanglement between two spatially separated atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are outlined. The system set-up comprises of two condensates loaded in an optical lattice, which, in return, is confined within a high-Q optical resonator. The system is driven by an external laser that illuminates the atoms such that photons can scatter into the cavity. In the superradiant phase a cavity field is established and we show that the emerging cavity mediated interactions between the two condensates is capable of entangling them despite photon losses. This macroscopic atomic entanglement is sustained throughout the time-evolution apart from occasions of sudden deaths/births. Using an auxiliary photon mode and coupling it to a collective quadrature of the two condensates we demonstrate that the auxiliary mode's squeezing is proportional to the atomic entanglement and as such it can serve as a probe field of the macroscopic entanglement.

abstract: We present theoretical and experimental analysis of an interferometric measurement of the {\it in-situ} phase drop across and current flow through a rotating barrier in a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This experiment is the atomic analog of the rf-superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The phase drop is extracted from a spiral-shaped density profile created by the spatial interference of the expanding toroidal BEC and a reference BEC after release from all trapping potentials. We characterize the interferometer when it contains a single particle, which is initially in a coherent superposition of a torus and reference state, as well as when it contains a many-body state in the mean-field approximation. The single-particle picture is sufficient to explain the origin of the spirals, to relate the phase-drop across the barrier to the geometry of a spiral, and to bound the expansion times for which the {\it in-situ} phase can be accurately determined. Mean-field estimates and numerical simulations show that the inter-atomic interactions shorten the expansion time scales compared to the single-particle case. Finally, we compare the mean-field simulations with our experimental data and confirm that the interferometer indeed accurately measures the {\it in-situ} phase drop.

abstract: The retrieval of phases from intensity measurements is a key process in many fields in science, from optical microscopy to x-ray crystallography. Here we study phase retrieval of a one-dimensional multi-phase object that is illuminated by quantum states of light. We generalize the iterative Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to photon correlation measurements on the output plane, rather than the standard intensity measurements. We report a numerical comparison of classical and quantum phase retrieval of a small one-dimensional object of discrete phases from its far-field diffraction. While the classical algorithm was ambiguous and often converged to wrong solutions, quantum light produced a unique reconstruction with smaller errors and faster convergence. We attribute these improvements to a larger Hilbert space that constrains the algorithm.

abstract: We study an autonomous quantum system, which exhibits refrigeration under an information-work tradeoff like a Maxwell demon. The system becomes correlated as a single "demon" qubit interacts sequentially with memory qubits while in contact with two heat reservoirs of different temperatures. Using strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy, we derive a global Clausius inequality to show thermodynamical advantages from access to correlated information. It is demonstrated, in a matrix product density operator formalism, that our demon can simultaneously realize refrigeration against a thermal gradient and erasure of information from its memory, which is impossible without correlations. The phenomenon can be even enhanced by the presence of quantum coherence.

As a nonlocal descendant of the square well families endowed with Dirac (i.e., Hermitian) and with complex Robin (i.e., non-Hermitian but still local) boundary conditions, the model is shown characterized by the survival of solvability in combination with an enhanced spectral-design flexibility. The solvability incorporates also the feasibility of closed-form constructions of the physical Hilbert-space inner products rendering the time-evolution unitary.

abstract: A continuous wave atom laser formed by the outcoupling of atoms from a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) potentially has a range of metrological applications. However, in order for the device to be truly continuous, a mechanism to replenish the atoms in the BEC is required. Here we calculate the temporal coherence properties of a continuously pumped atom laser beam outcoupled from a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate which is replenished from a reservoir at finite temperature. We find that the thermal fluctuations of the condensate can significantly decrease the temporal coherence of the output beam due to atomic interactions between the trapped BEC and the beam, and this can impact the metrological usefulness of the device. We demonstrate that a Raman outcoupling scheme imparting a sufficient momentum kick to the atom laser beam can lead to a significantly reduced linewidth.

abstract: The importance of models with an exact solution for the study of materials with non-trivial topological properties has been extensively demonstrated. Among these, the Kitaev model of a one-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor plays a guiding role in the search for Majorana modes in condensed matter systems. Also, the $sp$ chain, with an anti-symmetric mixing among the $s$ and $p$ bands provides a paradigmatic example of a topological insulator with well understood properties. There is an intimate relation between these two models and in particular their topological quantum phase transitions share the same universality class. Here we consider a two-band $sp$ model of spinless fermions with an attractive (inter-band) interaction. Both the interaction and hybridization between the $s$ and $p$ fermions are anti-symmetric. The zero temperature phase diagram of the model presents a variety of phases including a Weyl superconductor, topological insulator and trivial phases. The quantum phase transitions between these phases can be either continuous or discontinuous. We show that the transition from the topological superconducting phase to the trivial one has critical exponents different from those of an equivalent transition in Kitaev's model.

abstract: We report on the fabrication of quantum photonic integrated circuits based on suspended GaAs membranes. The fabrication process consists of a single lithographic step followed by inductively-coupled-plasma dry etching through an electron-beam-resist mask and wet etching of a sacrificial layer. This method does not require depositing, etching, and stripping a hard mask, greatly reducing fabrication time and costs, while at the same time yielding devices of excellent structural quality. We discuss in detail the procedures for cleaning the resist residues caused by the plasma etching and present a statistical analysis of the etched feature size after each fabrication step.

We look at states of the system whose correlations with respect to the channel have a certain symmetry. Then we show that detailed balance holds if the Kraus operators satisfy a very interesting algebraic relation which plays an important role in the representation theory of any compact quantum group.

abstract: A single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle obeys the Dirac equation in $d\ge 1$ spatial dimension and is bound by an attractive central monotone potential which vanishes at infinity (in one dimension the potential is even). This work refines the relativistic comparison theorems which were derived by Hall \cite{p75}. The new theorems allow the graphs of the two comparison potentials $V_a$ and $V_b$ to crossover in a controlled way and still imply the spectral ordering $E_a\le E_b$ for the eigenvalues at the bottom of each angular momentum subspace. More specifically in a simplest case we have: in dimension $d=1$, if $\int_0^x (V_b(t)-V_a(t)) dt\ge 0,\ x\in [0,\ \infty)$, then $E_a\le E_b$; and in $d>1$ dimensions, if $\int_0^r (V_b(t)-V_a(t))t^{2|k_d|} dt\ge 0,\ r\in [0,\ \infty)$, where $k_d=\tau\left(j+\frac{d-2}{2}\right)$ and $\tau=\pm 1$, then $E_a\le E_b$.

The arithmetics allows one to define calculus and algebra intrinsic to the fractal in question, and one can formulate classical and quantum physics within the fractal set. In particular, fractals in space-time can be generated by means of homogeneous spaces associated with appropriate Lie groups. The construction is illustrated by explicit examples.

With interaction, we show that there remains a unique stationary state in the thermodynamic limit, i.e. absence of phase coexistence, and the relaxation towards it is exponentially fast for local observables. We do not assume that the quantum Markov process is reversible (detailed balance) w.r.t. a local Hamiltonian.

abstract: Quantum fluctuations of local quantities can be a direct signature of entanglement in an extended quantum many-body system. Hence they may serve as a theoretical (as well as an experimental) tool to detect the spatial properties of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. In the ground state of quantum many-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the subsystem (area law). Here we propose a microscopic insight into the spatial structure of entanglement and fluctuations using the concept of \emph{contour}, recently introduced to decompose the bipartite entanglement entropy of lattice free fermions between two extended regions $A$ and $B$ into contributions from single sites in $A$. We generalize the notion of contour to the entanglement of any quadratic (bosonic or fermionic) lattice Hamiltonian, as well as to particle-number fluctuations. The entanglement and fluctuations contours are found to generally decay when moving away from the boundary between $A$ and $B$. We show that in the case of free fermions the decay of the entanglement contour follows closely that of the fluctuation contour. In the case of Bose-condensed interacting bosons, treated via the Bogoliubov and spin-wave approximations, such a link cannot be established -- fluctuation and entanglement contours are found to be radically different, as they lead to a logarithmically violated area law for fluctuations, and to a strict area law of entanglement. Analyzing in depth the role of the zero-energy Goldstone mode of spin-wave theory, and of the corresponding lowest-energy mode in the entanglement spectrum, we unveil a subtle interplay between the special contour and energy scaling of the latter, and universal additive logarithmic corrections to entanglement area law discussed extensively in the recent literature.

abstract: The behaviour of a relativistic scalar particle in a possible scenario that arises from the violation of the Lorentz symmetry is investigated. The background of the Lorentz symmetry violation is defined by a tensor field that governs the Lorentz symmetry violation out of the Standard Model Extension. Thereby, we show that a Coulomb-type potential can be induced by Lorentz symmetry breaking effects and bound states solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation can be obtained. Further, we discuss the effects of this Coulomb-type potential on the confinement of the relativistic scalar particle to a linear confining potential by showing that bound states solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation can also be achieved, and obtain a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of a parameter of the linear confining potential on the quantum numbers $\left\{n,l\right\}$ of the system.

abstract: The Lagrange-mesh method has the simplicity of a calculation on a mesh and can have the accuracy of a variational method. It is applied to the study of a confined helium atom. Two types of confinement are considered. Soft confinements by potentials are studied in perimetric coordinates. Hard confinement in impenetrable spherical cavities is studied in a system of rescaled perimetric coordinates varying in [0,1] intervals. Energies and mean values of the distances between electrons and between an electron and the helium nucleus are calculated. A high accuracy of 11 to 15 significant figures is obtained with small computing times. Pressures acting on the confined atom are also computed. For sphere radii smaller than 1, their relative accuracies are better than $10^{-10}$. For larger radii up to 10, they progressively decrease to $10^{-3}$, still improving the best literature results.

abstract: Classifying the information content of neural spike trains in a linguistic endeavor, an uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration. This uncertainty is associated with the task of synchronizing the spike trains of different duration representing different words. The uncertainty involves peculiar quantum features, so that word comparison amounts to measurement-based-quantum computation. Such a quantum behavior explains the onset and decay of the memory window connecting successive pieces of a linguistic text. The behavior here discussed is applicable to other reported evidences of quantum effects in human linguistic processes, so far lacking a plausible framework, since either no efforts to assign an appropriate quantum constant had been associated or speculating on microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic decoherence times.

Concerning the electronic-vibrational quantum mixtures, the impact of protein-induced fluctuations was examined by calculating the 2D electronic spectra of a weakly coupled dimer with vibrational modes in the resonant condition [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 212403 (2015)]. This analysis demonstrated that quantum mixtures of the vibronic resonance are rather robust under the influence of the fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures, whereas the mixtures are eradicated by the fluctuations at physiological temperatures. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized because the magnitude of the coupling inducing the quantum mixtures is proportional to the inter-pigment coupling. In this study, we explore the impact of the fluctuations on electronic-vibrational quantum mixtures in a strongly coupled dimer. with an off-resonant vibrational mode. Toward this end, we calculate electronic energy transfer (EET) dynamics and 2D electronic spectra of a dimer that corresponds to the most strongly coupled bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex in a numerically accurate manner. The quantum mixtures are found to be robust under the exposure of protein-induced fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures, irrespective of the resonance. At 300 K, however, the quantum mixing is disturbed more strongly by the fluctuations, and therefore, the beats in the 2D spectra become obscure even in a strongly coupled dimer with a resonant vibrational mode. Further, the overall behaviors of the EET dynamics are demonstrated to be dominated by the environment and coupling between the 0-0 vibronic transitions as long as the Huang-Rhys factor of the vibrational mode is small.

abstract: We consider integer quantum Hall states and calculate bulk entanglement spectrum by formulating the correlation matrix in guiding center representation. Our analytical approach is based on the projection operator with redefining the inner product of states in Hilbert space to take care of the restriction imposed by the (rectangle-tiled) checkerboard partition. The resultant correlation matrix contains the coupling constants between states of different guiding centers parameterized by magnetic length and the period of partition. We find various band-crossings by tuning the flux $\Phi$ threading each chekerborad pixel and by changing filling factor $\nu$. When $\nu=1$ and $\Phi=2\pi$, or $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=\pi$, one Dirac band crossing is found. For $\nu=1$ and $\Phi=\pi$, the band crossings are in the form of nodal line, enclosing the Brillouin zone. As for $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=2\pi$, the doubled Dirac point, or the quadratic point, is seen. Besides, we infer that the quadratic point is protected by C$_4$ symmetry of the checkerboard partition since it evolves into two separate Dirac points when the symmetry is lowered to C$_2$. In addition, we also identify the emerging symmetries responsible for the symmetric bulk entanglement spectra, which are absent in the underlying quantum Hall states.

abstract: A tunable double optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) with a squeezed field is investigated in a system consisting of an optomechanical cavity coupled to a charged nanomechanical resonator via Coulomb interaction. Such a double OMIT can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the Coulomb interaction, and observed even with a single-photon squeezed field at finite temperature. Since it is robust against the cavity decay, but very sensitive to some parameters, such as the environmental temperature, the model under our consideration can be applied as a quantum thermometer for precision measurement of the environmental temperature within the reach of current techniques.

abstract: We derive a local-time path-integral representation for a generic one-dimensional time-independent system. In particular, we show how to rephrase the matrix elements of the Bloch density matrix as a path integral over x-dependent local-time profiles. The latter quantify the time that the sample paths x(t) in the Feynman path integral spend in the vicinity of an arbitrary point x. Generalization of the local-time representation that includes arbitrary functionals of the local time is also provided. We argue that the results obtained represent a powerful alternative to the traditional Feynman-Kac formula, particularly in the high and low temperature regimes. To illustrate this point, we apply our local-time representation to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bloch density matrix at low temperatures. Further salient issues, such as connections with the Sturm-Liouville theory and the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle are also discussed.

abstract: We introduce a single-channel opening in a random Hamiltonian and a quantized chaotic map: localization on the opening occurs as a sensible deviation of the wavefunction statistics from the predictions of random matrix theory, even in the semiclassical limit. Increasing the coupling to the open channel in the quantum model, we observe a similar picture to resonance trapping, made of few fast-decaying states, whose left (right) eigenfunctions are entirely localized on the (preimage of the) opening, and plentiful long-lived states, whose probability density is instead suppressed at the opening. For the latter we derive and test a linear relation between the wavefunction intensities and the decay rates, similar to Breit-Wigner law. We then analyze the statistics of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding (discretized) classical propagator, finding a similar behavior to the quantum system only in the weak-coupling regime.

abstract: Schwinger's trick in quantum field theory can be easily implemented in the case of scalar theories in D-dimension, with exponential interactions, such as $\mu^D\exp(\alpha\phi)$. The key point is the relation $$ \exp\big(\alpha{\delta\over \delta J(x)}\big)\exp(-Z_0[J])=\exp(-Z_0[J+\alpha_x]) $$ with $J$ the external source, and $\alpha_x(y)=\alpha\delta(y-x)$. Such a shift, related to the normal ordering of $\exp(\alpha\phi)$, leads to an exact scaling relation by renormalizing $\mu$. The theory exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking of space-time translations, due to the fact that the vacuum is filled in by infinitely many point-like sources $\alpha_x(y)$. This suggests that the vev of the energy-momentum tensor of the purely scalar part of the Higgs lagrangian, proposed in arXiv:1506.05761, may explain the origin of the cosmological constant. In this respect, we derive the expression of $\langle\phi(x)\rangle$, compute its space-time integral, and prove that $x$-dependent contributions to $\langle\phi(x)\rangle$ start only at $\alpha^5$. Next, we derive a new formulation of perturbation theory for the potentials $V(\phi)=\lambda:\phi^n:$, using the partition function associated to $:\exp(\alpha\phi):$. The $\Delta_F(0)$ related to the normal ordering are absorbed at once. The functional derivatives with respect to $J$ are explicitly computed and the Green's functions are expressed in terms of combinatorics involving ordinary derivatives. Finally, we note that the Feynman propagator can be seen as building block for a metric on suitable moduli spaces. In the two-dimensional case, this shows a connection with the moduli space of punctured spheres and with the underlying Liouville theory. The present investigation can be extended to more general quantum field theories.

abstract: We show that confluent Darboux-Crum transformations with emergent Jordan states are an effective tool for the design of optical systems governed by the Helmholtz equation under the paraxial approximation. The construction of generic, asymptotically real and periodic, $PT$-symmetric systems with local complex periodicity defects is discussed in detail. We show how the decay rate of the defect is related with the energy of the bound state trapped by the defect. In particular, the bound states in the continuum are confined by the periodicity defects with power law decay. We show that these defects possess complete invisibility; the wave functions of the system coincide asymptotically with the wave functions of the undistorted setting. The general results are illustrated with explicit examples of reflectionless models and systems with one spectral gap. We show that the spectral properties of the studied models are reflected by Lax-Novikov-type integrals of motion and associated supersymmetric structures of bosonized and exotic nature.

abstract: We have constructed an asymmetric matter-wave beam splitter and a ring potential on an atom chip with Bose-Einstein condensates using radio-frequency dressing. By applying rf-field parallel to the quantization axis in the vicinity of the static trap minima added to perpendicular rf-fields, versatile controllability on the potentials is realized. Asymmetry of the rf-induced double well is manipulated without discernible displacement of the each well along horizontal and vertical direction. Formation of an isotropic ring potential on an atom chip is achieved by compensating the gradient due to gravity and inhomogeneous coupling strength. In addition, position and rotation velocity of a BEC along the ring geometry are controlled by the relative phase and the frequency difference between the rf-fields, respectively.

abstract: The confluent SUSY QM usually involves a second-order SUSY transformation where the two factorization energies converge to a single value. In order to achieve it, one needs to solve an indefinite integral, which limits the actual systems to which it can be applied. Not so long ago, an alternative method to achieve this transformation was developed through a Wronskian differential formula [Phys Lett. A 3756 (2012) 692]. In this work, we consider the k-confluent SUSY transformation, where k factorization energies merge to a single value, and we develop a generalized Wronskian differential formula for this case. Furthermore, we explicitly work out the third- and fourth-order cases and we present as examples the free particle and the single-gap Lam\'e potentials.

abstract: Using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDMRG) we theoretically study the collision of a one-dimensional gas of interacting bosons with an impurity trapped in a shallow box potential. We study the dynamic response of both the impurity and the bosonic gas and find an approximate independence of the sign of the interaction (attractive or repulsive) between the impurity and the bosons. This sign-independence breaks down when the interaction energy is of the same order as the box potential depth, leading to resonant pair tunneling. Our predictions can be tested using contemporary techniques with ultracold atoms.

abstract: Light transport in periodic waveguides coupled to a two-level atom is investigated. By using optical Bloch equations and a photonic modal formalism, we derive semi-analytical expressions for the scattering matrix of one atom trapped in a periodic waveguide. The derivation is general, as the expressions hold for any periodic photonic or plasmonic waveguides. It provides a basic building block to study collective effects arising from photon-mediated multi-atom interactions in periodic waveguides.

abstract: Understanding and manipulating work fluctuations in microscale and nanoscale systems are of both fundamental and practical interest. For example, in considering the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-\beta W} \rangle=e^{-\beta \Delta F}$, a change in the fluctuations of $e^{-\beta W}$ may impact on how fast the statistical average of $e^{-\beta W}$ converges towards the theoretical value $e^{-\beta \Delta F}$, where $W$ is the work, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $\Delta F$ is free energy difference between two equilibrium states. Motivated by our previous study aiming at the suppression of work fluctuations, here we obtain a principle of minimal work fluctuations. In brief, adiabatic processes as treated in quantum and classical adiabatic theorems yield the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$. In the quantum domain, if a system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium is subject to a work protocol but isolated from a bath during the time evolution, then a quantum adiabatic process without energy level crossing (or an assisted adiabatic process reaching the same final states as in a conventional adiabatic process) yields the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$, where $W$ is the quantum work defined by two energy measurements in the beginning and at the end of the process. In the classical domain where the classical work protocol is realizable by an adiabatic process, then the classical adiabatic process also yields the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$. Numerical experiments based on a Landau-Zener process confirm our theory in the quantum domain, and our theory in the classical domain explains our previous numerical findings regarding the suppression of classical work fluctuations [G.~Y.~Xiao and J.~B.~Gong, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 90}, 052132 (2014)].

abstract: Long sequences of successive direct (projective) measurements or observations of a few "uninteresting" physical quantities of a quantum system may reveal indirect, but precise and unambiguous information on the values of some very "interesting" observables of the system. In this paper, the mathematics underlying this claim is developed; i.e., we attempt to contribute to a mathematical theory of indirect and, in particular, non-demolition measurements in quantum mechanics. Our attempt leads us to make novel uses of classical notions and results of probability theory, such as the "algebra of functions measurable at infinity", the Central Limit Theorem, results concerning relative entropy and its role in the theory of large deviations, etc.

abstract: We study positive kernels on $X\times X$, where $X$ is a set equipped with an action of a group, and taking values in the set of $\mathcal A$-sesquilinear forms on a (not necessarily Hilbert) module over a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$. These maps are assumed to be covariant with respect to the group action on $X$ and a representation of the group in the set of invertible ($\mathcal A$-linear) module maps. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for extremality of such kernels in certain convex subsets of positive covariant kernels. Our focus is mainly on a particular example of these kernels: a completely positive (CP) covariant map for which we obtain a covariant minimal dilation (or KSGNS construction). We determine the extreme points of the set of normalized covariant CP maps and, as a special case, study covariant quantum observables and instruments whose value space is a transitive space of a unimodular type-I group. As an example, we discuss the case of instruments that are covariant with respect to a square-integrable representation.

abstract: We consider a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice as a quantum simulator for electron-positron pair production in quantum electrodynamics (QED). For a setup in one spatial dimension, we investigate the nonequilibrium phenomenon of pair production including the backreaction leading to plasma oscillations. Unlike previous investigations on quantum link models, we focus on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of QED and show that it may be well approximated by experiments employing Bose-Einstein condensates interacting with fermionic atoms. The calculations based on functional integral techniques give a unique access to the physical parameters required to realize the QED phenomena in a cold atom experiment. In particular, we use our approach to consider quantum link models in a yet unexplored parameter regime and give bounds for their ability to capture essential features of the physics. The results suggest a paradigmatic change towards realizations using coherent many-body states rather than single atoms for quantum simulations of high-energy particle physics phenomena.

abstract: Optical measurement of the motion of a 940 kHz mechanical resonance of a silicon nitride nanostring resonator is demonstrated with a read out noise imprecision reaching 37 dB below that of the resonator's zero-point fluctuations. Via intensity modulation of the optical probe laser, radiation pressure feedback is used to cool and damp the mechanical mode from an initial room temperature occupancy of $\bar{n}_{b} = 6.5 \times 10^6$ ($T_{b}=295$K) down to a phonon occupation of $\langle n \rangle = 66 \pm 10$, representing a mode temperature of $T_{m} \approx 3$mK. The five decades of cooling is enabled by the system's large single-photon cooperativity $(C_{1} = 4)$ and high quantum efficiency of optical motion detection ($\eta_{t} = 0.27$).

abstract: The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of finite ultracold bosonic ensembles in periodically driven one-dimensional optical lattices is investigated. Our study reveals that the driving enforces the bosons in different wells to oscillate in-phase and to exhibit a dipole-like mode. A wide range from weak-to-strong driving frequencies is covered and a resonance-like behaviour of the intra-well dynamics is discussed. In the proximity of the resonance a rich intraband excitation spectrum is observed. The single particle excitation mechanisms are studied in the framework of Floquet theory elucidating the role of the driving frequency. The impact of the interatomic repulsive interactions is examined in detail yielding a strong influence on the tunneling period and the excitation probabilities. Finally, the dependence of the resonance upon a variation of the tunable parameters of the optical lattice is examined. Our analysis is based on the ab-initio Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree Method for bosons.

abstract: Sums of matrix elements of spin-dependent two-body momentum-independent interactions and sums of their products are calculated analytically in the basis of many-body states with given total spin --- the states built from spin and spatial wavefunctions belonging to multidimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group, unless the total spin has the maximal allowed value. As in the first part of the series [V. A. Yurovsky, Phys. Rev. A 91, 053601 (2015)], the sum dependence on the many-body states is given by universal factors, which are independent of the Hamiltonians of non-interacting particles. The sum rules are applied to perturbative analysis of energy spectra and to calculation of two-body spin-dependent local correlations.

abstract: The existence of twisted light may be inferred from modern quantum concepts and experimental data. These waves possess energy, impulse and angular momentum. However, the Maxwell's four-dimensional theory of electromagnetism does not imply the existence of waves with these properties. This article develops a model generalizing the theory of electromagnetism in such a way that it would be possible to obtain equations of twisted electromagnetic waves. Generalization is implemented by introduction of a space-time with a more complex structure compared to the four-dimensional space-time. Such spaces include a seven-dimensional space-time, which allows to describe not only translational, but also rotational motion of bodies. A model developed by the author provides the following results: 1) generalization of the theory of electromagnetism in which it is possible to obtain equations of twisted light waves, 2) solution describing interference of light waves oppositely twisted, 3) the formula relating the energy, impulse and angular momentum of electromagnetic wave, 4) justification of a new phenomenon - redshift due to electromagnetic waves screwing.

abstract: Since the advent of atom laser-cooling, trapping or cooling natural molecules has been a long standing and challenging goal. Here, we demonstrate a method for laser-trapping molecules that is radically novel in its configuration, in its underlined physical dynamics and in its outcomes. It is based on self-optically spatially-nanostructured high pressure molecular hydrogen confined in hollow-core photonic-crystal-fibre. An accelerating molecular-lattice is formed by a periodic potential associated with Raman saturation except for a 1-dimentional array of nanometer wide and strongly-localizing sections. In these sections, molecules with a speed of as large as 1800 m/s are trapped, and stimulated Raman scattering in the Lamb-Dicke regime occurs to generate high power forward and backward-Stokes continuous-wave laser with sideband-resolved sub-Doppler emission spectrum. The spectrum exhibits a central line with a sub-recoil linewidth of as low as 14 kHz, more than 5 orders-of-magnitude narrower than in conventional Raman scattering, and sidebands comprising Mollow triplet, molecular motional-sidebands and four-wave-mixing.

The boundary states in conformal field theories play a crucial role in our formulation and the bulk diffeomorphism is naturally taken into account. We give an identification of bulk local operators which reproduces correct scalar field solutions on AdS3 and bulk scalar propagators. We also calculate the information metric for a locally excited state and show that it is given by that of 2d hyperbolic manifold, which is argued to describe the time slice of AdS3.

abstract: For a unital completely positive map $\Phi$ ("quantum channel") governing the time propagation of a quantum system, the Stinespring representation gives an enlarged system evolving unitarily. We argue that the Stinespring representations of each power $\Phi^m$ of the single map together encode the structure of the original quantum channel and provides an interaction-dependent model for the bath. The same bath model gives a "classical limit" at infinite time $m\to\infty$ in the form of a noncommutative "manifold" determined by the channel. In this way a simplified analysis of the system can be performed by making the large-$m$ approximation. These constructions are based on a noncommutative generalization of Berezin quantization. The latter is shown to involve very fundamental aspects of quantum-information theory, which are thereby put in a completely new light.

abstract: The statistics photons in the resonance fluorescence of a qubit excited by microwave and radio-frequency (RF) fields have been studied. It has been established that the coherent dissipative dynamics of the qubit with allowance for multiphoton emission and absorption of RF photons in each act of emission and absorption of a microwave photon results in periodic alternation of photon bunching and antibunching. It has been shown that periodically varying statistics photons can be smoothly transformed to the purely sub-Poisson statistics by varying the parameters of the RF field. The conditions for the formation of the "collapse-revival" of oscillations in the second-order correlation function photons have been determined. The described effects can be implemented on spin and superconducting qubits, quantum dots, and qubit-mechanical hybrid systems.

abstract: We analyze mathematical and physical properties of a previously introduced [J. Phys. A47, 115302 (2014)] family of $U(4)$ coherent states (CS). They constitute a matrix version of standard spin $U(2)$ CS when we add an extra (pseudospin) dichotomous degree of freedom: layer, sublattice, two-well, nucleon, etc. Applications to bilayer quantum Hall systems at fractions of filling factor $\nu=2$ are discussed, where Haldane's sphere picture is generalized to a Grassmannian picture. We also extend Wehrl's definition of entropy from Glauber to Grassmannian CS and state a conjecture on the entropy lower bound.

We show that the presence of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in classical field theories produces quasi-integrable excitations with asymptotically conserved charges.

abstract: We explore the constraints following from requiring the Area Law in the entanglement entropy in the context of loop quantum gravity. We find a unique solution to the single link wave-function in the large j limit, believed to be appropriate in the semi-classical limit. We then generalize our considerations to multi-link coherent states, and find that the area law is preserved very generically using our single link wave-function as a building block. Finally, we develop the framework that generates families of multi-link states that preserve the area law while avoiding macroscopic entanglement, the space-time analogue of "Schroedinger cat". We note that these states, defined on a given set of graphs, are the ground states of some local Hamiltonian that can be constructed explicitly. This can potentially shed light on the construction of the appropriate Hamiltonian constraints in the LQG framework.

abstract: It has recently been demonstrated that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can interact with superconducting qubits at the quantum level. SAW resonators in the GHz frequency range have also been found to have low loss at temperatures compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. These advances open up new possibilities to use the phonon degree of freedom to carry quantum information. In this paper, we give a description of the basic SAW components needed to develop quantum circuits, where propagating or localized SAW-phonons are used both to study basic physics and to manipulate quantum information. Using phonons instead of photons offers new possibilities which make these quantum acoustic circuits very interesting. We discuss general considerations for SAW experiments at the quantum level and describe experiments both with SAW resonators and with interaction between SAWs and a qubit. We also discuss several potential future developments.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.01637
abstract: We consider a \textit{PT}-symmetric cubic oscillator with an imaginary double well. We prove the existence of an infinite number of level crossings with a definite selection rule. Decreasing the positive parameter $\hbar$ from large values, at a value $\hbar_n$ we find the crossing of the pair of levels $(E_{2n+1}(\hbar),E_{2n}(\hbar))$ becoming the pair of levels $(E_n^+(\hbar),E_n^-(\hbar))$. For large parameters, a level is a holomorphic function $E_m(\hbar)$ with different semiclassical behaviors, $E_j^\pm(\hbar),$ along different paths. The corresponding $m$-nodes delocalized state $\psi_m(\hbar)$ behaves along the same paths as the semiclassical $j$-nodes states $\psi_j^\pm(\hbar),$ localized at one of the wells $x_\pm$ respectively. In particular, if the crossing parameter $\hbar_n$ is by-passed from above, the levels $E_{2n+(1/2)\pm(1/2)}(\hbar)$ have respectively the semiclassical behaviors of the levels $E_n^\mp(\hbar)$ along the real axis. These results are obtained by the control of the nodes. There is evidence that the parameters $\hbar_n$ accumulate at zero and the accumulation point of the corresponding energies is aninstability point of a subset of the Stokes complex called the monochord, consisting of the vibrating string and the sound board.

abstract: We explore properties of the universal terms in the entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity in 4d CFTs, aiming to clarify the ways in which they behave like the analogous entanglement measures in quantum mechanics. We show that, unlike entanglement entropy in finite-dimensional systems, the sign of the universal part of entanglement entropy is indeterminate. In particular, if and only if the central charges obey $a>c$, the entanglement across certain classes of entangling surfaces can become arbitrarily negative, depending on the geometry and topology of the surface. The negative contribution is proportional to the product of $a-c$ and the genus of the surface. Similarly, we show that in $a>c$ theories, the logarithmic negativity does not always exceed the entanglement entropy.

abstract: We study the entanglement spectrum of highly excited eigenstates of a one-dimensional random-field Heisenberg model which exhibits a many-body localization transition. Our results indicate that the entanglement spectrum shows a "two-component" structure: a universal part that is associated to Random Matrix Theory, and a non-universal part that is model dependent. The non-universal part manifests the deviation of the highly excited eigenstate from a true random state even in the thermalized phase where the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis holds. The fraction of the spectrum containing the universal part decreases continuously as one approaches the many-body localization transition and vanishes at the critical point. We use the universal part fraction to construct an order parameter for the many-body delocalized-to-localized transition. A toy model based on a spin glass is also presented to illustrate the emergence of the "two-component" structure in the entanglement spectrum of not completely random excited quantum states.

abstract: A single spinless particle obeys the Klein--Gordon equation in $d \ge 1$ spatial dimensions and is bound by an attractive central monotone potential that vanishes at infinity ( in one dimension, the potential is even). This work refines relativistic comparison theorems which were derived by Hall and Aliyu \cite{HallComp}. The new theorems allow the graphs of the two comparison potentials $V_a$ and $V_b$ to crossover in a controlled way and still imply spectral ordering $E_a\le E_b$ for positive eigenvalues at the bottom of each angular momentum subspace. More specifically in a simplest case we have, in one dimension, if $\int_0^x (V_b(t)-V_a(t)) dt\ge 0,\ x\in [0,\ \infty)$, then $E_a\le E_b$; in $d>1$ dimensions, if $\int_0^r (V_b(t)-V_a(t))t^{d-1} dt\ge 0,\ i=a$ or $b,\ r\in[0,\ \infty)$, then $E_a\le E_b$. Sharper bounds are constructed for cases where one of the wave functions is known.

abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectra provide a wealth of information on the electronic structure. The extraction of molecular details requires adequate theoretical methods, which in case of transition metal complexes has to account for effects due to the multi-configurational and spin-mixed nature of the many-electron wave function. Here, the Restricted Active Space Self-Consistent Field method including spin-orbit coupling is used to cope with this challenge and to calculate valence and core photoelectron spectra. The intensities are estimated within the frameworks of the Dyson orbital formalism and the sudden approximation. Thereby, we utilize an efficient computational algorithm that is based on a biorthonormal basis transformation. The approach is applied to the valence photoionization of the gas phase water molecule and to the core ionization spectrum of the $\text{[Fe(H}_2\text{O)}_6\text{]}^{2+}$ complex. The results show good agreement with the experimental data obtained in this work, whereas the sudden approximation demonstrates distinct deviations from experiments.

A summary of the systematic effects contributing to the measurement is given and the optimal experimental conditions for mitigating those effects in order to reach a competitive measurement of $k_B$ at a part per million accuracy level are outlined.

abstract: We theoretically analyze a discrete Schr\"odinger chain with hopping to the first and second neighbors, as can be realized with zigzag arrangements of optical waveguides or lattice sites for cold atoms. Already at moderate values, the second-neighbor hopping has a strong impact on the band structure, leading to the emergence of a new extremum located inside the band, accompanied by a van Hove singularity in the density of states. The energy band is then divided into a subcritical regime with the usual unique correspondence between wave number and energy of the travelling waves, and a supercritical regime, in which waves of different wave number are degenerate in energy. We study the consequences of these features in a scattering setup, introducing a defect that locally breaks the translational invariance. The notion of a local probability current is generalized beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation and bound states with energies outside the band are discussed. At subcritical energies inside the band, an evanescent mode coexists with the travelling plane wave, giving rise to resonance phenomena in scattering. At weak coupling to the defect, we identify a prototypical Fano-Feshbach resonance of tunable shape and provide analytical expressions for its profile parameters. At supercritical energies, we observe coupling of the degenerate travelling waves, leading to an intricate wave packet fragmentation dynamics. The corresponding branching ratios are analyzed.

A PT-symmetric reinterpretation of these models at a quantum-mechanical level eliminates these instabilities and suggests that these instabilities may also be tamed at the quantum-field-theory level.

The solution is obtained in the form of two algebraic Riccati equations. Relevant examples involving dynamic squeezers are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our method.

abstract: We investigate the spontaneous emission rate of a two-level quantum emitter near a graphene-coated substrate under the influence of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the application of the magnetic field can substantially increase or decrease the decay rate. We show that a suppression as large as 99$\%$ in the Purcell factor is achieved even for moderate magnetic fields. The emitter's lifetime is a discontinuous function of $|{\bf B}|$, which is a direct consequence of the occurrence of discrete Landau levels in graphene. We demonstrate that, in the near-field regime, the magnetic field enables an unprecedented control of the decay pathways into which the photon/polariton can be emitted. Our findings strongly suggest that a magnetic field could act as an efficient agent for on-demand, active control of light-matter interactions in graphene at the quantum level.

abstract: One of the great challenges of electronic structure theory is the search for the exact functional of density functional theory (DFT). Its existence is undoubted but it is hard to even conceptualize it as it is a surface in a massively multidimensional space. However, the asymmetric two-site Hubbard model has a two-dimensional universe of density matrices and the exact functional simply becomes a function of two variables whose landscape can be calculated, visualized and explored. This one unique surface contains all the possible physics of any system in this universe. A walk on this landscape, moved to the angle of any one-electron Hamiltonian, gives a valley whose minimum is the exact total energy. We show concrete examples of pure-state density matrices that are not v-representable due to the underlying non-convex nature of the exact functional. Using the Perdew, Parr, Levy and Balduz extension to fractional ensembles we calculate the exact functional for all numbers of electrons. The derivative discontinuity becomes an explicit physical feature that demonstrates clearly how the exact functional itself gives the fundamental gap.

abstract: We study the Hawking radiation in field theories which break Lorentz invariance via dissipative effects above a certain energy scale. We assume that the additional degrees of freedom which cause dissipation are Gaussian and freely falling. The asymptotic spectrum and the correlations are extracted from the anticommutator of the radiation field. The singular behavior of the Green function found for relativistic fields as one point crosses the horizon is completely suppressed by dissipation. Yet, when the dissipative frequency scale is much larger than the surface gravity of the black hole, we show that the asymptotic observables acquire their standard (relativistic) vacuum expectation values. We explicitly compute the effects of dissipation on the spectrum and on the nonseparable character of the correlations when varying the dissipative scale, the extension of the near-horizon geometry, and the temperature of the environment.

We use the observed vacuum Rabi splitting to make non-destructive measurements of atomic population with the equivalent of projection-noise limited sensitivity and minimal heating ($<0.01$ photon recoils/atom). This technique may be used to enhance the performance of optical lattice clocks by generating entangled states and reducing dead time.

abstract: We examine mixedness and entanglement of the chronology-respecting (CR) system with assuming that quantum mechanical closed timelike curves (CTCs) exist in nature and by introducing the qubit system and applying the general controlled operations between CR and CTC systems. We use the magnitude of Bloch vector as a measure of mixedness. While Deutschian-CTC (D-CTC) either preserves or decreases the magnitude, postselected-CTC (P-CTC) can increases it. Nonintuitively, even the completely mixed CR-qubit can be converted into a pure state after CTC-qubit travels around the P-CTC. It is also shown that while D-CTC cannot increase the entanglement of CR system, P-CTC can increase it. Surprisingly, any partially entangled state can be maximally entangled pure state if P-CTC exists. Thus, distillation of P-CTC-assisted entanglement can be easily achieved without preparing the multiple copies of the partially entangled state.

abstract: Spatial gaps correspond to the projection in position space of the gaps of a periodic structure whose envelope varies spatially. They can be easily generated in cold atomic physics using finite-size optical lattice, and provide a new kind of tunnel barriers which can be used as a versatile tool for quantum devices. We present in detail different theoretical methods to quantitatively describe these systems, and show how they can be used to realize in one dimension matter wave Fabry-Perot cavities. We also provide experimental and numerical results that demonstrate the interest of spatial gaps structures for phase space engineering. We then generalize the concept of spatial gaps in two dimensions and show that this enables to design multiply connected cavities which generate a quantum dot structure for atoms or allow to construct curved wave guides for matter waves. At last, we demonstrate that modulating in time the amplitude of the periodic structure offers a wide variety of possible atom manipulations including the control of the scattering of an incoming wave packet, the loading of cavities delimited by spatial gaps, their coupling by multiphonon processes or the realization of a tunable source of atoms. This large range of possibilities offered by space and time engineering of optical lattices demonstrates the flexibility of such band gap structures for matter wave control, quantum simulators and atomtronics.

abstract: Here we propose a pair of experiments to distinguish the recently proposed "slicing theory" of quantum measurement, which gives a transient many worlds picture, and decoherence. Since these two theories are essentially "opposites" in their approach and both claim to arise from the many body Schr\"odinger equation itself, there is no chance of them being equivalent representations of the same reality. It will be explicitly shown that each theory gives very different answers to the questions of back reaction and revival of phase effects after measurement. We suggest that the kinds of isolated systems now possible in optical traps is now sufficient to generate a selective distinction between these two theories. In particular we show that the slicing theory gives examples of interference from "revival of histories" in controlled examples but no back reaction on the measurement devices whereas decoherence gives the opposite.

So that, the chemical descriptors based on their derivatives present the hamper of discontinuities for isolated systems and consequently higher order derivatives are undefined. The introduction of the interaction between the physical domain with an environment induces a coherent structure for the density matrix in the grand-canonical formulation suppressing the discontinuities leading to the proper definitions of the descriptors.

abstract: There has been a significant interest in the last years in finding fractional quantum Hall physics in lattice models, but it is not always clear how these models connect to the corresponding models in continuum systems. Here we introduce a family of models that is able to interpolate between a recently proposed set of lattice models with Laughlin-like ground states constructed from conformal field theory and models with ground states that are practically the usual bosonic/fermionic Laughlin states in the continuum. Both the ground state and the Hamiltonian are known analytically, and we find that the Hamiltonian in the continuum limit does not coincide with the usual delta interaction Hamiltonian for the Laughlin states. We introduce quasiholes into the models and show analytically that their braiding properties are as expected if the quasiholes are screened. We demonstrate screening numerically for the 1/3 Laughlin model and find that the quasiholes are slightly smaller in the continuum than in the lattice. Finally, we compute the effective magnetic field felt by the quasiholes and show that it is close to uniform when approaching the continuum limit. The techniques presented here to interpolate between the lattice and the continuum can also be applied to other fractional quantum Hall states that are constructed from conformal field theory.

abstract: By placing an atom into a cavity, the electromagnetic mode structure of the cavity is modified. In Cavity QED, one manifestation of this phenomenon is the appearance of a gauge-dependent diamagnetic term, known as the $A^2$ contribution. Although in atomic Cavity QED, the resulting modification in the eigenmodes is negligible, in recent superconducting circuit realizations, such corrections can be observable and may have qualitative implications. We revisit the canonical quantization procedure of a circuit QED system consisting of a single superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a multimode superconducting microwave resonator. A complete derivation of the quantum Hamiltonian of an open circuit QED system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a leaky transmission line cavity is presented. We introduce a complete set of modes that properly conserves the current in the entire structure and present a sum rule for the dipole transition matrix elements of a multi-level transmon qubit coupled to a multi-mode cavity. Finally, an effective multi-mode Rabi model is derived with coefficients that are given in terms of circuit parameters.

abstract: Topological invariants built from the periodic Bloch functions characterize new phases of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superconductors. The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the Quantum Hall Effect. Here, we provide a general expression for the superfluid weight $D_s$ of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number $C$. We find that an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound $D_s \geq |C|$. Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero. As an example, we provide $D_s$ for the time-reversal invariant attractive Harper-Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.

abstract: The possibility of maintaining entanglement in a quantum system at finite, even high, temperatures -- the so-called `hot entanglement' -- has obvious practical interest, but also requires closer theoretical scrutiny. Since quantum entanglement in a system evolves in time and is continuously subjected to environmental degradation, a nonequilibrium description by way of open quantum systems is called for. To identify the key issues and the contributing factors that may permit `hot entanglement' to exist, or the lack thereof, we carry out a model study of two spatially-separated, coupled oscillators in a shared bath depicted by a finite-temperature scalar field. From the Langevin equations we derived for the normal modes and the entanglement measure constructed from the covariance matrix we examine the interplay between direct coupling, field-induced interaction and finite separation on the structure of late-time entanglement. We show that the coupling between oscillators plays a crucial role in sustaining entanglement at intermediate temperatures and over finite separations. In contrast, the field-induced interaction between the oscillators which is a non-Markovian effect, becomes very ineffective at high temperature. We determine the critical temperature above which entanglement disappears to be bounded in the leading order by the inverse frequency of the center-of-mass mode of the reduced oscillator system, a result not unexpected, which rules out hot entanglement in such settings.

abstract: The energy spectrum of two 0-branes for fixed angular momentum in 2+1 dimensions is calculated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The basis function used for each angular momentum consists of 80 eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator problem on the corresponding space. It is seen that the spectrum exhibits a definite linear Regge trajectory behavior. It is argued how this behavior supports the picture by which the bound-states of quarks and QCD-strings are governed by the quantum mechanics of matrix coordinates.

abstract: We propose $Sp(8,\mathbb{R})$ and $SO(9,\mathbb{R})$ as dynamical groups for closed quantum systems. Restricting here to $Sp(8,\mathbb{R})$, the quantum theory is constructed and investigated. The functional Mellin transform plays a prominent role in defining the quantum theory as it provides a bridge between the quantum algebra of observables and the algebra of operators on Hilbert spaces furnishing unitary representations that are induced from a distinguished parabolic subgroup of $Sp(8,\mathbb{R})$. As well, the parabolic subgroup furnishes a fiber bundle construction that models what can be described as a matrix quantum gauge theory. The formulation is strictly quantum mechanics: no a priori space-time is assumed and the only geometrical input comes from the group manifold. But, what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple model, turns out to have a capacious structure suggesting some surprising physical interpretations.

abstract: We consider deformations of unbounded operators by using the novel construction tool of warped convolutions. By using the Kato-Rellich theorem we show that unbounded self-adjoint deformed operators are self-adjoint if they satisfy a certain condition. This condition proves itself to be necessary for the oscillatory integral to be well-defined. Moreover, different proofs are given for self-adjointness of deformed unbounded operators in the context of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

abstract: An alternative method is proposed for deriving the time dependent Schroedinger equation from the pictures of wave and matrix mechanics. The derivation is of a mixed classical quantum character, since time is treated as a classical variable, thus avoiding any controversy over its meaning in quantum mechanics. The derivation method proposed in this paper requires no ad hoc assumption and avoids going through a second-order differential equation that can be reduced to the well known time-dependent Schroedinger equation only postulating a complex wavefunction with an exponential time dependence, as did by Schroedinger in its original paper of 1926.

abstract: We propose a simple mean-field ansatz to study phase transitions from a topological phase to a trivial phase. We probe the efficiency of this approach by considering the string-net model in the presence of a string tension for any anyon theory. Such a perturbation is known to be responsible for a deconfinement-confinement phase transition which is well described by the present variational setup. We argue that mean-field results become exact in the limit of large total quantum dimension.

abstract: In this paper, the control of the edge-mode spectrum of integer-Hall-effect 2D waveguides by electric field is proposed and modeled. Under certain found conditions, the applied transversal electric field allows refining the modal spectrum from non-localized waves, and, additionally, it can switch the edge-mode from the propagating to the evanescent state, and it is interesting in the design of the edge-mode off and on logic components. These waveguides, arbitrary biased by potentials, are described by the Pauli spin-less charge equation and are simulated using the order reduction method of partial differential equations in its Kron quantum-circuit representation. Additionally to the spectrum control mechanism, the influence of strong-magnitude disorder of chemical potential and magnetic field on the edge localization and modal switching is studied to simulate the arisen-in-practice limitations on these effects.

abstract: For each generic $(3\mbox{-}j)$ the column parities, $2(j \pm m)$, define $3$ intrinsic parities: $\alpha, \beta,\gamma$. In algebra $so(3)$ only $(3\mbox{-}j)\_{\alpha}$ exists whereas super-algebra $osp(1|2)$ admits $3$ kinds of super-symbols $(3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\alpha}, (3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\beta}, (3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\gamma}$. Instead of 4 for $\{6\mbox{-}j\}$ symbols, Regge symmetry this time produces 5 partitions ${\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(0), {\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(1), {\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(2), {\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(4), {\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(5)$, with ${\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(3) = \emptyset$. Valid for $(3\mbox{-}j)\_{\alpha}, (3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\alpha,\gamma}$ they reduce to 2 for $(3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\beta}$ with ${\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(0), {\tt S}\_{\boldsymbol{\wr}}(1)$. Unexpectedly a symbol $(3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\beta}$ and its 'Regge-transformed' may be opposite in sign. In terms of integer parts and super-triangle $\triangle^{S}$ a formula similar to that of a $(3\mbox{-}j)$ is obtained for the $(3\mbox{-}j)^{S}$. Some forbidden $(3\mbox{-}j)^{S}\_{\beta}$ require an analytic prolongation, consistent with Regge $\beta$-partitions.

abstract: We study a noncanonical Hilbert space representation of the polymer quantum mechanics. It is shown that Heisenberg algebra get some modifications in the constructed setup from which a generalized uncertainty principle will naturally come out. Although the extracted physical results are the same as those obtained from the standard canonical representation, the noncanonical representation may be notable in view of its possible connection with the generalized uncertainty theories suggested by string theory. In this regard, by considering an Snyder-deformed Heisenberg algebra we show that since the translation group is not deformed it can be identified with a polymer-modified Heisenberg algebra. In classical level, it is shown the noncanonical Poisson brackets are related to their canonical counterparts by means of a Darboux transformation on the corresponding phase space.

abstract: The planar quantum dynamics of spin-1/2 neutral particle interacting with electrical fields is considered. A set of first order differential equations are obtained directly from the planar Dirac equation with nonminimum coupling. New solutions of this system, in particular, for the Aharonov-Casher effect, are found and discussed in detail. Pauli equation is also obtained by studying the motion of the particle when it describes a circular path of constant radius. We also analyze the planar dynamics in the full space, including the $r=0$ region. The self-adjoint extension method is used to obtain the energy levels and wave functions of the particle for two particular values for the self-adjoint extension parameter. The energy levels obtained are analogous to the Landau levels and explicitly depend on the spin projection parameter.

abstract: Starting from integrable $su(2)$ (quasi-)spin Richardson-Gaudin XXZ models we derive several properties of integrable spin models coupled to a bosonic mode. We focus on the Dicke-Jaynes-Cummings-Gaudin models and the two-channel $(p+ip)$-wave pairing Hamiltonian. The pseudo-deformation of the underlying $su(2)$ algebra is here introduced as a way to obtain these models in the contraction limit of different Richardson-Gaudin models. This allows for the construction of the full set of conserved charges, the Bethe Ansatz state, and the resulting Richardson-Gaudin equations. For these models an alternative and simpler set of quadratic equations can be found in terms of the eigenvalues of the conserved charges. Furthermore, the recently proposed eigenvalue-based determinant expressions for the overlaps and form factors of local operators are extended to these models, linking the results previously presented for the Dicke-Jaynes-Cummings-Gaudin models with the general results for Richardson-Gaudin XXZ models.

abstract: Using a modified spin-wave theory which artificially restores zero sublattice magnetization on finite lattices, we investigate the entanglement properties of the N\'eel ordered $J_1 - J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Different kinds of subsystem geometries are studied, either corner-free (line, strip) or with sharp corners (square). Contributions from the $n_G=2$ Nambu-Goldstone modes give additive logarithmic corrections with a prefactor ${n_G}/{2}$ independent of the R\'enyi index. On the other hand, corners lead to additional (negative) logarithmic corrections with a prefactor $l^{c}_q$ which does depend on both $n_G$ and the R\'enyi index $q$, in good agreement with scalar field theory predictions. By varying the second neighbor coupling $J_2$ we also explore universality across the N\'eel ordered side of the phase diagram of the $J_1 - J_2$ antiferromagnet, from the frustrated side $0<J_2/J_1<1/2$ where the area law term is maximal, to the strongly ferromagnetic regime $-J_2/J_1\gg1$ with a purely logarithmic growth $S_q=\frac{n_G}{2}\ln N$, thus recovering the mean-field limit for a subsystem of $N$ sites. Finally, a universal subleading constant term $\gamma_q^{\rm ord}$ is extracted in the case of strip subsystems, and a direct relation is found (in the large-S limit) with the same constant extracted from free lattice systems. The singular limit of vanishing aspect ratios is also explored, where we identify for $\gamma_q^\text{ord}$ a regular part and a singular component, explaining the discrepancy of the linear scaling term for fixed width {\it{vs}} fixed aspect ratio subsystems.

abstract: We investigate how entanglement spreads in time-dependent states of a 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). The results depend qualitatively on the value of the central charge. In rational CFTs, which have central charge below a critical value, entanglement entropy behaves as if correlations were carried by free quasiparticles. This leads to long-term memory effects, such as spikes in the mutual information of widely separated regions at late times. When the central charge is above the critical value, the quasiparticle picture fails. Assuming no extended symmetry algebra, any theory with $c>1$ has diminished memory effects compared to the rational models. In holographic CFTs, with $c \gg 1$, these memory effects are eliminated altogether at strong coupling, but reappear after the scrambling time $t \gtrsim \beta \log c$ at weak coupling.

abstract: Reversible logic has attracted much research interest over the last few decades, especially due to its application in quantum computing. In the construction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly used to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic gates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and Fredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be expensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla bits a practical topic. This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single base gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of the 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three main results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can generate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated Toffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations using no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known result for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known result for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is trivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove their optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible gates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We also explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new concept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an unlimited number of borrowed bits.

abstract: While band insulators are usually described in wavevector space in terms of fully filled bands, they are sometimes also described in terms of a complementary Wannier picture in which electrons occupy localized, atom-like orbitals. Under what conditions does the latter picture break down? The presence of irremovable quantum entanglement between different sites can obstruct a localized orbital description, which occurs in systems like Chern and topological insulators. We collectively refer to such states as Quantum Band Insulators (QBIs). Here we report the theoretical discovery of a filling-enforced QBI - that is, a free electron insulator in which the band filling is smaller than the minimum number dictated by the atomic picture. Consequently such insulators have no representation in terms of filling localized orbitals and must be QBIs. This is shown to occur in models of certain cubic crystals with non-symmorphic space groups. Like topological insulators, filling-enforced QBIs require spin-orbit coupling. However, in contrast, they do not typically exhibit surface states. Instead their nontrivial nature is revealed by studying the quantum entanglement of their ground state wavefunction.

We find that above a critical mass ratio, this version of the Calogero problem exhibits the generalized Efimov effect, the emergence of discrete scale invariance manifested by a geometric series of three-body bound states with an accumulation point at zero energy.

abstract: We provide a scheme for inferring causal relations from uncontrolled statistical data which makes use of all of the information in the joint probability distribution over the observed variables rather than just the conditional independence relations. We focus on causal models containing just two observed variables, each of which is binary. We allow any number of latent variables and we do not impose any restriction on the manner in which the observed variables may depend functionally on the latent ones. In particular, the noise need not be additive. We provide an inductive scheme for classifying causal models into distinct observational equivalence classes. For each observational equivalence class, we provide a procedure for deriving, using techniques from algebraic geometry, necessary and sufficient conditions on the joint distribution for the feasibility of the class. Connections and applications of these results to the emerging field of quantum causal models are also discussed.

abstract: We consider soft-core bosons with onsite interaction loaded in the honeycomb lattice with different site energies for the two sublattices. Using both a mean-field approach and quantum Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that the topology of the honeycomb lattice results in a non-vanishing Berry curvature for the band structure of the single-particle excitations of the system. This Berry curvature induces an anomalous Hall effect. It is seen by studying the time evolution of a wavepacket, namely a superfluid ground state in a harmonic trap, subjected either to a constant force (Bloch oscillations) or to a sudden shift of the trap center.

For strongly interacting systems, however, the locality of temperature breaks down. We study the possibility of associating an effective thermal state to subsystems of infinite chains of interacting spin particles of arbitrary finite dimension. We study the effect of correlations and criticality in the definition of this effective thermal state and discuss the possible implications for the classical simulation of thermal quantum systems.

abstract: We study the exact nuclear time-dependent potential energy surface (TDPES) for laser-induced electron localization with a view to eventually developing a mixed quantum-classical dynamics method for strong-field processes. The TDPES is defined within the framework of the exact factorization [A. Abedi, N. T. Maitra, and E. K. U. Gross, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 123002 (2010)] and contains the exact effect of the couplings to the electronic subsystem and to any external fields within a scalar potential. We compare its features with those of the quasistatic potential energy surfaces (QSPES) often used to analyse strong-field processes. We show that the gauge-independent component of the TDPES has a mean-field-like character very close to the density-weighted average of the QSPESs. Oscillations in this component are smoothened out by the gauge-dependent component, and both components are needed to yield the correct force on the nuclei. Once the localization begins to set in, the gradient of the exact TDPES tracks one QSPES and then switches to the other, similar to the description provided by surface-hopping between QSPESs. We show that evolving an ensemble of classical nuclear trajectories on the exact TDPES accurately reproduces the exact dynamics. This study suggests that the mixed quantum-classical dynamics scheme based on evolving multiple classical nuclear trajectories on the exact TDPES will be a novel and useful method to simulate strong field processes.

For fermions, the vicinity of the integrability is characterized by large deviations with respect to the predictions of the Bethe ansatz. For the consistency of the contact model, it appears essential to take into account the contact of three particles.

One can easily check these conditions in concrete models. We illustrate this by discussing a number of spin systems with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for secure information processing and communications, where hyperentanglement or high-dimensional entanglement has been separately proposed towards high data capacity and error resilience. The continuous-variable nature of the energy-time entanglement makes it an ideal candidate for efficient high-dimensional coding with minimal limitations. Here we demonstrate the first simultaneous high-dimensional hyperentanglement using a biphoton frequency comb to harness the full potential in both energy and time domain. The long-postulated Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum revival is exhibited, with up to 19 time-bins, 96.5% visibilities. We further witness the high-dimensional energy-time entanglement through Franson revivals, which is observed periodically at integer time-bins, with 97.8% visibility. This qudit state is observed to simultaneously violate the generalized Bell inequality by up to 10.95 deviations while observing recurrent Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt S-parameters up to 2.76. Our biphoton frequency comb provides a platform in photon-efficient quantum communications towards the ultimate channel capacity through energy-time-polarization high-dimensional encoding.

abstract: Radiation pressure has been known since Kepler's observation that a comet's tail is always oriented away from the sun, and in the past centuries this phenomenon stimulated remarkable discoveries in electromagnetism, quantum physics and relativity [1-3]. In modern terms, the pressure of light is associated with the momentum of photons, which plays a crucial role in a variety of systems, from atomic [4-7] to astronomical [8,9] scales. Experience from these cases leads us to assume that the direction of the optical momentum and the radiation-pressure force are naturally aligned with the propagation of light, i.e., its wavevector. Here we report the direct observation of an extraordinary optical momentum and force directed perpendicular to the wavevector, and proportional to the optical spin (i.e., degree of circular polarization). This transverse spin-dependent optical force, a few orders of magnitude weaker than the usual radiation pressure, was recently predicted for evanescent waves [10] and other structured fields [11]. Fundamentally, it can be associated with the enigmatic "spin momentum," introduced by Belinfante in field theory 75 years ago [12-14]. We measure this unusual transverse momentum using a nano-cantilever with extremely low compliance (capable of femto-Newton resolution), which is immersed in an evanescent optical field directly above the total-internal-reflecting glass surface. Such sensors, perpendicular to a substrate, have already shown an extreme force resolution in various systems [15-19]. Our findings revisit fundamental momentum properties of light, while the experimental technique opens the way for precision measurements of fine optical forces in structured fields at subwavelength scales.

abstract: Expository paper providing a historical survey of the gradual transformation of the "philosophical discussions" between Bohr, Einstein and Schr\"odinger on foundational issues in quantum mechanics into a quantitative prediction of a new quantum effect, its experimental verification and its proposed (and loudly advertised) applications. The basic idea of the 1935 paper of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) was reformulated by David Bohm for a finite dimensional spin system. This allowed John Bell to derive his inequalities that separate the prediction of quantum entanglement from its possible classical interpretation. We reproduce here their later (1971) version, reviewing on the way the generalization (and mathematical derivation) of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations (due to Weyl and Schr\"odinger) needed for the passage from EPR to Bell. We also provide an improved derivation of the quantum theoretic violation of Bell's inequalities. Soon after the experimental confirmation of the quantum entanglement (culminating with the work of Alain Aspect) it was Feynman who made public the idea of a quantum computer based on the observed effect.

We first review the notions of quantum locally compact metric spaces, and present various examples of such structures. We then explain the construction of the dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity, first in the context of quasi-Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces, and then in the context of pointed quantum proper metric spaces. We include a few new result concerning perturbations of the metrics on Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces in relation with the dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity.

abstract: Motivated by experiments exploring the physics of neutral atoms in artificial magnetic fields, we study the ground state of bosons interacting with long range dipolar interactions on a two-leg ladder. Using two complimentary variational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics driven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to destroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest neighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where the total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is modulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields, next nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder phase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is modulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection symmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space. For values of the flux near $\phi = \pi$, we find that a switching effect occurs for arbitrarily weak interactions, where the density modulates in space, but the chiral current changes sign on every plaquette. Arbitrarily weak attractive interactions along the rungs destroy the Meissner phase completely, in favor of a modulated density wave phase. Varying magnetic field produces a cascade of first order transitions between modulated density wave states with different wave-vectors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in the chiral current. Polarizing the dipoles along the ladder direction yields a region of phase space where a stable biased ladder phase occurs even at arbitrarily weak magnetic fields. We discuss the experimental consequences of our work, in particular, how the interleg charge density wave can manifest itself in recent experiments on bosons in synthetic dimensions.

abstract: We study the formation of bound two-particle states in gapless monolayer graphene in gated structures. We find that, even in the regime of massless Dirac fermions, coupling can occur at zero-energy for different or same charge quasiparticles. These bipartite states must have a non-zero internal angular momentum, meaning that they only exist as stationary vortices. We propose a new picture of the experimentally seen Fermi velocity renormalization as a manifestation of these pairs, suggest the possibility of a condensate of these novel quasiparticles.

abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of an isolated quantum system after a sudden quench to a dynamical critical point is expected to be characterized by scaling and universal exponents due to the absence of time scales. We explore these features for a quench of the parameters of a Hamiltonian with $O(N)$ symmetry, starting from a ground state in the disordered phase. In the limit of infinite $N$, the exponents and scaling forms of the relevant two-time correlation functions can be calculated exactly. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by the numerical solution of the corresponding equations. Moreover, we find that the same scaling functions, yet with different exponents, also describe the coarsening dynamics for quenches below the dynamical critical point.

abstract: We analyze idealized sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments with higher spin particles. This analysis serves at least two purposes: The widely discussed spin-1/2 case leads to some misunderstandings which hopefully is removed by the higher spin discussion. Secondly, Wigner rotation matrices for generic spins become conceptually more transparent with this physical example. We also give compact formulas for the probabilities in terms of the angle between the sequential SG apparatuses for generic spins. We work out the spin-$1/2$, spin-$1$ and spin-$2$ cases explicitly. Since there are some confusing issues regarding the actual experiment, we also compile a "facts and fiction" section on the SG experiments.

abstract: In 1986, Saks and Wigderson conjectured that the largest separation between deterministic and zero-error randomized query complexity for a total boolean function is given by the function $f$ on $n=2^k$ bits defined by a complete binary tree of NAND gates of depth $k$, which achieves $R_0(f) = O(D(f)^{0.7537\ldots})$. We show this is false by giving an example of a total boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits whose deterministic query complexity is $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ while its zero-error randomized query complexity is $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. This shows that the relations $D(f) \le R_0(f)^2$ and $D(f) \le 2R_1(f)^2$ are optimal, up to poly-logarithmic factors. We further show that the quantum query complexity of the same function is $\tilde O(n^{1/4})$, giving the first example of a total function with a super-quadratic gap between its quantum and deterministic query complexities. Variations of this function give new separations between several other query complexity measures, including: the first super-linear separation between bounded-error and zero-error randomized complexity, larger gaps between exact quantum query complexity and deterministic/randomized query complexities, and a 4th power separation between approximate degree and bounded-error randomized complexity. All of these examples are variants of a function recently introduced by G\"{o}\"{o}s, Pitassi, and Watson which they used to separate the unambiguous 1-certificate complexity from deterministic query complexity and to resolve the famous Clique versus Independent Set problem in communication complexity.

abstract: The space of all possible boundary conditions that respect self-adjointness of Hamiltonian operator is known to be given by the group manifold $U(2)$ in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. In this paper we study non-Abelian Berry's connections in the space of boundary conditions in a simple quantum mechanical system. We consider a system for a free spinless particle on a circle with two point-like interactions described by the $U(2) \times U(2)$ family of boundary conditions. We show that, for a certain $SU(2) \subset U(2) \times U(2)$ subfamily of boundary conditions, all the energy levels become doubly-degenerate thanks to the so-called higher-derivative supersymmetry, and non-Abelian Berry's connection in the ground-state sector is given by the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole of $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. We also show that, in the ground-state sector of this quantum mechanical model, matrix elements of position operator give the adjoint Higgs field that satisfies the BPS equation. It is also discussed that Berry's connections in the excited-state sectors are given by non-BPS 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.

abstract: Weyl semimetals typically appear in systems in which either time-reversal (T) or inversion (P) symmetry are broken. We show that these topological states of matter can also arise in fermionic systems with gauge potentials preserving both T and P. The role of the gauge symmetry in the formation of Weyl points is discussed for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge potentials. Focusing on a U(2) symmetric system in a cubic lattice, we show that double-Weyl points and Fermi arcs appear as an effect of gauge invariance. A simultaneous breaking of both gauge and time-reversal symmetry brings the P T invariant system into a usual Weyl semimetal with inversion symmetry.

abstract: Categories of relations over a regular category form a family of models of quantum theory. Using regular logic, many properties of relations over sets lift to these models, including the correspondence between Frobenius structures and internal groupoids. Over compact Hausdorff spaces, this lifting gives continuous symmetric encryption. Over a regular Mal'cev category, this correspondence gives a characterization of categories of completely positive maps, enabling the formulation of quantum features. These models are closer to Hilbert spaces than relations over sets in several respects: Heisenberg uncertainty, impossibility of broadcasting, and behavedness of rank one morphisms.

abstract: Charged massive matter fields of spin 0 and 1/2 are quantized in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field in a spatial region bounded by two parallel plates. The most general set of boundary conditions at the plates, that is required by mathematical consistency and the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian operator, is employed. The vacuum fluctuations of the matter field in the case of the magnetic field orthogonal to the plates are analyzed, and it is shown that the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates is positive and independent of the boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the plates. Possibilities of the detection of this new-type Casimir effect are discussed.

abstract: It is argued that gravity should cause a breakdown of quantum mechanics, at low energies, accessible to table-top experiments. It is then shown that one can formulate a theory of quantum gravity in which gravitational correlations exist between worldline or worldsheet paths, for the particle or field of interest. Using a generalized equivalence principle, one can give a unique form for the correlators, yielding a theory with no adjustable parameters. A key feature of the theory is the "bunching" of quantum trajectories caused by the gravitational correlations - this is {\it not} a decoherence or a "collapse" mechanism. This bunching causes a breakdown of the superposition principle for large masses, with a very rapid crossover to classical behaviour at an energy scale which depends on the physical structure of the object. Formal details, and applications of the theory, are kept to a minimum in this paper; but we show how physical quantities can be calculated, and give a detailed discussion of the dynamics of a single particle.

abstract: We study the survival probability of moving relativistic unstable particles with definite momentum $\vec{p} \neq 0$. The amplitude of the survival probability of these particles is calculated using its integral representation. We found decay curves of such particles for the quantum mechanical models considered. These model studies show that late time deviations of the survival probability of these particles from the exponential form of the decay law, that is the transition times region between exponential and non-expo\-nen\-tial form of the survival probability, occur much earlier than it follows from the classical standard approach resolving itself into replacing time $t$ by $t/\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor) in the formula for the survival probability and that the survival probabilities tend to zero as $t\rightarrow \infty$ much slower than one would expect using classical time dilation relation. Here we show also that for some physically admissible models of unstable states the computed decay curves of the moving particles have analogous fluctuating form as the decay curves obtained in the GSI experiment.

abstract: Throughout human history, people have used sight to learn about the world, but only in relatively recent times the science of light has been developed. Egyptians and Mesopotamians made the first known lenses out of quartz, giving birth to what was later known as optics. On the other hand, geometry is a branch of mathematics that was born from practical studies concerning lengths, areas and volumes in the early cultures, although it was not put into axiomatic form until the 3rd century BC. In this work, we will discuss the connection between these two timeless topics and show some new things in old things". There has been several works in this direction, but taking into account the didactic approach of the Enrico Fermi Summer School, we would like to address the subject and our audience in a new light.

abstract: We report on studying the dynamic evolution of orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying light in sum frequency generation (SFG). Dynamic evolution of the SFG beam is studied in different cases, in which the two pump beams are either a single OAM mode or OAM superposition mode. For the cases when the two pumps are both in superposition mode, two kinds of spatial patterns and evolution behaviors are observed, one set of spatial pattern is non-diffractive and unchanged with propagating. In addition, SFG of two pump beams with opposite OAM will evolve into a kind of quasi-Gaussian mode. These observations show that the pumps phases are coherently transferred to SFG beam in the conversion process. Our findings give insights to physical picture of OAM light transformation in nonlinear processes, which can be used in OAM mode engineering and de-multiplexing of different OAM modes.

abstract: We investigate the properties of the Dirac operator on manifolds with boundaries in presence of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition. An exact counting of the number of edge states for boundaries with isometry of a sphere is given. We show that the problem with the above boundary condition can be mapped to one where the manifold is extended beyond the boundary and the boundary condition is replaced by a delta function potential of suitable strength. We also briefly highlight how the problem of the self-adjointness of the operators in the presence of moving boundaries can be simplified by suitable transformations which render the boundary fixed and modify the Hamiltonian and the boundary condition to reflect the effect of moving boundary.

abstract: We present a guiding principle for designing fermionic Hamiltonians and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods that are free from the infamous sign problem by exploiting the Lie groups and Lie algebras that appear naturally in the Monte Carlo weight of fermionic QMC simulations. Specifically, rigorous mathematical constraints on the determinants involving matrices that lie in the split orthogonal group provide a guideline for sign-free simulations of fermionic models on bipartite lattices. This guiding principle not only unifies the recent solutions of the sign problem based on the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods and the Majorana representation, but also suggests new efficient algorithms to simulate physical systems that were previously prohibitive because of the sign problem.

abstract: Joint electron-ion energy spectra for the dissociative ionization of a model H$_2^+$ in few-cycle, infrared laser pulses are calculated via the numerical ab initio solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. A strong, pulse-dependent modulation of the ionization probability for certain values of the protons' kinetic energy (but almost independent of the electron's energy) is observed. With the help of models with frozen ions, this feature---which mistakenly might be attributed to vibrational excitations---is traced back to the transient population of electronically excited states, followed by ionization. This assertion is further corroborated employing a two-level model incorporating strong-field ionization from the excited state.

abstract: We investigate dynamical many-body localization and delocalization in an integrable system of periodically-kicked, interacting linear rotors. The Hamiltonian we investigate is linear in momentum, and its Floquet evolution operator is analytically tractable for arbitrary interaction strengths. One of the hallmarks of this model is that depending on certain parameters, it manifest both localization and delocalization in momentum space. We explicitly show that, for this model, the energy being bounded at long times is not a sufficient condition for dynamical localization. Besides integrals of motion associated to the integrability, this model manifests additional integrals of motion, which are the exclusive consequence of dynamical many-body localization. We also propose an experimental scheme, involving voltage-biased Josephson junctions, to realize such many-body kicked models.

abstract: I consider the low-energy particle-particle scattering properties in a periodic simple cubic crystal. In particular, I investigate the relation between the two-body scattering length and the energy shift experienced by the lowest-lying unbound state when this is placed in a periodic finite box. I introduce a continuum model for s-wave contact interactions that respects the symmetry of the Brillouin zone in its regularisation and renormalisation procedures, and corresponds to the naive continuum limit of the Hubbard model. In this way, the differences in the energy shifts between different renormalisation schemes that yield identical low-energy scattering properties are apparent. I then particularise to the Hubbard model, and find that for large finite lattices the results are identical to those obtained in the naive continuum limit. The results reported here are valid in the weak, intermediate and unitary limits, and can be used for the extraction of scattering information ,via exact diagonalisation or Monte Carlo methods, of two-body systems in realistic periodic lattices.

abstract: We examine what happens when a strongly many body localized system is coupled to a weak heat bath, with both system and bath containing similar numbers of degrees of freedom. Previous investigations of localized systems coupled to baths operated in regimes where the back action of the system on the bath is negligible, and concluded that the bath generically thermalizes the system. In this work we show that when the system is strongly localized and the bath is only weakly ergodic, the system can instead localize the bath. We demonstrate this both in the limit of weak coupling between system and bath, and in the limit of strong coupling, and for two different types of `weak' bath - baths which are close to an atomic limit, and baths which are close to a non-interacting limit. The existence of this `many body localization proximity effect' indicates that many body localization is more robust than previously appreciated, and can not only survive coupling to a (weak) heat bath, but can even destroy the bath.

abstract: Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we theoretically study the proximity-induced density of states (DOS) in clean SFF spin-valves with noncollinear exchange fields. Our results clearly demonstrate a direct correlation between the presence of a zero energy peak (ZEP) in the DOS spectrum and the persistence of spin-1 triplet pair correlations. By systematically varying the geometrical and material parameters governing the spin-valve, we point out to experimentally optimal system configurations where the ZEPs are most pronounced, and which can be effectively probed via scanning tunneling microscopy. We complement these findings in the ballistic regime by employing the Usadel formalism in the full proximity limit to investigate their diffusive SFF counterparts. We determine the optimal normalized ferromagnetic layer thicknesses which result in the largest ZEPs. Our results can serve as guidelines in designing samples for future experiments.

abstract: The interplay of the tunneling transfer of charges and the emission and absorption of light can be investigated in a setup, where a voltage-biased Josephson junction is connected in series with a microwave cavity. We focus here on the emission processes of photons and analyze the underlying time-dependent statistics using the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and the waiting-time distribution $w(\tau)$. Both observables highlight the crossover from a coherent light source to a single-photon source. Due to the nonlinearity of the Josephson junction, tunneling Cooper pairs can create a great variety of non-classical states of light even at weak driving. Analytical results for the weak driving as well as the classical regime are complemented by a numerical treatment for the full nonlinear case. We also address the question of possible relations between $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and $w(\tau)$ as well as the specific information which is provided by each of them.

abstract: The silicon vacancy in silicon carbide is a strong emergent candidate for applications in quantum information processing and sensing. We perform room temperature optically-detected magnetic resonance and spin echo measurements on an ensemble of vacancies and find the properties depend strongly on magnetic field. The spin echo decay time varies from less than 10 $\mu$s at low fields to 80 $\mu$s at 68 mT, and a strong field-dependent spin echo modulation is also observed. The modulation is attributed to the interaction with nuclear spins and is well-described by a theoretical model.

abstract: We report on the observation of single-photon superradiance from an exciton in a semiconductor quantum dot. The confinement by the quantum dot is strong enough for it to mimic a two-level atom, yet sufficiently weak to ensure superradiance. The electrostatic interaction between the electron and the hole comprising the exciton gives rise to an anharmonic spectrum, which we exploit to prepare the superradiant quantum state deterministically with a laser pulse. We observe a five-fold enhancement of the oscillator strength compared to conventional quantum dots. The enhancement is limited by the base temperature of our cryostat and may lead to oscillator strengths above 1000 from a single quantum emitter at optical frequencies.

abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the destruction of quantum multifractality in the presence of perturbations. We study diverse representative models displaying multifractality, including a pseudointegrable system, the Anderson model and a random matrix model. We apply several types of natural perturbations which can be relevant for experimental implementations. We construct an analytical theory for certain cases, and perform extensive large-scale numerical simulations in other cases. The data are analyzed through refined methods including double scaling analysis. Our results confirm the recent conjecture that multifractality breaks down following two scenarios. In the first one, multifractality is preserved unchanged below a certain characteristic length which decreases with perturbation strength. In the second one, multifractality is affected at all scales and disappears uniformly for a strong enough perturbation. Our refined analysis shows that subtle variants of these scenarios can be present in certain cases. This study could guide experimental implementations in order to observe quantum multifractality in real systems.

abstract: The scalar models with exponential interaction, introduced in arXiv:1506.00987, include theories with $\langle \phi\rangle\neq0$. Here, we investigate the partition function of scalar theories with normal ordered exponential interactions. The vev of the normal ordering of the exponential of the integrated potential $$ e^{-Z_R[J]}=\langle 0| :e^{-\int d^4xV(\phi)}:|0\rangle_J $$ generates the lowest order contributions to the $N$-point function. We first investigate the case $V(\phi)=\mu^D\exp(-\alpha\phi)$, and then focus on $V(\phi)=-2\nu m^4\sinh({\phi/\nu m})$. The latter can be seen as an effective theory with dimensionless scale parameter $\nu$. The standard normalization choice for finite theories suggests setting $\nu=\sqrt{\Delta_{F,\Lambda}(0)}/m$, with $\Delta_{F,\Lambda}(x)$ the Feynman propagator with cut-off on the momenta. For large $\Lambda$ the model is well-described by $Z_R[J]$ $$ \langle\phi\rangle=2m $$ in agreement with the experimental data. In such a limit the propagator corresponds to the free one. The investigation suggests a natural way to get the lagrangian of the Standard Model, with a different Higgs lagrangian, that may be tested in future experiments at LHC.

abstract: Germanium is a widely used material for electronic and optoelectronic devices and recently it has become an important material for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Donor spins in silicon have been shown to support very long coherence times ($T_{2}$) when the host material is isotopically enriched to remove any magnetic nuclei. Germanium also has non-magnetic isotopes so it is expected to support long $T_{2}$s while offering some new properties. Compared to Si, Ge has a strong spin-orbit coupling, large electron wavefunction, high mobility, and highly anisotropic conduction band valleys which will all give rise to new physics. In this Letter, the first pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements of $T_{2}$ and the spin-lattice relaxation ($T_1$) times for $^{75}$As and $^{31}$P donors in natural and isotopically enriched germanium are presented. We compare samples with various levels of isotopic enrichment and find that spectral diffusion due to $^{73}$Ge nuclear spins limits the coherence in samples with significant amounts of $^{73}$Ge. For the most highly enriched samples, we find that $T_1$ limits $T_2$ to $T_2 = 2T_1$. We report an anisotropy in $T_1$ and the ensemble linewidths for magnetic fields oriented along different crystal axes but do not resolve any angular dependence to the spectral-diffusion-limited $T_2$ in samples with $^{73}$Ge.

abstract: We study the thermal conductivity of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperature using a density matrix renormalization group approach. The integrability of this model gives rise to ballistic thermal transport. We calculate the temperature dependence of the thermal Drude weight at half filling for various interactions and moreover, we compute its filling dependence at infinite temperature. The finite-frequency contributions originating from the fact that the energy current is not a conserved quantity are investigated as well. We report evidence that breaking the integrability through a nearest-neighbor interaction leads to vanishing Drude weights and diffusive energy transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy spreads ballistically in local quenches with initially inhomogeneous energy density profiles in the integrable case. We discuss the relevance of our results for thermalization in ultra-cold quantum gas experiments and for transport measurements with quasi-one dimensional materials.

abstract: We propose a hybrid system composed of a Majorana qubit and a nanomechanical resonator, implemented by a spin-orbit-coupled superconducting nanowire, using a set of static and oscillating ferromagnetic gates. The ferromagnetic gates induce Majorana bound states in the nanowire, which hybridize and constitute a Majorana qubit. Due to the oscillation of one of these gates, the Majorana qubit can be coherently rotated. By tuning the gate voltage to modulate the local spin-orbit coupling, it is possible to reach the resonance of the qubit-oscillator system for relatively strong couplings.

abstract: Comparative analyses of protein-protein interaction networks play important roles in the understanding of biological processes. The growing enormity of available data on the networks becomes a computational challenge for the conventional alignment algorithms. Quantum algorithms generally provide efficiency over their classical counterparts in solving various problems. One of such algorithms is the quantum phase estimation algorithm which generates the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix with probability one. Using this property, in this article, we describe a quantum computing approach for the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks by following the classical algorithm IsoRank which uses the principal eigenvector of the stochastic matrix representing the Kronecker product of the normalized adjacency matrices of networks for the pairwise alignment. We also present a measurement scheme to efficiently procure the alignment from the output state of the phase estimation algorithm where the eigenvector is encoded as the amplitudes of this state. Furthermore, since the stochastic matrices are generally not Hermitian, we discuss how to approximate such matrices and generate quantum circuits. Finally we discuss the complexity of the quantum approach and show that it is exponentially more efficient.

abstract: The soliton effect is defined in nonlinear physics by the transformation of a nonlinear time-dependent dynamical system into an equivalent linear spectral eigenproblem whose invariant eigenvalues unambiguously define all the dynamical properties of the original system. We point out the existence of such an effect in a non-relativistic isotropic two-electron mean-field quantum-dot model. It yields the prediction of observable modulation of radiation absorption between its two lowest-energy zero-angular-momentum nonlinear eigenstates (i.e. eigenstates which include electron-electron interaction: hence their non-orthogonality). Characteristic values for such a possible experiment are given in the case of GaAs. Furthermore it provides an intriguing nonlinear definition of the fine-structure constant solely in terms of these eigenstates.

Based on our definition, we present a necessary and sufficient condition that leads to information-theoretic indistinguishability for quantum encryption scheme. The equivalence between the indistinguishability and semantic security of quantum encryption scheme is also proved.

abstract: We show that the excitation of long-range Rydberg molecules in a three-dimensional optical lattice can be used as a position- and time-sensitive probe of the site occupancy in the system. To this end, we detect the ions which are continuously generated by the decay of the formed Rydberg molecules. While a superfluid gas shows molecule formation for all parameters, a Mott insulator with $n=1$ filling reveals a strong suppression of the number of formed molecules. In the limit of weak probing, the technique can be used to probe the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition in real-time. Our method can be extended to higher fillings and has various applications for the real-time diagnosis and manipulation of ultracold lattice gases.

abstract: An edge state is a time-harmonic solution of a conservative wave system, e.g. Schr\"odinger, Maxwell, which is propagating (plane-wave-like) parallel to, and localized transverse to, a line-defect or "edge." Topologically protected edge states are edge states which are stable against spatially localized (even strong) deformations of the edge. First studied in the context of the quantum Hall effect, protected edge states have attracted huge interest due to their role in the field of topological insulators. Theoretical understanding of topological protection has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and direct numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of continuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically protected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on R^2 with a background two-dimensional honeycomb potential perturbed by an "edge-potential." The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse to a prescribed "rational" edge, between two distinct periodic structures. General conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically protected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure. The bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a one-dimensional effective Dirac operator. A key condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then use this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states along zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent with the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the existence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems. We also show that the family of Hamiltonians we study contains cases where zigzag edge states exist, but which are not topologically protected.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of the influence of resonant enhancement on quantum path dynamics in the generation of harmonics above and below the ionization threshold in helium. By varying the wavelength and intensity of the driving field from 425 nm to 500 nm and from 30 TW/cm${^2}$ to 140 TW/cm${^2}$, respectively, we identify enhancements of harmonics 7, 9, and 11 that correspond to multiphoton resonances between the ground state and the Stark shifted $1s2p$, $1s3p$, and $1s4p$ excited states. A time-frequency analysis of the emission shows that both the short and long quantum path contributions to the harmonic yield are enhanced through these bound state resonances. We analyze the sub-cycle time structure of the 9th harmonic yield in the vicinity of the resonances and find that on resonance the long trajectory contribution is phase shifted by approximately $\pi/4$. Finally, we compare the single atom and the macroscopic response of a helium gas and find that while the sub-cycle time profiles are slightly distorted by propagation effects, the phase shift of the long trajectory contribution is still recognizable.

Our results are in excellent agreement with other works in the literature.

(2) Both $ N=\infty $ classical limit and $ 1/N $ quantum fluctuations have been achieved in two of our previously published papers. It is the $ 1/N $ quantum fluctuations which lead to the non-trivial new quantum phenomena. In view of only a few $ N=2\sim 9 $ qubits inside a circuit QED microwave cavity, they can be tested in near future experiments. (3) Several possible experimental implementations of the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model have been proposed before and recently experimentally realized.

We predict the condition for non-topological phase to the topological phase transition conditions for three different model Hamiltonians in cavity QED lattice. We study these topological quantum phase transition through winding number, which is a topological invariant quantity. We argue that the appearance of topological phase in these systems where the discrete Z 2 symmetry broken. We show that the non-topological state is the vacuum state of the system where each cavity contains fermionic type excitations from light-matter interaction whereas the topological state of system contains Majorana modes of excitations at the end cavity of the lattice.

We show that for each fixed $j$ one has the asymptotic expansion \[ E_j(\beta)=-\dfrac{\beta^2}{4}+\mu^D_j+ o(1) \;\text{ as }\; \beta\to+\infty\,, \] where $\mu_j^D$ is the $j$th eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta_S+K-M^2$ on $L^2(S)$, in which $K$ and $M$ are the Gauss and mean curvatures, respectively, and $-\Delta_S$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator with the Dirichlet condition at the boundary of $S$. If, in addition, the boundary of $S$ is $C^2$-smooth, then the remainder estimate can be improved to ${\mathcal O}(\beta^{-1}\log\beta)$.

Moreover, topological properties of the field resulting from Maxwell's equations are encoded in the algebra, leading to commutation relations with values in its center. The representation theory of the algebra is discussed with focus on vacuum representations, fixing the dynamics of the field.

abstract: The Monte Carlo calculation of R\'enyi entanglement entropies $S^{}_n$ of interacting fermions suffers from a well-known signal-to-noise problem, even for a large number of situations in which the infamous sign problem is absent. A few methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, such as ensemble switching and the use of auxiliary partition-function ratios. Here, we present an approach that builds on the recently proposed free-fermion decomposition method; it incorporates entanglement in the probability measure in a natural way; it takes advantage of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (an essential tool in lattice quantum chromodynamics and other gauge theories with dynamical fermions); and it does not suffer from noise problems. This method displays no sign problem for the same cases as other approaches and is therefore useful for a wide variety of systems. As a proof of principle, we calculate $S_2^{}$ for the one-dimensional, half-filled Hubbard model and compare with results from exact diagonalization and the free-fermion decomposition method.

abstract: Using the density matrix formalism, we prove an existence theorem of the periodic steady-state for an arbitrary periodically-driven system. This state has the same period as the modulated external influence, and it is realized as an asymptotic solution ($t$$\to$$+\infty$) due to relaxation processes. The presented derivation simultaneously contains a simple computational algorithm non-using both Floquet and Fourier theories, i.e. our method automatically guarantees a full account of all frequency components. The description is accompanied by the examples demonstrating a simplicity and high efficiency of our method. In particular, for three-level $\Lambda$-system we calculate the lineshape and field-induced shift of the dark resonance formed by the field with periodically modulated phase. For two-level atom we obtain the analytical expressions for signal of the direct frequency comb spectroscopy with rectangular light pulses. In this case it was shown the radical dependence of the spectroscopy lineshape on pulse area. Moreover, the existence of quasi-forbidden spectroscopic zones, in which the Ramsey fringes are significantly reduced, is found. The obtained results have a wide area of applications in the laser physics and spectroscopy, and they can stimulate the search of new excitation schemes for atomic clock. Also our results can be useful for many-body physics.

abstract: Topological order in two dimensions can be described in terms of deconfined quasiparticle excitations - anyons - and their braiding statistics. However, it has recently been realized that this data does not completely describe the situation in the presence of an unbroken global symmetry. In this case, there can be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics, but with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry enriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we take to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e. does not change one type of anyon into a different type of anyon - one can imagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon. This leads to projective representations and a group cohomology description of symmetry fractionalization, with $H^2(G,{\cal A})$ being the relevant group. In this paper, we treat the general case of a symmetry group $G$ possibly permuting anyon types. We show that despite the lack of a local action of $G$, one can still make sense of a so-called twisted group cohomology description of symmetry fractionalization, and show how this data is encoded in the associativity of fusion rules of the extrinsic `twist' defects of the symmetry. Furthermore, building on work of Hermele, we construct a wide class of exactly solved models which exhibit this twisted symmetry fractionalization, and connect them to our formal framework.

abstract: We calculate thermal corrections to R\'{e}nyi entropies for free massless fermions on a sphere. More specifically, we take a free fermion on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and calculate the leading thermal correction to the R\'{e}nyi entropies for a cap like region with opening angle $2\theta$. By expanding the density matrix in a Boltzmann sum, the problem of finding the R\'{e}nyi entropies can be mapped to the problem of calculating a two point function on an $n$ sheeted cover of the sphere. We follow previous work for conformal field theories to map the problem on the sphere to a conical region in Euclidean space. By using the method of images, we calculate the two point function and recover the R\'{e}nyi entropies.

abstract: We study the structure of the eigenstates and the dynamics of a system that undergoes an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT). The analysis is performed for two-level pairing models characterized by a U(n+1) algebraic structure and exhibiting a second order phase transition between two limiting dynamical symmetries represented by the U(n) and SO(n+1) subalgebras. The models describe systems of (or that can be mapped to) interacting bosons. We show that the eigenstate with energy at the ESQPT critical point, E_ESQPT, is highly localized in the U(n)-basis. Consequently, the dynamics of a system initially prepared in the U(n)-basis vector with energy close to E_ESQPT is extremely slow. Signatures of an ESQPT can therefore be found in the structure of the eigenstates and in the speed of the evolution after a sudden quench. Our findings may be tested experimentally.

abstract: In quantum optics, the quantum state of a light beam is represented through the Wigner function, a density on $\mathbb R^2$ which may take negative values but must respect intrinsic positivity constraints imposed by quantum physics. In the framework of noisy quantum homodyne tomography with efficiency parameter $1/2 < \eta \leq 1$, we study the theoretical performance of a kernel estimator of the Wigner function. We prove that it is minimax efficient, up to a logarithmic factor in the sample size, for the $\mathbb L_\infty$-risk over a class of infinitely differentiable. We compute also the lower bound for the $\mathbb L_2$-risk. We construct adaptive estimator, i.e. which does not depend on the smoothness parameters, and prove that it attains the minimax rates for the corresponding smoothness class functions. Finite sample behaviour of our adaptive procedure are explored through numerical experiments.

abstract: Refrigeration of a solid-state system with light has potential applications for cooling small-scale electronics and photonics. We show theoretically that two coupled semiconductor quantum wells are efficient cooling media for optical refrigeration because they support long-lived indirect electron-hole pairs. Thermal excitation of these pairs to distinct higher-energy states with faster radiative recombination allows an efficient escape channel to remove thermal energy from the system. From band-diagram calculations along with an experimentally realistic level scheme we calculate the cooling efficiency and cooling yield of different devices with coupled quantum wells embedded in a suspended membrane. The dimension and composition of the quantum wells allow optimizing either of these quantities, which cannot, however, be maximized simultaneously. Quantum-well structures with electrical control allow tunability of carrier lifetimes and energy levels so that the cooling efficiency can be optimized over time as the thermal population decreases due to the cooling.

abstract: The four standard quantum optics model in cavity QED such as Rabi, Dicke, Jaynes-Cummings ( JC ) and Tavis-Cummings (TC) model were proposed many decades ago. Despite their relative simple forms and many previous theoretical works, their solutions at a finite $ N $, especially inside the superradiant regime remain unknown. In view of recent remarkable experimental advances in several experimental systems such as cold atoms inside a cavity or superconducting qubits inside a microcavity to realize these models, it becomes topical and important to understand what would be the new phenomena in these models at a finite $ N $, especially inside the superradaint regime. In this work, we resolved this outstanding problem. We use three independent methods such as $ 1/J $ expansion, the strong coupling expansion and exact diagonization (ED) to study $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model at a finite $ N $ and different anisotropy parameters $ 0 \leq \beta \leq 1 $ as the atom-photon interaction strength increases. This model include the four standard quantum optics model as its special limit. We identify 3 different regimes: the normal, $ U(1) $ and quantum tunneling (QT) regime. We map out the evolution of energy level structures, compute all kinds of photon correlation functions and find nearly perfect agreements between the strong coupling expansion and the ED not only in QT regime, but also in the $ U(1) $ regime not too close to the critical point at $ N=\infty $.

abstract: Generation of spatially inhomogeneously polarized (SIP) beams due to polarization spatial mode nonseparability is demonstrated using a polarization Sagnac interferometer. Counter propagating horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarized Laguerre Gaussian beams of opposite topological charges(LG01)corresponding to the two binary degrees of freedom (DoF) are coherently superposed in the interferometer. Quantum inspired entanglement witness and quantification such as Bell state measurement, violation of CHSH form of Bells inequality and concurrence measurements are experimentally measured to establish nonseparability between the two DoF. As the SIP beams are equivalent to bipartite pure states, point wise Stokes polarimetry measurements are used to calculate the reduced coherency matrix corresponding to polarization DoF. Using these we calculate the linear entropy and maximized Bells measure to quantify the degree of entanglement of the SIP beams.

abstract: Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a theory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with quantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the no-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here, we show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes lead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure between two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally connected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal structure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or non-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating space times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally related to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements performed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular example of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it needn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For measurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce the notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a choice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and temporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different type of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in quantum theory while the latter is allowed. In the case of the AMPS firewall experiment we find that the entanglement structure is modified, and one must have entanglement between the infalling Hawking partners and early time outgoing Hawking radiation which surprisingly tame violation of entanglement monogamy.

abstract: Since massive scalar field plays an important role in theoretical physics, we consider the interaction between a sphere and a plate due to the vacuum fluctuation of a massive scalar field. We consider combinations of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. There is a simple prescription to obtain the functional formulas for the Casimir interaction energies, known as TGTG formula, for the massive interactions from the massless interactions. From the TGTG formulas, we discuss how to compute the small separation asymptotic expansions of the Casimir interaction energies up to the next-to-leading order terms. Unlike the massless case, the results could not be expressed as simple algebraic expressions, but instead could only be expressed as infinite sums over some integrals. Nonetheless, it is easy to show that one can obtain the massless limits which agree with previously established results. We also show that the leading terms agree with that derive using proximity force approximation. The dependence of the leading order terms and the next-to-leading order terms on the mass of the scalar field is studied both numerically and analytically. In particular, we derive the small mass asymptotic expansions of these terms. Surprisingly, the small mass asymptotic expansions are quite complicated as they contain terms that are of odd powers in mass as well as logarithms of mass terms.

abstract: In this work we study the sets of two-party correlations generated from a Bell scenario involving two spatially separated systems with respect to various physical models. We show that the sets of classical, quantum, no-signaling and unrestricted correlations can be expressed as projections of affine sections of appropriate convex cones. As a by-product, we identify a spectrahedral outer approximation to the set of quantum correlations which is contained in the first level of the Navascu\'es, Pironio and Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy and also a sufficient condition for the set of quantum correlations to be closed. Furthermore, by our conic formulations, the value of a nonlocal game over the sets of classical, quantum, no-signaling and unrestricted correlations can be cast as a linear conic program. This allows us to show that a semidefinite programming upper bound to the classical value of a nonlocal game introduced by Feige and Lov\'asz is in fact an upper bound to the quantum value of the game and moreover, it is at least as strong as optimizing over the first level of the NPA hierarchy. Lastly, we show that deciding the existence of a perfect quantum (resp. classical) strategy is equivalent to deciding the feasibility of a linear conic program over the cone of completely positive semidefinite matrices (resp. completely positive matrices). By specializing the results to synchronous nonlocal games, we recover the conic formulations for various quantum and classical graph parameters that were recently derived in the literature.

abstract: The main question studied in this paper concerns the weak-coupling behavior of the geometrically induced bound states of singular Schr\"odinger operators with an attractive $\delta$ interaction supported by a planar, asymptotically straight curve $\Gamma$. We demonstrate that if $\Gamma$ is only slightly bent or weakly deformed, then there is a single eigenvalue and the gap between it and the continuum threshold is in the leading order proportional to the fourth power of the bending angle, or the deformation parameter. For comparison, we analyze the behavior of a general geometrical induced eigenvalue in the situation when one of the curve asymptotes is wiggled.

abstract: The second critical charge in the 3-body quantum Coulomb system $(Z, e, e)$ predicted by F Stillinger has been calculated to be equal to $Z_{B}^{\infty}\ =\ 0.904854$ and $Z_{B}^{m_p}\ =\ 0.905138$ for infinite and finite (proton) mass $m_p$ of charge $Z$, respectively. In both cases, the ground state energy $E(Z)$ has a square-root branch point with exponent 3/2 at $Z=Z_B$ in the complex $Z$-plane. Based on analytic continuation, the second excited, spin-singlet bound state of negative hydrogen ion H${}^-$ is predicted to be at -0.515541 a.u. (-0.515311 a.u. for the proton mass $m_p$). The first critical charge for which the ionization energy vanishes is found for a finite proton mass in the Lagrange mesh method, $Z^{m_p}_{c}\ =\ 0.911\, 069\, 724\, 655$.

abstract: We consider the notion of thermal equilibrium for an individual closed macroscopic quantum system in a pure state, i.e., described by a wave function. The macroscopic properties in thermal equilibrium of such a system, determined by its wave function, must be the same as those obtained from thermodynamics, e.g., spatial uniformity of temperature and chemical potential. When this is true we say that the system is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE). Such a system may however not be in microscopic thermal equilibrium (MITE). The latter requires that the reduced density matrices of small subsystems be close to those obtained from the microcanonical, equivalently the canonical, ensemble for the whole system. The distinction between MITE and MATE is particularly relevant for systems with many-body localization (MBL) for which the energy eigenfunctions fail to be in MITE while necessarily most of them, but not all, are in MATE. We note however that for generic macroscopic systems, including those with MBL, most wave functions in an energy shell are in both MATE and MITE. For a classical macroscopic system, MATE holds for most phase points on the energy surface, but MITE fails to hold for any phase point.

abstract: We investigate elementary topological properties of sets of completely positive (CP) maps that arise in quantum Perron-Frobenius theory. We prove that the set of primitive CP maps of fixed Kraus rank is path-connected and we provide a complete classification of the connected components of irreducible CP maps at given Kraus rank and fixed peripheral spectrum in terms of a multiplicity index. These findings are then applied to analyse 1D quantum phases by studying equivalence classes of translational invariant Matrix Product States that correspond to the connected components of the respective CP maps. Our results extend the previously obtained picture in that they do not require blocking of physical sites, they lead to analytic paths and they allow to decompose into ergodic components and to study the breaking of translational symmetry.

It is shown that in presence of uniaxial stress along the $\left\langle 110 \right\rangle$ axes one can find a conserved spin quantity that is directly connected with $k$-independent eigenspinors of the effective Hamiltonian which describes the lowest valence subband. In contrast to previous works, this quantity is not restricted to model-systems with requirements for the Luttinger parameters which are difficult to realize in real materials.

abstract: Electron transport through a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads shows a sharp conductance onset when a quantum dot orbital level crosses the superconducting coherence peak of one lead. We study superconducting single electron transistors in the weak coupling limit by connecting individual gold nanoparticles with aluminum junctions formed by electromigration. We show that the transport features close to the conductance onset threshold can be accurately described by the quantum dot levels' hybridization with the leads, which is strongly enhanced by the divergent density of states at the superconducting gap edge. This highlights the importance of electron cotunneling effects in spectroscopies with superconducting probes.

abstract: We study the properties of the classical electromagnetic (EM) radiation produced by two physically different yet closely related systems, which may be regarded as classical analogues of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE). They correspond to two flat, infinite, parallel planes, one of them static and imposing perfect conductor boundary conditions, while the other performs a rigid oscillatory motion. The systems differ just in the electrical properties of the oscillating plane: one of them is just a planar dipole layer (representing, for instance, a small-width electret). The other, instead, has a dipole layer on the side which faces the static plane, but behaves as a conductor on the other side: this can be used as a representation of a conductor endowed with patch potentials (on the side which faces the conducting plane). We evaluate, in both cases, the dissipative flux of energy between the system and its environment, showing that, at least for small mechanical oscillation amplitudes, it can be written in terms of the dipole layer autocorrelation function. We show that there are resonances as a function of the frequency of the mechanical oscillation.

abstract: Disorder and scattering in photonic systems have long been considered a nuisance that should be circumvented. Recently, disorder has been harnessed for a rapidly growing number of applications, including imaging, sensing and spectroscopy. The chaotic dynamics and extreme sensitivity to external perturbations make random media particularly well-suited for optical cryptography. However, using random media for distribution of secret keys between remote users still remains challenging, since it requires the users have access to the same scattering system. Here we utilize random mode mixing in multimode fibres to generate and distribute keys simultaneously. Fast fluctuations in the fibre mode mixing provide the source of randomness for the key generation, and optical reciprocity guarantees that the keys at the two ends of the fibre are identical. We experimentally demonstrate the scheme using classical light and off-the-shelf components, opening the door for cost effective key establishment at the physical-layer of fibre-optic networks.

We theoretically studied the fluorescence of a strongly pumped intersubband transition in a quantum well. Our results show that the many-electron nature of such a system leads to a modification of the usual Mollow theory. In particular, the intensity of the central peak in the fluorescence spectrum becomes a function of the electron coherence, allowing access to the coherence time of a two dimensional electron gas through a fluorescence intensity measurement.

abstract: Referring to the 18th century idealism of George Berkeley in which an object exists if and only if it is observed, this note shows that orthodox quantum mechanics (OQM) entails a Berkelian idealism regarding properties (BIRP): a quantum `has' a property X with quantitative value x if and only if the property X has just been measured with outcome x. It is then impossible to recontextualize GR's principle of curvature in any quantum framework that implies this BIRP, for a quantum cannot curve space-time if it doesn't have a definite energy - which is supposed to be the cause of curvature - in absence of observation to begin with. Concluding, it is ruled out that a quantum theory of gravity, in which GR's principle of curvature is built in as a fundamental physical principle, can be developed in any framework implying this BIRP.

A new method to calculate the asymptotics of the expectation values of the operator $\int\limits_{0} ^{\infty}e^{iH_{0}t}\zeta\left( \frac{\left\vert x\right\vert }{R}\right) e^{-iH_{0}t}dt,$ as $R\rightarrow\infty,$ is presented. Here $H_{0}$ is the free Dirac operator and $\zeta\left( t\right) $ is such that $\zeta\left( t\right) =1$ for $0\leq t\leq1$ and $\zeta\left( t\right) =0$ for $t>1.$ This approach allows us to obtain the time delay operator $\delta \mathcal{T}\left( f\right) $ for initial states $f$ in $\mathcal{H} _{2}^{3/2+\varepsilon}\left( \mathbb{R}^{3};\mathbb{C}^{4}\right) ,$ $\varepsilon>0,$ the Sobolev space of order $3/2+\varepsilon$ and weight $2.$ The relation between the time delay operator $\delta\mathcal{T}\left( f\right) $ and the Eisenbud-Wigner time delay operator is given. Also, the relation between the averaged time delay and the spectral shift function is presented.

Our construction is motivated by the G\"o\"os-Pitassi-Watson function but does not use it.

abstract: Non-Markovian effects in the evolution of open quantum systems have recently attracted widespread interest, particularly in the context of assessing the efficiency of energy and charge transfer in nanoscale biomolecular networks and quantum technologies. With the aid of many-body simulation methods, we uncover and analyse an ultrafast environmental process that causes energy relaxation in the reduced system to depend explicitly on the phase relation of the initial state preparation. Remarkably, for particular phases and system parameters, the net energy flow is uphill, transiently violating the principle of detailed balance, and implying that energy is spontaneously taken up from the environment. A theoretical analysis reveals that non-secular contributions, significant only within the environmental correlation time, underlie this effect. This suggests that environmental energy harvesting will be observable across a wide range of coupled quantum systems.

abstract: We analyze the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics through the lens of the proposed ER=EPR (Einstein-Rosen = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) duality between entanglement and wormholes. In particular, we find that the no-cloning theorem is dual on the gravity side to the no-go theorem for topology change, violating the axioms of which allows for wormhole stabilization and causality violation. Such a duality between important no-go theorems elucidates the proposed connection between spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement.

abstract: We present a technical report that the two methods of calculating characteristic functions for the work distribution in the weakly driven quantum master equations are equivalent. One is obtained by the notion of quantum jump trajectory [Phys. Rev. E 89, 042122 (2014)], while the other is based on the two time energy measurements on the combined system and reservoir [Silaev, et al., Phys. Rev. E 90, 022103 (2014)]. They are indeed the backward and forward methods, respectively, which is very similar to the case of the Kolmogorov backward and forward equations in classical stochastic theory. The microscopic basis of the former method is also clarified.

abstract: We combine the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) with the equation of motion-phase matching approach (PMA) to calculate two-dimensional photon echo spectra for photoactive molecular complexes with an intermediate strength of the coupling to their environment. Both techniques are highly efficient, yet they involve approximations at different levels. By explicitly comparing with the numerically exact quasi-adiabatic path integral approach, we show for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex that the CMRT describes the decay rates in the population dynamics well, but final stationary populations and the oscillation frequencies differ slightly. In addition, we use the combined CMRT+PMA to calculate two-dimensional photon-echo spectra for a simple dimer model. We find excellent agreement with the exact path integral calculations at short waiting times where the dynamics is still coherent. For long waiting times, differences occur due to different final stationary states, specifically for strong system-bath coupling. For weak to intermediate system-bath couplings, which is most important for natural photosynthetic complexes, the combined CMRT+PMA gives reasonable results with acceptable computational efforts.

abstract: The Aharonov Casher effect predicts the existence in two dimensions of ceil(Phi/2pi) -1 bounded zero modes associated with a magnetic flux Phi. Aharonov and Casher discussed the case of gyromagnetic factor equals 2, we will discuss the general case of any gyromagnetic factor. As a simple model, we study the case where the magnetic field lies in a thin annulus. First we examine the wavefunctions of the zero-energy bounded states, predicted by the Aharonov Casher Effect for electrons with gyromagnetic ratio equal 2. We then calculate the wave function and energies for a gyromagnetic ratio g not equal to 2. We give the dependence of the bound states energies on g and the angular momentum. Finally, we provide an order of magnitude estimations for the binding energies.

abstract: We report on the direct measurement in real space of the effect of the van der Waals forces between individual Rydberg atoms on their external degrees of freedom. Clusters of Rydberg atoms with inter-particle distances of around 5 {\mu}m are created by first generating a small number of seed excitations in a magneto-optical trap, followed by off-resonant excitation that leads to a chain of facilitated excitation events. After a variable expansion time the Rydberg atoms are field ionized, and from the arrival time distributions the size of the Rydberg cluster after expansion is calculated. Our experimental results agree well with a numerical simulation of the van der Waals explosion.

abstract: We adapt modulus of continuity estimates to the study of spectra of combinatorial graph Laplacians, as well as the Dirichlet spectra of certain weighted Laplacians. The latter case is equivalent to stoquastic Hamiltonians and is of current interest in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. In particular, we introduce a new technique which bounds the spectral gap of such Laplacians (Hamiltonians) by studying the limiting behavior of the oscillations of their eigenvectors when introduced into the heat equation. Our approach is based on recent advances in the PDE literature, which include a proof of the fundamental gap theorem by Andrews and Clutterbuck.

abstract: Chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in photosynthetic reaction centers. The relevant nuclear spin observables are a direct manifestation of the radical-pair mechanism. We here use quantum trajectories to describe the time evolution of radical-pairs, and compare their prediction of nuclear spin observables to the one derived from the radical-pair master equation. We unravel a major inconsistency within Haberkorn's approach, while our approach provides a consistent description. These results challenge the understanding of CIDNP experiments within the traditional approach to radical-pair quantum dynamics.

abstract: Superconducting qubit designs vary in complexity from single- and few-junction systems, such as the transmon and flux qubits, to the many-junction fluxonium. Here we consider the question of wether the many degrees of freedom in the fluxonium circuit can limit the qubit coherence time. Such a limitation is in principle possible, due to the interactions between the low-energy, highly anharmonic qubit mode and the higher-energy, weakly anharmonic collective modes. We show that so long as the coupling of the collective modes with the external electromagnetic environment is sufficiently weaker than the qubit-environment coupling, the qubit dephasing induced by the collective modes does not significantly contribute to decoherence. Therefore, the increased complexity of the fluxonium qubit does not constitute by itself a major obstacle for its use in quantum computation architectures.

abstract: In recent years, central components of a new approach to linguistics, the Minimalist Program (MP) have come closer to physics. Features of the Minimalist Program, such as the unconstrained nature of recursive Merge, the operation of the Labeling Algorithm that only operates at the interface of Narrow Syntax with the Conceptual-Intentional and the Sensory-Motor interfaces, the difference between pronounced and un-pronounced copies of elements in a sentence and the build-up of the Fibonacci sequence in the syntactic derivation of sentence structures, are directly accessible to representation in terms of algebraic formalism. Although in our scheme linguistic structures are classical ones, we find that an interesting and productive isomorphism can be established between the MP structure, algebraic structures and many-body field theory opening new avenues of inquiry on the dynamics underlying some central aspects of linguistics.

abstract: The game Quantum Moves was designed to pit human players against computer algorithms, combining their solutions into hybrid optimization to control a scalable quantum computer. In this midstream report, we open our design process and describe the series of constitutive building stages going into a quantum physics citizen science game. We present our approach from designing a core gameplay around quantum simulations, to putting extra game elements in place in order to frame, structure, and motivate players' difficult path from curious visitors to competent science contributors. The player base is extremely diverse - for instance, two top players are a 40 year old female accountant and a male taxi driver. Among statistical predictors for retention and in-game high scores, the data from our first year suggest that people recruited based on real-world physics interest and via real-world events, but only with an intermediate science education, are more likely to become engaged and skilled contributors. Interestingly, female players tended to perform better than male players, even though men played more games per day. To understand this relationship, we explore the profiles of our top players in more depth. We discuss in-world and in-game performance factors departing in psychological theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and the implications for using real live humans to do hybrid optimization via initially simple, but ultimately very cognitively complex games.

abstract: An extension of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem to one employing parameters that vary with time is derived. The resulting formula for the dynamics of observables is found to have a profound connection to Berry curvature type of quantities that however, incorporate the dynamics. By way of application of the new theorem, the quantum equations of motion of a spinless and a spinfull electron in a solid are derived without any adiabatic or semiclassical approximation. The charge current formula for a many-body and interacting spinfull system is also derived and is found to consist of a longitudinal and a transverse part; phenomenological interpretations with respect to polarization and magnetization currents respectively emerge in a natural way. In addition, a formula for the topological magnetoelectric effect for an interacting spinfull electron system is also provided. By carefully defining single-valuedness in parameter space, in a nonstandard fashion and in higher rigor that usual, we are able to discuss in clarity the issue of possible obstruction of this single-valuedness, the associated creation of "Berry monopoles" in parameter space and the quantization of the flux of Berry curvature (but with dynamics included).

abstract: Fermionic natural occupation numbers do not only obey Pauli's exclusion principle, but are even further restricted by so-called generalized Pauli constraints. Such restrictions are particularly relevant whenever they are saturated by given natural occupation numbers $\vec{\lambda}=(\lambda_i)$. For few-site Hubbard models we explore the occurrence of this pinning effect. By varying the on-site interaction $U$ for the fermions we find sharp transitions from pinning of $\vec{\lambda}$ to the boundary of the allowed region to nonpinning. We analyze the origin of this phenomenon which turns out be either a crossing of natural occupation numbers $\lambda_{i}(U), \lambda_{i+1}(U)$ or a crossing of $N$-particle energies. Furthermore, we emphasize the relevance of symmetries for the occurrence of pinning. Based on recent progress in the field of ultracold atoms our findings suggest an experimental set-up for the realization of the pinning effect.

abstract: We study periodically driven bosonic scalar field theories in the infinite N limit. It is well-known that the free theory can undergo parametric resonance under monochromatic modulation of the mass term and thereby absorb energy indefinitely. Interactions in the infinite N limit terminate this increase for any choice of the UV cutoff and driving frequency. The steady state has non-trivial correlations and is synchronized with the drive. The O(N) model at infinite N provides the first example of a clean interacting quantum system that does not heat to infinite temperature at any drive frequency.

abstract: Pulsed laser excitation of a dense ultracold Cs vapor has been used to study the pairwise interactions between Cs atoms excited to $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg states of principal quantum numbers in the range $n=22-36$. Molecular resonances were observed that correspond to excitation of Rydberg-atom-pair states correlated not only to the $n$p$_{3/2}+n$p$_{3/2}$ dissociation asymptotes, but also to $n$s$_{1/2}+(n+1)$s$_{1/2}$, $n$s$_{1/2}+n'$f$_{j}$, and $(n-4)$f$_{j}+(n-3)$f$_{j}$ $(j=5/2,7/2)$ dissociation asymptotes. These pair resonances are interpreted as arising from dipole-dipole, and higher-order long-range-interaction terms between the Rydberg atoms on the basis of i) their spectral positions, ii) their response to static and pulsed electric fields, and iii) millimeter-wave spectra between pair states correlated to different pair-dissociation asymptotes. The Rydberg-atom--pair states were found to spontaneously decay by Penning ionization and the dynamics of the ionization process were investigated during the first 10 $\mu$s following initial photoexcitation. To interpret the experimental observations, a potential model was derived that is based on the numerical determination of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the long-range interaction Hamiltonian. With this potential model, which does not include adjustable parameters, all experimental observations could be accounted for, and the results demonstrate that long-range-interaction models provide a global and accurate description of interactions in ultracold Rydberg gases and that they correctly account for, and enable the analysis of, phenomena as diverse as the formation of Rydberg macrodimers, Penning ionization in dense Rydberg gases, and Rydberg-excitation blockade effects.

abstract: We provide an overview of our recents results about the quench dynamics of one-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by spin-1/2 models. Both cases are considered: clean chains without any disorder and disordered systems with static on-site magnetic fields. The quantity used for the analysis is the probability for finding the initial state later in time, the so-called survival probability. In the absence of random disorder, the survival probability may decay faster than exponentially. Gaussian behaviors and even the limit established by the energy-time uncertainty relation are displayed. In the presence of strong disorder, the dynamics at long-times slows down significantly and shows a powerlaw behavior. For both scenarios, we provide analytical expressions that agree very well with our numerical results.The initial state used for the illustrations is the experimentally accessible N\'eel state.

We verify this by measuring the degree of polarization and observing the intensity distribution of the beam when projected to different polarization states, before as well as after the scattering. We extend our study to the non-maximally non-separable states also.

abstract: Recent observations of temperature and concentration dependence of optical spectra in strongly-coupled organic microcavities [A. Canaguier-Durand et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 52, 10533 (2013)] have been explained as showing that the fraction of molecules coupled to light vs those uncoupled increases as the Rabi splitting increases, driven by thermodynamics. In this paper, starting from a microscopic model, we investigate the physics of how molecules might self-consistently adapt their coupling to light, considering both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. In both cases we do find that the matter-light coupling can lead to a self-consistent change of the molecular states, with consequent temperature-dependent signatures in the absorption spectrum. However, for typical parameters, these effects are much too weak to explain the measurements. We propose instead another mechanism, of vibrational dressing, that has the right magnitude to be at the origin of the observed data.

abstract: We report on an online platform, Quantum Moves, which presents optimization problems in quantum physics as dynamic games. These games have so far been played 500,000 times. We observe that many of our players explore distinct solution strategies, which outperform numerical optimization algorithms. Combining the players' solutions with numerical methods we obtain a hybrid optimization algorithm that generates significantly improved results. We show that the hybrid solutions explore the most favorable regions of a complex, high-dimensional control landscape that we visualize here for the first time in quantum physics. This provides new insight into the failure of traditional gradient based optimization in quantum control and into the nature of the Quantum Speed Limit (QSL) appearing in optimization problems with bounded resources.

abstract: A superconducting qubit coupled to an open transmission line represents an implementation of the spin-boson model with a broadband environment. We show that this environment can be engineered by introducing partial reflectors into the transmission line, allowing to shape the spectral function, J({\omega}), of the spin-boson model. The spectral function can be accessed by measuring the resonance fluorescence of the qubit, which provides information on both the engineered environment and the coupling between qubit and transmission line. The spectral function of a transmission line without partial reflectors is found to be Ohmic over a wide frequency range, whereas a peaked spectral density is found for the shaped environment. Our work lays the ground for future quantum simulations of other, more involved, impurity models with superconducting circuits.

As a main result we obtain the exact quantum work distributions for charged particles traveling through a time-dependent vector potential evolving under Schr\"odinger as well as under Dirac dynamics, and for which the Jarzynski equality is verified. Special emphasis is put on the conceptual and technical subtleties arising from relativistic quantum mechanics.

abstract: New exact solution class of Born -- Infeld type nonlinear scalar field model is obtained. The variational principle of this model has a specific form which is characteristic for extremal four-dimensional hypersurface or hyper film in five-dimensional space-time. Obtained solutions are singular solitons propagating with speed of light and having energy, momentum, and angular momentum which can be calculated for explicit conditions. The soliton singularity has a form of moving two-dimensional surface or shell. The lightlike soliton can have a set of tubelike singular shells with the appropriate cavities. A twisted lightlike soliton is considered. It is notable that its energy is proportional to its angular momentum in high-frequency approximation. A case with one tubelike cavity is considered. In this case the soliton shell is diffeomorphic to cylindrical surface with cuts by multifilar helix. The shell transverse size of the appropriate finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity. The ideal gas of such lightlike solitons with minimal twist parameter is considered in a finite volume. Explicit conditions provide that the angular momentum of each soliton in the volume equals Planck constant. The equilibrium energy spectral density for the solitons is obtained. It has the form of Planck distribution in some approximation. A beam of twisted lightlike solitons is considered. The representation of arbitrary polarization for beam with twisted lightlike solitons is discussed. It is shown that this beam provides the effect of mechanical angular momentum transfer to absorbent by circularly polarized beam. This effect well known for photon beam. Thus the soliton solution which have determinate likeness with photon is obtained in particular.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate an alternative mathematical model for porphyrin thin film. By introducing an additional gauge degree of freedom, we show that in a special limit and with a specific gauge choice, the pristine model reduces to a time-reversal invariant Hamiltonian, which in turn reduces to the usually $TI$ thin film model in the continuum limit. By incorporating explicit $TRS$ breaking couplings, we give a lucid exposition of the topological phases of the full model by exploring all the topological properties, as a function of the competing interactions. We compute the Chern numbers associated with each topological phase. It is found that in the insulating regime of the pristine model, a phase transition point separates an ordinary insulator phase and a quantum anomalous Hall $(QAH)$ phase, with no quantum spin Hall $(QSH)$ phase; whereas in the $QSH$ regime of the pristine model, the transition point separates a $QSH$ phase and a $QAH$ phase, with no ordinary insulator phase. Thus, a $QAH$ phase appears in both regimes.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling-induced transparency (TIT) and the Autler-Townes (AT) doublet and triplet in a triple-quantum-dot system. For the resonant tunneling case, we show that the TIT induces a transparency dip in a weak-tunneling regime and no anticrossing occurs in the eigenenergies of the system Hamiltonian. However, in a strong-tunneling regime, we show that the TIT evolves to the AT splitting, which results in a well-resolved doublet and double anticrossings. For the off-resonance case, we demonstrate that, in the weak-tunneling regime, the double TIT is realized with a new detuning-dependent dip, where the anticrossing is also absent. In the strong-tunneling regime, the AT triplet is realized with triple anticrossings and a wide detuning-dependent transparency window by manipulating one of the energy-level detunings. Our results can be applied to quantum measurement and quantum-optics devices in solid systems.

abstract: Any nonsingular function of spin j matrices always reduces to a matrix polynomial of order 2j. The challenge is to find a convenient form for the coefficients of the matrix polynomial. The theory of biorthogonal systems is a useful framework to meet this challenge. Central factorial numbers play a key role in the theoretical development. Explicit polynomial coefficients for rotations expressed either as exponentials or as rational Cayley transforms are considered here. Structural features of the results are discussed and compared, and large j limits of the coefficients are examined.

abstract: We study the behavior of the critical Casimir force and its interplay with the van der Waals force acting between two parallel slabs separated at a distance $L$ from each other confining a non-polar simple fluid or a binary liquid mixture. The surfaces of the slabs are coated by thin layers exerting strong preference to the liquid phase of the fluid, or one of the components of the mixture. The slabs influence the fluid by long-range competing dispersion potentials. Under such conditions one usually expects {\it attractive} Casimir force governed by universal scaling function to which the dispersion potentials provide only corrections to scaling. We demonstrate, however, that below a given $L<L_{\rm crit}$ the competition between the effects due to the coatings and the slabs can result in {\it sign change} of the Casimir force when one changes the temperature $T$, the chemical potential of the fluid $\mu$, or $L$. The last implies that by choosing specific materials for the slabs, coatings and the fluid for $L \lesssim L_{\rm crit}$ one can realize {\it repulsive} Casimir force with {\it non-universal} behavior which, upon increasing $L$, gradually turns into an {\it attractive} one described by an {\it universal} scaling function for $L\gg L_{\rm crit}$. We presented arguments and relevant data for specific substances in support of the experimental feasibility of the predicted behavior of the force.
