abstract: Laser photons carrying non-zero orbital angular momentum are known and exploited during the last twenty years. Recently it has been demonstrated experimentally that such (twisted) electrons can be produced and even focused to a subnanometer scale. Thus, twisted electrons emerge as a new tool in atomic physics. The state of a twisted electron can be considered as a specific wave packet of plane waves. In the present paper-I we consider elastic scattering of the wave packets of fast non-relativistic particles on a potential field. We obtain simple and convenient formulae for a number of events in such a scattering. The equations derived represent, in fact, generalization of the well-known Born approximation for the case when finite sizes and inhomogeneity of the initial packet should be taken into account. To illustrate the obtained results, we consider two simple models corresponding to scattering of a Gaussian wave packet on the Gaussian potential and on the hydrogen atom. The scattering of twisted electrons on atoms will be considered in the next paper-II.

abstract: Fourier transforms are ubiquitous mathematical tools in basic and applied sciences. We here report classical and quantum optical realizations of the discrete fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform. In the integrated configuration used in our experiments, the order of the transform is mapped onto the longitudinal coordinate, thus opening up the prospect of simultaneously observing all Transformation orders. In the context of classical optics, we implement discrete fractional Fourier transforms, both integer and fractional, of exemplary wave functions and experimentally demonstrate the shift theorem. Moreover, we apply this approach in the quantum realm to transform separable and highly entangled biphoton wave functions. The proposed approach is versatile and could find applications in various fields where Fourier transforms are essential tools, such as quantum chemistry and biology, physics and mathematics.

abstract: The connection between gauge fields and Discrete Time Quantum Walks (DTQWs) is revisited on a new family of (1 + 2)-dimensional walks whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and by constructing a gauge-invariant discrete electromagnetic field. Numerical simulations outside the scope of the continuous limit confirm the existence of phenomena typical of the electromagnetic coupling, such as Bloch oscillations and the $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift. Applications to quantum simulations and quantum algorithmics are discussed.

abstract: We present a scalable quantum-bus-based device for generating the entanglement on microwave photons (MPs) in distant superconducting resonators (SRs). Different from the processors in previous works with some resonators coupled to a superconducting qubit (SQ), our device is composed of some 1D SRs $r_j$ which are coupled to the quantum bus (another common resonator $R$) in its different positions simply, assisted by superconducting quantum interferometer devices. By using the technique for catching and releasing a MP state in a 1D SR, it can work as an entanglement generator or a node in quantum communication. To demonstrate the performance of this device, we propose a one-step scheme to generate high-fidelity Bell states on MPs in two distant SRs. It works in the dispersive regime of $r_j$ and $R$, which enables us to extend it to generate high-fidelity multi-Bell states on different resonator pairs simultaneously.

abstract: Photoionisation is a process where absorption of one or several photons liberates an electron and creates a hole in a quantum system, such as an atom or a molecule. Is it faster to remove an electron using one or many photons, and how to define this time? Here we introduce a clock that allows us to define ionisation time for both one-photon and many-photon ionisation regimes. The clock uses the interaction of the electron or hole spin with the magnetic field created by their orbital motion, known as the spin-orbit interaction. The angle of spin precession in the magnetic field records time. We use the combination of analytical theory and ab-initio calculations to show how ionisation delay depends on the number of absorbed photons, how it appears in the experiment and what electron dynamics it signifies. In particular, we apply our method to calculate the derived time delays in tunnelling regime of strong-field ionisation.

abstract: We show that discrete quasiprobability distributions defined via the discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group can be obtained as discretizations of the continuous $SU(N)$ quasiprobability distributions. This is done by identifying the phase-point operators with the continuous quantisation kernels evaluated at special points of the phase space. As an application we discuss the positive-P function and show that its discretization can be used to treat the problem of diverging trajectories. We study the dissipative long-range transverse-field Ising chain and show that the long-time dynamics of local observables is well described by a semiclassical approximation of the interactions.

abstract: Multi-photon entanglement has been successfully made by experimental groups. As the increase of photon number, several problems are encountered, say, greater number of copies, longer time, the error of fidelity and so on. In this paper, we present a new scheme based on Lagrange multiplier and feedback to save the measure copies in multi-photon experiment and five percent of measuring time, also guarantee the acceptable error of fidelity. All the results have been supported by the data of eight photon experiment. Furthermore, same approach is applied in the simulation for ten photon entanglement, and 22.45 percent of copies are saved, optimized copy distribution gives better estimation of fidelity than the average copy distribution.

abstract: Spatial search is a widely studied application of quantum algorithms. Several algorithms have been proposed for spatial search without using ancilla qubits which are easier to implement physically. All such algorithms are based on the widely studied quantum walk approach. Here we consider another approach by Aaronson and Ambainis based on the recursive application of Grover's algorithm rather than quantum walks. Their algorithm needs one ancilla qubit for successful implementation. We present a different recursive algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubit and hence it offers physical implementation advantages.

abstract: In this paper we discuss mainly with our proposed non maximally entangled mixed state defined in (Adhikari \textit{et. al}, \textit{Quant. Inf. Comp.}\textbf{10}, No. 5, 0398, (2010)). We show that such non maximal entangled state is dependent on its characteristic parameter. As has been already shown, that for certain parameter range, the state could be used as a teleportation channel, we show here that for some other ranges of parameter the state behaves as a bound entangled state. We also show that for all values of the characteristic parameter of the state, coherent information is always less than zero, so that the state can never used in dense coding protocols. We conjectured the existence of witnesses which can categorize dense codeable states.

abstract: Weak values allow the measurement of observables associated to non-commuting operators. Up to now, position-momentum weak values have been mainly developed for (relativistic) photons. In this work, a proposal for the measurement of such weak values in typical electronic devices is presented. Inspired by the classical Ramo-Shockley-Pellegrini theorem that provides a relation between current and electron velocity, it is shown that the displacement current measured in multiterminal configurations can provide either a weak measurement of the momentum or strong measurement of position. This proposal opens new opportunities for fundamental and applied physics with state-of-the-art electronic technology. As an example, a setup for the measurement of the Bohmian velocity of (non-relativistic) electrons is presented and tested with numerical experiments.

abstract: Quantum coherence is the yield of the superposition principle. Recently, it has been theorized as a quantum resource, and is the premise of quantum correlations in multipartite systems. However, coherence is degraded by environmental interactions. It is therefore natural to study the coherence content and its distribution in a multipartite quantum system. In this work, we show analytically as well as numerically the reciprocity between coherence and mixedness of a quantum state. It appears that this trade-off is a general feature rather being exotic. We also study the distribution of coherence in multipartite systems and prove several interesting results. Numerical investigation unravels the fact that the percent of quantum states satisfying the additivity relation of coherence increases with increasing number of parties, the rank of quantum state and raising the power of coherence measure under investigation. We also study distribution of coherence in X states. We further show that for Dicke states, while the normalized measures of coherence violate the additivity relation, the unnormalized ones do satisfy the same.

abstract: We combine single- and two-photon interference procedures for characterizing any multi-port linear optical interferometer accurately and precisely. Accuracy is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced precision is attained by curve fitting to measured quantities based on a Poissonian shot noise assumption, and we employ bootstrapping statistics to quantify the resultant degree of precision. A scattershot approach is devised to effect a reduction in the experimental time required to characterize the interferometer.

abstract: Additional information in the Hamilton-Jacobi representation of quantum mechanics, not available in the Schr\"odinger representation, renders microstates of $\psi$. This additional information is incorporated into the quantum reduced action, $W$. Jacobi's theorem generates a microstate-dependent time parametrization $t-\tau=\partial_E W$ where energy, $E$, and action variable, $J$, are quantized eigenvalues. Milne quantization renders eigenvalue $J$s. Eigenvalues $J$ and $E$ mutually imply each other. The behavior of the quantum reduced action as a function of energy for non-eigenvalue energies or action variables is continuous within a neighborhood that contains an energy or action variable eigenvalue as a limit point. Substantiating examples include solving the linear harmonic oscillator numerically and the square well symbolically in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formulation.

abstract: Finite plane geometry is associated with finite dimensional Hilbert space. The association allows mapping of q-number Hilbert space observables to the c-number formalism of quantum mechanics in phase space. The mapped entities reflect geometrically based line-point interrelation. Particularly simple formulas are involved when use is made of mutually unbiased bases (MUB) representations for the Hilbert space entries. The geometry specifies a point-line interrelation. Thus underpinning d-dimensional Hilbert space operators (resp. states) with geometrical points leads to operators termed "line operators" underpinned by the geometrical lines. These "line operators", $\hat{L}_j;$ (j designates the line) form a complete orthogonal basis for Hilbert space operators. The representation of Hilbert space operators in terms of these operators form the phase space representation of the d-dimensional Hilbert space. The "line operators" (resp. "line states") are studied in detail. The paper aims at self sufficiency and to this end all relevant notions are explained herewith.

On the one side the revelations of Snowden, though he said nothing really new, made the world more aware of the importance to protect sensitive data from all kinds of adversaries, including sometimes "friends." On the other side, breakthroughs in quantum computation, in particular in superconducting qubits and surface-codes, made it possible that in 15 to 25 years there might be a quantum machine able to break today's codes. This implies that in order to protect today's data over a few decades, one has to act now and use some quantum-safe cryptography.

abstract: We have established that the mean photon number obtained employing the conventional Hamiltonian for the twin light beams with the same frequency, produced by a subharmonic generator, is half that of the twin light beams with different frequencies. In view of this, we have found it to be quite appropriate to describe the process of subharmonic generation by the same Hamiltonian regardless of whether the twin light beams have the same or different frequencies. Applying this Hamiltonian, we have calculated the photon statistics and quadrature squeezing for the signal-signal and the signal-idler modes. Obviously, this time the mean photon number of the signal-signal modes is exactly the same as that of the signal-idler modes. In addition, we have found that the maximum global quadrature squeezing of the signal-signal or the signal-idler modes is 50$\%$ below the vacuum-state level and the maximum local quadrature squeezing of the signal-signal modes is 74.9$\%$ below the same level.

abstract: The answer to the question {\it How far can one send a photon?} depends heavily on what one means by {\it a photon} and on what one intends to do with that photon. For direct quantum communication the limit is of about 500 km. For terrestrial quantum communication, near future technologies based on quantum teleportation and quantum memories will soon enable quantum repeaters that will turn the development of a world-wide-quantum-web (WWQW) into a (highly non-trivial) engineering problem. For Device Independent Quantum Information Processing, near future qubit amplifiers (i.e. probabilistic heralded amplification of the probability amplitude of presence of photonic qubits) will soon allow demonstrations over a few tens of km.

abstract: A key ingredient of quantum repeaters is entanglement distillation, i.e., the generation of high-fidelity entangled qubits from a larger set of pairs with lower fidelity. Here, we present entanglement distillation protocols based on qubit couplings that originate from exchange interaction. First, we make use of asymmetric bilateral two-qubit operations generated from anisotropic exchange interaction and show how to distill entanglement using two input pairs. We furthermore consider the case of three input pairs coupled through isotropic exchange. Here, we characterize a set of protocols which are optimizing the tradeoff between the fidelity increase and the probability of a successful run.

abstract: We explore the challenges posed by the violation of Bell-like inequalities by $d$-dimensional systems exposed to imperfect state-preparation and measurement settings. We address, in particular, the limit of high-dimensional systems, naturally arising when exploring the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that, although suitable Bell inequalities can be violated, in principle, for any dimension of given subsystems, it is in practice increasingly challenging to detect such violations, even if the system is prepared in a maximally entangled state. We characterize the effects of random perturbations on the state or on the measurement settings, also quantifying the efforts needed to certify the possible violations in case of complete ignorance on the system state at hand.

abstract: Being able to implement effective entanglement distribution in noisy environments is a key step towards practical quantum communication, and long-term efforts have been made on the development of it. Recently, it has been found that the null-result weak measurement (NRWM) can be used to enhance probabilistically the entanglement of a single copy of amplitude-damped entangled state. This paper investigates remote distributions of bipartite and multipartite entangled states in the amplitude-damping environment by combining NRWMs and entanglement distillation protocols (EDPs). We show that the NRWM has no positive effect on the distribution of 2-qubit maximally entangled states, although it is able to increase the amount of entanglement of each source state (noisy entangled state) of EDPs with a certain probability. More importantly, we find that the NRWM would contribute to remote distributions of multipartite entangled states, e.g.,Wstates. We demonstrate that the NRWM can not only reduce the fidelity threshold for distillability of the decohered $N$-qubit W state, but also raise the distillation efficiency of the $N$-qubit W state. Our results also suggest a new idea for quantifying the ability of a local filtering operation in protecting entanglement from decoherence.

abstract: A universal quantum computer will have fundamental impact on a vast number of research fields and technologies. Therefore an increasingly large scientific and industrial community is working towards the realization of such a device. A large scale quantum computer is best constructed using a modular approach. We present the blueprint for an ion trap based scalable quantum computer module which makes it possible to create an arbitrarily large quantum computer architecture powered by long-wavelength radiation. This quantum computer module controls all operations as a stand-alone unit, is constructed using silicon microfabrication techniques and within reach of current technology. To perform the required quantum computations, the module makes use of long-wavelength-radiation quantum gate technology and relies only on a vacuum environment and global laser and microwave fields. To scale this microwave quantum computer architecture beyond one module we also present a new approach that makes use of ion transport between different modules, thereby allowing connections between arbitrarily many modules for a large scale architecture. A high-error-threshold surface error correction code making use of such module interactions can be implemented in the proposed architecture to execute fault-tolerant quantum logic operations. With only minor adjustments these modules are also suitable for alternative ion trap quantum computer architectures, such as schemes using photonic interconnects.

We finally employ quantum feedback control to suppress detector backaction and determine the work statistics.

abstract: Complex eigenvalues, resonances, play an important role in large variety of fields in physics and chemistry. For example, in cold molecular collision experiments and electron scattering experiments, autoionizing and pre-dissociative metastable resonances are generated. However, the computation of complex resonance eigenvalues is difficult, since it requires severe modifications of standard electronic structure codes and methods. Here we show how resonance eigenvalues, positions and widths, can be calculated using the standard, widely used, electronic-structure packages. Our method enables the calculations of the complex resonance eigenvalues by using analytical continuation procedures (such as Pad\'{e}). The key point in our approach is the existence of narrow analytical passages from the real axis to the complex energy plane. In fact, the existence of these analytical passages relies on using finite basis sets. These passages become narrower as the basis set becomes more complete, whereas in the exact limit, these passages to the complex plane are closed. As illustrative numerical examples we calculated the autoionization resonances of helium, hydrogen anion and hydrogen molecule. We show that our results are in an excellent agreement with the results obtained by other theoretical methods and with available experimental results.

abstract: Coherent controlization, i.e., coherent conditioning of arbitrary single- or multi-qubit operations on the state of one or more control qubits, is an important ingredient for the flexible implementation of many algorithms in quantum computation. This is of particular significance when certain subroutines are changing over time or when they are frequently modified, such as in decision-making algorithms for learning agents. We propose a scheme to realize coherent controlization for any number of superconducting qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. For two and three qubits, we present an explicit construction that is of high relevance for quantum learning agents. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, taking into account loss, dephasing, and the cavity self-Kerr effect.

abstract: We extend the usual representation of quantum algorithms, limited to the process of solving the problem, to the process of setting the problem. This originates two time-symmetric and relational representations, one with respect to the problem setter, the other with respect to the problem solver, to whom the setting of the problem must be hidden inside a black box. We show that one is free to ascribe to the final measurement, required to read the solution of the problem, any part of the selection of the random outcome of the initial measurement, required to prepare the computer register with the desired setting of the problem. This projects the input state with respect to the problem solver, of complete ignorance of the problem setting, on a state of lower entropy where she knows part of the problem setting in advance, before performing any computation. The quantum algorithm turns out to be a sum over classical histories in each of which the problem solver, knowing in advance part of the problem setting, performs the computations steps (oracle queries) still required to identify the solution. Given an oracle problem and the fraction of the information (R) that specifies the random outcome of the initial measurement whose selection is ascribed to the final measurement, this retrocausality model provides the number of computation steps required to solve the problem quantally. Conversely, given a known quantum algorithm, it yields the value of R that explains its speed up. We compare the retrocausality model with a sample of quantum algorithms. R is steadily 1/2 or, in one case, slightly above it. Conversely, R = 1/2 always corresponds to an existing quantum algorithm and provides the order of magnitude of the number of computation steps required by the optimal one. If this held in general, it would solve the open problem of quantum query complexity. This work is an exploration.

abstract: Measurements on quantum channels are described by so-called process operator valued measures, or process POVMs. We study implementing schemes of extremal process POVMs. As it turns out, the corresponding measurement must satisfy certain extremality property, which is stronger that the usual extremality given by the convex structure. This property motivates the introduction and investigation of the A-convex structure of POVMs, which generalizes both the usual convex and C*-convex structure. We show that extremal points and faces of the set of process POVMs are closely related to A-extremal points and A-faces of POVMs, for a certain subalgebra A. We give a characterization of A-extremal and A-pure POVMs in the Appendix.

Assessing the validity of these models is extremely challenging because, although their expected effects can be significant in various realistic situations, it is non-trivial to discriminate unambiguously their presence in experiments where other hardly controllable sources of noise compete to the overall decoherence. Here we provide a simple procedure able to probe the hypothetical presence of the collapse noise with a levitated nanosphere in a Fabry-Perot cavity. We show that the stationary state of the system is particularly sensitive, under specific experimental conditions, to the interplay between the cavity size, the trapping frequency and the momentum diffusion induced by the collapse models, allowing to detect them even in the presence of standard environmental noises.

title: Quantum field theory treatment of magnetic effects on the spin and orbital angular momentum of a free electron

abstract: We consider in a quantum field theory framework the effects of a classical magnetic field on the spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a free electron. We derive formulae for the changes in the spin and OAM due to the introduction of a general classical background field. We consider then a constant magnetic field, in which case the relevant expressions of the effects become much simpler and conversions between spin and OAM become readily apparent. An estimate of the expectation values for a realistic electron state is also given. Our findings may be of interest to researchers in spintronics and the field of quantum biology, where electron spin has been implicated on macroscopic time and energy scales.

abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for many-body state preparation. It is especially suited for injective PEPS and thermal states of local commuting Hamiltonians on a lattice. We show that for a uniform gap and sufficiently smooth paths, an adiabatic runtime and circuit depth of $ O(\operatorname{polylog} N)$ can be achieved for $O(N)$ spins. This is an almost exponential improvement over previous bounds. The total number of elementary gates scales as $O(N \operatorname{polylog} N)$. This is also faster than the best known upper bound of $O(N^2)$ on the mixing times of Monte-Carlo Markov Chain algorithms for sampling classical systems in thermal equilibrium.

abstract: Fluctuation and dissipation are by-products of coupling to the `environment.' The Caldeira-Leggett model, a successful paradigm of quantum Brownian motion, views the environment as a collection of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the system. However, symmetry considerations may forbid a linear coupling, e.g. for a neutral particle in quantum electrodynamics. We argue that nonlinear couplings can lead to a fundamentally different behavior. Specifically, we consider a heavy particle quadratically coupled to quantum fluctuations of the bath. In one dimension the particle undergoes anomalous diffusion, unfolding as a power-law distribution in space, reminiscent of L\'{e}vy flights. We suggest condensed matter analogs where similar effects may arise.

abstract: The breaking of a combined PT (parity- and time-reversal) symmetry in non-Hermitian systems with balanced gain and loss is conventionally associated with a transition from a purely oscillatory to an exponentially amplified dynamical regime. In this work we analyze the steady state of systems with an underlying PT symmetry and show that the combination of nonlinear saturation effects and noise, both of which shall be present in actual experiments, result in unexpected behavior that differs significantly from the usual dynamical picture. In particular, we observe additional phases with preserved or weakly broken PT symmetry, and an unconventional transition from a high-noise thermal state to a low-amplitude lasing state. We illustrate these effects here for the specific example of coupled mechanical resonators with optically-induced loss and gain, but the described mechanisms will be essential for understanding the steady-state properties of actual PT-symmetric systems in general.

abstract: For more than 35 years theorists have studied quantum or Casimir friction, which occurs when two smooth bodies move transversely to each other, experiencing a frictional dissipative force due to quantum fluctuations. These forces are typically very small, unless the bodies are nearly touching, and consequently such effects have never been observed, although lateral Casimir forces have been seen for corrugated surfaces. Because of the lack of contact with phenomena, theoretical predictions for the frictional force between parallel plates, or between a polarizable atom and a metallic plate, have varied widely. Here we review the history of these calculations, show that theoretical consensus is emerging, and offer some hope that it might be possible to experimentally confirm this phenomenon of dissipative quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: Due to the absence of degeneracy in one dimension, when a parameter, $\lambda$, of a potential is varied slowly the discrete energy eigenvalue curves, $E_n(\lambda)$, cannot cross but they are allowed to come quite close and diverge from each other. This phenomena is called avoided crossing of energy levels. The parametric evolution of eigenvalues of the generally known one dimensional potentials do not display avoided crossings and on the other hand some complicated and analytically unsolvable models do exhibit this. Here, we show that this interesting spectral property can be found in simple one-dimensional double-wells when width of one of them is varied slowly.

abstract: The master equation for a charged harmonic oscillator coupled to an electromagnetic reservoir is investigated up to fourth-order in the interaction strength by using Krylov averaging method. The interaction is in the velocity-coupling form and includes a diamagnetic term. Exact analytical expressions for the second, the third, and the fourth-order contributions to mass renormalization, decay constant, normal and anomalous diffusion coefficients are obtained for the blackbody type environment. It is found that, generally, the third and the fourth order contributions have opposite sign when their magnitudes are comparable to that of the second order one.

The Comment did not confront my explanation without potentials of the Aharonov-Bohm effects appeared in the original paper, but stated that I cannot apply this explanation for seven other examples. In my reply I provide explanations using my method, of one of the examples, show that two other example are not relevant, and agree that the remaining examples require further analysis. However, I argue that none of the examples provide robust counter examples to my claim similar to the original Aharonov-Bohm setups which were explained in my Paper, so the Comment does not refute my claim.

abstract: We study one-dimensional systems of $N$ particles in a one-dimensional harmonic trap with an inverse power law interaction $\sim|x|^{-d}$. Within the framework of the harmonic approximation we derive, in the strong interaction limit, the Schmidt decomposition of the one-particle reduced density matrix and investigate the nature of the degeneracy appearing in its spectrum. Furthermore, the ground-state asymptotic occupancies and their natural orbitals are derived in closed analytic form, which enables their easy determination for a wide range of values of $N$. A closed form asymptotic expression for the von Neumann entanglement entropy is also provided and its dependence on $N$ is discussed for the systems with $d=1$ (charged particles) and with $d=3$ (dipolar particles).

abstract: The identification of phenomena able to pinpoint quantum interference is attracting large interest. Indeed, a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an important leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical applications, such as certification of photonic quantum devices, whose computational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle interference. Quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many particles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the Fourier transformation in the Fock space. In this work we develop a scalable approach for the implementation of quantum fast Fourier transform using 3-D photonic integrated interferometers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique. We observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4- and 8-mode optical circuits: the experimental results demonstrate genuine quantum interference between the injected photons, thus offering a powerful tool for diagnostic of photonic platforms.

The dipole--dipole interactions between Rydberg excited atoms significantly distort the dark state and electromagnetically induced transparency behavior observed with independent atoms and, thus, their steady state light emission. We calculate and analyze the temporal correlations between intensities and amplitudes of the signals emitted by the atoms and explain their origin in the atomic Rydberg state interactions.

abstract: We generalise a non-classicality test described by Kot et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 233601 (2010)], which can be used to rule out any classical description of a physical system. The test is based on measurements of quadrature operators and works by proving a contradiction with the classical description in terms of a probability distribution in phase space. As opposed to the previous work, we generalise the test to include states without rotational symmetry in phase space. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the non-classicality test with classical tomography methods based on the inverse Radon transform, which can also be used to establish the quantum nature of a physical system. In particular, we consider a non-classicality test based on the so-called filtered back-projection formula. We show that the general non-classicality test is conceptually simpler, requires less assumptions on the system and is statistically more reliable than the tests based on the filtered back-projection formula. As a specific example, we derive the optimal test for a quadrature squeezed single photon state and show that the efficiency of the test does not change with the degree of squeezing.

abstract: Absorption spectroscopy is routinely used to characterise chemical and biological samples. For the state-of-the-art in absorption spectroscopy, precision is theoretically limited by shot-noise due to the fundamental Poisson-distribution of photon number in laser radiation. In practice, the shot-noise limit can only be achieved when all other sources of noise are eliminated. Here, we use wavelength-correlated and tuneable photon pairs to demonstrate sub-shot-noise absorption spectroscopy. We measure the absorption spectra of spectrally-similar biological samples---oxyhaemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin---and show that obtaining a given precision in resolution requires fewer heralded single probe photons compared to using an ideal laser.

abstract: We devise a ternary operation for combining three quantum states: it consists of permuting the input systems in a continuous fashion and then discarding all but one of them. This generalizes a binary operation recently studied by Audenaert et al. [arXiv:1503.04213] in the context of entropy power inequalities. In fact, our ternary operation continuously interpolates between all such nested binary operations. Our construction is based on a unitary version of Cayley's theorem: we use representation theory to show that any finite group can be naturally embedded in a continuous subgroup of the unitary group. Formally, this amounts to characterizing when a linear combination of certain permutations is unitary.

abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a valuable tool for sensing and polarizing spins. Motivated by potential applications in chemistry, biology and medicine we show that NV-based sensors are capable of detecting single spin targets even if they undergo diffusive motion in an ambient thermal environment. Focusing on experimentally relevant diffusion regimes we derive an effective model for the NV-target interaction, where parameters entering the model are obtained from numerical simulations of the target motion. The practicality of our approach is demonstrated by analyzing two realistic experimental scenarios: (i) time-resolved sensing of a fluorine target bound to an NHC-Ru catalyst that is immobilized on the diamond surface and (ii) detection of an electron spin label by an NV center in a nanodiamond, both attached to a vibrating chemokine receptor in thermal motion. We find in particular that the detachment of a fluorine target from the NHC-Ru carrier molecule can be monitored with a time resolution of a few seconds.

abstract: Propagation of information encoded in spin degrees of freedom through networks of coupled spins enables important applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. We study control of information propagation in networks of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles with uniform nearest neighbour couplings forming a ring with a single excitation in the network as simple prototype of a router for spin-based information. Specifically optimising spatially distributed potentials, which remain constant during information transfer, simplifies the implementation of the routing scheme. However, the limited degrees of freedom makes finding a control that maximises the transfer probability in a short time difficult. We show that the structure of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors must fulfill a specific condition to be able to maximise the transfer fidelity, and demonstrate that a specific choice among the many potential structures that fulfill this condition significantly improves the solutions found by optimal control.

abstract: The recent discovery of fully-homomorphic classical encryption schemes has had a dramatic effect on the direction of modern cryptography. Such schemes, however, implicitly rely on the assumptions that solving certain computation problems are intractable. Here we present a quantum encryption scheme which is homomorphic for arbitrary classical and quantum circuits which have at most some constant number of non-Clifford gates. Unlike classical schemes, the security of the scheme we present is information theoretic, satisfying entropic security definitions, and hence independent of the computational power of an adversary.

abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can provide enhanced security, as compared to traditional QKD, and it constitutes an important framework for a quantum network with an untrusted network server. Still, a key assumption in MDI-QKD is that the sources are trusted. We propose here a MDI quantum network with a single untrusted source. We have derived a complete proof of the unconditional security of MDI-QKD with an untrusted source. Using simulations, we have considered various real-life imperfections in its implementation, and the simulation results show that MDI-QKD with an untrusted source provides a key generation rate that is close to the rate of initial MDI-QKD in the asymptotic setting. Our work proves the feasibility of the realization of a quantum network. The network users need only low-cost modulation devices, and they can share both an expensive detector and a complicated laser provided by an untrusted network server.

However, it is now known that some quantum features may be acheived with quantum discord, a generalized measure of quantum correlation. In this paper, we study how quantum discord, or more specifically, the measures of entropic discord and geometric discord are affected by the influence of amplitude damping decoherence. We also show that a protocol deploying weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal can effectively protect quantum discord from amplitude damping decoherence, enabling to distribute quantum correlation between two remote parties in a noisy environment.

Using this cost-efficient entanglement access network, we report experimental demonstration of a secure multiparty computation protocol, the privacy-preserving secure sum problem, based on the network quantum cryptography.

The photon is heralded by its time-correlated partner generated in the SPDC process, while the absorption event is heralded by a single photon emitted in its course. Coincidence detection marks doubly-heralded absorption, enabling photon-to-atom quantum state transfer [1, 2]. Background in the coincidence measurement is strongly suppressed by a new method that discriminates real absorption events from dark count-induced coincidences.

A heat-transfer analysis between the components of the instrument as well as a transfer-function analysis on thermal oscillations induced by the spacecraft interior and by dissipative sources is performed. The thermal behaviour of the instrument in an orbit around a Lagrangian point and in a highly elliptical Earth orbit is discussed. Finally, we investigate further possible design improvements aiming at lower temperatures of the environment of the macroscopic particle. These include a mirror-based design of the imaging system on the optical bench and the extension of the heat shields.

By evaluating canonical potential, we obtain Casimir potential and force at the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$. We also show that Casimir force oscillates depends on distance $d$ for fixed parameters.

abstract: Curiously overlooked in physics is its dependence on the transmission of numbers. For example the transmission of numerical clock readings is implicit in the concept of a coordinate system. The transmission of numbers and other logical distinctions is often achieved over a computer-mediated communications network in the face of an unpredictable environment. By unpredictable we mean something stronger than the spread of probabilities over given possible outcomes, namely an opening to unforeseeable possibilities. Unpredictability, until now overlooked in theoretical physics, makes the transmission of numbers interesting. Based on recent proofs within quantum theory that provide a theoretical foundation to unpredictability, here we show how regularities in physics rest on a background of channels over which numbers are transmitted. As is known to engineers of digital communications, numerical transmissions depend on coordination reminiscent of the cycle of throwing and catching by players tossing a ball back and forth. In digital communications, the players are computers, and the required coordination involves unpredictably adjusting "live clocks" that step these computers through phases of a cycle. We show how this phasing, which we call `logical synchronization,' constrains number-carrying networks, and, if a spacetime manifold in invoked, put "stripes" on spacetime. Via its logically synchronized channels, a network of live clocks serves as a reference against which to locate events. Such a network in any case underpins a coordinate frame, and in some cases the direct use of a network can be tailored to investigate an unpredictable environment. Examples include explorations of gravitational variations near Earth.

abstract: Correlations related to related to quantum entanglement have convinced many physicists that there must be some at-a-distance connection between separated events, at the quantum level. In the late 1940's, however, O. Costa de Beauregard proposed that such correlations can be explained without action at a distance, so long as the influence takes a zigzag path, via the intersecting past lightcones of the events in question. Costa de Beauregard's proposal is related to what has come to be called the retrocausal loophole in Bell's Theorem, but -- like that loophole -- it receives little attention, and remains poorly understood. Here we propose a new way to explain and motivate the idea. We exploit some simple symmetries to show how Costa de Beauregard's zigzag needs to work, to explain the correlations at the core of Bell's Theorem. As a bonus, the explanation shows how entanglement might be a much simpler matter than the orthodox view assumes -- not a puzzling feature of quantum reality itself, but an entirely unpuzzling feature of our knowledge of reality, once zigzags are in play.

abstract: We develop a theory to teleport an unknown quantum state using entanglement between two distant parties. Our theory takes into account experimental limitations due to contribution of multi-photon pair production of parametric down conversion source, inefficiency and dark counts of detectors and channel losses. We use a linear optics setup for quantum teleportation of an unknown quantum state by performing Bell state measurement by the sender. Our theory successfully provides a model for experimentalists to optimize the fidelity by adjusting the experimental parameters. We apply our model to a recent experiment on quantum teleportation and the results obtained by our model are in good agreement with the experiment results.

abstract: In quantum physics, measurements give random results and yield a corresponding random back action on the state of the system subject to measurement. If a quantum system is probed continuously over time, its state evolves along a stochastic quantum trajectory. To investigate the characteristic properties of such dynamics, we perform weak continuous measurements on a superconducting qubit that is driven to undergo Rabi oscillations. From the data we observe a number of striking temporal correlations within the time dependent signals and the quantum trajectories of the qubit, and we discuss their explanation in terms of quantum measurement and photodetection theory.

In order to illustrate the method, we compute the normalized trace of unitary matrices, and implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The largest matrix that can be manipulated with our set-up is 1080$\times$1920, which is able to represent a system with approximately 21 qubits.

abstract: We explore the crucial role of relative space-time positioning between the two detectors in an operational two-party entanglement-harvesting protocol. Specifically we show that the protocol is robust if imprecision in spatial positioning and clock synchronization are much smaller than the spatial separation between the detectors and its light-crossing time thereof. This in principle guarantees robustness if the imprecision is comparable to a few times the size of the detectors, which suggests entanglement harvesting could be explored for tabletop experiments. On the other hand, keeping the effects of this imprecision under control would be demanding on astronomical scales.

abstract: We demonstrate improved operation of exchange-coupled semiconductor quantum dots by substantially reducing the sensitivity of exchange operations to charge noise. The method involves biasing a double-dot symmetrically between the charge-state anti-crossings, where the derivative of the exchange energy with respect to gate voltages is minimized. Exchange remains highly tunable by adjusting the tunnel coupling. We find that this method reduces the effect of charge noise by more than a factor of five in comparison to operation near a charge-state anti-crossing, improving the number of observable exchange oscillations in our qubit by a similar factor.

abstract: By exploiting the hyperentanglement, we propose a new concrete scheme to realize weak value amplification, which can be implemented by N hyperentangled photons along with coincidence detection. Our scheme can optimally increase the amplification factor by a factor of N compared to the usage of N uncorrelated photons, and achieve the Heisenberg limit for the purpose of parameter estimation. We expect our study can inspire a further investigation on the usage of hyperentanglement in weak measurement and quantum metrology.

abstract: We demonstrate the quantum fidelity approach for exploring and mapping out quantum phases. As a simple model exhibiting a number of distinct quantum phases, we consider the alternating-bond Ising chain using the infinite time evolving block decimation method in the infinite matrix product state representation. Examining the quantum fidelity with an arbitrary reference state in the whole range of the interaction parameters leads to the explicit detection of the doubly degenerate groundstates, indicating a $Z_2$ broken symmetry. The discontinuities of the fidelity indicate a first-order quantum phase transition between the four ordered phases. In order to characterize each phase, based on the spin configurations from the spin correlations, even and odd antiferromagnetic order parameters are introduced. The four defined local order parameters are shown to characterize each phase and to exhibit first-order quantum phase transitions between the ordered phases.

abstract: Finding a given node in a network exploiting the speed-up offered by quantum search was only known to hold for a handful of specific graphs. In this work, we prove that for Erd\"os-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\ graphs of $n$ vertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by continuous time quantum walk is \textit{almost surely} optimal as long as $p\geq \log^{3/2}(n)/n$. Consequently, we prove that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for \emph{almost all} graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices for which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish high fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random network of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as well as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks typically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered structures.

abstract: Fundamental principle of classical physics -- local realism, means that freely chosen observations can be explained by a local (slower than light) real process. It is apparently violated in quantum mechanics as shown by Bell theorem. Despite extreme efforts experiments have not conclusively confirmed this violation due to loopholes. We propose a new postulate that the description of quantum processes must be consistent with local realism, It also assumes existence of many worlds/copies of the same system, interacting weakly microscopically but strongly macroscopically, whose number can be estimated experimentally.Bell theorem will never address a real experiment because its assumptions cannot be strictly fulfilled. By an appropriate generalization of quantum framework and measurement postulates, in particular taking into account freedom of choice, local realism agrees with quantum mechanics and the performed experiments, also involving single qubit coherence and a weaker version of the Bell test, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering.

abstract: In this letter, we present a new procedure to determine completely the complex modular values of arbitrary observables of pre- and post-selected ensembles, which works experimentally for both weak and strong measurement strengths. By controlling simultaneously the visibility and the phase of an interferometric experiment involving a qubit meter, we determine directly both the modulus and the argument of the modular value as a function of the measurement strength. Modular and weak values are closely related. When two entangled qubits are used as the probed and meter systems, the phase of the modular and weak values has a topological origin. Its physical significance can thus be used to evaluate the quantumness of weak values.

The solution shows that the total wave function is a two-term function in the sense that it is a linear combination of the two linear independent wave functions. The two-term character of the total wave function was visualized in calculations of the total electron density of $H_2^+$ at different internuclear separations.

abstract: This chapter covers the development of feedback control of superconducting qubits using projective measurement and a discrete set of conditional actions, here referred to as digital feedback. We begin with an overview of the applications of digital feedback in quantum computing. We then introduce an implementation of high-fidelity projective measurement of superconducting qubits. This development lays the ground for closed-loop control based on the binary measurement result. A first application of digital feedback control is fast and deterministic qubit reset, allowing the repeated initialization of a qubit more than an order of magnitude faster than its relaxation rate. A second application employs feedback in a multi-qubit setting to convert the generation of entanglement by parity measurement from probabilistic to deterministic, targeting an entangled state with the desired parity every time.

abstract: Reliable quantum information processing in the face of errors is a major fundamental and technological challenge. Quantum error correction protects quantum states by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) in multiple physical qubits, so that errors can be detected without affecting the encoded state. To be compatible with universal fault-tolerant computations, it is essential that the states remain encoded at all times and that errors are actively corrected. Here we demonstrate such active error correction on a continuously protected qubit using a diamond quantum processor. We encode a logical qubit in three long-lived nuclear spins, repeatedly detect phase errors by non-destructive measurements using an ancilla electron spin, and apply corrections on the encoded state by real-time feedback. The actively error-corrected qubit is robust against errors and multiple rounds of error correction prevent errors from accumulating. Moreover, by correcting phase errors naturally induced by the environment, we demonstrate that encoded quantum superposition states are preserved beyond the dephasing time of the best physical qubit used in the encoding. These results establish a powerful platform for the fundamental investigation of error correction under different types of noise and mark an important step towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

abstract: A protocol for transferring an unknown single qubit state has quantum features when the average fidelity of the outcomes is greater than 2/3. We use the probabilistic and unambiguous state extraction scheme as a mechanism to redistribute the fidelity in the outcome of the teleportation when the process is performed with an X-state as a noisy quantum channel. We show that the entanglement of the channel is necessary but not sufficient in order for the total average fidelity f_X to display quantum features, i.e., we find a threshold C_X for the concurrence of the channel. If the mechanism for redistributing fidelity is successfully applied then we find a filtrable outcome with normalized average fidelity f_{X,USE,0} greater than f_X. In addition, we find the threshold concurrence of the channel C_{X,USE,0} in order for the normalized average fidelity to display quantum features. Surprisingly, we find that the threshold concurrence C_{X,USE,0} can be lesser than C_X. Finally, we show that if the mechanism for redistributing fidelity fails then the respective filtrable outcome has average fidelity lesser than 2/3.

abstract: Stopping and regenerating a pair of single-photon pulses at adjacent locations in coherently prepared Rydberg atomic ensembles are significantly affected by their effective interaction mediated by Rydberg excitations, and the similar processes can differ notably from the one exhibiting the common Rydberg blockade as with the stationary propagation of multi-photon light beams in the same medium. Based on the complete dynamics, we reveal the detailed features in such processes by finding how the profiles of the involved quantum fields evolve in various situations. The findings help to determine the proper regimes for implementing photonic gates and transistors. In addition, we discuss the non-adiabatic corrections associated with quickly changing control fields, and illustrate a method that restores the photon pulses' original amplitude during their retrieval unless they are heavily damped before storage.

abstract: We propose a two-way secure-communication protocol in which Alice uses an amplified spontaneous emission source while Bob employs binary phase-shift keying and an optical amplifier. Against an eavesdropper who captures all the light lost in fibers linking Alice and Bob, this protocol is capable of 3.5 Gbps quantum-secured direct communication at 50 km range. If Alice augments her terminal with a spontaneous parametric downconverter and both Alice and Bob add channel monitors, they can realize 2 Gbps quantum key distribution at that range against an eavesdropper who injects her own light into Bob's terminal. Compared with prevailing quantum key distribution methods, this protocol has the potential to significantly increase secure key rates at long distances by employing many ultrabroadband photons per key bit to mitigate channel loss.

abstract: Quantum entanglement shared between more than two particles is essential to foundational questions in quantum mechanics, and upcoming quantum information technologies. So far, up to 14 two-dimensional qubits have been entangled, and an open question remains if one can also demonstrate entanglement of higher-dimensional discrete properties of more than two particles. A promising route is the use of the photon orbital angular momentum (OAM), which enables implementation of novel quantum information protocols, and the study of fundamentally new quantum states. To date, only two of such multidimensional particles have been entangled albeit with ever increasing dimensionality. Here we use pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) to produce photon quadruplets that are entangled in their OAM, or transverse-mode degrees of freedom; and witness genuine multipartite Dicke-type entanglement. Apart from addressing foundational questions, this could find applications in quantum metrology, imaging, and secret sharing.

abstract: The objectivity of quantum measurement is treated as an emergent phenomenon with $N$ observers who can agree to the same result of measurement, and meanwhile, they can identify their records with each other. In this many-observer world (MOW), an objective quantum measurement is dealt with as a multipartite [$(N+1)$-body] quantum correlation among the measured system and $N$ observers when its bipartite reductions are the same classical correlations. With this conceptual clarification, we find that, an objective quantum measurement is implemented if and only if the MOW is initially factorized in a pure state and then the total system can evolve into a generalized GHZ state with respect to the orthogonal basis preferred by each observer. Especially, such objective quantum measurement is recast in ideal classical correlation when the observer world is macroscopic for $N\rightarrow\infty$.

abstract: We define a family of binary outcome $n$-party $m\leq n$ settings per party Bell inequalities whose members require the least detection efficiency for their violation among all known inequalities of the same type. This gives upper bounds for the minimum value of the critical efficiency --- below which no violation is possible --- achievable for such inequalities. For $m=2$, our family reduces to the one given by Larsson and Semitecolos in 2001. For $m>2$, a gap remains between these bounds and the best lower bounds. The violating state near the threshold efficiency always approaches a product state of $n$ qubits.

abstract: Approximating ground and a fixed number of excited state energies, or equivalently low order Hamiltonian eigenvalues, is an important but computationally hard problem. Typically, the cost of classical deterministic algorithms grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. Under general conditions, and using a perturbation approach, we provide a quantum algorithm that produces estimates of a constant number $j$ of different low order eigenvalues. The algorithm relies on a set of trial eigenvectors, whose construction depends on the particular Hamiltonian properties. We illustrate our results by considering a special case of the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation with $d$ degrees of freedom. Our algorithm computes estimates of a constant number $j$ of different low order eigenvalues with error $O(\epsilon)$ and success probability at least $\frac34$, with cost polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ and $d$. This extends our earlier results on algorithms for estimating the ground state energy. The technique we present is sufficiently general to apply to problems beyond the application studied in this paper.

abstract: The router is a key element for a network. We describe a scheme to realize genuine quantum routing of single-photon pulses based on cascading of conditional quantum gates in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and report a proof-of-principle experiment for its demonstration using linear optics quantum gates. The polarization of the control photon routes in a coherent way the path of the signal photon while preserving the qubit state of the signal photon represented by its polarization. We demonstrate quantum nature of this router by showing entanglement generated between the initially unentangled control and signal photons, and confirm that the qubit state of the signal photon is well preserved by the router through quantum process tomography.

abstract: The so-called quasi-Bell entangled coherent states in a thermal environment are studied. In the analysis, we assume thermal noise affects only one of the two modes of each state. First the matrix representation of the density operators of the quasi-Bell entangled coherent states in a thermal environment is derived. Secondly we investigate the entanglement property of one of the quasi-Bell entangled coherent states with thermal noise. At that time a lower bound of the entanglement of formation for the state is computed. Thirdly the minimax discrimination problem for two cases of the binary set of the quasi-Bell entangled coherent states with thermal noise is considered, and the error probabilities of the minimax discrimination for the two cases are computed with the help of Helstrom's algorithm for finding the Bayes optimal error probability of binary states.

abstract: Nonlocality, one of the most remarkable aspects of quantum mechanics, is closely related to Bayesian game theory. Quantum mechanics can offer advantages to some Bayesian games, if the payoff functions are related to Bell inequalities in some way. Most of these Bayesian games that have been discussed are common interest games. Recently the first conflicting interest Bayesian game is proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401 (2015). In the present paper we present three new conflicting interest Bayesian games where quantum mechanics offers advantages. The first game is linked with Cereceda inequalities, the second game is linked with a generalized Bell inequality with 3 possible measurement outcomes, and the third game is linked with a generalized Bell inequality with 3 possible measurement settings.

abstract: Resonant excitation of atoms and ions in macroscopic cavities has lead to exceptional control over quanta of light. Translating these advantages into the solid state with emitters in microcavities promises revolutionary quantum technologies in information processing and metrology. Key is resonant optical reading and writing from the emitter-cavity system. However, it has been widely expected that the reflection of a resonant laser from a micro-fabricated wavelength-sized cavity would dominate any quantum signal. Here we demonstrate coherent photon scattering from a quantum dot in a micro-pillar. The cavity is shown to enhance the fraction of light which is resonantly scattered towards unity, generating anti-bunched indistinguishable photons a factor of 16 beyond the time-bandwidth limit, even when the transition is near saturation. Finally, deterministic excitation is used to create 2-photon N00N states with which we make super-resolving phase measurements in a photonic circuit.

abstract: We propose a new interferometric setup which displays a completely destructive generalized N-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. The key property of this scheme is that is does not require any optical elements like beam splitters or integrated waveguide structures. The interference is intrinsically produced by the evolution of N photons in free space when emitted by N identical statistically independent single photon sources and measured by N detectors in the far field. In this sense the setup is a most simple and natural implementation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect, i.e., of a completely destructive multi-photon interference produced by statistically independent incoherent sources.

As a by-product we compute the metric tensor and its inverse as well as the Laplace-Beltrami for SU (4).

We also show that the modes associated with the Foucault currents play a crucial role in the limit of vanishing losses, in contrast to expectations.

abstract: Measuring thermodynamic quantities can be easy or not, depending on the system that is being studied. For a macroscopic object, measuring temperatures can be as simple as measuring how much a column of mercury rises when in contact with the object. At the small scale of quantum electromechanical systems, such simple methods are not available and invariably detection processes disturb the system state. Here we propose a method for measuring the temperature on a suspended semiconductor membrane clamped at both ends. In this method, the membrane is mediating a capacitive coupling between two transmission line resonators (TLR). The first TLR has a strong dispersion, that is, its decaying rate is larger than its drive, and its role is to pump in a pulsed way the interaction between the membrane and the second TLR. By averaging the pulsed measurements of the quadrature of the second TLR we show how the temperature of the membrane can be determined. Moreover the statistical description of the state of the membrane, which is directly accessed in this approach is significantly improved by the addition of a Josephson Junction coupled to the second TLR.

abstract: Quantum technology relies on the utilization of resources, like quantum coherence and entanglement, which allow quantum information and computation processing. This achievement is however jeopardized by the detrimental effects of the environment surrounding any quantum system, so that finding strategies to protect quantum resources is essential. Non-Markovian and structured environments are useful tools to this aim. Here we show how a simple environmental architecture made of two coupled lossy cavities enables a switch between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes for the dynamics of a qubit embedded in one of the cavity. Furthermore, qubit coherence can be indefinitely preserved if the cavity without qubit is perfect. We then focus on entanglement control of two independent qubits locally subject to such an engineered environment and discuss its feasibility in the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics. With up-to-date experimental parameters, we show that our architecture allows entanglement lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than the spontaneous lifetime without local cavity couplings. This cavity-based architecture is straightforwardly extendable to many qubits for scalability.

abstract: We present a general strategy to derive entanglement criteria which consists in performing a mapping from qudits to qubits that preserves the separability of the parties and SU(2) rotational invariance. Consequently, it is possible to apply the well known positive partial transpose criterion to reveal the existence of quantum correlations between qudits. We discuss some examples of entangled states that are detected using the proposed strategy. Finally, we demonstrate, using our scheme, how some variance-based entanglement witnesses can be generalized from qubits to higher dimensional spin systems.

abstract: In a scenario where two parties share, act on and exchange some physical resource, the assumption that the parties' actions are ordered according to a definite causal structure yields constraints on the possible correlations that can be established. We show that the set of correlations that are compatible with a definite causal order forms a polytope, whose facets define causal inequalities. We fully characterize this causal polytope in the simplest case of bipartite correlations with binary inputs and outputs. We find two families of nonequivalent causal inequalities; both can be violated in the recently introduced framework of process matrices, which extends the standard quantum formalism by relaxing the implicit assumption of a fixed causal structure. Our work paves the way to a more systematic investigation of causal inequalities in a theory-independent way, and of their violation within the framework of process matrices.

abstract: We propose a procedure for tomographic characterization of continuous variable quantum operations which employs homodyne detection and single-mode squeezed probe states with a fixed degree of squeezing and anti-squeezing and a variable displacement and orientation of squeezing ellipse. Density matrix elements of a quantum process matrix in Fock basis can be estimated by averaging well behaved pattern functions over the homodyne data. We show that this approach can be straightforwardly extended to characterization of quantum measurement devices. The probe states can be mixed, which makes the proposed procedure feasible with current technology.

abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme to generate optically-controlled delays based on off-resonant Raman absorption. Dispersion in a transparency window between two neighboring, optically-activated Raman absorption lines is used to reduce the group velocity of broadband 765 nm pulses. We implement this approach in a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) waveguide at room temperature, and demonstrate Raman-induced delays of up to 140 fs for a 650-fs duration, 1.8-THz bandwidth, signal pulse; the available delay-bandwidth product is $\approx1$. Our approach is applicable to single photon signals, offers wavelength tunability, and is a step toward processing ultrafast photons.

abstract: The ability to perform fast, high-fidelity readout of quantum bits (qubits) is essential for the goal of building a quantum computer. However, the parameters of a superconducting qubit device necessary to achieve this typically enhance qubit relaxation by spontaneous emission through the measurement channel. Here we design a broadband filter using impedance engineering to allow photons to leave the resonator at the cavity frequency but not at the qubit frequency. This broadband filter is implemented both in an on-chip and off-chip configuration.

abstract: It is a fundamental problem to decide how many copies of an unknown mixed quantum state are necessary and sufficient to determine the state. Previously, it was known only that estimating states to error $\epsilon$ in trace distance required $O(dr^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies for a $d$-dimensional density matrix of rank $r$. Here, we give a theoretical measurement scheme (POVM) that requires $O( (dr/ \delta ) \ln (d/\delta) )$ copies of $\rho$ to error $\delta$ in infidelity, and a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. This implies $O( (dr / \epsilon^2) \ln (d/\epsilon) )$ copies suffice to achieve error $\epsilon$ in trace distance. For fixed $d$, our measurement can be implemented on a quantum computer in time polynomial in $n$.

abstract: Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) offers significant advantages for coherent population transfer between un- or weakly-coupled states and has the potential of realizing efficient quantum gate, qubit entanglement, and quantum information transfer. Here we report on the realization of STIRAP in a superconducting phase qutrit - a ladder-type system in which the ground state population is coherently transferred to the second-excited state via the dark state subspace. The result agrees well with the numerical simulation of the master equation, which further demonstrates that with the state-of-the-art superconducting qutrits the transfer efficiency readily exceeds $99\%$ while keeping the population in the first-excited state below $1\%$. We show that population transfer via STIRAP is significantly more robust against variations of the experimental parameters compared to that via the conventional resonant $\pi$ pulse method. Our work opens up a new venue for exploring STIRAP for quantum information processing using the superconducting artificial atoms.

abstract: Inducing topological transitions by a time-periodic perturbation offers a route to controlling the properties of materials. Here we show that the adiabatic preparation of a non-trivial state involves a selective population of edge-states, due to exponentially-small gaps preventing adiabaticity. We illustrate this by studying graphene-like ribbons with hopping's phases of slowly increasing amplitude, as for, e.g., a circularly polarized laser slowly turned-on. The induced currents have large periodic oscillations, but flow solely at the edges upon time-averaging, and can be controlled by focusing the laser on either edge. The bulk undergoes a non-equilibrium topological transition, as signaled by the local Chern marker introduced by Bianco & Resta in equilibrium. The failure of the adiabatic picture in presence of intraband resonances is discussed.

abstract: Signature schemes, proposed in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, have become ubiquitous across modern communications. They allow for the exchange of messages from one sender to multiple recipients, with the guarantees that messages cannot be forged or tampered with and that messages also can be forwarded from one recipient to another without compromising their validity. Signatures are different from, but no less important than encryption, which ensures the privacy of a message. Commonly used signature protocols - signatures based on the Rivest-Adleman-Shamir (RSA) algorithm, the digital signature algorithm (DSA), and the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) - are only computationally secure, similar to public key encryption methods. In fact, since these rely on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms or factoring large primes, it is known that they will become completely insecure with the emergence of quantum computers. We may therefore see a shift towards signature protocols that will remain secure even in a post-quantum world. Ideally, such schemes would provide unconditional or information-theoretic security. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible and comprehensive review of existing unconditionally secure signature schemes for signing classical messages, with a focus on unconditionally secure quantum signature schemes.

abstract: In the quantum state tomography problem, one wishes to estimate an unknown $d$-dimensional mixed quantum state $\rho$, given few copies. We show that $O(d/\epsilon)$ copies suffice to obtain an estimate $\hat{\rho}$ that satisfies $\|\hat{\rho} - \rho\|_F^2 \leq \epsilon$ (with high probability). An immediate consequence is that $O(\mathrm{rank}(\rho) \cdot d/\epsilon^2) \leq O(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate in the standard trace distance. This improves on the best known prior result of $O(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ copies for full tomography, and even on the best known prior result of $O(d^2\log(d/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2)$ copies for spectrum estimation. Our result is the first to show that nontrivial tomography can be obtained using a number of copies that is just linear in the dimension. Next, we generalize these results to show that one can perform efficient principal component analysis on $\rho$. Our main result is that $O(k d/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to output a rank-$k$ approximation $\hat{\rho}$ whose trace distance error is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best rank-$k$ approximator to $\rho$. This subsumes our above trace distance tomography result and generalizes it to the case when $\rho$ is not guaranteed to be of low rank. A key part of the proof is the analogous generalization of our spectrum-learning results: we show that the largest $k$ eigenvalues of $\rho$ can be estimated to trace-distance error $\epsilon$ using $O(k^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In turn, this result relies on a new coupling theorem concerning the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm that should be of independent combinatorial interest.

abstract: We establish an operational connection between coherence and quantum correlation by showing that, Alice can create quantum coherence on Bob's side using local selective measurement as long as the previously shared bipartite state has non-vanishing quantum correlation on $B$, and the maximum average coherence she can extract can not surpass the $B$-side quantum correlation in the initial bipartite state. Steering-induced coherence is introduced to characterize Alice's ability to extract quantum coherence on Bob's side. For pure states and the maximally correlated states, the steering-induced relative entropy of coherence is proved to reach the initially shared quantum correlation which is measured by the relative entropy of $B$-side measurement-induced disturbance. The condition to reach the upper bound of quantum correlation varies for different measures of coherence. While the steering-induced $l_1$-norm of coherence is shown reach the initially shared quantum correlation (measured by trace-norm of $B$-side measurement-induced disturbance) for any two-qubit states, an example is found whose steering-induced relative entropy of coherence is strictly less than the relative entropy of $B$-side measurement-induced disturbance.

abstract: We demonstrate a quantum walk with time-dependent coin bias. With this technique we realize an experimental single-photon one-dimensional quantum walk with a linearly-ramped time-dependent coin flip operation and thereby demonstrate two periodic revivals of the walker distribution. In our beam-displacer interferometer, the walk corresponds to movement between discretely separated transverse modes of the field serving as lattice sites, and the time-dependent coin flip is effected by implementing a different angle between the optical axis of half-wave plate and the light propagation at each step. Each of the quantum-walk steps required to realize a revival comprises two sequential orthogonal coin-flip operators, with one coin having constant bias and the other coin having a time-dependent ramped coin bias, followed by a conditional translation of the walker.

abstract: In metrological tasks, employing entangled probes can quantitatively improve the precision of parameter estimation. However, susceptibility of the entanglement to decoherence fades this capability in the realistic metrology and limits precision of estimation. Motivated by this fact, the present paper is going to provide a metrological strategy which is able to beat this limitation by maintaining or reviving the entanglement in the presence of pure decoherence. In this strategy one benefits from the nonlocal memory effects generated by initial correlations in multimode bosonic environments to revive the initial entanglement of probes and shows that, by choosing a judicious measurement duration, the uncertainty of the estimation decreases as $N^{-7/8}$ with the number of the probes.

abstract: A small quantum absorption refrigerator, consisting of three qubits, is discussed in the transient regime. We discuss time scales for coherent dynamics, damping, and approach to the steady state, and we study cooling and entanglement. We observe that cooling can be enhanced in the transient regime, in the sense that lower temperatures can be achieved compared to the steady-state regime. This is a consequence of coherent dynamics, but can occur even when this dynamics is strongly damped by the dissipative thermal environment, and we note that precise control over couplings or timing is not needed to achieve enhanced cooling. We also show that the amount of entanglement present in the refrigerator can be much larger in the transient regime compared to the steady-state. These results are of relevance to future implementations of quantum thermal machines.

Refuting those claims by correcting those misconceptions leads to various simplifications, notably the elimination of everything probabilistic from fundamental physics (stochastic processes) and from the methodology of testing ('Bayesian' credences).

A spin contamination one formally analogous to that found for spin unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave functions. A noncollinearity contribution related to the fact that the wave function is not an eigenfunction of the spin-S\_z operator. A perpendicularity contribution related to the fact that the spin density is not constrained to be zero in the xy-plane. All these contributions are evaluated and compared for the H\_2O^+ system. The optimization of the collinearity axis is also considered.

abstract: An approximate quantum-mechanical two-body equation for spinless particles incorporating relativistic kinematics is derived. The derivation is based on the relativistic energy-momentum relation $mc^{2}+\epsilon = \sqrt{m^{2}c^{4}+p^{2}c^{2}}+V$ for each single particle, where $mc^2$ is the particle rest mass energy, $p$ its linear momentum, $\epsilon$ its dynamical energy, and $V$ being the time-like vector interaction potential. The resulting two-body equation assumes rapid wave oscillations in a single, slowly varying potential well. A Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition is obtained. The approximation is compared to exact results for the harmonic potential.

abstract: In this paper, a quantum filter for estimating the states of a non-Markovian qubit system is presented in an augmented Markovian system framework including both the qubit system of interest and multi-ancillary systems for representing the internal modes of the non-Markovian environment. The colored noise generated by the multi-ancillary systems disturbs the qubit system via a direct interaction. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit is determined by a memory kernel function arising from the dynamics of the ancillary system. In principle, colored noise with arbitrary power spectrum can be generated by a combination of Lorentzian noises. Hence, the quantum filter can be constructed for the qubit disturbed by arbitrary colored noise and the conditional state of the qubit system can be obtained by tracing out the multi-ancillary systems. An illustrative example is given to show the non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit system with Lorentzian noise.

abstract: Quantum repeater networks have attracted attention for the implementation of long-distance and large-scale sharing of quantum states. Recently, researchers extended classical network coding, which is a technique for throughput enhancement, into quantum information. The utility of quantum network coding (QNC) has been shown under ideal conditions, but it has not been studied previously under conditions of noise and shortage of quantum resources. In this paper, we analyzed QNC on a butterfly network, which can create end-to-end Bell pairs at twice the rate of the standard quantum network repeater approach. The joint fidelity of creating two Bell pairs has a small penalty for QNC relative to entanglement swapping. It will thus be useful when we care more about throughput than fidelity. We found that the output fidelity drops below 0.5 when the initial Bell pairs have fidelity F < 0.90.

abstract: Losses of optical signals scale exponentially with the distance. Quantum repeaters are devices that tackle these losses in quantum communication by splitting the total distance into shorter parts. Today two types of quantum repeaters are subject of research in the field of quantum information: Those that use two-way communication and those that only use one-way communication. Here we explain the details of the performance analysis for repeaters of the second type. Furthermore we compare the two different schemes. Finally we show how the performance analysis generalizes to large-scale quantum networks.

abstract: In recent reports, suggestions have been put forward to the effect that parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry in quantum mechanics is incompatible with causality. It is shown here, in contrast, that PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is fully consistent with standard quantum mechanics. This follows from the surprising fact that the much-discussed metric operator on Hilbert space is not physically observable. In particular, for closed quantum systems in finite dimensions there is no statistical test that one can perform on the outcomes of measurements to determine whether the Hamiltonian is Hermitian in the conventional sense, or PT-symmetric---the two theories are indistinguishable. Nontrivial physical effects arising as a consequence of PT symmetry are expected to be observed, nevertheless, for open quantum systems with balanced gain and loss.

We show that within the class of ontological models due to Harrigan and Spekkens, those satisfying preparation-measurement reciprocity must allow indeterminism of the order of quantum theory. Our result implies that one can design quantum random number generator, for which it is impossible, even in principle, to construct a reciprocal deterministic model.

We have shown that the hybrid qubit using vacuum and single-photon states is generally more robust to photon loss effects compared to the one using the photon polarization with respect to fidelities and success probabilities of quantum teleportation.

By adopting the noninteracting blip approximation, which is applicable in the strong photon-qubit coupling regime, we describe the essential contribution of indirect qubit-qubit interaction to the population distribution, mediated by the photonic baths. The linear relations of both the optimal flux and noise power with the qubits system size are obtained. Moreover, the inversed power-law style for the finite-size scaling of the optimal photon-qubit coupling strength is exhibited, which is proposed to be universal.

abstract: We consider an optomechanical quantum system composed of a single cavity mode interacting with N mechanical resonators. We propose a scheme for generating continuous-variable graph states of arbitrary size and shape, including the so-called cluster states for universal quantum computation. The main feature of this scheme is that, differently from previous approaches, the graph states are hosted in the mechanical degrees of freedom rather than in the radiative ones. Specifically, via a 2N-tone laser drive, we engineer a linear Hamiltonian which is instrumental to dissipatively drive the system to the desired target state. The robustness of this scheme is assessed against finite interaction times and mechanical noise, confirming it as a valuable approach towards quantum state engineering for continuous-variable computation in a solid-state platform.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequalities were proposed in order to assess whether sets of pairs of measurements on a quantum system at different times can be consistent with a notion of realism for the set of all variables measured. However, their interpretation is severely complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing violations of realism from the invasive effects of sequential measurements. The typically imposed requirement, of non-invasive measurability (NIM), is often too stringent to be implemented experimentally. Here, we propose a weaker alternative which is to replace the standard quantum-mechanical formula for two-time sequential measurements with a closely related quasi-probability which is linear in the projection operators. This quasi-probability is indirectly measurable (for two times), has the same correlation function as the usual two-time measurement probability (for the bivalent variables considered here) and has the key property that the probabilities for the later time are independent of whether an earlier measurement was made, i.e. satisfies the analogue of NIM for quasi-probabilities. Attention is restricted only to those parameter ranges for which the quasi-probability is non-negative, a condition named linear positivity by Goldstein and Page, and the quasi-probability may then be regarded as a probability for the alternatives at two times. Violations of the Leggett-Garg inequalities within this restricted parameter range are then clear refutations of realism and not consequences of the invasiveness of measurement. We exhibit a simple spin model in which linear positivity holds for the two-time quasi-probabilities but the Leggett-Garg inequalities are violated.

abstract: The (1,0)+(0,1) spinor description of the photon field is developed rigorously and systematically, which will be of great advantage to study some issues involving with single-photon states and the angular momentum of light, etc. Based on the (1,0)+(0,1) spinor description, the quantum theory and some symmetries of the photon field are discussed from a new perspective, where some new contents are shown, with some results being useful for our next work. Starting from the Dirac-like equation in an inhomogeneous medium, we present a preliminary investigation on the spin-orbit interaction of photons. By means of the (1,0)+(0,1) spinor description, we for the first time treat the photon field in curved spacetime via spin connection and the tetrad formalism, which is of great advantage to study the gravitational spin-orbit coupling of photons. As an example, the effect of gravitational spin-orbit coupling on the circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry is studied.

abstract: We analyze a quantum force sensor that uses coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) to beat the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). This sensor, which allows for the continuous, broad-band detection of feeble forces, is a hybrid dual-cavity system comprised of a mesoscopic mechanical resonator optically coupled to an ensemble of ultracold atoms. In contrast to the stringent constraints on dissipation typically associated with purely optical schemes of CQNC, the dissipation rate of the mechanical resonator only needs to be matched to the decoherence rate of the atomic ensemble -- a condition that is experimentally achievable even for the technologically relevant regime of low frequency mechanical resonators with large quality factors. The modular nature of the system further allows the atomic ensemble to aid in the cooling of the mechanical resonator, thereby combining atom-mediated state preparation with sensing deep in the quantum regime.

abstract: We review the demonstration of a closed formula between Bell function, identifying nonlocality, and concurrence, quantifying entanglement, valid for a system of two noninteracting qubits initially prepared in extended Werner-like states undergoing any local pure-dephasing evolution. This formula allows for finding nonlocality thresholds for the concurrence depending only on the purity of the initial state. We then utilize these thresholds in a paradigmatic system where the two qubits are locally affected by a quantum environment with an Ohmic class spectrum. We show that steady entanglement can be achieved and provide the lower bound of initial state purity such that this stationary entanglement is above the nonlocality threshold thus guaranteeing the maintenance of nonlocal correlations.

The redefined Stokes parameters characterize average measured polarization, and the effects of intensity fluctuations of the fields are removed. Thus their average values are a statistical ensemble averages of polarization, and not averages of intensity at the exits of polarization analyzers (divided by the total average intensity), as it is in the standard case. We show examples of entanglement conditions, which upon change from old to new Stokes parameters detect entanglement for a significantly broader range of states. Our working example is the (bright) squeezed vacuum.

abstract: Using the Wigner-Weyl mapping of quantum mechanics to phase space we consider exactly the quantum mechanics of an harmonic oscillator driven by an external white noise force or whose frequency is time dependent, either adiabatically or parametrically. We find several transition probabilities exactly. We also consider the (quantum mechanical) randomizing effects of the external white noise force on the Weyl quantized phase angle and upon other Weyl quantized quantities.

Many of the properties of the oscillator, including its steady-state properties and entanglement with the reservoir can be understood and quantified in terms of a simple probability density, which we may associate with the ground-state frequency spectrum of the oscillator.

abstract: One of the challenges with quantum simulation in ion traps is that the effective spin-spin exchange couplings are not uniform across the lattice. This can be particularly important in Penning trap realizations where the presence of an ellipsoidal boundary at the edge of the trap leads to dislocations in the crystal. By adding an additional anharmonic potential to better control interion spacing, and a triangular shaped rotating wall potential to reduce the appearance of dislocations, one can achieve better uniformity of the ionic positions. In this work, we calculate the axial phonon frequencies and the spin-spin interactions driven by a spin-dependent optical dipole force, and discuss what effects the more uniform ion spacing has on the spin simulation properties of Penning trap quantum simulators. Indeed, we find the spin-spin interactions behave more like a power law for a wide range of parameters.

abstract: Entanglement is the resource to overcome the natural limitations of spatially separated parties restricted to Local Operations assisted by Classical Communications (LOCC). Recently two new classes of operational entanglement measures, the source and the accessible entanglement, for arbitrary multipartite states have been introduced. Whereas the source entanglement measures from how many states the state of interest can be obtained via LOCC, the accessible entanglement measures how many states can be reached via LOCC from the state at hand. We consider here pure bipartite as well as multipartite states and derive explicit formulae for the source entanglement. Moreover, we obtain explicit formulae for a whole class of source entanglement measures that characterize the simplicity of generating a given bipartite pure state via LOCC. Furthermore, we show how the accessible entanglement can be computed numerically. For generic four-qubit states we first derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of LOCC transformations among these states and then derive explicit formulae for their accessible and source entanglement.

abstract: We propose an approach for collective enhancement of precision for remotely located optical lattice clocks and a way of generation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state of remote clocks. Close to Heisenberg scaling of the clock precision with the number of clocks M can be achieved even for an optical channel connecting clocks with substantial losses. This scenario utilizes a collective quantum nondemolition measurement on clocks with parallel Bloch vectors for enhanced measurement precision. We provide an optimal network solution for distant clocks as well as for clocks positioned in close proximity of each other. In the second scenario, we employ collective dissipation to drive two clocks with oppositely oriented Bloch vectors into a steady state entanglement. The corresponding EPR entanglement provides enhanced time sharing beyond the projection noise limit between the two quantum synchronized clocks protected from eavesdropping, as well as allows better characterization of systematic effects.

abstract: The quantum correlation of light and atomic collective excitation can be used to compose an SU(1,1)-type hybrid light-atom interferometer, where one arm in optical SU(1,1) interferometer is replaced by the atomic collective excitation. The phase-sensing probes include not only the photon field but also the atomic collective excitation inside the interferometer. For a coherent squeezed state as the phase-sensing field, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit under the optimal conditions. We also study the effects of the loss of light field and the dephasing of atomic excitation on the phase sensitivity. Since nonlinear processes are involved in this interferometer, they can couple a variety of different waves and form new types of hybrid interferometers, which provides a new method for basic measurement using the hybrid interferometers.

abstract: Recently S. Colin and A.Valentini show that the Bohm's second-order dynamics is unstable and in this formulation of bohemian mechnics, unlike the de Broglie's first-order dynamics ,the non-equilibrium state does not relax to Quantum equilibrium [19]. On this basis they argue that, while de Broglie's dynamics is a tenable physical theory, Bohm's dynamics is not. In this paper we show that a simple natural modification of the Bohm's dynamics Leads to a stable second-order dynamics. In fact we show, on the basis of a sub quantum H-theorem, the non-equilibrium phase space distribution, relax to equilibrium distribution (in cores-grain level). However, in our model the particle trajectories and quantum force are different from Standard Bohmian counterparts, but the statistical result of this model is same as standard Bohmian mechanics and also standard quantum mechanics (Of course in the equilibrium state).

abstract: We extend the connection between degenerate entanglement spectra present in symmetry-protected topological orders (SPTO's) of 1D spin chains and their use in measurement-based quantum computation (MQC) to the setting of 2D systems. We find surprisingly that the 2D cluster state, an archetypal resource state for MQC, is in a trivial 2D SPTO phase, and show, by a more fine-grained classification, that it does have non-trivial SPTO, but of the same nature as 1D spin chains. In contrast, we introduce a new ground state which possesses non-trivial SPTO entirely of a 2D nature, and show that it is universal for MQC. By utilizing genuine 2D SPTO for the first time in MQC, our results open up a renewed equivalence of fluctuating domain walls of SPTO with computationally useful quantum networks, in relation to the Clifford hierarchy of the latter.

As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to a one-dimensional system of two bosons with a contact interaction subjected to an open potential well. The correlation properties of the lowest-energy resonance state of the system are explored over a wide range of the inter-boson interaction strength, including the Tonks-Girardeau regime.

abstract: There are both practical and foundational motivations to consider the thermodynamics of quantum systems at small scales. Here we address the issue of autonomous quantum thermal machines that are tailored to achieve some specific thermodynamic primitive, such as work extraction in the presence of a thermal environment, while having minimal or no control from the macroscopic regime. Beyond experimental implementations, this provides an arena in which to address certain foundational aspects such as the role of coherence in thermodynamics, the use of clock degrees of freedom and the simulation of local time-dependent Hamiltonians in a particular quantum subsystem. For small-scale systems additional issues arise. Firstly, it is not clear to what degree genuine ordered thermodynamic work has been extracted, and secondly non-trivial back-actions on the thermal machine must be accounted for. We find that both these aspects can be resolved through a judicious choice of quantum measurements that magnify thermodynamic properties up the ladder of length-scales, while simultaneously stabilizing the quantum thermal machine. Within this framework we show that thermodynamic reversibility is obtained in a particular Zeno limit, and finally illustrate these concepts with a concrete example involving spin-systems.

abstract: A stochastic process's statistical complexity stands out as a fundamental property: the minimum information required to synchronize one process generator to another. How much information is required, though, when synchronizing over a quantum channel? Recent work demonstrated that representing causal similarity as quantum state-indistinguishability provides a quantum advantage. We generalize this to synchronization and offer a sequence of constructions that exploit extended causal structures, finding substantial increase of the quantum advantage. We demonstrate that maximum compression is determined by the process's cryptic order---a classical, topological property closely allied to Markov order, itself a measure of historical dependence. We introduce an efficient algorithm that computes the quantum advantage and close noting that the advantage comes at a cost---one trades off prediction for generation complexity.

Process. 14 373) that had a success probability of 25%, which increased to 50% when extra classical information is sent to the receiver. We show that using our modified scheme, the desired state can be prepared deterministically with the same quantum channel. Moreover, we generalize the scheme to prepare N-qubit equatorial states in which the receiver can reconstruct the original state with 100% success probability.

abstract: Quantum theory expresses the observable relations between physical properties in terms of probabilities that depend on the specific context described by the "state" of a system. However, the laws of physics that emerge at the macroscopic level are fully deterministic. Here, it is shown that the relation between quantum statistics and deterministic dynamics can be explained in terms of ergodic averages over complex valued probabilities, where the fundamental causality of motion is expressed in terms of an action given by the phase of the probability multiplied with the fundamental constant hbar. Importantly, classical physics emerges as an approximation of this more fundamental theory of motion, indicating that the assumption of a classical reality described by differential geometry is merely an artifact of an extrapolation from the observation of macroscopic dynamics to a fictitious level of precision that does not exist within our actual experience of the world around us. It is therefore possible to completely replace the classical concepts of trajectories with the more fundamental concept of action phase probabilities as a universally valid description of causality in the physical world.

abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving optimization problems, but like all other quantum information processing methods, it requires error correction to ensure scalability. In this work we experimentally compare two quantum annealing correction codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains, using two different quantum annealing processors. The lower temperature processor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in a number of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubits per encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which we explain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respective redundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with the higher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lower degree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an important tradeoff between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealing correction codes.

abstract: We propose a scheme for performing quantum key distribution (QKD) which has the potential to beat schemes based on the direct transmission of photons between the communicating parties. In our proposal, the communicating parties exchange photons with two quantum memories placed between them. This is a very simple quantum repeater scheme and can be implemented with currently available technology. Ideally, its secret key rate scales as the square root of the transmittivity of the optical channel, which is superior to QKD schemes based on direct transmission because key rates for the latter scale at best linearly with transmittivity. Taking into account various imperfections in each component of our setup, we present parameter regimes in which our protocol outperforms protocols based on direct transmission.

abstract: We re-examine the well-studied one dimensional spin-1/2 $XY$ model to reveal its nontrivial energy spectrum, in particular the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. In the case of the isotropic $XY$ model -- the $XX$ model -- the gap behaves very irregularly as a function of the system size at a second order transition point. This is in stark contrast to the usual power-law decay of the gap and is reminiscent of the similar behavior at the first order phase transition in the infinite-range quantum $XY$ model. The gap also shows nontrivial oscillatory behavior for the phase transitions in the anisotropic model in the incommensurate phase. We observe a close relation between this anomalous behavior of the gap and the correlation functions. These results, those for the isotropic case in particular, are important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing where the efficiency of computation is strongly affected by the size dependence of the energy gap.

Quantum annealing gives a way to find a ground state of a system, while the singular value decomposition requires the maximum eigenstate. The key idea is to transform the sign of the final Hamiltonian, and the maximum eigenstate is obtained by quantum annealing. Furthermore, the adiabatic time scale is obtained by the approximation focusing on the maximum eigenvalue.

abstract: Superradiance typically requires preparation of atoms in highly entangled multi-particle states, the so-called Dicke states. In this paper we discuss an alternative route where we prepare such states from initially uncorrelated atoms by a measurement process. By measuring higher order intensity intensity correlations we demonstrate that we can simulate the emission characteristics of Dicke superradiance by starting with atoms in the fully excited state. We describe the essence of the scheme by first investigating two excited atoms. Here we demonstrate how via Hanbury Brown and Twiss type of measurements we can produce Dicke superradiance and subradiance displayed commonly with two atoms in the single excited symmetric and antisymmetric Dicke states, respectively. We thereafter generalize the scheme to arbitrary numbers of atoms and detectors, and explain in detail the mechanism which leads to this result. The approach shows that Hanbury Brown and Twiss type intensity interference and the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance can be regarded as two sides of the same coin. We also present a compact result for the characteristic functional which generates all order intensity intensity correlations.

abstract: We present a new read-out technique for a superconducting qubit dispersively coupled to a Josephson parametric oscillator. We perform degenerate parametric flux pumping of the Josephson inductance with a pump amplitude surpassing the threshold for parametric instability. We map the qubit states onto two distinct states of classical parametric oscillations: one oscillating state, with on average 180 photons in the resonator, and one with zero oscillation amplitude. We demonstrate single-shot readout performance, with a total state discrimination of 81.5%. When accounting for qubit errors, this gives a corrected fidelity of 98.7%, obviating the need for a following quantum-limited amplifier. An error budget indicates that the readout fidelity is currently limited by spurious switching events between two bistable states of the resonator.

abstract: We present the general theory of a quantum heat machine based on an $N$-level system (working medium) whose $N-1$ excited levels are degenerate, a prerequisite for steady-state interlevel coherence. Our goal is to find out: To what extent is coherence in the working medium an asset for heat machines? The performance bounds of such a machine are common to (reciprocating) cycles that consist of consecutive strokes and continuous cycles wherein the periodically driven system is constantly coupled to cold and hot heat baths. Intriguingly, we find that the machine's performance strongly depends on the relative orientations of the transition-dipole vectors in the system. Perfectly aligned (parallel) transition dipoles allow for steady-state coherence effects, but also give rise to dark states, which hinder steady-state thermalization and thus reduce the machine's performance. Similar thermodynamic properties hold for $N$ two-level atoms conforming to the Dicke model. We conclude that level degeneracy, but not necessarily coherence, is a thermodynamic resource, equally enhancing the heat currents and the power output of the heat machine. By contrast, the efficiency remains unaltered by this degeneracy and adheres to the Carnot bound.

abstract: The adiabatic manipulation of quantum states is a powerful technique that has opened up new directions in quantum engineering, enabling tests of fundamental concepts such as the Berry phase and its nonabelian generalization, the observation of topological transitions, and holds the promise of alternative models of quantum computation. Here we benchmark the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process for circuit quantum electrodynamics, by using the first three levels of a transmon qubit. We demonstrate a population transfer efficiency above 80% between the ground state and the second excited state using two adiabatic Gaussian-shaped control microwave pulses coupled to the first and second transition. The advantage of this techniques is robustness against errors in the timing of the control pulses. By doing quantum tomography at successive moments during the Raman pulses, we investigate the transfer of the population in time-domain. We also show that this protocol can be reversed by applying a third adiabatic pulse on the first transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a hybrid adiabatic-nonadiabatic gate using a fast pulse followed by the adiabatic Raman sequence, and we study experimentally the case of a quasi-degenerate intermediate level.

abstract: Estimating the temperature of a cold quantum system is difficult. Usually, one measures a well-understood thermal state and uses that prior knowledge to infer its temperature. In contrast, we introduce a method of thermometry that assumes no knowledge of the state of a system and is potentially non-destructive. Our method uses a universal temperature-dependence of the non-equilibrium dynamics of an initially thermal system coupled to a qubit probe that follows from the Tasaki-Crooks theorem for non-equilibrium work distributions. We provide examples, for a cold atom system, for which our thermometry protocol may retain accuracy and precision at subnanokelvin temperatures.

abstract: We consider macroscopic correlations in a bipartite system consisting of 2N particles described by a generalised probabilistic theory. In particular, we discuss a case of N PR-boxes shared between two parties. We characterise macroscopic measurements as collective measurements of the same property on all the boxes in the same region. Such measurements are assumed to reveal only the average value of the measured collective property. We show that for two measurements per observer and N greater or equal 2 there always exist a joint probability distribution explaining all observable data and therefore the system admits local hidden variables. Next, we generalise this result to include measurement of fluctuations and additional measurement settings. Finally, we discuss our result in the context of previous works in which contradictory results were presented.

abstract: We present methods for the direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD) in which both the principal and ancilla systems undergo noisy processes. Using a concatenated error detection code, we discriminate between located and unlocated errors on the principal system in what amounts to filtering of ancilla noise. The example of composite noise involving amplitude damping and depolarizing channels is used to demonstrate the method, while we find the rate of noise filtering is more generally dependent on code distance. Our results indicate the accuracy of quantum process characterization can be greatly improved while remaining within reach of current experimental capabilities.

abstract: We study time-optimal protocols for controlling quantum systems which show several avoided level crossings in their energy spectrum. The structure of the spectrum allows us to generate a robust guess which is time-optimal at each crossing. We correct the field applying optimal control techniques in order to find the minimal evolution or quantum speed limit (QSL) time. We investigate its dependence as a function of the system parameters and show that it gets proportionally smaller to the well-known two-level case as the dimension of the system increases. Working at the QSL, we study the control fields derived from the optimization procedure, and show that they present a very simple shape, which can be described by a few parameters. Based on this result, we propose a simple expression for the control field, and show that the full time-evolution of the control problem can be analytically solved.

abstract: We introduce the Peierls substitution to two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk on a square lattice to examine the spreading dynamics and the coin-position entanglement in the presence of an artificial gauge field. We use the ratio of magnetic flux through unit cell to the flux quantum as a control parameter. For a given flux ratio, we obtain faster spreading for small number of steps and the walker tends to be highly localized around the origin. Moreover, the spreading of the walk can be suppressed and decreased within a limited time interval for specific rational values of flux ratio. When the flux ratio is an irrational number, even for large number of steps, the spreading exhibit diffusive behavior rather than the well-known ballistic one as in the classical random walk and there is a significant probability to find the walker at the origin. We also analyse the coin-position entanglement and show that asymptotic behavior vanishes when the flux ratio is different from zero and the coin-position entanglement become maximal in a periodic manner at long-time range.

abstract: In this note we lay some groundwork for the resource theory of thermodynamics in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). We consider theories satisfying a purely convex abstraction of the spectral decomposition of density matrices: that every state has a decomposition, with unique probabilities, into perfectly distinguishable pure states. The spectral entropy, and analogues using other Schur-concave functions, can be defined as the entropy of these probabilities. We describe additional conditions under which the outcome probabilities of a fine-grained measurement are majorized by those for a spectral measurement, and therefore the "spectral entropy" is the measurement entropy (and therefore concave). These conditions are (1) projectivity, which abstracts aspects of the Lueders-von Neumann projection postulate in quantum theory, in particular that every face of the state space is the positive part of the image of a certain kind of projection operator called a filter; and (2) symmetry of transition probabilities. The conjunction of these, as shown earlier by Araki, is equivalent to a strong geometric property of the unnormalized state cone known as perfection: that there is an inner product according to which every face of the cone, including the cone itself, is self-dual. Using some assumptions about the thermodynamic cost of certain processes that are partially motivated by our postulates, especially projectivity, we extend von Neumann's argument that the thermodynamic entropy of a quantum system is its spectral entropy to generalized probabilistic systems satisfying spectrality.

abstract: Phase-sensitive properties of light play a crucial role in a variety of quantum optical phenomena, which have been mostly discussed in the framework of photoelectric detection theory. However, modern detection schemes, such as arrays of on-off detectors, are not based on photoelectric counting. We demonstrate that the theory of homodyning with such click counting detectors can be established by using a proper detection model. For practical applications, a variety of typically occurring imperfections are rigorously analyzed and directly observable nonclassicality criteria are studied. Fundamental examples demonstrate the general functionality of our technique. Thus, our approach of homodyne detection with on-off detector systems is able to bridge the gap between imperfect detection and the phase resolution demands for modern applications of quantum light.

abstract: State selective protocols, like entanglement purification, lead to an essentially non-linear quantum evolution, unusual in naturally occurring quantum processes. Sensitivity to initial states in quantum systems, stemming from such non-linear dynamics, is a promising perspective for applications. Here we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state selective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all initial states in an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational polynomial map, including the example of the Mandelbrot set, can be directly realised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of initial states, the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that exponential sensitivity to initial states in any quantum system have to be related to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially. Our results show that magnifying initial differences of quantum states (a Schr\"odinger microscope) is possible, however, there is a strict bound on the number of copies needed.

abstract: Integrated photonics has enabled much progress towards quantum technologies. Many applications, including quantum communication, sensing, and distributed and cloud quantum computing, will require coherent photonic interconnection between separate chip-based sub-systems. Large-scale quantum computing systems and architectures may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable scaling beyond the limits of a single wafer and towards "multi-chip" systems. However, coherently interconnecting separate chips is challenging due to the fragility of these quantum states and the demanding challenges of transmitting photons in at least two media within a single coherent system. Distribution and manipulation of qubit entanglement between multiple devices is one of the most stringent requirements of the interconnected system. Here, we report a quantum photonic interconnect demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and manipulation between two separate chips, implemented using state-of-the-art silicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated and manipulated on-chip, and distributed between the chips by interconverting between path-encoding and polarisation-encoding. We use integrated state analysers to confirm a Bell-type violation of $S$=2.638+-0.039 between two chips. With improvements in loss, this quantum interconnect will provide new levels of flexible systems and architectures for quantum technologies.

abstract: One of the most intriguing aspects of Quantum Mechanics is the impossibility of measuring at the same time observables corresponding to non-commuting operators. This impossibility can be partially relaxed when considering joint or sequential weak values evaluation. Indeed, weak measurements have been a real breakthrough in the quantum measurement framework that is of the utmost interest from both a fundamental and an applicative point of view. Here we show how we realized, for the first time, a sequential weak value evaluation of two incompatible observables on a single photon.

abstract: Various measures have been suggested recently for quantifying the coherence of a quantum state with respect to a given basis. We first use two of these, the l_1-norm and relative entropy measures, to investigate tradeoffs between the coherences of mutually unbiased bases. Results include relations between coherence, uncertainty and purity; tight general bounds restricting the coherences of mutually unbiased bases; and an exact complementarity relation for qubit coherences. We further define the average coherence of a quantum state. For the l_1-norm measure this is related to a natural 'coherence radius' for the state, and leads to a conjecture for an l_2-norm measure of coherence. For relative entropy the average coherence is determined by the difference between the von Neumann entropy and the quantum subentropy of the state, and leads to upper bounds for the latter quantity. Finally, we point out that the relative entropy of coherence is a special case of G-asymmetry, which immediately yields several operational interpretations in contexts as diverse as frame-alignment, quantum communication and metrology, and suggests generalising the property of quantum coherence to arbitrary groups of physical transformations.

abstract: Within the established theoretical framework of quantum mechanics, interference always occurs between pairs of trajectories. Higher order interferences with multiple constituents are, however, excluded by Born's rule and can only exist in generalized probabilistic theories. Thus, high-precision experiments searching for such higher order interferences are a powerful method to test the validity of the Born rule and distinguish between quantum mechanics and more general theories. Here, we perform such a test in optical multi-path interferometers. Our results permit to rule out the existence of higher order interference terms to an extent which is more than four orders of magnitude smaller than the expected pairwise interference, refining previous bounds by two orders of magnitudes. This establishes the hitherto tightest constraints on generalized interference theories.

abstract: Increasing control of single photons enables new applications of photonic quantum-enhanced technology and further experimental exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena. Here, we demonstrate quantum logic using narrow linewidth photons that are produced under nearly perfect quantum control from a single ^87Rb atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity. We use a controlled- NOT gate integrated into a photonic chip to entangle these photons, and we observe non-classical correlations between events separated by periods exceeding the travel time across the chip by three orders of magnitude. This enables quantum technology that will use the properties of both narrowband single photon sources and integrated quantum photonics, such as networked quantum computing, narrow linewidth quantum enhanced sensing and atomic memories.

abstract: Various implementations of the Toffoli gate up to a relative phase have been known for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller circuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of quantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being applied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not matter. It has been furthermore believed by many that the relative phase deviations would prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical large-scale designs. In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for replacing multiple control Toffoli gates with their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions in the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest that a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their use may yield other optimizations.

In addition to brief replies to the comments, we provide a pedagogical discussion of some of the underlying principles of the work. This note serves to clarify some of the counterintuitive aspects arising when the two theories are jointly considered.

abstract: This thesis investigates the connection between quantum theory, thermodynamics and information theory. Theories with structure similar to that of quantum theory are considered, mathematically described by the framework of "Generalized Probabilistic Theories". For these theories, a thought experiment by von Neumann is adapted to obtain a natural thermodynamic entropy definition, following a proposal by J. Barrett. Mathematical properties of this entropy are compared to physical consequences of the thought experiment. The validity of the second law of thermodynamics is investigated. In that context, observables and projective measurements are generalized to prove an entropy increase for projective measurements of ensembles. Information-theoretically motivated definitions of the entropy are compared to the entropy from the thermodynamic thought experiment. The conditions for the thermodynamic entropy to be well-defined are considered in greater detail. Several further properties of the theories under consideration (e.g. whether there is higher order interference, Pfister's state discrimination principle) and their relation to entropy are investigated.

abstract: In this article the effect of noise on Grover's algorithm is analyzed, modeled as a total depolarizing channel (TDCh) and a local depolarizing channel in each qubit (LDCh). The focus was not in error correction (e.g. by the fault-tolerant method), but to provide an insight to the kind of error, or degradation, that needs to be corrected. The results extend previous works regarding only the TDCh model, concluding that the degradation of Grover's algorithm with local error (LDCh) is worse than with total error (TDCh). It has been shown that for both cases with an $N$-dependent small enough error-width, smaller than $1/\sqrt{N}$ for total error and $1/(\sqrt{N}\log_2{N})$ for the local case, correction is not needed.

abstract: In quantum communication protocols the existence of a shared reference frame between two spatially separated parties is normally presumed. However, in many practical situations we are faced with the problem of misaligned reference frames. In this paper, we study communication between two inertial observers who have partial knowledge about the Lorentz transformation that relates their frames of reference. Since every Lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analysing the effects on communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation relating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or pure boost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an arbitrary Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, we show how the results of previous studies where reference frames are completely uncorrelated are recovered from our results in appropriate limits.

abstract: Frequency conversion is an enabling process in many quantum information protocols. In this letter we study fundamental limits to high efficiency frequency conversion imposed by time ordering corrections. Using the Magnus expansion, we argue that these corrections, which are usually considered detrimental, can be used to increase the efficiency of conversion under certain circumstances. The corrections induce a nonlinear behaviour in the probability of upconversion as a function of the pump intensity, significantly modifying the sinusoidal Rabi oscillations that are otherwise expected. Finally, by using a simple scaling argument, we explain why cascaded frequency conversion devices attenuate time ordering corrections, allowing the construction of near ideal quantum pulse gates.

abstract: Precision control over hybrid physical systems at the quantum level is important for the realization of many quantum-based technologies. In the field of quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various proposals discuss the possibility of hybrid architectures where specific tasks are delegated to the most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks, it may be advantageous to transfer information from a subsystem that has good memory properties to another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting information between nodes in the network. For trapped-ions, a hybrid system formed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be exploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different elements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling, creation of entanglement through dissipation, and quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of one species with another. Here, we demonstrate an entangling quantum gate between ions of different elements which can serve as an important building block of QIP, quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate between a $^9$Be$^+$ ion and a $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction generated by state-dependent forces induced with laser beams. Combined with single-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element entangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for universal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and a SWAP gate. We further demonstrate the robustness of these gates against thermal excitation and show improved detection in quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS). We also observe a strong violation of a CHSH-type Bell inequality on entangled states composed of different ion species.

abstract: It is a fundamental challenge in quantum optics to deterministically generate indistinguishable single photons through non-deterministic nonlinear optical processes, due to the intrinsic coupling of single- and multi-photon generation probabilities in these processes. Actively multiplexing photons generated in many temporal modes can decouple these probabilities, but key issues are to minimize resource requirements to allow scalability, and to ensure indistinguishability of the generated photons. We demonstrate the multiplexing of photons from four temporal modes solely using fiber-integrated optics and off-the-shelf electronic circuits. We show a 100% enhancement to the single photon output probability without introducing additional multi-photon noise. Photon indistinguishability is confirmed by a four-fold Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference with a 91% visibility. Our demonstration paves the way for scalable multiplexing of many non-deterministic photon sources to a single near-deterministic source, which will be of benefit to future quantum photonic technologies.

abstract: The effects of electric field polarizations on pair production from a vacuum are investigated numerically by employing the real-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. For few-cycle fields, it is found that the interference pattern in momentum spectra is absent and the circular distortion of momentum distribution becomes more apparent with the increase of polarization. For multi-cycle fields, it is found that the interference effects in momentum spectra are obvious. And as the polarization increases, the momentum distribution is split into two parts in the momentum $q_y$ direction first and then two separated parts are connected into a ring. The effects of polarizations on the number density of created particles exhibits two different characteristics. For a small laser frequency, the particle number density deceases with the polarization, while for a large laser frequency, the relation between them is sensitive to the field frequency nonlinearly. Some interpretations for the obtained results in this study, which is expected to be valuable to deepen the understanding of pair production in complex fields and also helpful for the study associated to strong-field ionization.

abstract: We investigate collisions of polar molecules in quasi-2D traps in the presence of an external electric field perpendicular to the collision plane. We use the quantum-defect model characterized by two dimensionless parameters: $y$ and $s$. The first of them is related to the probability of the reaction at short distances, whereas the latter one defines the wave function phase at short distances. For $y$ close to unity we obtain universal collision rates determined by the quantum reflection process from the long-range part of the interaction potential that depends only on the van der Waals coefficient, dipole-dipole interaction and the trap frequency. For small short-range reaction probabilities collision rates are highly nonuniversal and trap induced shape resonances are visible. For high dipole moments we observe the damping of reactive collisions, which can stabilize the ultracold gas of polar molecules. The calculations were performed with help of multichannel wave funcion propagation by imposing short-range boundary condition derived from the quantum-defect model.

abstract: The richness of quantum theory's reversible dynamics is one of its unique operational characteristics, with recent results suggesting deep links between the theory's reversible dynamics, its local state space and the degree of non-locality it permits. We explore the delicate interplay between these features, demonstrating that reversibility places strong constraints on both the local and global state space. Firstly, we show that reversible dynamics are trivial (composed of local transformations and permutations of subsytems) in maximally non-local theories whose local state spaces satisfy a dichotomy criterion; this applies to a range of operational models that have previously been studied, such as d-dimensional "hyperballs" and almost all regular polytope systems. By separately deriving a similar result for odd-sided polygons, we show that classical systems are the only regular polytope state spaces whose maximally non-local composites allow for non-trivial reversible dynamics. Secondly, we show that non-trivial reversible dynamics do exist in maximally non-local theories whose state spaces are reducible into two or more smaller spaces. We conjecture that this is a necessary condition for the existence of such dynamics, but that reversible entanglement generation remains impossible even in this scenario.

abstract: Polarization quasiprobability distribution defined in the Stokes space shares many important properties with the Wigner function for the position and momentum. Most notably, they both give correct one-dimensional marginal probability distributions and therefore represent the natural choice for the probability distributions in classical hidden-variable models. In this context, negativity of the Wigner function is considered as a proof of non-classicality for a quantum state. On the contrary, the polarization quasiprobability distribution demonstrates negativity for all quantum states. This feature comes from the discrete nature of the Stokes variables; however, it was not observed in previous experiments, because they were performed with photon-number averaging detectors. Here we reconstruct the polarization quasiprobability distribution of a coherent state with photon-number resolving detectors, which allows us to directly observe for the first time its negativity.

abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which is immune to all detector side-channel attacks, is the most promising solution to the security issues in practical quantum key distribution systems. Though several experimental demonstrations of MDI QKD have been reported, they all make one crucial but not yet verified assumption, that is there are no flaws in state preparation. Such an assumption is unrealistic and security loopholes remain in the source. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first MDI-QKD experiment with state preparation flaws taken into consideration. By applying a novel security proof by Tamaki \textit{et al} (Phys. Rev. A 90, 052314 (2014)), we distribute secure keys over fiber links up to 40 km with imperfect sources, which would not have been possible under previous security proofs. By closing loopholes in both the sources and the detectors, our work shows the feasibility of secure QKD with practical imperfect devices.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel mean-field model for polariton condensates with velocity dependence of the effective polariton mass due the photon and exciton components. The effective mass depends on the in-plane wave vector k, which at the inflection point of the lower polariton energy branch becomes infinite and above negative. The polariton condensate modes of the new mean-field theory are now sensitive to mass variations and for certain points of the energy dispersion the polariton condensate mode represents fractional quantum mechanics. The impact of the generalized kinetic energy term is elucidated by numerical studies in 1D and 2D showing significant differences for large velocities. Analytical expressions for plane wave solutions as well as a linear waves analysis show the significance of this new model.

abstract: In this paper we provide a basic introduction of the core ideas and theories surrounding fault-tolerant quantum computation. These concepts underly the theoretical framework of large-scale quantum computation and communications and are the driving force for many recent experimental efforts to construct small to medium sized arrays of controllable quantum bits. We examine the basic principals of redundant quantum encoding, required to protect quantum bits from errors generated from both imprecise control and environmental interactions and then examine the principals of fault-tolerance from largely a classical framework. As quantum fault-tolerance essentially is avoiding the uncontrollable cascade of errors caused by the interaction of quantum-bits, these concepts can be directly mapped to quantum information.

abstract: The general feedback control theory for linear phase preserving and conjugating amplification is presented. The key idea is the use of coherent (i.e. measurement free) feedback with a passive (i.e. static) controller; this combination realizes the minimum-noise and robust amplification even under practical imperfections. Moreover, a non-degenerated parametric amplifier subjected to a special detuning is proposed to demonstrate that, additionally, it has a broadband nature.

abstract: In this paper we use the framework of generalized probabilistic theories to present two sets of basic assumptions, called axioms, for which we show that they lead to the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. The key results in this derivation are the co-ordinatization of generalized geometries and a theorem of Sol\'er which characterizes Hilbert spaces among the orthomodular spaces. A generalized Wigner theorem is applied to reduce some of the assumptions of the theorem of Sol\'er to the theory of symmetry in quantum mechanics. Since this reduction is only partial we also point out the remaining open questions.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of strongly driven spontaneous four-wave mixing in a lossy integrated microring resonator side-coupled to a channel waveguide. A nonperturbative, analytic solution within the undepleted pump approximation is developed for a cw pump input of arbitrary intensity. In the strongly driven regime self- and cross-phase modulation, as well as multi-pair generation, lead to a rich variety of power-dependent effects; the results are markedly different than in the low power limit. The photon pair generation rate, single photon spectrum, and joint spectral intensity (JSI) distribution are calculated. Splitting of the generated single photon spectrum into a doublet structure associated with both pump detuning and cross-phase modulation is predicted, as well as substantial narrowing of the generated signal and idler bandwidths associated with the onset of optical parametric oscillation at intermediate powers. Both the correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the JSI are calculated, and for sufficient powers the uncorrelated part of the JSI is found to form a quadruplet structure. The pump detuning is found to play a crucial role in all of these phenomena, and a critical detuning is identified which divides the system behaviour into distinct regimes, as well as an optimal detuning strategy which preserves many of the low-power characteristics of the generated photons for arbitrary input power.

abstract: We propose using nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer (NMZI) to efficiently prepare photonic quantum states from a classical input. We first analytically investigate the simple NMZI that can filtrate single photon state from weak coherent state by preferrentially blocking two-photon component. As a generalization, we show that the cascaded NMZI can deterministically extract arbitrary quantum state from a strong coherent state. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that the cascaded NMZI can be very efficient in both the input power and the level of cascade. The protocol of quantum state preparation with NMZI can be extended to various systems of bosonic modes.

abstract: Quantum state merging is one of the most important protocols in quantum information theory. In this task two parties aim to merge their parts of a pure tripartite state by making use of additional singlets while preserving coherence with a third party. We study a variation of this scenario where the merging parties have free access to PPT entangled states, and the total quantum state shared by all three parties is not necessarily pure. We provide general conditions for a state to admit perfect merging, and present a family of fully separable states which cannot be perfectly merged if the merging parties have no access to additional singlets. We also show that for pure states the conditional entropy plays the same role as in standard quantum state merging, quantifying the amount of quantum communication needed to perfectly merge the state. While the question whether the protocol considered here exhibits the strong converse property is left open, it is shown that for a significant amount of quantum states the merging fidelity vanishes asymptotically.

abstract: A bipartite state is said to be steerable iff it does not have single system description, i.e., the bipartite state cannot be explained by local hidden state model. Several steering inequalities have been derived using different local uncertainty relations to verify the ability to control the state of one subsystem by the other party. Here, we derive complementarity relations between coherences measured on mutually unbiased bases using various coherence measures such as the $l_1$-norm, relative entropy and skew information. Using these relations, we formulate steering inequalities to check whether one subsystem has control over the coherence of the other entangled subsystem. We show that all pure entangled states are maximally steerable but for mixed entangled states, coherence steerability needs stronger non-local correlation than the existing state steering inequalities. We also show that our steering criteria are monogamous.

abstract: According to mathematical constructivism, a mathematical object can exist only if there is a way to compute (or "construct") it; so, what is non-computable is non-constructive. In the example of the quantum model, whose Fock states are associated with Fibonacci numbers, this paper shows that the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is non-constructive since it permits an undecidable (or effectively impossible) subset of Hilbert space. On the other hand, as it is argued in the paper, if one believes that testability of predictions is the most fundamental property of any physical theory, one need to accept that quantum mechanics must be an effectively calculable (and thus mathematically constructive) theory. With that, a way to reformulate quantum mechanics constructively, while keeping its mathematical foundation unchanged, leads to hypercomputation. In contrast, the proposed in the paper superselection rule, which acts by effectively forbidding a coherent superposition of quantum states corresponding to potential and actual infinity, can introduce computable constructivism in a quantum mechanical theory with no need for hypercomputation.

abstract: In this paper, we study the geometry of reduced density matrices for states with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. We observe ruled surface structures on the boundary of the convex set of low dimension projections of the reduced density matrices if a symmetry-breaking term is added to the boundary of the system, which signals the SPT order. This symmetry-breaking term does not represent a thermodynamic quantity. Consequently, the ruled surface can neither be revealed in a system without boundary, nor by a symmetry-breaking term representing a thermodynamic quantity. Although the ruled surfaces only appear in the thermodynamic limit where the ground-state degeneracy is exact, we analyze the precision of our numerical algorithm and show that a finite system calculation suffices to reveal the ruled surfaces.

abstract: We formulate some separability conditions for a finite-dimensional quantum system. In quantum information processing, many protocols involve entangled states. Hence, separability criteria are of great importance here. We propose a lot of separability conditions based on local fine-grained uncertainty relations. Fine-grained uncertainty relations can be derived by an exact calculation or estimation of the spectral norms of certain positive matrices. One of possible approaches to separability conditions is based on considering upper bounds on the sum of maximal probabilities. This approach is immediately connected with uncertainty relations. As is known, separability criteria are often formulated for measurements that have a special structure. For instance, mutually unbiased bases and mutually unbiased measurements can be utilized for such purposes. Taking a resolution of the identity for each subsystem of a bipartite system, we construct a resolution of the identity in the product of Hilbert spaces. Separability conditions are then formulated in terms of maximal probabilities for a collection of specific outcomes. The presented conditions are compared with some previous formulations. Our results are exemplified with entangled states of a two-qutrit system.

abstract: Quantum sensors based on single solid-state spins promise a unique combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution. The key challenge in sensing is to achieve minimum estimation uncertainty within a given time and with a high dynamic range. Adaptive strategies have been proposed to achieve optimal performance but their implementation in solid-state systems has been hindered by the demanding experimental requirements. Here we realize adaptive d.c. sensing by combining single-shot readout of an electron spin in diamond with fast feedback. By adapting the spin readout basis in real time based on previous outcomes we demonstrate a sensitivity in Ramsey interferometry surpassing the standard measurement limit. Furthermore, we find by simulations and experiments that adaptive protocols offer a distinctive advantage over the best-known non-adaptive protocols when overhead and limited estimation time are taken into account. Using an optimized adaptive protocol we achieve a magnetic field sensitivity of $6.1 \pm 1.7$ nT *Hz$^{-1/2}$ over a wide range of 1.78 mT. These results open up a new class of experiments for solid-state sensors in which real-time knowledge of the measurement history is exploited to obtain optimal performance.

abstract: Surprisingly often decoherence is due to classical fluctuations of ambient fields and may thus be described in terms of random unitary (RU) dynamics. However, there are decoherence channels where such a representation cannot exist. Based on a simple and intuitive geometric measure for the distance of an extremal channel to the convex set of RU channels we are able to characterize the set of true quantum phase-damping channels. Remarkably, using the Caley-Menger determinant, our measure may be assessed directly from the matrix representation of the channel. We find that the channel of maximum quantumness is closely related to a symmetric, informationally-complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM) on the environment. Our findings are in line with numerical results based on the entanglement of assistance.

abstract: Quantum gates in topological quantum computation are performed by braiding non-Abelian anyons. These braiding processes can be performed with very low error rates. However, to make a topological quantum computation architecture truly scalable, even rare errors need to be corrected. Error correction for non-Abelian anyons is complicated by the fact that it needs to be performed on a continuous basis and further errors may occur while we are correcting existing ones. Here, we provide the first study of this problem and prove its feasibility, establishing non-Abelian anyons as a viable platform for scalable quantum computation. We thereby focus on Ising anyons as the most prominent example of non-Abelian anyons and show that for these a finite error rate can indeed be corrected continuously. There is a threshold error rate $p_c>0$ such that for all error rates $p<p_c$ the probability of a logical error per time-step can be made exponentially small in the distance of a logical qubit.

An oscillator model has certain resemblance with matchgate circuits also known as "fermionic linear optics" and effectively simulated on classical computer. The possibility of effective classical computations of average particle numbers in single-mode measurement for bosonic linear optical networks is treated using the analogy.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, pointer states are eigenstates of the observable of the measurement apparatus that represent the possible positions of the display pointer of the equipment. The origin of this concept lies in attempts to fill the blanks in the Everett's relative-state interpretation, and to make it a fully valid description of physical reality. To achieve this, it was necessary to consider not only the main system interacting with the measurement apparatus (like von Neumann and Everett did) but also the role of the environment in eliminating correlations between different possible measurements when interacting with the measurement apparatus. The interaction of the environment with the main system (and the measurement apparatus) is the core of the decoherence theory, which followed Everett's thesis. In this article, we review the measurement process according to von Neumann, Everett's relative state interpretation, the purpose of decoherence and some of its follow-up until Wojciech Zurek's primordial paper that consolidated the concept of pointer state, previously presented by Heinz Dieter Zeh. Employing a simple physical model consisting of a pair of two-level systems -- one representing the main system, the other the measurement apparatus -- and a thermal bath -- representing the environment -- we show how pointer states emerge, explaining its contributions to the question of measurement in quantum mechanics, as well as its limitations. Finally, we briefly show some of its consequences. This paper is accessible to readers with elementary knowledge about quantum mechanics, on the level of graduate courses.

abstract: We propose an approach to quantum phase estimation that can attain precision near the Heisenberg limit without requiring single-particle-resolved state detection. We show that the "one-axis twisting" interaction, well known for generating spin squeezing in atomic ensembles, can also amplify the output signal of an entanglement-enhanced interferometer to facilitate readout. Applying this interaction-based readout to oversqueezed, non-Gaussian states yields a Heisenberg scaling in phase sensitivity, which persists in the presence of detection noise as large as the quantum projection noise of an unentangled ensemble. Even in dissipative implementations -- e.g., employing light-mediated interactions in an optical cavity or Rydberg dressing -- the method significantly relaxes the detection resolution required for spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit.

abstract: Quantum thermodynamics studies quantum effects in thermal machines. But when is a heat engine, which cyclically interacts with external reservoirs that unavoidably destroy its quantum coherence, really quantum? We here use the Leggett-Garg inequality to assess the nonclassical properties of a single two-level Otto engine. We provide the complete phase diagram characterizing the quantumness of the engine as a function of its parameters and identify three distinct phases. We further derive an explicit expression for the transition temperature.

abstract: We study photon correlations generated by scattering from three-level systems (3LS) in one dimension. The two systems studied are a 3LS in a semi-infinite waveguide (3LS plus a mirror) and two 3LS in an infinite waveguide (double 3LS). Our scattering approach naturally connects photon correlation effects with inelastically scattered photons; it corresponds to input-output theory in the weak-probe limit. At the resonance where electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) occurs, we find that no photons are scattered inelastically and hence there are no induced correlations. Slightly away from EIT, the total inelastically scattered flux is large, being substantially enhanced due to the additional interference paths. This enhancement carries over to the two-photon correlation function, which exhibits non-classical behavior such as strong bunching with a very long time-scale. The long time scale originates from the slow-light effect associated with EIT.

We also draw the same conclusion using two alternative approaches of a perturbation theory and a projective construction. We propose a quantum non-demolition measurement scheme of the parity of Majorana modes. Such a scheme provides an alternative avenue to demonstrate the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions with measurement-based braidings.

abstract: We show that the second order traps in the control landscape for a three-level $\Lambda$-system found in our previous work {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 106}, 120402 (2011) are not local maxima: there exist directions in the space of controls in which the objective grows. The growth of the objective is slow --- at best 4th order for weak variations of the control. This implies that simple gradient methods would be problematic in the vicinity of second order traps, where more sophisticated algorithms that exploit the higher order derivative information are necessary to climb up the control landscape efficiently. The theory is supported by a numerical investigation of the landscape in the vicinity of the $\varepsilon(t)=0$ second order trap, performed using the GRAPE and BFGS algorithms.

abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition on a time-independent Hamiltonian and arbitrary initial state of a two-level quantum system which guarantees that the initial state will time evolve to another state from which it can be distinguished with an a priori established minimal error probability $\delta \in [0,1/2]$. The time required for the initial state to evolve to such a probabilistically distinguishable state is compared to previously established quantum speed limits giving lower bounds on the time required for evolution between nonorthogonal states. We use the explicit distinguishability time to provide a succinct derivation of the quantum brachistochrone, i.e., the Hamiltonian generating shortest time evolution between two states having equal magnitude Bloch vectors. As a consequence of the distinguishability condition, we find that if a given unitary does not evolve a given pure state to an orthogonal state, then there exist mixed states in the Bloch ball that time evolve faster than the given pure state and that reach a greater level of distinguishability under the given unitary. We show that such mixed states exist even in the case of nonunitary evolution by considering a two-level system resonantly coupled to a single mode electromagnetic field.

We use a confocal microscope to observe single NV centers and detect the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal produced by objective immersion oil, which has well understood nuclear spin properties, on the diamond surface. We determine the NV center depth by analyzing the NV NMR data using a model that describes the interaction of a single NV center with the statistically-polarized proton spin bath. We repeat this procedure for a large number of individual, shallow NV centers and compare the resulting NV depths to the mean value expected from simulations of the ion implantation process used to create the NV centers, with reasonable agreement.

abstract: Recent advances in quantum technology have led to the development and manufacturing of experimental programmable quantum annealers that could potentially solve certain quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems faster than their classical analogues. The applicability of such devices for many theoretical and practical optimization problems, which are often constrained, is severely limited by the sparse, rigid layout of the devices' quantum bits. Traditionally, constraints are addressed by the addition of penalty terms to the Hamiltonian of the problem, which in turn requires prohibitively increasing physical resources while also restricting the dynamical range of the interactions. Here we propose a method for encoding constrained optimization problems on quantum annealers that eliminates the need for penalty terms and thereby removes many of the obstacles associated with the implementation of these. We argue the advantages of the proposed technique and illustrate its effectiveness. We then conclude by discussing the experimental feasibility of the suggested method as well as its potential to boost the encodability of other optimization problems.

abstract: Many phenomena of strongly correlated materials are encapsulated in the Fermi-Hubbard model whose thermodynamical properties can be computed from its grand canonical potential according to standard procedures. In general, there is no closed form solution for lattices of more than one spatial dimension, but solutions can be approximated with cluster perturbation theory. To model long-range effects such as order parameters, a powerful method to compute the cluster's Green's function consists in finding its self-energy through a variational principle of the grand canonical potential. This opens the possibility of studying various phase transitions at finite temperature in the Fermi-Hubbard model. However, a classical cluster solver quickly hits an exponential wall in the memory (or computation time) required to store the computation variables. Here it is shown theoretically that that the cluster solver can be mapped to a subroutine on a quantum computer whose quantum memory scales as the number of orbitals in the simulated cluster. A quantum computer with a few tens of qubits could therefore simulate the thermodynamical properties of complex fermionic lattices inaccessible to classical supercomputers.

abstract: We study the evolution of the quantum state of $n$ photons in $m$ different modes when they go through a lossless linear optical system. We show that there are quantum evolution operators $U$ that cannot be built with linear optics alone unless the number of photons or the number of modes is equal to one. The evolution for single photons can be controlled with the known realization of any unitary proved by Reck, Zeilinger, Bernstein and Bertani. The evolution for a single mode corresponds to the trivial evolution in a phase shifter. We analyze these two cases and prove that any other combination of the number of photons and modes produces a Hilbert state too big for the linear optics system to give any desired evolution.

The possible ways for reducing the negative influence of thermalization on the quantum memory lifetime are also discussed.

abstract: CMOS-compatible photonic chips are highly desirable for real-world quantum optics devices due to their scalability, robustness, and integration with electronics. Despite impressive advances using Silicon nanostructures, challenges remain in reducing their linear and nonlinear losses and in creating narrowband photons necessary for interfacing with quantum memories. Here we demonstrate the potential of the silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform by realizing an ultracompact, bright, entangled photon-pair source with selectable photon bandwidths down to 30 MHz, which is unprecedented for an integrated source. Leveraging Si3N4's moderate thermal expansion, simple temperature control of the chip enables precise wavelength stabilization and tunability without active control. Single-mode photon pairs at 1550 nm are generated at rates exceeding 107 s-1 with mW's of pump power and are used to produce time-bin entanglement. Moreover, Si3N4 allows for operation from the visible to the mid-IR, which make it highly promising for a wide range of integrated quantum photonics applications.

abstract: We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$. We choose measurement settings adaptively and stochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm divides the estimation in two distinct steps: (i) Before the first detection of vacuum state, the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to detecting vacuum with the setting, which makes using too similar measurement settings twice unlikely and (ii) after the first detection of vacuum, we focus measurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step (i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of $\alpha$. Compared to nonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots required to achieve certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of $\alpha$ in phase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against readout errors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in the step (i).

abstract: For $N$ spin-polarized fermions in a $1$-dimensional trap with strong attractive interactions an odd-even effect is found. The entanglement spectrum of the $1$-particle reduced density matrix of the system's ground state differs qualitatively for $N$ odd and $N$ even. Since this effect does not occur for bosons it is the result of the competition between the attractive interaction and the repulsive nature of Pauli's exclusion principle. In contrast to the spectrum, the fermionic $1$-particle density and correlation function do not show any sensitivity on the number parity. This suggests that reduced density matrix functional theory for strong attractive interactions has a more subtle $N$-dependency than density functional theory.

abstract: We introduce a new approach to analyzing the interaction between classical and quantum systems that is based on a limiting procedure applied to multi-particle Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The limit equations obtained by this procedure, which we refer to as the classical-quantum limit, govern the interaction between classical and quantum systems, and they possess many desirable properties that are inherited in the limit from the multi-particle quantum system. As an application, we use the classical-quantum limit equations to identify the source of the non-local signalling that is known to occur in the classical-quantum hybrid scheme of Hall and Reginatto. We also derive the first order correction to the classical-quantum limit equation to obtain a fully consistent first order approximation to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation that should be accurate for modeling the interaction between particles of disparate mass in the regime where the particles with the larger masses are effectively classical.

abstract: The possibility to induce predetermined coherent quantum dynamics by controlling only the dissipative environmental parameters (such as temperature and pressure) is studied using the combined optimal control and environment engineering frameworks. As an example, we consider the problem of transforming an optically excited donor state into free charge carriers via intermediate higher-lying bridge state(s), with a view to solar energy conversion. In this context, vibrational bath engineering allows to promote fast, directional charge transfer and to suppress recombinative losses.

abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a way to characterize the NV centers. Recently, a remarkably sharp dip was observed in the ODMR with a high-density ensemble of NV centers, and this was reproduced by a theoretical model in [Zhu et al., Nature Communications 5, 3424 (2014)], showing that the dip is a consequence of the spin-1 properties of the NV centers. Here, we present much more details of analysis to show how this model can be applied to investigate the properties of the NV centers. By using our model, we have reproduced the ODMR with and without applied magnetic fields. Also, we theoretically investigate how the ODMR is affected by the typical parameters of the ensemble NV centers such as strain distributions, inhomogeneous magnetic fields, and homogeneous broadening width. Our model could provide a way to estimate these parameters from the ODMR, which would be crucial to realize diamond-based quantum information processing.

abstract: We extend recent results on expectation values of coherent oscillator states and SU(2) coherent states to the case of the discrete representations of su(1,1). Systematic semiclassical expansions of products of arbitrary operators are derived. In particular, the leading order of the energy uncertainty of an arbitrary Hamiltonian is found to be given purely in terms of the time dependence of the classical variables. The coherent states considered here include the Perelomov-Gilmore coherent states. As an important application we discuss the pseudoharmonic oscillator and compare the Perelomov-Gilmore states with the states introduced by Barut and Girardello. The latter ones turn out to be closer to the classical limit as their relative energy variance decays with the inverse square root of energy, while in the former case a constant is approached.

abstract: A simple formula is derived for the maximum squeezing rate which occurs at the initial stages of the squeezing process: the rate only depends on the second partial derivatives of a classical Hamiltonian. Rules for optimum rotation of the phase space are found to keep the state optimally located and oriented for fastest squeezing. These operations transform the phase-space point of interest into a saddle point with opposite principal curvatures. Similar results are found for the Bloch-sphere phase space and spin squeezing. Application of the general formulas is illustrated by several model examples including parametric downconversion, Kerr nonlinearity, Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and spin squeezing by one-axis twisting and two-axis countertwisting.

The measurement is performed by applying a microwave pulse to induce the transition between different electronic spin states. Under the practical experimental conditions, our calculations properly show that there exist both quantum Zeno and Zeno-like effects in an NV center.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove a local optimality property of a recently proposed coherent feedback configuration for distributed generation of EPR entanglement using two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs) in the idealized infinite bandwidth limit. This local optimality is with respect to a class of similar coherent feedback configurations but employing different unitary scattering matrices, representing different scattering of propagating signals within the network. The infinite bandwidth limit is considered as it significantly simplifies the analysis, allowing local optimality criteria to be explicitly verified. Nonetheless, this limit is relevant for the finite bandwidth scenario as it provides an accurate approximation to the EPR entanglement in the low frequency region where EPR entanglement exists.

abstract: We propose a new test of local realism based on correlation measurements of continuum valued functions of positions and momenta, known as modular variables. The Wigner representation of these observables are bounded in phase space, and therefore, the associated inequality holds for any state described by a non-negative Wigner function. This agrees with Bell's remark that positive Wigner functions, serving as a valid probability distribution over local (hidden) phase space coordinates, do not reveal non-locality. We construct a class of entangled states resulting in a violation of the inequality, and thus truly demonstrate non-locality in phase space. The states can be realized through grating techniques in space-like separated interferometric setups. The non-locality is verified from the spatial correlation data, collected from the screens.

abstract: The future of quantum repeater networking will require interoperability between various error correcting codes. A few specific code conversions and even a generalized method are known, however, no detailed analysis of these techniques in the context of quantum networking has been performed. In this paper, we analyze a generalized procedure to create Bell pairs encoded heterogeneously between two separate codes used often in error corrected quantum repeater network designs. We begin with a physical Bell pair, then encode each qubit in a different error correcting code, using entanglement purification to increase the fidelity. We investigate three separate protocols for preparing the purified encoded Bell pair. We calculate the error probability of those schemes between the Steane [[7,1,3]] code, a distance three surface code and single physical qubits by Monte Carlo simulation under a standard Pauli error model, and estimate the resource efficiency of the procedures. A local gate error rate of $10^{-3}$ allows us to create high-fidelity logical Bell pairs between any of our chosen codes. We find that a postselected model, where any detected parity flips in code stabilizers result in a restart of the protocol, performs the best.

abstract: The non-classical nature of quantum states, often illustrated using entanglement measures or quantum discord, constitutes a resource for quantum information protocols. However, the non-classicality of a quantum system cannot be encapsulated as a property of the state alone, as the set of available measurements used to extract information on the system is typically restricted. In this work we study how the non-classicality of quantum measurements, quantified via their incompatibility, is influenced by quantum noise and, further, how a non-Markovian environment may help us in maintaining the measurement resources.

abstract: We present a method to accelerate the dynamical evolution of multiqubit open system by employing dynamical decoupling pulses (DDPs) when the qubits are initially in W-type states. It is found that this speed-up evolution can be achieved in both of the weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling regime. The physical mechanism behind the acceleration evolution is explained as the result of the joint action of the non-Markovianity of reservoirs and the excited-state population of qubits. It is shown that both of the non-Markovianity and the excited-state population can be controlled by DDPs to realize the quantum speed-up.

abstract: Quantum vacuum fluctuations impose strict limits on precision displacement measurements, those of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors among them. Introducing squeezed states into an interferometer's readout port can improve the sensitivity of the instrument, leading to richer astrophysical observations. However, optomechanical interactions dictate that the vacuum's squeezed quadrature must rotate by 90 degrees around 50Hz. Here we use a 2-m-long, high-finesse optical resonator to produce frequency-dependent rotation around 1.2kHz. This demonstration of audio-band frequency-dependent squeezing uses technology and methods that are scalable to the required rotation frequency, heralding application of the technique in future gravitational-wave detectors.

abstract: We explore energy transfer in a generic three-level system, which is coupled to three non-equilibrium baths. Built on the concept of quantum heat engine, our three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including light-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced isomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of light-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is transferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and finally decays to the ground state. The efficiency of this process is evaluated by steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus a wide range of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the coupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in population inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which optimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling limit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency approaches the heat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois in Phys. Rew. Lett. 2, 262 (1959).

abstract: Understanding the non-Markovian mechanisms underlying the revivals of quantum entanglement in the presence of classical environments is central in the theory of quantum information. Tentative interpretations have been given by either the role of the environment as a control device or the concept of hidden entanglement. We address this issue from an information-theoretic point of view. To this aim, we consider a paradigmatic tripartite system, already realized in the laboratory, made of two independent qubits and a random classical field locally interacting with one qubit alone. We study the dynamical relationship between the two-qubit entanglement and the genuine tripartite correlations of the overall system, finding that collapse and revivals of entanglement correspond, respectively, to raise and fall of the overall tripartite correlations. Interestingly, entanglement dark periods can enable plateaux of nonzero tripartite correlations. We then explain this behavior in terms of information flows among the different parties of the system. Besides showcasing the phenomenon of the freezing of overall correlations, our results provide new insights on the origin of retrieval of entanglement within a hybrid quantum-classical system.

abstract: Finding efficient descriptions of how an environment affects a collection of discrete quantum systems would lead to new insights into many areas of modern physics. Markovian, or time-local, methods work well for individual systems, but for groups a question arises: does system-bath or inter-system coupling dominate the dissipative dynamics? The answer has profound consequences for the long-time quantum correlations within the system. We consider two bosonic modes coupled to a bath. By comparing an exact solution to different Markovian master equations, we find that a smooth crossover of the equations-of-motion between dominant inter-system and system-bath coupling exists -- but requires a non-secular master equation. We predict a singular behaviour of the dynamics, and show that the ultimate failure of non-secular equations of motion is essentially a failure of the Markov approximation. Our findings justify the use of time-local theories throughout the crossover between system-bath dominated and inter-system-coupling dominated dynamics.

abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing has recently been used to factor 56153 [Dattani & Bryans, arXiv:1411.6758] at room temperature, which is orders of magnitude larger than any number attempted yet using Shor's algorithm (circuit-based quantum computation). However, this number is still vastly smaller than RSA-768 which is the largest number factored thus far on a classical computer. We address a major issue arising in the scaling of adiabatic quantum factorization to much larger numbers. Namely, the existence of many 4-qubit, 3-qubit and 2-qubit interactions in the Hamiltonians. We showcase our method on various examples, one of which shows that we can remove 94% of the 4-qubit interactions and 83% of the 3-qubit interactions in the factorization of a 25-digit number with almost no effort, without adding any auxiliary qubits. Our method is not limited to quantum factoring. Its importance extends to the wider field of discrete optimization. Any CSP (constraint-satisfiability problem), psuedo-boolean optimization problem, or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization) problem can in principle benefit from the "deduction-reduction" method which we introduce in this paper. We provide an open source code which takes in a Hamiltonian (or a discrete discrete function which needs to be optimized), and returns a Hamiltonian that has the same unique ground state(s), no new auxiliary variables, and as few multi-qubit (multi-variable) terms as possible with deduc-reduc.

We study the role of the sidebands of the intense fields in the measured spectra, analyzing the information that can be recovered working with different analysis frequencies. In this case, the non-zero one-photon detuning appears as a necessary condition for spectrally resolving the sideband resonances in the correlation coefficient. Our experimental findings are supported by the perturbative model defined in the frequency domain.

abstract: Estimation of channel parameters is important for extending the range and increasing the key rate of continuous variable quantum key distribution protocols. We propose a new estimator for the channel noise parameter based on the method of moments. The method of moments finds an estimator from the moments of the output distribution of the protocol. This estimator has the advantage of being able to use all of the states shared between Alice and Bob. Other estimators are limited to a smaller publicly revealed subset of the states. The proposed estimator has a lower variance for high loss channel than what has previously been proposed. We show that the method of moments estimator increases the key rate by up to an order of magnitude at the maximum transmission of the protocol.

abstract: A sideband cooling strategy that incorporates (i) the dynamics induced by structured (non-Markovian) environments in the target and auxiliary systems and (ii) the optimally-time-modulated interaction between them is developed. For the context of cavity optomechanics, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered in the target system, ground state cooling is reached at much faster rates and at much lower phonon occupation number than previously reported. In constrast to similar current strategies, ground state cooling is reached here for coupling-strength rates that are experimentally accesible for the state-of-the-art implementations. After the ultrafast optimal-ground-state-cooling protocol is accomplished, an additional optimal control strategy is considered to maintain the phonon number as closer as possible to the one obtained in the cooling procedure. Contrary to the conventional expectation, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered in the auxiliary system, the efficiency of the cooling protocol is undermined.

abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can provide genuine randomness by appealing to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In general, a physical generator contains two parts --- a randomness source and its readout. The source is essential to the quality of the resulting random numbers; hence needs to be carefully calibrated and modeled to achieve information-theoretically provable randomness. However, in practice, the source is a complicated physical system, such as a light source or an atomic assemble, and any deviations in the real-life implementation from the theoretical model may affect the randomness of the output. To close this gap, we propose a source-independent scheme for QRNGs in which output randomness can be certified, even when the source is uncharacterized and untrusted. In our randomness analysis, we make no assumptions about the dimension of the source. For instance, multi-photon emissions are allowed in optical implementations. Our analysis takes account of the finite-key effect with the composable security definition. In the limit of large data size, the length of the input random seed is exponentially small compared to that of the output random bit. Our scheme can be implemented by simply converting some current realizations of quantum random number generation.

abstract: We present a guessing game, to be called "secret-bit guessing game," where a player (say, Bob) guesses two secret bits enveloped by another player (say, Alice) based on a legitimate strategy. Here we introduce a notion of supplementary information, under the name of hint, available for Bob to guess the secret bits. In such setting, we investigate an intriguing question: What happens if the physical elements to realize Bob's strategy are quantum? On the basis of the analysis of payoff function, we here offer a new scenario, namely, of allowing Bob to make better use of a given hint with the quantum elements beyond their classical counterparts. We argue that this quantum advantage is possible due to the ability of the quantum elements to use the quality of a given hint, as well as its amount, faithfully dealing with the nature of quantum superposition.

abstract: Multiple-post reentrant 3D lumped cavity modes have been realized to design the new concept of discrete Whispering Gallery and Fabry-Perot Modes for multimode microwave Quantum Electrodynamics experiments. Using a magnon spin-wave resonance of a submillimeter-sized Yttrium-Iron- Garnet sphere at millikelvin temperatures and a four-post cavity, we demonstrate the ultra-strong coupling regime between discrete Whispering Gallery Modes and a magnon resonance with strength of 1.84 GHz. By increasing the number of posts to eight and arranging them in a D4 symmetry pattern, we expand the mode structure to that of a discrete Fabry-Perot cavity and show control of the Free Spectral Range (FSR). We reach the superstrong coupling regime, where spin-photon coupling strength is larger than FSR, with coupling strength in the 1.1 to 1.5 GHz range.

abstract: We experimentally study optical homodyne and heterodyne detections with a same setup, which is flexible to manipulate the signal sideband modulation. When the modulation only generate a single signal sideband, the light field measurement by mixing the single sideband at $\omega_{0}+\Omega$ with a strong local oscillator at the carrier frequency $\omega_{0}$ on a beam splitter become balanced heterodyne detection. When two signal sidebands at $\omega_{0}\pm\Omega$ are generated and the relative phase of the two sidebands is locked, this measurement corresponds to optical balanced homodyne detection. With this setup, we may confirm directly that the signal-to-noise ratio with heterodyne detection is two-fold worse than that with homodyne detection. This work will have important applications in quantum state measurement and quantum information.

abstract: A long-standing aim of quantum information research is to understand what gives quantum computers their advantage. This requires separating problems that need genuinely quantum resources from those for which classical resources are enough. Two examples of quantum speed-up are the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's problem, both efficiently solvable on a quantum Turing machine, and both believed to lack efficient classical solutions. Here we show that both problems can be solved efficiently in an extension of Spekkens' toy model: The Deutsch-Jozsa problem with probability 1 using only one oracle query, and Simon's problem using linearly many oracle queries, just as expected of an ideal quantum computer. The extended toy model is efficiently simulatable in a classical probabilistic Turing machine, showing that the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's problem do not require any genuinely quantum resources, and that the quantum algorithms show no speed-up when compared with the corresponding classical simulation. This gives an insight into what resources are needed in the two algorithms, and calls for further study of oracle separation between quantum and classical computation.

abstract: In the evaluation of quantum annealers, metrics based on ground state success rates have two major drawbacks. First, evaluation requires computation time for both quantum and classical processors that grows exponentially with problem size. This makes evaluation itself computationally prohibitive. Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time. We evaluate D-Wave's latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave 2X system, on an array of problem classes and find that it performs well on several input classes relative to state of the art software solvers running single-threaded on a CPU.

abstract: In quantum adiabatic algorithm, as the adiabatic parameter $s(t)$ changes slowly from zero to one with finite rate, a transition to excited states inevitably occurs and this induces an intrinsic computational error. We show that this computational error depends not only on the total computation time $T$ but also on the time derivatives of the adiabatic parameter $s(t)$ at the beginning and the end of evolution. With six typical paths, we demonstrate how to optimally design an adiabatic path to reduce the computational errors. In this paper we focus on quantum adiabatic search algorithm although our results are general.

abstract: Grover's algorithm is a quantum query algorithm solving the unstructured search problem of size $N$ using $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. It provides a significant speed-up over any classical algorithm \cite{Gro96}. The running time of the algorithm, however, is very sensitive to errors in queries. It is known that if query may fail (report all marked elements as unmarked) the algorithm needs $\Omega(N)$ queries to find a marked element \cite{RS08}. \cite{AB+13} have proved the same result for the model where each marked element has its own probability to be reported as unmarked. We study the behavior of Grover's algorithm in the model where the search space contains both faulty and non-faulty marked elements. We show that in this setting it is indeed possible to find one of non-faulty marked items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. We also analyze the limiting behavior of the algorithm for a large number of steps and show the existence and the structure of limiting state $\rho_{lim}$.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics, a hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics, relies on the concept of trajectory, which evolves in time in compliance with dynamical information conveyed by the wave function. Here this appealing idea is considered to analyze both classical and quantum interference, thus providing an alternative and more intuitive framework to understand the time-evolution of waves, either in terms of the flow of energy (for mechanical waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, for instance) or, analogously, the flow of probability (quantum waves), respectively. Furthermore, this procedure also supplies a more robust explanation of interference phenomena, which currently is only based on the superposition principle. That is, while this principle only describes how different waves combine and what effects these combinations may lead to, flow lines provide a more precise explanation on how the energy or probability propagate in space before, during and after the combination of such waves, without dealing with them separately (i.e., the combination or superposition is taken as a whole). In this sense, concepts such as constructive and destructive interference, typically associated with the superposition principle, physically correspond to more or less dense swarms of (energy or probability) flow lines, respectively. A direct consequence of this description is that, when considering the distribution of electromagnetic energy flow lines behind two slits, each one covered by a differently oriented polarizer, it is naturally found that external observers' information on the slit crossed by single photons (understood as energy parcels) is totally irrelevant for the existence of interference fringes, in striking contrast with what is commonly stated and taught.

abstract: Over the past years, there have been many efforts towards generating interactions between two optical beams so strong that they could be observed at the level of individual photons. Such strong interactions, beyond opening up a new regime in optics, could lead to technologies such as all-optical quantum information processing. However, the extreme weakness of photon-photon scattering has hindered any attempt to observe such interactions at the level of single particles. Here we implement a strong optical nonlinearity using electromagnetically-induced transparency and slow light, and directly measure the resulting nonlinear phase shift for individual photons. This is done by illuminating the sample with a weak classical pulse with as few as 0.5 photons per pulse on average, and using post-selection to determine whether a given pulse contained (approximately) 0 or 1 photons. We present clear data showing the quantized dependence of a probe beam's measured phase shift on the post-selection result, for a range of input pulse intensities. We believe that this represents the first direct measurement of the cross-phase shift due to single photons.

abstract: In secure quantum communication protocols, a set of single qubits prepared using 2 or more mutually unbiased bases or a set of $n$-qubit ($n\geq2$) entangled states of a particular form are usually used to form a verification string which is subsequently used to detect traces of eavesdropping. The qubits that form a verification string are referred to as decoy qubits, and there exists a large set of different quantum states that can be used as decoy qubits. In the absence of noise, any choice of decoy qubits provides equivalent security. In this paper, we examine such equivalence for noisy environment (e.g., in amplitude damping, phase damping, collective dephasing and collective rotation noise channels) by comparing the decoy-qubit assisted schemes of secure quantum communication that use single qubit states as decoy qubits with the schemes that use entangled states as decoy qubits. Our study reveals that the single qubit assisted scheme perform better in some noisy environments, while some entangled qubits assisted schemes perform better in other noisy environments. Specifically, single qubits assisted schemes perform better in amplitude damping and phase damping noisy channels, whereas a few Bell-state-based decoy schemes are found to perform better in the presence of the collective noise. Thus, if the kind of noise present in a communication channel (i.e., the characteristics of the channel) is known or measured, then the present study can provide the best choice of decoy qubits required for implementation of schemes of secure quantum communication through that channel.

abstract: Degenerate optomechanical parametric oscillators are optical resonators in which a mechanical degree of freedom is coupled to a cavity mode that is nonlinearly amplified via parametric down-conversion of an external pumping laser. Below a critical pumping power the down-converted field is purely quantum-mechanical, making the theoretical description of such systems very challenging. Here we introduce a theoretical approach that is capable of describing this regime, even at the critical point itself. We find that the down-converted field can induce significant mechanical cooling and identify the process responsible of this as a "cooling by heating" mechanism. Moreover, we show that, contrary to naive expectations and semi-classical predictions, cooling is not optimal at the critical point, where the photon number is largest. Our approach opens the possibility for analyzing further hybrid dissipative quantum systems in the vicinity of critical points.

abstract: Since the first quantum ghost imaging (QGI) experiment in 1995, many QGI schemes have been put forward. However, the position-position or momentum-momentum correlation required in these QGI schemes cannot be distributed over optical fibers, which limits their large geographical applications. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a scheme for long distance QGI utilizing frequency correlated photon pairs. In this scheme, the frequency correlation is transformed to the correlation between the illuminating position of one photon and the arrival time of the other photon, by which QGI can be realized in the time domain. Since frequency correlation can be preserved when the photon pairs are distributed over optical fibers, this scheme provides a way to realize long-distance QGI over large geographical scale. In the experiment, long distance QGI over 50 km optical fibers has been demonstrated.

abstract: The security of source has become an increasingly important issue in quantum cryptography. Based on the framework of measurement-device-independent quantum-key-distribution (MDI-QKD), the source becomes the only region exploitable by a potential eavesdropper (Eve). Phase randomization is a cornerstone assumption in most discrete-variable (DV-) quantum communication protocols (e.g., QKD, quantum coin tossing, weak coherent state blind quantum computing, and so on), and the violation of such an assumption is thus fatal to the security of those protocols. In this paper, we show a simple quantum hacking strategy, with commercial and homemade pulsed lasers, by Eve that allows her to actively tamper with the source and violate such an assumption, without leaving a trace afterwards. Furthermore, our attack may also be valid for continuous-variable (CV-) QKD, which is another main class of QKD protocol, since, excepting the phase random assumption, other parameters (e.g., intensity) could also be changed, which directly determine the security of CV-QKD.

abstract: We implement the discrete-time quantum walk model using the continuous-time evolution of the Hamiltonian that includes both the shift and the coin generators. Based on the Trotter-Suzuki first-order approximation, we consider an optimization problem in which the Hellinger distance between the walker probability distributions resulted from the evolution of such Hamiltonian and the quantum walk dynamics is minimized. The phase space implementation of the quantum walk is considered where the walker state is encoded on the coherent state of a resonator and the coin on the two-level state of a qubit. In this approach, no mechanism for switching between the coin and the shift operators is included. We show the Hellinger distance is bounded for large number of time steps. The distance is small when we deviate from the standard quantum walk model, namely, when the walker is allowed to move in between the sites. In simulating the standard quantum walk model, the distance is large but bounded by $26\%$ for a relevant number of time steps. Even so, the system evolution shows the essential characteristics of the standard quantum walk dynamics, namely, the ballistic evolution of the probability distribution and the linear growth of the corresponding standard deviation. Moreover, the entanglement generated in this approach is approximately the same as the entanglement generated in the standard quantum walk dynamics. Finally, the system dynamics under the influence of the decoherence also shows the similar quantum-to-classical transition as in the standard quantum walk dynamics.

abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of two quantum repeater protocols with an existing experimental platform based on a $^{40}$Ca$^+$-ion in a segmented micro trap, and a third one that requires small changes to the platform. A fiber cavity serves as an ion-light interface. Its small mode volume allows for a large coupling strength of $g_c = 2 \pi 20$ MHz despite comparatively large losses $\kappa = 2 \pi 36.6$ MHz. With a fiber diameter of 125 mu m, the cavity is integrated into the microstructured ion trap, which in turn is used to transport single ions in and out of the interaction zone in the fiber cavity. We evaluate the entanglement generation rate for a given fidelity using parameters from the experimental setup. The DLCZ protocol (Duan et al, Nature, 2001, 414, 413-418) and the hybrid protocol (van Loock et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2006, 96, 240501) outperform the EPR protocol (Sanguard et al, New J. Phys., 2013, 15, 085004). We calculate rates of more than than 35 s$^{-1}$ for non-local Bell state fidelities larger than 0.9 with the existing platform. We identify parameters which mainly limit the attainable rates, and conclude that entanglement generation rates of 740 s$^{-1}$ at fidelities of 0.9 are within reach with current technology.

We demonstrate, in the single-magnon limit, strong coupling between a magnetostatic mode in the sphere and a microwave cavity mode. Moreover, we introduce a superconducting qubit in the cavity and couple the qubit with the magnon excitation via the virtual photon excitation. We observe the magnon-vacuum-induced Rabi splitting. The hybrid quantum system enables generation and characterization of non-classical quantum states of magnons.

We observe the trade-off between the two fundamental sources of noises that enforce the standard quantum limit: the measurement imprecision and radiation-pressure backaction from photon shot noise. We demonstrate that the quantum backaction of the measurement can overwhelm the intrinsic thermal motion by 24 dB, entering a new regime for cavity optomechanical systems.

abstract: Technical means for identifying when tampering occurs is a critical part of many containment and surveillance technologies. Conventional fiber optic seals provide methods for monitoring enclosed inventories, but they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks based on classical physics. We address these vulnerabilities with the development of a quantum seal that offers the ability to detect the intercept-resend attack using quantum integrity verification. Our approach represents an application of entanglement to provide guarantees in the authenticity of the seal state by verifying it was transmitted coherently. We implement these ideas using polarization-entangled photon pairs that are verified after passing through a fiber-optic channel testbed. Using binary detection theory, we find the probability of detecting inauthentic signals is greater than 0.9999 with a false alarm chance of $10^{-9}$ for a 10 second sampling interval. In addition, we show how the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect concurrently provides a tight bound on redirection attack, in which tampering modifies the shape of the seal. Our measurements limit the tolerable path length change to sub-millimeter disturbances. These tamper-indicating features of the quantum seal offer unprecedented security for unattended monitoring systems.

abstract: Having analytical instances of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) is of obvious interest, both for fundamental and applied reasons. This is generically a hard task, due to the belief that non-linear interactions are basic ingredients of the thermalization mechanism. In this article we proof that random gaussian free fermions satisfy ETH in the multiparticle sector, by analytically computing the correlations and entanglement entropies of the theory. With the explicit construction at hand, we finally comment on the differences between fully random Hamiltonians and random Gaussian systems, and on the connection between chaotic energy spectra and ETH.

abstract: One of the goals in quantum simulation is to adiabatically generate the ground state of a complicated Hamiltonian by starting with the ground state of a simple Hamiltonian and slowly evolving the system to the complicated one. If the evolution is adiabatic and the initial and final ground states are connected due to having the same symmetry, then the simulation will be successful. But in most experiments, adiabatic simulation is not possible because it would take too long, and the system has some level of diabatic excitation. In this work, we quantify the extent of the diabatic excitation even if we do not know {\it a priori} what the complicated ground state is. Since many quantum simulator platforms, like trapped ions, can measure the probabilities to be in a product state, we describe techniques that can employ these measurements to estimate the probability of being in the ground state of the system after the diabatic evolution. These techniques do not require one to know any properties about the Hamiltonian itself, nor to calculate its eigenstate properties. All the information is derived by analyzing the product-state measurements as functions of time.

In Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 285, 233-240 (2014) it was shown that all maxima and minima of the objective functional are global if $T\ge \pi$ (in suitable units). In the present work we show that all maxima and minima are global as soon as $T\ge \pi/2$. Hence we reduce by the factor of two the minimal time for which traps, i.e., local but not global maxima or minima of the objective functional, do not exist.

abstract: There has been great interest in recent years in quantum control landscapes. Given an objective $J$ that depends on a control field $\varepsilon$ the dynamical landscape is defined by the properties of the Hessian $\delta^2 J/\delta\varepsilon^2$ at the critical points $\delta J/\delta\varepsilon=0$. We show that contrary to recent claims in the literature the dynamical control landscape can exhibit trapping behavior due to the existence of special critical points and illustrate this finding with an example of a 3-level $\Lambda$-system. This observation can have profound implications for both theoretical and experimental quantum control studies.

This complements a result of Coutinho and Liu who showed that no tree of size greater than two has Laplacian perfect state transfer. In contrast, we prove that the corona product of two graphs exhibits Laplacian pretty good state transfer, under some mild conditions. This provides the first known examples of families of graphs with Laplacian pretty good state transfer. Our result extends of the work of Fan and Godsil on double stars to the Laplacian setting. Moreover, we also show that the corona product of any cocktail party graph with a single vertex graph has Laplacian pretty good state transfer, even though odd cocktail party graphs have no perfect state transfer.

abstract: Testable predictions of quantum mechanics are invariant under time reversal. But the change of the quantum state in time is not so, neither in the collapse nor in the no-collapse interpretations of the theory. This fact challenges the realistic interpretation of the quantum state. On the other hand, this fact follows easily if we interpret the quantum state as a mere calculation device, bookkeeping past real quantum events. The same conclusion follows from the analysis of the meaning of the wave function in the semiclassical regime.

abstract: We provide a rigorous generalization of the quantum adiabatic theorem for open systems described by a Markovian master equation with time-dependent Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}(t)$. We focus on the finite system case relevant for adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Adiabaticity is defined in terms of closeness to the instantaneous steady state. While the general result is conceptually similar to the closed system case, there are important differences. Namely, a system initialized in the zero-eigenvalue eigenspace of $\mathcal{L}(t)$ will remain in this eigenspace with a deviation that is inversely proportional to the total evolution time $T$. In the case of a finite number of level crossings the scaling becomes $T^{-\eta}$ with an exponent $\eta$ that we relate to the rate of the gap closing. For master equations that describe relaxation to thermal equilibrium, we show that the evolution time $T$ should be long compared to the corresponding minimum inverse gap squared of $\mathcal{L}(t)$. Our results are illustrated with several examples.

abstract: Whereas in standard quantum state tomography one estimates an unknown state by performing various measurements with known devices, and whereas in detector tomography one estimates the POVM elements of a measurement device by subjecting to it various known states, we consider here the case of SPAM (state preparation and measurement) tomography where neither the states nor the measurement device are assumed known. For $d$-dimensional systems measured by $d$-outcome detectors, we find there are at most $d^2(d^2-1)$ "gauge" parameters that can never be determined by any such experiment, irrespective of the number of unknown states and unknown devices. For the case $d=2$ we find new gauge-invariant quantities that can be accessed directly experimentally and that can be used to detect and describe SPAM errors. In particular, we identify conditions whose violations detect the presence of correlations between SPAM errors. From the perspective of SPAM tomography, standard quantum state tomography and detector tomography are protocols that fix the gauge parameters through the assumption that some set of fiducial measurements is known or that some set of fiducial states is known, respectively.

abstract: We propose a simple diatomic system trapped inside an optical cavity to control the energy flow between two thermal baths. Through the action of the baths the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state. Using the Large Deviation theory and full counting statistics we show that the energy current flowing between the two baths is dramatically different depending on the symmetry of the atomic states. Here we present a deterministic scheme to prepare symmetric and antisymmetric atomic states with the use of external driving fields, thus implementing an atomic control switch for the energy flow.

abstract: In most studies on post-selected weak measurement, the zero-mean Gaussian state (i.e., pure state) is initialized as a pointer state. Recently, several theoretical studies give the limits that using fisher information metric, weak measurement amplification strategy can not outperform the standard metrology strategy. However, we show that the limits, especially for the imaginary part of weak value, is no longer tenable if thermal state is initialized as a pointer state. By adjusting the temperature, we can improve accuracy of the measurement precision.

abstract: In certain circumstances, the uncertainty, $\Delta S [\phi]$, of a quantum observable, $S$, can be bounded from below by a finite overall constant $\Delta S>0$, \emph{i.e.}, $\Delta S [\phi] \geq \Delta S$, for all physical states $\phi$. For example, a finite lower bound to the resolution of distances has been used to model a natural ultraviolet cutoff at the Planck or string scale. In general, the minimum uncertainty of an observable can depend on the expectation value, $t=\langle \phi, S \phi\rangle$, through a function $\Delta S_t$ of $t$, \emph{i.e.}, $\Delta S [\phi]\ge \Delta S_t$, for all physical states $\phi$ with $\langle \phi, S \phi\rangle=t$. An observable whose uncertainty is finitely bounded from below is necessarily described by an operator that is merely symmetric rather than self-adjoint on the physical domain. Nevertheless, on larger domains, the operator possesses a family of self-adjoint extensions. Here, we prove results on the relationship between the spacing of the eigenvalues of these self-adjoint extensions and the function $\Delta S_t$. We also discuss potential applications in quantum and classical information theory.

abstract: Dynamical decoupling protocols are one of the most used tools for efficient quantum error corrections and for reservoir engineering. In this paper we study the effect of dynamical decoupling pulses on the preservation of both quantum and classical correlations, and their influence on the intriguing phenomenon of time-invariant discord. We study two qubits experiencing local dephasing with an Ohmic class spectrum and subject to dynamical decoupling protocols. We investigate the connection between the dynamics of both classical and quantum correlations and the behaviour of information flow between system and environment. Finally, we establish a set of necessary conditions for which time-invariant discord can be created using dynamically decoupling techniques.

abstract: This work explores a fundamental dynamical structure for a wide range of many-body quantum systems under periodic driving. Generically, in the thermodynamic limit, such systems are known to heat up to infinite temperature states after infinite-time evolution, irrespective of dynamical details. In the present study, instead of considering infinitely long-time scale, we aim to provide a framework to understand the long but finite time behavior, namely the transient dynamics. In the analysis, we focus on the Floquet-Magnus (FM) expansion that gives a formal expression of the effective Hamiltonian on the system. Although in general the full series expansion is not convergent in the thermodynamics limit, we give a clear relationship between the FM expansion and the transient dynamics. More precisely, we rigorously show that a truncated version of the FM expansion accurately describes the exact dynamics for a finite-time scale. Our result reveals a reliable time scale of the validity of the FM expansion, which can be comparable to the experimental time scale. Furthermore, we discuss several dynamical phenomena, such as the effect of small integrability breaking, efficient numerical simulation of periodically driven systems, dynamical localization and thermalization. Especially on thermalization, we discuss generic scenario of the prethermalization phenomenon in periodically driven systems.

abstract: Electroluminescence, the emission of light in the presence of an electric current, provides information on the allowed electronic transitions of a given system. It is commonly used to investigate the physics of strongly-coupled light-matter systems, whose eigenfrequencies are split by the strong coupling with the photonic field of a cavity. Here we show that, together with the usual electroluminescence, systems in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime emit a uniquely quantum radiation when a flow of current is driven through them. While standard electroluminescence relies on the population of excited states followed by spontaneous emission, the process we describe herein extracts bound photons by the dressed ground state and it has peculiar features that unequivocally distinguish it from usual electroluminescence.

abstract: Significant advances in coherence have made superconducting quantum circuits a viable platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To further extend capabilities, highly coherent quantum systems could act as quantum memories for these circuits. A useful quantum memory must be rapidly addressable by qubits, while maintaining superior coherence. We demonstrate a novel superconducting microwave cavity architecture that is highly robust against major sources of loss that are encountered in the engineering of circuit QED systems. The architecture allows for near-millisecond storage of quantum states in a resonator while strong coupling between the resonator and a transmon qubit enables control, encoding, and readout at MHz rates. The observed coherence times constitute an improvement of almost an order of magnitude over those of the best available superconducting qubits. Our design is an ideal platform for studying coherent quantum optics and marks an important step towards hardware-efficient quantum computing with Josephson junction-based quantum circuits.

abstract: A set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) is said to be unextendible if there does not exist another basis that is unbiased with respect to the given set. Here, we prove the existence of smaller sets of MUBs in prime-squared dimensions ($d=p^{2}$) that cannot be extended to a complete set using the generalized Pauli operators. We further observe an interesting connection between the existence of unextendible sets and the tightness of entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in these dimensions. In particular, we show that our construction of unextendible sets of MUBs naturally leads to sets of $p+1$ MUBs that saturate both a Shannon ($H_{1}$) and a collision ($H_{2}$) entropic lower bound. Such an identification of smaller sets of MUBs satisfying tight EURs is crucial for cryptographic applications as well as constructing optimal entanglement witnesses for higher dimensional systems.

abstract: Recent findings suggest, separable states, which are otherwise of no use in entanglement dependent tasks, can also be used in information processing tasks that depend upon the discord type general non classical correlations. In this work, we explore the nature of uncertainty in separable states as measured by local quantum uncertainty. Particularly in two-qubit system, we find separable X-state which has maximum local quantum uncertainty. Interestingly, this separable state coincides with the separable state, having maximum geometric discord. We also search for the maximum amount of local quantum uncertainty in separable Bell diagonal states. We indicate an interesting connection to the tightness of entropic uncertainty with the state of maximum uncertainty.

abstract: For more than 80 years, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum theory have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades, numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials testing the CHSH-Bell inequality $S \leq 2$ and find $S = 2.42 \pm 0.20$. A null hypothesis test yields a probability of $p = 0.039$ that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.

abstract: We consider a model for a Planck scale ultraviolet cutoff which is based on Shannon sampling. Shannon sampling originated in information theory, where it expresses the equivalence of continuous and discrete representations of information. When applied to quantum field theory, Shannon sampling expresses a hard ultraviolet cutoff in the form of a bandlimitation. This introduces nonlocality at the cutoff scale in a way that is more subtle than a simple discretization of space: quantum fields can then be represented as either living on continuous space or, entirely equivalently, as living on any one lattice whose average spacing is sufficiently small. We explicitly calculate vacuum entanglement entropies in 1+1 dimension and we find a transition between logarithmic and linear scaling of the entropy, which is the expected 1+1 dimensional analog of the transition from an area to a volume law. We also use entanglement entropy and mutual information as measures to probe in detail the localizability of the field degrees of freedom. We find that, even though neither translation nor rotation invariance are broken, each field degree of freedom occupies an incompressible volume of space, indicating a finite information density.

abstract: We present a class of tractable non-equilibrium dynamical quantum systems which includes combinations of single site injection, detection and extraction of particles interspersed by simple unitary evolutions. We show how such operations generate a hierarchy of equations tying lower correlation functions with higher order ones. The hierarchy closes for particular choices of measurements and leads to a rich class of evolutions whose long time behavior can be simulated efficiently. In particular, we use the hierarchy to study current generation through a quantum exclusion process, and exhibit an explicit formula for the long time energy distribution.

abstract: The academic research into entanglement nicely illustrates the interplay between fundamental science and applications, and the need to foster both aspects to advance either one. For instance, the possibility to distribute entangled photons over tens or even hundreds of kilometers is fascinating because it confirms the quantum predictions over large distances, while quantum theory is often presented to apply to the very small (see Figure 1). On the other hand, entanglement enables quantum key distribution (QKD) [1]. This most advanced application of quantum information processing allows one to distribute cryptographic keys in a provably secure manner. For this, one merely has to measure the two halves of an entangled pair of photons. Surprisingly, and being of both fundamental and practical interest, the use of entanglement removes even the necessity for trusting most equipment used for the measurements [5]. Furthermore, entanglement serves as a resource for quantum teleportation (see Figure 2) [1]. In turn, this provides a tool for extending quantum key distribution to arbitrarily large distances and building large-scale networks that connect future quantum computers and atomic clocks [6]. In the following, we describe the counter-intuitive properties of entangled particles as well as a few recent experiments that address fundamental and applied aspects of quantum teleportation. While a lot of work is being done using different quantum systems, including trapped ions, color centers in diamond, quantum dots, and superconducting circuits, we will restrict ourselves to experiments involving photons due to their suitability for building future quantum networks.

abstract: Advances in single photon creation, transmission, and detection suggest that sending quantum information over optical fibers may have losses low enough to be correctable using a quantum error correcting code. Such error-corrected communication is equivalent to a novel quantum repeater scheme, but crucial questions regarding implementation and system requirements remain open. Here we show that long range entangled bit generation with rates approaching $10^8$ ebits/s may be possible using a completely serialized protocol, in which photons are generated, entangled, and error corrected via sequential, one-way interactions with a minimal number of matter qubits. Provided loss and error rates of the required elements are below the threshold for quantum error correction, this scheme demonstrates improved performance over transmission of single photons. We find improvement in ebit rates at large distances using this serial protocol and various quantum error correcting codes.

abstract: The nine-component positive vector optical tomographic probability portrait of quantum state of spin-1 particles containing full spatial and spin information about the state without redundancy is constructed. Also the suggested approach is expanded to symplectic tomography representation and to representations with quasidistributions. The evolution equations for constructed vector optical and symplectic tomograms and vector quasidistributions for arbitrary Hamiltonian are found. The evolution equations are also obtained in special case of the quantum system of charged spin-1 particle in arbitrary electro-magnetic field, which are analogs of non-relativistic Proca equation in appropriate representations. The generalization of proposed approach to the cases of arbitrary spin is discussed. The possibility of formulation of quantum mechanics of the systems with spins in terms of joint probability distributions without the use of wave functions or density matrixes is explicitly demonstrated.

abstract: Weak single-photon nonlinearities have many potential applications in quantum computing and quantum information. Here we demonstrate a relatively simple system for producing low-power cross-phase modulation using metastable xenon inside a high finesse cavity. The use of a noble gas such as xenon eliminates the contamination of the high-finesse mirrors that can occur when using alkali metal vapors such as rubidium. Cross-phase shifts of 5 mrad with 4.5 fJ control pulses were demonstrated. Numerical solutions of the master equation are in good agreement with the experimental results, and they predict that cross-phase shifts greater than 1 mrad per control photon should be achievable by reducing the size of the cavity.

abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging research field aiming to extend standard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to ensembles of sizes well below the thermodynamic limit, in non-equilibrium situations, and with the full inclusion of quantum effects. Fuelled by experimental advances and the potential of future nanoscale applications this research effort is pursued by scientists with different backgrounds, including statistical physics, many-body theory, mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory, who bring various tools and methods to the field. A multitude of theoretical questions are being addressed ranging from issues of thermalisation of quantum systems and various definitions of "work", to the efficiency and power of quantum engines. This overview provides a perspective on a selection of these current trends accessible to postgraduate students and researchers alike.

abstract: Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however, spontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative relaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous emission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a resonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the lifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or optical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first application of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small mode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission constitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is increased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity resonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled on-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin systems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and quantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work represents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of individual spins to microwave photons.

abstract: It is known that the origin of the deviations from standard thermodynamics proceed from the strong coupling to the bath. Here, it is shown that these deviations are related to the power spectrum of the bath. Specifically, it is shown that the system thermal-equilibrium-state cannot be characterized by the canonical Boltzmann's distribution in quantum mechanics. This is because the uncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total energy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath. However, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via central forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal equilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann distribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all energy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to the environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes predicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong coupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard thermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such as stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is known that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian character. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the thermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum optomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary system which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the non-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if we use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the different modes.

abstract: Any lossless transformation on $n_{s}$ spatial and $n_{p}$ internal modes of light can be described by an $n_{s}n_{p}\times n_{s}n_{p}$ unitary matrix, but there is no known procedure to effect an arbitrary $n_{s}n_{p}\times n_{s}n_{p}$ unitary matrix on light in $n_{s}$ spatial and $n_{p}$ internal modes. We devise an algorithm to realize an arbitrary discrete unitary transformation on the combined spatial and internal degrees of freedom of light. Our realization uses beamsplitters and operations on internal modes to effect arbitrary linear transformations. The number of beamsplitters required to realize a unitary transformation is reduced as compared to existing realization by a factor $n_{p}^2/2$ at the cost of increasing the number of internal optical elements by a factor of two. Our algorithm thus enables the optical implementation of higher dimensional unitary transformations.

abstract: The scalable application of quantum information science will stand on reproducible and controllable high-coherence quantum bits (qubits). In this work, we revisit the design and fabrication of the superconducting flux qubit, achieving a planar device with broad frequency tunability, strong anharmonicity, high reproducibility, and coherence times in excess of 40 us at its flux-insensitive point. Qubit relaxation times across 21 qubits of widely varying designs are consistently matched with a single model involving ohmic charge noise, quasiparticle fluctuations, resonator loss, and 1/f flux noise, a noise source previously considered primarily in the context of dephasing. We furthermore demonstrate that qubit dephasing at the flux-insensitive point is dominated by residual thermal photons in the readout resonator. The resulting photon shot noise is mitigated using a dynamical decoupling protocol, reaching T2 ~ 80 us , approximately the 2T1 limit. In addition to realizing a dramatically improved flux qubit, our results uniquely identify photon shot noise as limiting T2 in contemporary state-of-art qubits based on transverse qubit-resonator interaction.

abstract: The outcome of a weak quantum measurement conditioned to a subsequent postselection (a weak value protocol) can assume peculiar values. These results cannot be explained in terms of conditional probabilistic outcomes of projective measurements. However, a classical model has been recently put forward that can reproduce peculiar expectation values, reminiscent of weak values. This led the authors of that work to claim that weak values have an entirely classical explanation. Here we discuss what is quantum about weak values with the help of a simple model based on basic quantum mechanics. We first demonstrate how a classical theory can indeed give rise to non-trivial conditional values, and explain what features of weak values are genuinely quantum. We finally use our model to outline some main issues under current research.

abstract: We describe a practical experimental protocol for robustly characterizing the error rates of non-Clifford gates associated with dihedral groups, including gates in SU(2) associated with arbitrarily small angle rotations. Our dihedral benchmarking protocol is a generalization of randomized benchmarking that relaxes the usual unitary 2-design condition. Combining this protocol with existing randomized benchmarking schemes enables an efficient means of characterizing universal gate sets for quantum information processing in a way that is independent of state-preparation and measurement errors. In particular, our protocol enables direct benchmarking of the $T$ gate (sometime called $\pi/8$-gate) even for the gate-dependent error model that is expected in leading approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation.

By exploiting the non-signaling principle, we derive the exact relationship between the chained Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt sum of correlations CHSH_K and the success probability P_K associated with Hardy's ladder test of nonlocality for two qubits and K+1 observables per qubit. Then, by invoking the Tsirelson bound for CHSH_K, the derived relationship allows us to establish an upper limit on P_K. In addition, we draw the connection between CHSH_K and the chained version of the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality.

abstract: A canonical result about satisfiability theory is that the 2-SAT problem can be solved in linear time, despite the NP-hardness of the 3-SAT problem. In the quantum 2-SAT problem, we are given a family of 2-qubit projectors $\Pi_{ij}$ on a system of $n$ qubits, and the task is to decide whether the Hamiltonian $H=\sum \Pi_{ij}$ has a 0-eigenvalue, or it is larger than $1/n^\alpha$ for some $\alpha=O(1)$. The problem is not only a natural extension of the classical 2-SAT problem to the quantum case, but is also equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state of 2-local frustration-free Hamiltonians of spin $\frac{1}{2}$, a well-studied model believed to capture certain key properties in modern condensed matter physics. While Bravyi has shown that the quantum 2-SAT problem has a classical polynomial-time algorithm, the running time of his algorithm is $O(n^4)$. In this paper we give a classical algorithm with linear running time in the number of local projectors, therefore achieving the best possible complexity.

abstract: We consider two systems A and B that share Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering correlations and study how these correlations will decay, when each of the systems are independently coupled to a reservoir. EPR steering is a directional form of entanglement, and the measure of steering can change depending on whether the system A is steered by B, or vice versa. First, we examine the decay of the steering correlations of the two-mode squeezed state. We find that if the system B is coupled to a reservoir, then the decoherence of the steering of A by B is particularly marked, to the extent that there is a sudden death of steering after a finite time. We find a different directional effect, if the reservoirs are thermally excited. Second, we study the decoherence of the steering of a Schr\"odinger cat state, modeled as the entangled state of a spin and harmonic oscillator, when the macroscopic system (the cat) is coupled to a reservoir.

abstract: Unconditional security of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol has been proved by exploiting the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, but the practical quantum key distribution system maybe hacked by considering the imperfect state preparation and measurement respectively. Until now, different attacking schemes have been proposed by utilizing imperfect devices, but the general security analysis model against all of the practical attacking schemes has not been proposed. Here, we demonstrate that the general practical attacking schemes can be divided into the Trojan horse attack, strong randomness attack and weak randomness attack respectively. We prove security of BB84 protocol under randomness attacking models, and these results can be applied to guarantee the security of the practical quantum key distribution system.

abstract: In ordinary Quantum Mechanics only ideally instantaneous observations of a quantity or a set of compatible quantities are usually considered. In an old paper of our group in Milano a formalism was introduced for the continuous monitoring of a system during a certain interval of time in the framework of a somewhat generalized approach to Q. M. The outcome was a distribution of probability on the space of all the possible continuous histories of a set of quantities to be considered as a kind of coarse grained approximation to some ordinary quantum observables commuting or not. The main aim was the introduction of a classical level in the context of Quantum Mechanics, treating formally a set of basic quantities {\it to be considered as beables} in the sense of Bell as continuously taken under observation. However the effect of such assumption was a permanent modification of the Liouville-von Neumann equation for the statistical operator by the introduction of a dissipative term which is in conflict with basic conservation rules in all reasonable models we had considered. Difficulties were even encountered for a relativistic extension of the formalism. In this paper I propose a modified version of the original formalism which seems to overcome both difficulties. First I study the simple models of an harmonic oscillator and a free scalar field in which a coarse grain position and a coarse grained field respectively are treated as beables. Then I consider the more realistic case of Spinor Electrodynamics in which only certain coarse grained electric and magnetic fields and no matter related quantities are introduced as classical variables.

abstract: Gate operations in a quantum information processor are generally realized by tailoring specific periods of free and driven evolution of a quantum system. Unwanted environmental noise, which may in principle be distinct during these two periods, acts to decohere the system and increase the gate error rate. While there has been significant progress characterizing noise processes during free evolution, the corresponding driven-evolution case is more challenging as the noise being probed is also extant during the characterization protocol. Here we demonstrate the noise spectroscopy (0.1 - 200 MHz) of a superconducting flux qubit during driven evolution by using a robust spin-locking pulse sequence to measure relaxation (T1rho) in the rotating frame. In the case of flux noise, we resolve spectral features due to coherent fluctuators, and further identify a signature of the 1MHz defect in a time-domain spin-echo experiment. The driven-evolution noise spectroscopy complements free-evolution methods, enabling the means to characterize and distinguish various noise processes relevant for universal quantum control.

abstract: We report results important for the creation of a best-of-both-worlds quantum hybrid system consisting of a solid-state source of single photons and an atomic ensemble as quantum memory. We generate single photons from a GaAs quantum dot (QD) frequency-matched to the Rb D2-transitions and then use the Rb transitions to analyze spectrally the quantum dot photons. We demonstrate lifetime-limited QD linewidths (1.48 GHz) with both resonant and non-resonant excitation. The QD resonance fluorescence in the low power regime is dominated by Rayleigh scattering, a route to match quantum dot and Rb atom linewidths and to shape the temporal wave packet of the QD photons. Noise in the solid-state environment is relatively benign: there is a blinking of the resonance fluorescence at MHz rates but negligible upper state dephasing of the QD transition. We therefore establish a close-to-ideal solid-state source of single photons at a key wavelength for quantum technologies.

abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) considered two particles in an entangled state of motion to illustrate why they questioned the completeness of quantum theory. In the past decades, microscopic systems with entanglement in various degrees of freedom have successfully been generated, representing compelling evidence to support the completeness of quantum theory. Today, the generation of an EPR-entangled state of motion of two massive objects of up to the kilogram-scale seems feasible with state-of-the-art technology. Recently, the generation and verification of EPR-entangled mirror motion in interferometric gravitational wave detectors was proposed, with the aim of testing quantum theory in the regime of macroscopic objects, and to make available nonclassical probe systems for future tests of modified quantum theories that include (non-relativistic) gravity. The work presented here builds on these earlier results and proposes a specific Michelson interferometer that includes two high-quality laser mirrors of about 0.1 kg mass each. The mirrors are individually suspended as pendula and located close to each other, and cooled to about 4 K. The physical concepts for the generation of the EPR-entangled centre of mass motion of these two mirrors are described. Apart from a test of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic world, the setup is envisioned to test predictions of yet-to-be-elaborated modified quantum theories that include gravitational effects.

abstract: Improving the understanding of strongly correlated quantum many body systems such as gases of interacting atoms or electrons is one of the most important challenges in modern condensed matter physics, materials research and chemistry. Enormous progress has been made in the past decades in developing both classical and quantum approaches to calculate, simulate and experimentally probe the properties of such systems. In this work we use a combination of classical and quantum methods to experimentally explore the properties of an interacting quantum gas by creating experimental realizations of continuous matrix product states - a class of states which has proven extremely powerful as a variational ansatz for numerical simulations. By systematically preparing and probing these states using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system we experimentally determine a good approximation to the ground-state wave function of the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, which describes an interacting Bose gas in one dimension. Since the simulated Hamiltonian is encoded in the measurement observable rather than the controlled quantum system, this approach has the potential to apply to exotic models involving multicomponent interacting fields. Our findings also hint at the possibility of experimentally exploring general properties of matrix product states and entanglement theory. The scheme presented here is applicable to a broad range of systems exploiting strong and tunable light-matter interactions.

abstract: The one clean qubit model of quantum computation (DQC1) efficiently implements a computational task that is not known to have a classical alternative. During the computation, there is never more than a small but finite amount of entanglement present, and it is typically vanishingly small in the system size. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is nothing unexpected hidden within the DQC1 model -- Grover's Search, when acting on a mixed state, provably exhibits a speed-up over classical with guarantees as to the presence of only vanishingly small amounts of quantum correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) -- while arguing that this is not an artefact of the oracle-based construction. We also present some important refinements in the evaluation of how much entanglement may be present in DQC1, and how the typical entanglement of the system must be evaluated.

abstract: The relation between the geometry of refrigeration cycles and their performance is explored. The model studied is based on a coupled spin system. Small cycle times termed sudden refrigerators, develop coherence and inner friction. We explore the interplay between coherence and energy of the working medium employing a family of sudden cycles with decreasing cycle times. At the point of minimum ratio between energy and coherence the cycle changes geometry. This region of cycle times is characterised by short circuit cycles where heat is dissipated both to the hot and cold baths. We rationalise the cycle change of geometry as a result of a half integer quantisation which maximises coherence. From this point on, increasing or decreasing the cycle time, eventually leads to refrigeration cycles. The transition point between refrigerators and short circuit cycles is characterised by a transition from ?finite to singular dynamical temperature. Extremely short cycle times reach a universal limit where all cycles types are equivalent.

abstract: We study the bipartite entanglement per bond to determine characteristic features of the phase diagram of various quantum spin models in different spatial dimensions. The bipartite entanglement is obtained from a tensor network representation of the ground state wave-function. Three spin-1/2 models (Ising, XY, XXZ, all in a transverse field) are investigated. Imaginary-time evolution (TEBD in 1D, `simple update' in 2D and 3D) is used to determine the ground states of these models. The phase structure of the models is discussed for all three dimensions.

abstract: We present experiments on the driven dynamics of a two-level superconducting artificial atom. The driving strength reaches 4.78 GHz, significantly exceeding the transition frequency of 2.288 GHz. The observed dynamics is described in terms of quasienergies and quasienergy states, in agreement with Floquet theory. In addition, we observe the role of pulse shaping in the dynamics, as determined by non-adiabatic transitions between Floquet states, and we implement subnanosecond single-qubit operations. These results pave the way to quantum control using strong driving with applications in quantum technologies.

abstract: In this work we investigate the issue of integrability in a classical model for noninteracting fermionic fields. This model is constructed via classical-quantum correspondence obtained from the semiclassical treatment of the quantum system. Our main finding is that the classical system, contrary to the quantum system, is not integrablein general. Regarding this contrast it is clear that in general classical models for fermionic quantum systems have to be handled with care. Further numerical investigation of the system showed that there may be islands of stability in the phase space. We also investigated a similar model that is used in theoretical chemistry and found this one to be most probably integrable, although also here the integrability is not assured by the quantum-classical correspondence principle.

abstract: We analyse the operation principles and performance bounds of quantum engines whose working fluid (WF) is energised by a non-thermal bath. We show that such a bath (e.g., a squeezed or coherently displaced thermal bath) can render the WF state non-passive, i.e., capable of storing and delivering work. This non-passivity converts the heat engine into a thermo-mechanical machine that is powered by mechanical work, as well as heat, from the non-thermal bath. Its efficiency is unrestricted by the Carnot bound, which only applies to heat engines. By contrast, for certain WF--bath interactions and non-thermal bath states the WF thermalises. The machine then operates as a heat engine, but its Carnot bound may correspond to a higher temperature than its thermal-bath counterpart.

abstract: Open Fabry-Perot microcavities represent a promising route for achieving a quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) platform with diamond-based emitters. In particular, they offer the opportunity to introduce high purity, minimally fabricated material into a tunable, high quality factor optical resonator. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-based microcavity incorporating a thick (> 10 {\mu}m) diamond membrane with a finesse of 17,000, corresponding to a quality factor Q ~ $10^6$. Such minimally fabricated, thick samples can contain optically stable emitters similar to those found in bulk diamond. We observe modified microcavity spectra in the presence of the membrane, and develop analytic and numerical models to describe the effect of the membrane on cavity modes, including loss and coupling to higher-order transverse modes. We estimate that a Purcell enhancement of approximately 20 should be possible for emitters within the diamond in this device, and provide evidence that better diamond surface treatments and mirror coatings could increase this value to 200 in a realistic system.

abstract: Pattern formation of atoms in high-finesse optical resonators results from the mechanical forces of light associated with superradiant scattering into the cavity mode. It occurs when the laser intensity exceeds a threshold value, such that the pumping processes counteract the losses. We consider atoms driven by a laser and coupling with a mode of a standing-wave cavity and describe their dynamics with a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the atomic motion is semiclassical but the cavity field is a full quantum variable. The asymptotic state of the atoms is a thermal state, whose temperature is solely controlled by the detuning between the laser and the cavity frequency and by the cavity loss rate. From this result we derive the free energy and show that in the thermodynamic limit selforganization is a second-order phase transition. The order parameter is the field inside the resonator, to which one can associate a magnetization in analogy to ferromagnetism, the control field is the laser intensity, however the steady state is intrinsically out-of-equilibrium. In the symmetry-broken phase quantum noise induces jumps of the spatial density between two ordered patterns: We characterize the statistical properties of this temporal behaviour at steady state and show that the thermodynamic properties of the system can be extracted by detecting the light at the cavity output. The results of our analysis are in full agreement with previous studies, extend them by deriving a self-consistent theory which is valid also when the cavity field is in the shot-noise limit, and elucidate the nature of the selforganization transition.

abstract: We consider the problem of testing multiple quantum hypotheses $\{\rho_1^{\otimes n},\ldots,\rho_r^{\otimes n}\}$, where an arbitrary prior distribution is given and each of the $r$ hypotheses is $n$ copies of a quantum state. It is known that the average error probability $P_e$ decays exponentially to zero, that is, $P_e\thicksim\exp(-\xi n)$. However, this error exponent $\xi$ is generally unknown, except for the case that $r=2$. In this paper, we solve the long-standing open problem of identifying the above error exponent, by proving Nussbaum and Szko\l a's conjecture that $\xi=\min_{i\neq j}C(\rho_i,\rho_j)$. The right-hand side of this equality is called the multiple quantum Chernoff distance, and $C(\rho_i,\rho_j):=\max_{0\leq s\leq 1}\{-\log\operatorname{Tr}\rho_i^s\rho_j^{1-s}\}$ has been previously identified as the optimal error exponent for testing two hypotheses, $\rho_i^{\otimes n}$ versus $\rho_j^{\otimes n}$. The main ingredient of our proof is a new upper bound for the average error probability, for testing an ensemble of finite-dimensional, but otherwise general, quantum states. This upper bound, up to a states-dependent factor, matches the multiple-state generalization of Nussbaum and Szko\l a's lower bound. Specialized to the case $r=2$, we give an alternative proof to the achievability of the binary-hypothesis Chernoff distance, which was originally proved by Audenaert et al.

abstract: A critical ingredient for realizing large-scale quantum information processors will be the ability to make economical use of qubit control hardware. We demonstrate an extensible strategy for reusing control hardware on same-frequency transmon qubits in a circuit QED chip with surface-code-compatible connectivity. A vector switch matrix enables selective broadcasting of input pulses to multiple transmons with individual tailoring of pulse quadratures for each, as required to minimize the effects of leakage on weakly anharmonic qubits. Using randomized benchmarking, we compare multiple broadcasting strategies that each pass the surface-code error threshold for single-qubit gates. In particular, we introduce a selective-broadcasting control strategy using five pulse primitives, which allows independent, simultaneous Clifford gates on arbitrary numbers of qubits.

abstract: The initial state of a system-bath composite is needed as the input for prediction from any quantum evolution equation to describe, for example, the noise on the system from joint evolution of the system-bath interaction dynamics. The conventional wisdom is to simply write down an uncorrelated state as if the system and bath were prepared in the absence of each other; or one uses a symbolic system-bath state, allowing for possible arbitrary correlations--quantum or classical--between the system and the bath, but the latter approach lacks predictive power unless one can say something about that symbolic state. Here, we show how one uses ideas from quantum tomography or state estimation to deduce an initial system-bath state consistent with the available information. In typical experimentally relevant situations, such a state turns out to be uncorrelated or almost uncorrelated between the system and the bath. This has implications on the subject of subsequent non-Markovian or non-completely-positive dynamics of the system, where the non-complete-positivity stems from initial nontrivial correlations between the system and the bath. Deviation from predictions based on such an almost uncorrelated state can be indicative of accidental control of hidden degrees of freedom in the bath.

abstract: Stopping light via an electromagnetically induced transparency setup for x-ray pulses in a thin film planar x-ray cavity is investigated theoretically. The pulse is nearly resonant to the 14.4 keV M\"ossbauer transition in $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$, with one nm-thin layer of the latter embedded in the thin-film x-ray cavity. Via a moderate hyperfine magnetic field which takes over the role of the control field, electromagnetically induced transparency and slowing down of the x-ray pulse occurs in the cavity setup. We show that by switching off the control magnetic field, a narrowband x-ray pulse can be completely stored in the cavity for approx. hundred ns. Coherent storage occurs in this scenario by imprinting the x-ray field onto nuclear coherences in a controllable and robust manner. Additional manipulation of the external magnetic field can lead to both group velocity and phase control of the pulse in the x-ray cavity sample.

Here we envisage for the first time an optomechanical system that bridges optical photons and x-rays with the aim to control the latter and exploit their unique properties regarding large momentum transfer, focusability, penetration, robustness and detection efficiency. The x-ray-optical interface system comprises of an optomechanical cavity and a movable microlever interacting with both an optical laser and with x-rays via resonant nuclear scattering. We develop a theoretical model for this system and show that x-ray absorption spectra of nuclei can be tuned optomechanically. In particular, our theoretical simulations predict optomechanically induced transparency of x-rays.

abstract: We consider retarded settings in the context of a Bell-type experiment. The retarded setting is defined as the value the setting would have taken were it not for some external intervention (for example, by a human). We derive retarded Bell inequalities that explicitly take into account the retarded settings. These inequalities are not violated by Quantum Theory (or any other theory) when the retarded settings are equal to the actual settings. We construct a simple model that reproduces Quantum Theory when the retarded and actual settings are equal, but violates it when they are not. We discuss using humans to choose the settings in this type of experiment and the implications of a violation of Quantum Theory (in agreement with the retarded Bell inequalities) in this context.

abstract: Coherent control of quantum systems has far-reaching implications in quantum engineering. In this context, coherent population trapping (CPT) involving dark resonances has played a prominent role, leading to a wealth of major applications including laser cooling of atoms and molecules, optical magnetometry, light storage and highly precise atomic clocks. Extending CPT methods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in cryogenic environments for electron spin impurities and superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrate efficient CPT of a single nuclear spin in a room temperature solid. To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a $\Lambda$-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin states addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a relaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by spontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally controlled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from consecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin $\Lambda$-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us (i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state and (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of dark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences. This work offers new prospects for quantum state preparation, information storage in hybrid quantum systems and metrology.

abstract: The existence of higher order entanglement in the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes is established using the perturbative solutions of the Heisenberg equations of motion for various field modes that are obtained using the Sen-Mandal technique and a fully quantum mechanical Hamiltonian that describes the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes. Specifically, the perturbative Sen-Mandal solutions are exploited here to show the signature of the higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement. In some special cases, we have also observed higher order entanglement in the partially spontaneous Raman processes. Further, it is shown that the depth of the nonclassicality indicators (parameters) can be manipulated by the specific choice of coupling constants, and it is observed that the depth of nonclassicality parameters increases with the order.

abstract: Direct detection of vacuum fluctuations and analysis of sub-cycle quantum properties of the electric field are explored by a paraxial quantum theory of ultrafast electro-optic sampling. The feasibility of such experiments is demonstrated by realistic calculations adopting a thin ZnTe electro-optic crystal and stable few-femtosecond laser pulses. We show that nonlinear mixing of a short near-infrared probe pulse with multi-terahertz vacuum field modes leads to an increase of the signal variance with respect to the shot noise level. The vacuum contribution increases significantly for appropriate length of the nonlinear crystal, short probe pulse durations, tight focusing, and sufficiently large number of photons per probe pulse. If the vacuum input is squeezed, the signal variance depends on the probe delay. Temporal positions with noise level below the pure vacuum may be traced with a sub-cycle accuracy.

abstract: High contrast matter-wave interferometry is essential in various fundamental quantum mechanical experiments as well as for technical applications. Thereby, contrast and sensitivity are typically reduced by decoherence and dephasing effects. While decoherence accounts for a general loss of quantum information in a system due to entanglement with the environment, dephasing is due to collective time-dependent external phase shifts, which can be related to temperature drifts, mechanical vibrations or electromagnetic oscillations. In contrast to decoherence, dephasing can in principle be reversed. Here, we demonstrate in experiment and theory a method for the analysis and reduction of the influence of dephasing noise and perturbations consisting of several external frequencies in an electron interferometer. This technique uses the high spatial and temporal resolution of a delay line detector to reveal and remove dephasing perturbations by second order correlation analysis. It allows matter-wave experiments under perturbingly lab conditions and can be applied in principle to electron, atom, ion, neutron and molecule interferometers.

abstract: The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool for quantum many-body effects is explored. It is demonstrated that an array of electrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the Bose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon regime to the Anderson tight-binding model. Employing a density matrix formalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the interplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization process. It is found that the phonon population remains localized for low enough temperatures even if the total population of excitations is lost from the array due to dissipative effects; with increasing temperatures the localization is lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing in the steady regime a fully thermalized system. Finally, we consider a possible experimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a superconducting qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators. We also consider the possibility of using the proposed quantum simulator for realizing continuous-time quantum walks.

abstract: We show that the Natanzon family of potentials is necessarily dropped into a restricted set of distinct potentials involving a fewer number of independent parameters if the potential term in the Schr\"odinger equation is proportional to an energy-independent parameter and if the potential shape is independent of both energy and that parameter. In the hypergeometric case only six such potentials exist, all five-parametric. Among these, only two (Eckart, P\"oschl-Teller) are independent in the sense that each cannot be derived from the other by specifications of the involved parameters. Discussing the solvability of the Schr\"odinger equation in terms of the single-confluent Heun functions, we show that in this case there exist in total fifteen seven-parametric potentials, of which independent are nine. Six of the inde-pendent potentials present different generalizations of the hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric ones, while three others do not possess hypergeometric sub-potentials. The result for the double- and bi-confluent Heun equations produces the three independent double- and five independent bi-confluent six-parametric Lamieux-Bose potentials, and the general five-parametric quartic oscillator potential for the tri-confluent Heun equation.

abstract: We propose and analyze a new approach to the coherent control and manipulation of quantum degrees of freedom in disordered, interacting systems in the many-body localized phase. Our approach leverages a number of unique features of many-body localization: a lack of thermalization, a locally gapped spectrum, and slow dephasing. Using the technique of quantum phase estimation, we demonstrate a protocol that enables the local preparation of a many-body system into an effective eigenstate. This leads to the ability to encode information and control interactions without full microscopic knowledge of the underlying Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the effects of weak coupling to an external bath and provide an estimate for the fidelity of our protocol.

abstract: In thermal phases, the quantum coherence of individual degrees of freedom is rapidly lost to the environment. Many-body localized (MBL) phases limit the spread of this coherence and appear promising for quantum information applications. However, such applications require not just long coherence times but also a means to transport and manipulate information. We demonstrate that this can be done in a one dimensional model of interacting spins at infinite temperature. Our protocol utilizes protected qubits which emerge at the boundary between topological and trivial phases. State transfer occurs via dynamic shifts of this boundary and is shown to preserve quantum information. As an example, we discuss the implementation of a universal, two-qubit gate based upon MBL-protected quantum state transfer.

abstract: We study a non-Hermitian version of the Rabi model, where a two-level system is periodically driven with an imaginary-valued drive strength, leading to alternating gain and loss. In the Floquet picture, the model exhibits PT symmetry, which can be broken when the drive is sufficiently strong. We derive the boundaries of the PT phase diagram for the different resonances by doing perturbation theory beyond the rotating-wave approximation. For the main resonance, we show that the non-Hermitian analog of the Bloch-Siegert shift corresponds to maximal PT-breaking. For the higher-order resonances, we capture the boundaries to lowest order. We also solve the regime of high frequency by mapping to the Wannier-Stark ladder. Our model can be experimentally realized in waveguides with spatially-modulated loss or in atoms with time-modulated spontaneous decay.

abstract: We study the convergence of states under continuous-time depolarizing channels with full rank fixed points in terms of the relative entropy. The optimal exponent of an upper bound on the relative entropy in this case is given by the log-Sobolev-1 constant. Our main result is the computation of this constant. As an application we use the log-Sobolev-1 constant of the depolarizing channels to improve the concavity inequality of the von-Neumann entropy. This result is compared to similar bounds obtained recently by Kim et al. and we show a version of Pinsker's inequality, which is optimal and tight if we fix the second argument of the relative entropy. Finally, we consider the log-Sobolev-1 constant of tensor-powers of the completely depolarizing channel and use a quantum version of Shearer's inequality to prove a uniform lower bound.

abstract: When a system thermalizes it loses all local memory of its initial conditions. This is a general feature of open systems and is well described by equilibrium statistical mechanics. Even within a closed (or reversible) quantum system, where unitary time evolution retains all information about its initial state, subsystems can still thermalize using the rest of the system as an effective heat bath. Exceptions to quantum thermalization have been predicted and observed, but typically require inherent symmetries or noninteracting particles in the presence of static disorder. The prediction of many-body localization (MBL), in which disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize in spite of strong interactions and high excitation energy, was therefore surprising and has attracted considerable theoretical attention. Here we experimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with long-range interactions and programmably random disorder to ten spins initialized far from equilibrium. We observe the essential signatures of MBL: memory retention of the initial state, a Poissonian distribution of energy level spacings, and entanglement growth in the system at long times. Our platform can be scaled to higher numbers of spins, where detailed modeling of MBL becomes impossible due to the complexity of representing such entangled quantum states. Moreover, the high degree of control in our experiment may guide the use of MBL states as potential quantum memories in naturally disordered quantum systems.

abstract: A system of $N_a$ atoms of $n$-levels interacting dipolarly with $\ell$ modes of electromagnetic field is considered. The energy surface of the system is constructed from the direct product of the coherent states of U$(n)$ in the totally symmetric representation for the matter times the $\ell$ coherent states of the electromagnetic field. A variational analysis shows that the collective region is divided into $\ell$ zones, inside each of which only one mode of the electromagnetic field contributes to the ground state. In consequence, the polychromatic phase diagram for the ground state naturally divides itself into monochromatic regions. For the case of $3$-level atoms in the $\Xi$-configuration in the presence of $2$ modes, the variational calculation is compared with the exact quantum solution showing that both are in agreement.

abstract: Semiquantum key distribution allows a quantum party to share a random key with a "classical" party who only can prepare and measure qubits in the computational basis, or reorder some qubits. In this work, we present a protocol where a secret key can be established between a quantum user and a really classical user who almost has no quantum requirements except accessing quantum channels, by securely delegating quantum computation to a quantum server. We show the proposed protocol is secure even when the delegated quantum server is a powerful adversary, and is experimentally feasible with current technology. As one party of our protocol is the most quantum-resource efficient, it can significantly widen the applicability scope of quantum key distribution.

We show how interspecies coupling can be used for high fidelity quantum non demolition state measurements with low crosstalk in qubit arrays.

We apply our theory to the (one-dimensional) Anderson model.

abstract: Quantum annealing has recently been used to determine the Ramsey numbers R(m,2) for 3 < m < 9 and R(3,3) [Bian et al. (2013) PRL 111, 130505]. This was greatly celebrated as the largest experimental implementation of an adiabatic evolution algorithm to that date. However, in that computation, more than 66% of the qubits used were auxiliary qubits, so the sizes of the Ramsey number Hamiltonians used were tremendously smaller than the full 128-qubit capacity of the device used. The reason these auxiliary qubits were needed was because the best quantum annealing devices at the time (and still now) cannot implement multi-qubit interactions beyond 2-qubit interactions, and they are also limited in their capacity for 2-qubit interactions. We present a method which allows the full qubit capacity of a quantum annealing device to be used, by reducing multi-qubit and 2-qubit interactions. With our method, the device used in the 2013 Ramsey number quantum computation could have determined R(16,2) and R(4,3) with under 10 minutes of runtime.

abstract: A scheme is proposed to entangle two systems that have not interacted by using an ancillary particle in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, by making a suitable post--selection of the particle followed by a conditional feedback on one of the subsystems to be entangled. For a strong interaction, the process works deterministically. For a weaker interaction only the probability of success is reduced, but the output continues to be a maximally entangled state.

abstract: A local excitation in a quantum many-spin system evolves deterministically. A time-reversal procedure, involving the inversion of the signs of every energy and interaction, should produce the excitation revival. This idea, experimentally coined in NMR, embodies the concept of the Loschmidt echo (LE). While such an implementation involves a single spin autocorrelation $M_{1,1}$, i.e. a local LE, theoretical efforts have focused on the study of the recovery probability of a complete many-body state, referred here as global or many-body LE $M_{MB}$. Here, we analyze the relation between these magnitudes, in what concerns to their characteristic time scales and their dependence on the number of spins $N$. We show that the global LE can be understood, to some extent, as the simultaneous occurrence of $N$ independent local LEs, i.e. $M_{MB}\sim \left( M_{1,1}\right) ^{N/4}$. This extensive hypothesis is exact for very short times and confirmed numerically beyond such a regime. Furthermore, we discuss a general picture of the decay of $M_{1,1}$ as a consequence of the interplay between the time scale that characterizes the reversible interactions ($T_{2}$) and that of the perturbation ($\tau _{\Sigma }$). Our analysis suggests that the short time decay, characterized by the time scale $\tau _{\Sigma }$, is greatly enhanced by the complex processes that occur beyond $T_{2}$ . This would ultimately lead to the experimentally observed $T_{3},$ which was found to be roughly independent of $\tau _{\Sigma }$ but closely tied to $T_{2}$.

abstract: The Boolean constraint satisfaction problem 3-SAT is arguably the canonical NP-complete problem. In contrast, 2-SAT can not only be decided in polynomial time, but in fact in deterministic linear time. In 2006, Bravyi proposed a physically motivated generalization of k-SAT to the quantum setting, defining the problem "quantum k-SAT". He showed that quantum 2-SAT is also solvable in polynomial time on a classical computer, in particular in deterministic time O(n^4), assuming unit-cost arithmetic over a field extension of the rational numbers, where n is number of variables. In this paper, we present an algorithm for quantum 2-SAT which runs in linear time, i.e. deterministic time O(n+m) for n and m the number of variables and clauses, respectively. Our approach exploits the transfer matrix techniques of Laumann et al. [QIC, 2010] used in the study of phase transitions for random quantum 2-SAT, and bears similarities with both the linear time 2-SAT algorithms of Even, Itai, and Shamir (based on backtracking) [SICOMP, 1976] and Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan (based on strongly connected components) [IPL, 1979].

abstract: Instances of discrete quantum systems coupled to a continuum of oscillators are ubiquitous in physics. Often the continua are approximated by a discrete set of modes. We derive analytical error bounds on expectation values of system observables that have been time evolved under such discretised Hamiltonians. These bounds take on the form of a function of time and the number of discrete modes, where the discrete modes are chosen according to Gauss quadrature rules. The derivation makes use of tools from the field of Lieb-Robinson bounds and the theory of orthonormal polynominals.

abstract: Generalizations of the classic Bell inequality to higher dimensional quantum systems known as qudits are reputed to exhibit a higher degree of robustness to noise, but such claims are based on one particular noise model. We analyze the violation of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality subject to more realistic noise sources and their scaling with dimension. This analysis is inspired by potential Bell inequality experiments with superconducting resonator-based qudits. We find that the robustness of the inequality to noise generally decreases with increasing qudit dimension.

abstract: The vibrational motion equations of both homo and hetero-nuclei diatomic molecules are here derived for the first time. A diatomic molecule is first considered as a one dimensional quantum mechanics oscillator. The second and third-order Hamiltonian operators are then formed by substituting the number operator for the quantum number in the corresponding vibrational energy eigenvalues. The expectation values of relative position and linear momentum operators of two oscillating atoms are calculated by solving Heisenbergs equations of motion. Subsequently, the expectation values of potential and kinetics energy operators are evaluated in all different vibrational levels of Morse potential. On the other hand, the stability theory of optical oscillators (lasers) is exploited to determine the stability conditions of an oscillating diatomic molecule.It is peculiarly turned out that the diatomic molecules are exactly dissociated at the energy level in which their equations of motion become unstable. We also determine the minimum oscillation frequency (cut-off frequency) of a diatomic molecule at the dissociation level of Morse potential. At the end, the energy conservation is illustrated for the vibrational motion of a diatomic molecule.

abstract: We study the low energy spectrum of parent Hamiltonians of injective Matrix Product States in a particular long range and system size limit. We show that in this limit a natural first quantization arises. This allows us to compute a specific type of low energy spectrum. This spectrum depends solely on the properties of a quantum channel, i.e. transfer matrix of the ground state, and not on any other details of the ground-state. In the case of normal quantum channels, more refined predictions on the low energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian can be made. The emergence of bound states can be predicted simply by looking at the relative distance between the spectrum of the channel and the boundary of the unit circle, and the breakdown of the absolute ordering of the eigenvalues.

Several BQC protocols have been proposed, e.g., Li et al. in [1] proposed a triple-server BQC protocol and Xu et al. in [2] proposed a single-server BQC protocol. Though both papers claimed that their protocols can satisfy the requirement of privacy, this paper points out a security loophole in their protocols. With that the server can reveal the private information of the client.

abstract: We give an analytic construction of a class of two-qubit gate pulse sequences that act on five of the six spin-$\frac12$ particles used to encode a pair of exchange-only three-spin qubits. Within this class, the problem of gate construction reduces to that of finding a smaller sequence that acts on four spins and is subject to a simple constraint. The optimal sequence satisfying this constraint yields a two-qubit gate sequence equivalent to that found numerically by Fong and Wandzura. Our construction is sufficiently simple that it can be carried out entirely with pen, paper, and knowledge of a few basic facts about quantum spin. We thereby analytically derive the Fong-Wandzura sequence that has so far escaped intuitive explanation.

abstract: The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by the coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states in one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin parameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with quasi-energy $E=0,\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different boundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary conditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be computed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes are provided.

abstract: We propose the square of convex-roof extended negativity(SCREN) as a powerful candidate to characterize strong monogamy of multi-party quantum entanglement. We first provide a strong monogamy inequality of multi-party entanglement using SCREN, and show that the tangle-based multi-qubit strong monogamy inequality can be rephrased by SCREN. We further show that SCREN strong monogamy inequality is still true for the counterexamples that violate tangle-based strong monogamy inequality in higher-dimensional quantum systems rather than qubits. We also analytically show that SCREN strong monogamy inequality is true for a large class of multi-qudit states, a superposition of multi-qudit generalized W-class states and vacuums. Thus SCREN is a good alternative to characterize the strong monogamy of entanglement even in multi-qudit systems.

abstract: Quantum walks with memory are a type of modified quantum walk that records the walker's latest path. In this work, we show that a quantum walk with memory on a digraph can be transformed as a quantum walk without memory on the line digraph of the original one. With this correspondence, we construct a model which includes all possible standard quantum walks with memory on regular graphs. This construction would help us to study quantum walks with memory and also help in corresponding experiments. Based on this model, by taking the straight line as example, we study the general properties of quantum walks with memory, such as variance, occupancy rate and localization. Interestingly, we find that a quantum walk with memory can produce the same probability distribution as that of a standard quantum walk whose initial spin state is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|0\rangle_p(|1\rangle_c+i|-1\rangle_c)$.

abstract: The ontological model framework provides a rigorous approach to address the question of whether the quantum state is ontic or epistemic. When considering only conventional projective measurements, auxiliary assumptions are always needed to prove the reality of the quantum state in the framework. For example, the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem is based on an additional preparation independence assumption. In this paper, we give a new proof of psi-ontology in terms of protective measurements in the ontological model framework. The proof does not rely on auxiliary assumptions, and also applies to deterministic theories such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory. In addition, we give a simpler argument for psi-ontology beyond the framework, which is only based on protective measurements and a weaker criterion of reality. The argument may be also appealing for those people who favor an anti-realist view of quantum mechanics.

abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss in some detail the two different quantum schemes for duopoly problems. We investigate under what conditions one of the schemes is more reasonable that the other one. Using the Cournot's duopoly example we show that the current quantum schemes require a slight refinement so that they output the classical game in a particular case. Then we show how the amendment changes the way of studying the quantum games with respect to Nash equilibria. Finally, we define another scheme for the Cournot's duopoly in terms of quantum computation.

abstract: Quantum memory is an essential building block for quantum communication and scalable linear quantum computation. Storing two color entangled photons, with one photon being in telecomband while the other photon being compatible of quantum memory, has great advantages toward the realization of long distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters. Here, we report an experimental realization of storing a photon entangled with a flying telecomband photon in polarization as a spin wave, thus establishing entanglement between the telecomband photon and the atomic-ensemble memory in polarization degree of freedom. The reconstructed density matrix and the violation of Clauser Horne Shimony Holt inequality show the preservation of quantum entanglement during storage. Our result is very promising for establishing a long distance quantum network based on cold atomic ensembles.

abstract: Blind quantum computation (BQC) enables a client without enough quantum power to delegate his quantum computation to a quantum server, while keeping the input data, the algorithm and the result unknown to the server. In the studies of practical BQC protocol, an important problem is how to reduce the quantum requirement of the client. Multi-server BQC protocols have been proposed to solve this problem. We review the double-server and triple-server protocols [Li et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 040302(R) (2014)], and propose a modified double-server BQC protocol with a trusted center. In our protocol, the servers are allowed to communicate mutually, and the client is completely classical. Furthermore, our double-server protocol can be modified into a single-server protocol by simply combining the two servers. Compared with the triple-server protocol, our double-server and single-server protocols are more simple and the client is not required to have the ability to access quantum channel. So our protocols are more practical when quantum computer is applied in the `cloud' model.

abstract: We propose to use a cryogenic nonlinear resonator for the projective readout, classical memory, and feedback for a superconducting qubit. This approach sidesteps many of the inefficiencies inherent in two-way communication between temperature stages in typical systems with room temperature controllers, and avoids increasing the cryogenic heat load. This controller may find a broad range of uses in multi-qubit systems, but here we analyze two specific demonstrative cases in single qubit-control. In the first case, the nonlinear controller is used to initialize the qubit in a definite eigenstate. And in the second case, the qubit's state is read into the controller's classical memory, where it is stored for an indefinite period of time, and then used to reinstate the measured state after the qubit has decayed. We analyze the properties of this system and we show simulations of the time evolution for the full system dynamics.

abstract: Quantum superposition is central to quantum theory but challenges our concepts of reality and spacetime when applied to macroscopic objects like Schr\"odinger's cat. For that reason, it has been a long-standing question whether quantum physics remains valid unmodified even for truly macroscopic objects. By now, the predictions of quantum theory have been confirmed via matter-wave interferometry for massive objects up to $10^4\,$ atomic mass units (amu). The rapid development of new technologies promises to soon allow tests of quantum theory for significantly higher test masses by using novel techniques of quantum optomechanics and high-mass matter-wave interferometry. Such experiments may yield novel insights into the foundations of quantum theory, pose stringent limits on alternative theoretical models or even uncover deviations from quantum physics. However, performing experiments of this type on Earth may soon face principal limitations due to requirements of long times of flight, ultra-low vibrations, and extremely high vacuum. Here, we present a short overview of recent developments towards the implementation of the proposed space-mission MAQRO, which promises to overcome those limitations and to perform matter-wave interferometry in a parameter regime orders of magnitude beyond state-of-the-art.

abstract: Standard quantum state reconstruction techniques indicate that a detection efficiency of $0.5$ is an absolute threshold below which quantum interferences cannot be measured. However, alternative statistical techniques suggest that this threshold can be overcome at the price of increasing the statistics used for the reconstruction. In the following we present numerical experiments proving that quantum interferences can be measured even with a detection efficiency smaller than $0.5$. At the same time we provide a guideline for handling the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states based on homodyne data collected by low efficiency detectors.

abstract: We give a systematic derivation of the semiclassical limit of the motion of a charged particle in the presence of an infinitely long and infinitesimally thin solenoid carrying magnetic flux. We show how the naive picture of Aharonov-Bohm interference of two half-waves acquiring Dirac's magnetic phase when passing on either side of the solenoid emerges from the quantum propagator, and that the typical scale of the resulting interference pattern is fully determined by the ratio of the angular part of Hamilton's principal function to Planck's constant. Gutzwiller's semiclassical propagator is recovered in the limit when this ratio diverges.

abstract: In a variant of communication complexity tasks, two or more separated parties cooperate to compute a function of their local data, using a limited amount of communication. It is known that communication of quantum systems and shared entanglement can increase the probability for the parties to arrive at the correct value of the function, compared to classical resources. Here we show that quantum superpositions of the direction of communication between parties can also serve as a resource to improve the probability of success. We present a tripartite task for which such a superposition provides an advantage compared to the case where the parties communicate in a fixed order. In a more general context, our result also provides the first semi-device-independent certification of the absence of a definite order of communication.

abstract: We propose a fruitful scheme for exploring multiphoton entangled states based on linear optics and weak nonlinearities. Compared with the previous schemes the present method is more feasible because there are only small phase shifts instead of a series of related functions of photon numbers in the process of interaction with Kerr nonlinearities. In the absence of decoherence we analyze the error probabilities induced by homodyne measurement and show that the maximal error probability can be made small enough even when the number of photons is large. This implies that the present scheme is quite tractable and it is possible to produce entangled states involving a large number of photons.

abstract: We consider the problem of determining the energy distribution of a product state, with respect to a local hamiltonian in one dimensional quantum lattice. For a one dimensional lattice with $n$ sites and a $2$-local hamiltonian defined on it, we show that the overlap of a product state (with average energy $f$) with the eigenspace of energy $g$ is less that $e^{-(g-f)^2/120n}$, as long as $|g-f|>245n^{1/2}$. This can be viewed as an extension of Chernoff bound to quantum setting.

abstract: In this paper, we study the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol, which allows a client to perform quantum computation on a remote quantum server and the Remote Blind qubit tate Preparation (RBSP) protocol which allows the client to prepare single qubits on the server's location with week coherent pulses. This RBSP protocol is inefficient for small $ T $, because the required number of pulses for generating one single qubit scales as $ \mbox{O}(1/T^4) $, where $ T $ is the transmittance of the quantum channe between the client and the server. Our contribution in this paper is a modified RBSP protocol with decoy states. This new protocol allows us to generate $ S $ single qubits simultaneously in a single instance. With our new rotocol, we are able to reduce the number of weak coherent pulses required for generating one single qubit from $ \mbox{O}(1/T^4) $ to nearly $ \mbox{O}(1/T) $, significantly increasing the efficiency. For a 100 km standard telecom fiber of loss 0.2 dB/km, our method gives a six orders of magnitude improvement in the speed, which is very significant.

abstract: The energies of Andreev bound states (ABS) forming in a $N$-terminal junction are affected by $N - 1$ independent macroscopic phase differences between superconducting leads and can be regarded as energy bands in $N - 1$ periodic solid owing to the $2\pi$ periodicity in all phases. We investigate the singularities and peculiarities of the resulting ABS spectrum combining phenomenological and analytical methods and illustrating with the numerical results. We pay special attention on spin-orbit (SO) effects. We consider Weyl singularities with a conical spectrum that are situated at zero energy in the absence of SO interaction. We show that the SO interaction splits the spectrum in spin like a Zeeman field would do. The singularity is preserved while departed from zero energy. With SO interaction, points of zero-energy form an $N - 2$ dimensional manifold in $N - 1$ dimensional space of phases, while this dimension is $N - 3$ in the absence of SO interaction. The singularities of other type are situated near the superconducting gap edge. In the absence (presence) of SO interaction, the ABS spectrum at the gap edge is mathematically analogues to that at zero energy in the presence (absence) of SO interaction. We demonstrate that the gap edge touching (GET) points of the spectrum in principle form $N - 2$ ($N - 3$) dimensional manifold when the SO interaction is absent (present). Certain symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone of the phases are exceptional from this rule, and GET there should be considered separately. We derive and study the effective Hamiltonians for all the singularities under consideration.

A field theoretic formulation in terms of fields on a manifold ${\mathcal M} \times {\tilde{\mathcal M}}$ where the two components have opposite orientation is also presented. We propose formulating gravitational dynamics for noncommutative geometry using thermofield dynamics, doubling the Hilbert space modeling the noncommutative space. We consider 2+1 dimensions in some detail and since ${\mathcal M}$ and ${\tilde{\mathcal M}}$ have opposite orientation, the commutative limit leads to the Einstein-Hilbert action as the difference of two Chern-Simons actions.

abstract: H2O is one of the most important substances needed in sustaining life; but yet not much is known about its ground state. Here, a previously unidentified anomaly is identified in the form of a minimum in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant with respect to temperature near 20 K while the real part remains monotonic. Isothermal dispersion and absorption measurements show coinciding results. For the case of heavy ice (D2O), no anomaly was identified confirming an apparent isotope effect. Concerted quantum tunneling of protons is believed to be the main cause behind the reported anomaly. Our findings identify another system that exhibits macroscopic quantum phenomena of which rarely occur in nature.

journal:

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00221
abstract: For equilibrium states of macroscopic quantum systems,we study what are measured when fluctuations of macrovariables are measured. To mimic classical ideal measurements, we consider `quasi-classical measurements' which are minimally-disturbing, homogeneous, and unbiased quantum measurements with moderate magnitudes of errors. For all such measurements, we find that the symmetrized time correlation is obtained among many quantum correlations that reduce, in the classical limit, to the same classical time correlation. As an important consequence of this universal result, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is partially violated as a relation between observed quantities in macroscopic quantum systems. The post-measurement state is squeezed by backactions of the measurements, but is macroscopically identical to the pre-measurement equilibrium state. This state evolves with time, in which macrovariables fluctuate and relax, unlike other microstates (such as the Gibbs state) that represent the same equilibrium state.

abstract: A full strength Coulomb interaction between trapped electrons can be felt only in absence of a neutralizing background. In order to study quantum degenerate electrons without such a background, an external trap is needed to compensate for the strong electronic repulsion. As a basic model for such a system, we study a trapped electron pair in a harmonic trap with an explicit inclusion of its Coulomb interaction. We find the eigenenergies of the system for any value of the trapping strength. The problem is solved either numerically or by using approximate methods. As function of the trapping strength a crossover can be made from the strongly to the weakly-coupled regime, and we show that in both regimes perturbative methods based on a pair-wise electron description would be effective for a many-particle trapped electron system.

abstract: We performed a cognitive experiment in which we asked the participants to pick a pair of directions they considered as the 'preferred good example of two different wind directions'. The results of the experiment reveal that the 'Clauser Horne Shimony Holt' (CHSH) form of Bell inequalities is violated. The violation is significant and numerically almost equal to the violation of the CHSH inequality predicted by quantum theory and observed in coincidence spin measurements on pairs of quantum particles in an entangled spin state. Analysing the experiment there are more similarities, as if the human mind selects probabilistically on wind directions and their difference in the same way as Stern-Gerlach apparatuses select probabilistically on spin directions and their difference. As in the quantum violation, our violation indicates that entanglement systematically occurs in human cognition, and that accordingly non-classical probabilistic structures of a quantum type are needed in the modeling of cognitive processes. We support this result by presenting a quantum theoretical model in Hilbert space, which exactly reproduces the collected data and enlightens the deep analogies existing between quantum and cognitive entities.

abstract: Motivated by experiments in Munich (M. Schreiber et. al. arXiv:1501.05661), we study the dynamics of interacting fermions initially prepared in charge density wave states in bichromatic optical lattices. The experiment sees a marked lack of thermalization, which has been taken as evidence for an interacting generalization of Anderson localization, dubbed "many-body localization." We model the experiments using an interacting Aubry-Andre model and develop a computationally efficient low-density cluster expansion to calculate the even-odd density imbalance as a function of interaction strength and potential strength. Our calculations agree with the experimental results and shed light on the phenomena. We also explore how allowing hopping in transverse directions suppresses the imbalance. The cluster expansion method we develop should have broad applicability to similar problems in non-equilibrium quantum physics.

abstract: We model the dynamics of attractively interacting ultracold bosonic atoms in a quasi-one-dimensional wave-guide with additional harmonic trapping. Initially, we prepare the system in its ground state and then shift the zero of the harmonic trap and switch on an additional narrow scattering potential near the center of the trap. After colliding with the barrier twice, we propose to measure the number of atoms opposite to the initial condition. Quantum-enhanced interferometry with quantum bright solitons allows us to predict detection of an offset of the scattering potential with considerably increased accuracy as compared to single-particle experiments. In a future experimental realization this might lead to measurement of weak forces caused, for example, by small horizontal gradients in the gravitational potential --- with a resolution of several micrometers given essentially by the size of the solitons. Our numerical simulations are based on the rigorously proved effective potential approach developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010403 (2009) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210402 (2009)], in a parameter regime inaccessible to the mean-field description via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation due to Schr\"odinger-cat states occurring between the two scattering events.

abstract: Dispersive shock waves dominate wave-breaking phenomena in Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of loss, these highly irregular and disordered waves are potentially reversible. However, no experimental evidence has been given about the possibility of inverting the dynamics of a dispersive shock wave and turn it into a regular wave-front. Nevertheless, the opposite scenario, i.e., a smooth wave generating turbulent dynamics is well studied and observed in experiments. Here we introduce a new theoretical formulation for the dynamics in a highly nonlocal and defocusing medium described by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Our theory unveils a mechanism that enhances the degree of irreversibility. This mechanism explains why a dispersive shock cannot be reversed in evolution even for an arbitrarirly small amount of loss. Our theory is based on the concept of nonlinear Gamow vectors, i.e., power dependent generalizations of the counter-intuitive and hereto elusive exponentially decaying states in Hamiltonian systems. We theoretically show that nonlinear Gamow vectors play a fundamental role in nonlinear Schroedinger models: they may be used as a generalized basis for describing the dynamics of the shock waves, and affect the degree of irreversibility of wave-breaking phenomena. Gamow vectors allow to analytically calculate the amount of breaking of time-reversal with a quantitative agreement with numerical solutions. We also show that a nonlocal nonlinear optical medium may act as a simulator for the experimental investigation of quantum irreversible models, as the reversed harmonic oscillator.

abstract: We derive exact analytic expressions for the average work done and work fluctuations in instantaneous quenches of the ground and thermal states of a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. The average work and a quantum fluctuation relation is used to determine the amount of irreversible entropy produced during the quench, eventually revealing how the closing of the excitation gap leads to increased dissipated work. The work fluctuation is calculated and shown to exhibit non-analytic behavior as the pre-quench anisotropy parameter and transverse field are tuned across quantum critical points. Exact compact formulas for the average work and work fluctuation in ground state quenches of the transverse field Ising model allow us to calculate the first singular derivative at the critical field values.

By means of a direct calculation based on coherent state path integral, we find an analytic form for these moments in terms of the Riemann theta function. We show that the moments of arbitrary order are equal to the same quantities for the compactified boson at the self-dual point. These equalities imply the non trivial result that also the negativity of the free fermion and the self-dual boson are equal.

abstract: We analyze the quantum phases, correlation functions and edge modes for a class of spin-1/2 and fermionic models related to the one-dimensional Ising chain in the presence of a transverse field. These models are the Ising chain with anti-ferromagnetic long-range interactions that decay with distance as $1/r^\alpha$, as well as a related class of fermionic Hamiltonians that generalise the Kitaev chain, where both the hopping and pairing terms are long-range and their relative strength can be varied. For these models, we provide the complete phase diagram for all exponents $\alpha$, based on an analysis of the entanglement entropy, the decay of correlation functions, and the edge modes in the case of open chains. We demonstrate that violations of the area law can occur for $\alpha \lesssim1$, while connected correlation functions can decay with a hybrid exponential and power-law behaviour, with a power that is $\alpha$-dependent. Interestingly, for the fermionic models we provide an exact analytical derivation for such a behaviour at every $\alpha$. Along the critical lines, for all models breaking of conformal symmetry is argued at low enough $\alpha$. For the fermionic models we show that the edge modes, massless for $\alpha \gtrsim 1$, can acquire a mass for $\alpha < 1$. The mass of these states can be tuned by varying the relative strength of the kinetic and pairing terms in the Hamiltonian. Interestingly, for the Ising chain a similar edge localization appears for excited bulk states on the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram, where edge modes are not expected. We argue that, at least for the fermionic chains, these massive states correspond to the appearance of new phases, notably approached via quantum phase transitions without mass gap closure. Finally, we discuss the possibility to detect some of these effects in experiments with cold trapped ions.

abstract: We construct a universal spin$_c$ Dirac operator on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ built by projecting $su(n+1)$ left actions and prove its equivalence to the standard right action Dirac operator on $\mathbb{C}P^n$. The eigenvalue problem is solved and the spinor space constructed thereof, showing that the proposed Dirac operator is universal, changing only its domain for different spin$_c$ structures. Explicit expressions for the chirality and the eigenspinors are also found and consistency with the index theorem is established. Also the extended $\mathcal{N} =2$ supersymmetry algebra is realised through the Dirac operator and its companion supercharge, and an expression for the superpotential of any spin$_c$ connection on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is found. The $R$-symmetry of this superalgebra is found to be equivalent to the $U(1)$ holonomy of the spin$_c$ connection.

abstract: In quantum information theory, Fisher Information is a natural metric on the space of perturbations to a density matrix, defined by calculating the relative entropy with the unperturbed state at quadratic order in perturbations. In gravitational physics, Canonical Energy defines a natural metric on the space of perturbations to spacetimes with a Killing horizon. In this paper, we show that the Fisher information metric for perturbations to the vacuum density matrix of a ball-shaped region B in a holographic CFT is dual to the canonical energy metric for perturbations to a corresponding Rindler wedge R_B of Anti-de-Sitter space. Positivity of relative entropy at second order implies that the Fisher information metric is positive definite. Thus, for physical perturbations to anti-de-Sitter spacetime, the canonical energy associated to any Rindler wedge must be positive. This second-order constraint on the metric extends the first order result from relative entropy positivity that physical perturbations must satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations.

abstract: The ability to calculate precise likelihood ratios is fundamental to many STEM areas, such as decision-making theory, biomedical science, and engineering. However, there is no assumption-free statistical methodology to achieve this. For instance, in the absence of data relating to covariate overlap, the widely used Bayes' theorem either defaults to the marginal probability driven "naive Bayes' classifier", or requires the use of compensatory expectation-maximization techniques. Equally, the use of alternative statistical approaches, such as multivariate logistic regression, may be confounded by other axiomatic conditions, e.g., low levels of co-linearity. This article takes an information-theoretic approach in developing a new statistical formula for the calculation of likelihood ratios based on the principles of quantum entanglement. In doing so, it is argued that this quantum approach demonstrates: that the likelihood ratio is a real quality of statistical systems; that the naive Bayes' classifier is a special case of a more general quantum mechanical expression; and that only a quantum mechanical approach can overcome the axiomatic limitations of classical statistics.

abstract: There are two kinds of quantum fluctuations relevant to cosmology that we focus on in this article: those that form the seeds for structure formation in the early universe and those giving rise to Boltzmann brains in the late universe. First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the density of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect of gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to inflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities. However, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is homogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the foundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the symmetry of the quantum state. Second, Boltzmann brains are random agglomerates of particles that, by extreme coincidence, form functioning brains. Unlikely as these coincidences are, they seem to be predicted to occur in a quantum universe as vacuum fluctuations if the universe continues to exist for an infinite (or just very long) time, in fact to occur over and over, even forming the majority of all brains in the history of the universe. We provide a brief introduction to the Bohmian version of quantum theory and explain why in this version, Boltzmann brains, an undesirable kind of fluctuation, do not occur (or at least not often), while inhomogeneous seeds for structure formation, a desirable kind of fluctuation, do.

As a proof of principle, we propose a somewhat elaborate inflationary model where a Bell inequality violating observable can be constructed.

An applied magnetic field enhances the coupling of the light to the otherwise strictly forbidden transition. We determine the magic wavelength, the quadratic magnetic Zeeman shift and the transition frequency to be 468.463(207)$\,$nm, -206.6(2.0)$\,$MHz/T$^2$ and 655 058 646 691(101)$\,$kHz, respectively. These are compared with theoretical predictions and results from complementary experiments. We also developed a high-precision relativistic structure model for magnesium, give an improved theoretical value for the blackbody radiation shift and discuss a clock based on bosonic magnesium.

These decay channel are mediated through the exchange of the massive $W$ and $Z$ vector bosons of the electroweak interaction. After summing over the various neutrino channels, the standard model calculation yields the rate for such a single photon decay process of $\Gamma_{Ps \rightarrow \gamma}$ = 1.72 $\times 10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$.

abstract: The electromagnetic momentum transferred transfered to scattering particles is proportional to the intensity of the incident fields, however, the momentum of single photons ($\hbar k$) does not naturally appear in these classical expressions. Here, we discuss an alternative to Maxwell's stress tensor that renders the classical electromagnetic field momentum compatible to the quantum mechanical one. This is achieved through the introduction of the quantum conversion which allows the transformation, including units, of the classical fields to wave-function equivalent fields.

abstract: We consider a localized electronic spin controlled by a circularly polarized optical beam and an external magnetic field. When the frequency of the beam is tuned near an optical resonance with a continuum of higher energy states, effective magnetic fields are induced on the two-level system via the Inverse Faraday Effect. We explore the process in which the frequency of the beam is made linearly time-dependent so that it sweeps through the optical resonance, starting and ending at the values far away from it. In addition to changes of spin states, Kramers-Kronig relations guarantee that a localized electron can also escape into a continuum of states. We argue that probabilities of transitions between different possible electronic states after such a sweep of the optical frequency can be found exactly regardless the shape of the resonance. We also discuss extension of our results to multistate systems.

abstract: We investigate the statistical orthogonality catastrophe (SOC) in single-particle and many-body localized systems by studying the response of the many-body ground state to a local quench. Using scaling arguments and exact numerical calculations, we establish that the SOC gives rise to a wave function overlap between the pre- and post-quench ground states that has an exponential decay with the system size, in sharp contrast to the well-known power law Anderson orthogonality catastrophe. This exponential decay arises from a statistical charge transfer process where a particle can be effectively "transported" to an arbitrary lattice site. In a many-body localized phase, we find this non-local transport and the associated exponential SOC phenomenon to persist in the presence of interaction effects. We discuss possibilities of observing this "stronger" exponential SOC in cold atoms and mesoscopic systems.

abstract: By performing quantum-noise-limited optical heterodyne detection, we observe polarization noise in light after propagation through a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF). We compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and find an increase of noise even though the light is mainly transmitted in air in a hollow-core PCF. Combined with our simulation of the acoustic vibrational modes in the hollow-core PCF, we are offering an explanation for the polarization noise with a variation of guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS). Here, instead of modulating the strain in the fiber core as in a solid core fiber, the acoustic vibrations in hollow-core PCF influence the effective refractive index by modulating the geometry of the photonic crystal structure. This induces polarization noise in the light guided by the photonic crystal structure.

abstract: We discuss the existence of monodromies associated with the singular points of the eigenvalue problem for the Rabi model. The complete control of the full monodromy data requires the taming of the Stokes phenomenon associated with the unique irregular singular point. The monodromy data, in particular the composite monodromy, are written in terms of the parameters of the model via the isomonodromy method and the tau-function of the Painlev\'e V. These data provide a systematic way to obtain the quantized spectrum of the Rabi model.

abstract: We show how the squeezing of light can lead to the formation of topological states. Such states are characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers, and exhibit protected edge modes which give rise to chiral elastic and inelastic photon transport. These topological bosonic states are not equivalent to their fermionic (topological superconductor) counterparts and cannot be mapped by a local transformation onto topological states found in particle-conserving models. They thus represent a new type of topological system. We study this physics in detail in the case of a Kagome lattice model, and discuss possible realizations using nonlinear photonic crystals or superconducting circuits.

abstract: Disordered quantum networks, as those describing light-harvesting complexes, are often characterized by the presence of antenna structures where the light is captured and inner structures (reaction centers) where the excitation is transferred. Antennae often display distinguished coherent features: their eigenstates can be separated, with respect to the transfer of excitation, in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant states. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In absence of disorder superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC, while subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states, thus creating an indirect coupling to the RC. We consider the problem of finding the maximal excitation transfer efficiency as a function of the RC energy and the disorder strength, first in a paradigmatic three-level system and then in a realistic model for the light-harvesting complex of purple bacteria. Specifically, we focus on the case in which the excitation is initially on a subradiant state, showing that the optimal disorder is of the order of the superradiant coupling. We also determine the optimal detuning between the initial state and the RC energy. We show that the efficiency remains high around the optimal detuning in a large energy window, proportional to the superradiant coupling. This allows for the simultaneous optimization of excitation transfer from several initial states with different optimal detuning.

abstract: We express the boundary conditions for TE and TM waves at the interfaces of an infinite planar slab of homogeneous metamaterial as certain point interactions and use them to compute the transfer matrix of the system. This allows us to demonstrate the omnidirectional reflectionlessness of Veselago's slab for waves of arbitrary wavelength, reveal the translational and reflection symmetry of this slab, explore the laser threshold condition and coherent perfect absorption for active negative-index metamaterials, introduce a point interaction modeling phase-conjugation, determine the corresponding antilinear transfer matrix, and offer a simple proof of the equivalence of Veselago's slab with a pair of parallel phase-conjugating plates. We also study the connection between certain optical setups involving metamaterials and a class of PT-symmetric quantum systems defined on wedge-shape contours in the complex plane. This provides a physical interpretation for the latter.

abstract: The relationship between the foundations of mathematics and physics is a topic of of much interest. This paper continues this exploration by examination of the effect of space and time dependent number scaling on theoretical descriptions of some physical and geometric quantities. Fiber bundles provide a good framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number scaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and geometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce a new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1) invariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling field. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to affect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on flat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates for the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics restricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to zero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no restrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does not affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another. However it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of computations or measurements. These are needed because theory predictions are in terms of numerical values.

abstract: We construct the Baxter's operator and the corresponding Baxter's equation for a quantum version of the Ablowitz Ladik model. The result is achieved by looking at the quantum analogue of the classical Backlund transformations. For comparison we find the same result by using the well-known Bethe ansatz technique. General results about integrable models governed by the same r-matrix algebra will be given. The Baxter's equation comes out to be a q-difference equation involving both the trace and the quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix. The spectrality property of the classical Backlund transformations gives a trace formula representing the classical analogue of the Baxter's equation. An explicit q-integral representation of the Baxter's operator is discussed.

abstract: We propose a metamaterial to realize true electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), where the incidence of an auxiliary electromagnetic wave called the control wave induces transparency for a probe wave. The analogy to the original EIT effect in an atomic medium is shown through analytical and numerical calculations derived from a circuit model for the metamaterial. We performed experiments to demonstrate the EIT effect of the metamaterial in the microwave region. The width and position of the transparent region can be controlled by the power and frequency of the control wave. We also observed asymmetric transmission spectra unique to the Fano resonance.

We apply these results to all 85 arithmetic triangles and establish the boundary conditions under which the quantum billiard is \textquotedblleft genuinely arithmetic\textquotedblright, i. e., has Poissonian level statistics; otherwise the billiard is "pseudo-arithmetic" and belongs to the GOE universality class

abstract: We theoretically analyze a system where two electrons are trapped separately in two quantum dots on a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT), subject to external ac electric driving. An indirect mechanically-induced coupling of two distant single electron spins is induced by the interaction between the spins and the mechanical motion of the CNT. We show that a two-qubit iSWAP gate and arbitrary single-qubit gates can be obtained from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Combining the iSWAP gate and single-qubit gates, maximally entangled states of two spins can be generated in a single step by varying the frequency and the strength of the external electric driving field. The spin-phonon coupling can be turned off by electrostatically shifting the electron wave function on the nanotube.

abstract: The one-dimensional extended bosonic Hubbard model has been shown to exhibit a variety of phases ranging from Mott insulator and superfluid to exotic supersolids and Haldane insulators depending on the filling and the relative value of the contact ($U$) and near neighbor ($V$) interaction strengths. In this paper we use the density matrix renormalization group and the time evolving block decimation numerical methods to study in detail the dynamics and excitation spectra of this model in its various phases. In particular, we study in detail the behavior of the charge and neutral gaps which characterize the Mott, charge density and Haldane insulating phases. We also show that in addition to the gapless modes at $k=0$, the supersolid phase exhibits gapless modes at a finite $k$ which depends on the filling.

abstract: Imaging the fields of magnetic materials provides crucial insight into the physical and chemical processes surrounding magnetism, and has been a key ingredient in the spectacular development of magnetic data storage. Existing approaches using the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), x-ray and electron microscopy have limitations that constrain further development, and there is increasing demand for imaging and characterisation of magnetic phenomena in real time with high spatial resolution. In this work, we show how the magneto-optical response of an array of negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond can be used to image and map the sub-micron stray magnetic field patterns from thin ferromagnetic films. Using optically detected magnetic resonance, we demonstrate wide-field magnetic imaging over 100x100 {\mu}m^2 with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution of 440 nm at video frame rates, under ambient conditions. We demonstrate a novel all-optical spin relaxation contrast imaging approach which can image magnetic structures in the absence of an applied microwave field. Straightforward extensions promise imaging with sub-{\mu}T sensitivity and sub-optical spatial and millisecond temporal resolution. This work establishes practical diamond-based wide-field microscopy for rapid high-sensitivity characterisation and imaging of magnetic samples, with the capability for investigating magnetic phenomena such as domain wall and skyrmion dynamics and the spin Hall effect in metals.

abstract: We propose a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a Hilbert space enlarged with an ancilla such that the partial trace of its solution obeys to the Lindblad equation of an open quantum system. The dynamics involved by this nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation constitutes then a purification of the Lindbladian dynamics. This nonlinear equation is compared with other Schr\"odinger like equations appearing in the theory of open systems. We study the (non adiabatic) geometric phases involved by this purification and show that our theory unifies several definitions of geometric phases for open systems which have been previously proposed. We study the geometry involved by this purification and show that it is a complicated geometric structure related to an higher gauge theory, i.e. a categorical bibundle with a connective structure.

abstract: "Bottom-up" approaches to the many-body physics of fermions have demonstrated recently precise number and site-resolved preparations with tunability of interparticle interactions in single-well, SW, and double-well, DW, nano-scale confinements created by manipulating ultracold fermionic atoms with optical tweezers. These experiments emulate an analogue-simulator mapping onto the requisite microscopic hamiltonian, approaching realization of Feynman's vision of quantum simulators that "will do exactly the same as nature". Here we report on exact benchmark configuration-interaction computational microscopy solutions of the hamiltonian, uncovering the spectral evolution, wave-function anatomy, and entanglement properties of the interacting fermions in the entire parameter range, including crossover from a SW to a DW confinement and a controllable energy imbalance between the wells. We demonstrate attractive pairing and formation of repulsive, highly-correlated, ultracold Wigner molecules, well-described in the natural orbital representation. The agreement with the measurements affirms the henceforth gained deep insights into ultracold molecules and opens access to the size-dependent evolution of nano-clustered and condensed-matter phases and ultracold-atoms quantum information.

abstract: A meaningful probability distribution for measurements of a quantum stress tensor operator can only be obtained if the operator is averaged in time or in spacetime. This averaging can be regarded as a description of the measurement process. Realistic measurements can be expected to begin and end at finite times, which means that they are described by functions with compact support, which we will also take to be smooth. Here we study the probability distributions for stress tensor operators averaged with such functions of time, in the vacuum state of a massless free field. Our primary aim is to understand the asymptotic form of the distribution which describes the probability of large vacuum fluctuations. Our approach involves asymptotic estimates for the high moments of the distribution. These estimates in turn may be used to obtain estimates for the asymptotic form of the probability distribution. Our results show that averaging over a finite interval results in a probability distribution which falls more slowly than for the case of Lorentzian averaging, and both fall more slowly than exponentially. This indicates that vacuum fluctuations effects can dominate over thermal fluctuations in some circumstances.

Benchmark calculations for two to six fermions with the full configuration interaction method, equivalent to the exact diagonalization approach, and the coupled cluster method including single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations are presented. The convergence of the correlation energy with the level of excitations included in the coupled cluster model is analyzed. The range of the interaction strength for which single-reference coupled cluster methods work is examined. Next, the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and noniterative triple excitations, CCSD(T), is employed to study a two-component Fermi gas composed of 6 to 80 atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. The density profiles of trapped atomic clouds are also reported. Finally, a comparison with experimental results for few-fermion systems is presented. Upcoming possible applications and extensions of the presented approach are discussed.

abstract: We propose a versatile and efficient method to generate a broad class of complex entangled states of many atoms via the detection of a single photon. For an atomic ensemble contained in a strongly coupled optical cavity illuminated by weak single- or multi-frequency light, the atom-light interaction entangles the frequency spectrum of a transmitted photon with the collective spin of the atomic ensemble. Simple time-resolved detection of the transmitted photon then projects the atomic ensemble into a desired pure entangled state. Complex entangled states such as multicomponent Schroedinger cat states can be generated with high fidelity. This probabilistic but fast heralded state-carving method can be made quasi-deterministic by repeated trial and feedback, yields high success probability per trial, and can be implemented with existing technology.

abstract: We study the effect of resonances associated with complex molecular interaction of Rydberg atoms on Rydberg blockade. We show that densely-spaced molecular potentials between doubly-excited atomic pairs become unavoidably resonant with the optical excitation at short interatomic separations. Such molecular resonances limit the coherent control of individual excitations in Rydberg blockade. As an illustration, we compute the molecular interaction potentials of Rb atoms near the $100s$ states asymptote to characterize such detrimental molecular resonances, determine the resonant loss rate to molecules and inhomogeneous light shifts. Techniques to avoid the undesired effect of molecular resonances are discussed.

The basic theory of Nash inequalities is extended to the setting of non-commutative Lp spaces, where their relationship to Poincare and log-Sobolev inequalities are fleshed out. We prove Nash inequalities for a number of unital reversible semigroups.

We keep the writing in a self-consistent way, requiring minimum background in quantum information science. Basic knowledge in undergraduate quantum physics and condensed matter physics is assumed. We start slowly from the basic ideas in quantum information theory, but wish to eventually bring the readers to the frontiers of research in condensed matter physics, including topological phases of matter, tensor networks, and symmetry-protected topological phases.

abstract: We derive a formula which applies to conformal field theories on a spatial torus and gives the asymptotic density of states solely in terms of the vacuum energy on a parallel plate geometry. The formula follows immediately from global scale and Lorentz invariance, but to our knowledge has not previously been made explicit. It can also be understood from the fact that $\log Z$ on $\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ is the absolute value of a modular form of weight $1-d$, which we prove. The results are extended to theories which violate Lorentz invariance and hyperscaling but maintain a scaling symmetry. The formula is checked for the cases of a free scalar, free Maxwell gauge field, and free $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. The case of a Maxwell gauge field gives Casimir's original calculation of the electromagnetic force between parallel plates in terms of the entropy of a photon gas.

abstract: We investigate the quantum mechanical transitions, induced by the combined effect of Gravitational wave (GW) and noncommutative (NC) structure of space, among the states of a 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The phonon modes excited by the passing GW within the resonant bar-detector are formally identical to forced harmonic oscillator and they represent a length variation of roughly the same order of magnitude as the characteristic length-scale of spatial noncommutativity estimated from the phenomenological upper bound of the NC parameter. This motivates our present work. We employ a number of different GW wave-forms that are typically expected from possible astronomical sources. We find that the transition probablities are quite sensitive to the nature of polarization of the GW. We further elaborate on the particular type of sources of GW radiation which can induce transitions that can be used as effective probe of the spatial noncommutative structure.

abstract: Chiral discrimination with high harmonic generation (cHHG method) has been introduced in the recent work by R. Cireasa et al ( Nat. Phys. 11, 654 - 658, 2015). In its original implementation, the cHHG method works by detecting high harmonic emission from randomly oriented ensemble of chiral molecules driven by elliptically polarized field, as a function of ellipticity. Here we discuss future perspectives in the development of this novel method, the ways of increasing chiral dichroism using tailored laser pulses, new detection schemes involving high harmonic phase measurements, and concentration-independent approaches. Using the example of the epoxypropane molecule C$_3$H$_6$O (also known as 1,2-propylene oxide), we show theoretically that application of two-color counter-rotating elliptically polarized laser fields yields an order of magnitude enhancement of chiral dichroism compared to single color elliptical fields. We also describe how one can introduce a new functionality to cHHG: concentration-independent measurement of the enatiomeric excess in a mixture of randomly oriented left-handed and right-handed molecules. Finally, for arbitrary configurations of laser fields, we connect the observables of the cHHG method to the amplitude and phase of chiral response, providing a basis for reconstructing wide range of chiral dynamics from cHHG measurements, with femtosecond to sub-femtosecond temporal resolution.

We show experiments that demonstrate CCCPs are powerful and versatile tools not only in QIP but also in NMR measurements.

abstract: Quantum-mechanically correlated (entangled) states of many particles are of interest in quantum information, quantum computing and quantum metrology. Metrologically useful entangled states of large atomic ensembles have been experimentally realized, but these states display Gaussian spin distribution functions with a non-negative Wigner function. Non-Gaussian entangled states have been produced in small ensembles of ions, and very recently in large atomic ensembles. Here, we generate entanglement in a large atomic ensemble via the interaction with a very weak laser pulse; remarkably, the detection of a single photon prepares several thousand atoms in an entangled state. We reconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function, an important hallmark of nonclassicality, and verify an entanglement depth (minimum number of mutually entangled atoms) of 2910(190) out of 3100 atoms. This is the first time a negative Wigner function or the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms have been attained in an ensemble containing more than a few particles. While the achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex Schrodinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for entanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a single photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.

abstract: We formulate a quantum coherent state picture for topological and non-topological solitons. We recognize that the topological charge arises from the infinite occupation number of zero momentum quanta flowing in one direction. Thus, the Noether charge of microscopic constituents gives rise to a topological charge in the macroscopic description. This fact explains the conservation of topological charge from the basic properties of coherent states. It also shows that no such conservation exists for non-topological solitons, which have finite mean occupation number. Consequently, they can have an exponentially-small but non-zero overlap with the vacuum, leading to vacuum instability. This amplitude can be interpreted as a coherent state description of false vacuum decay. Next we show that we can represent topological solitons as a convolution of two sectors that carry information about topology and energy separately, which makes their difference very transparent. Finally, we show how interaction among the solitons can be understood from basic properties of quantum coherent states.

abstract: We critically reexamine the bosonization-debosonization procedure for systems including certain types of localized features (although more general scenarios are possible). By focusing on the case of a tunneling junction out of equilibrium, we show that the conventional approach gives results that are not consistent with the exact solution of the problem even at the qualitative level. We identify inconsistencies that can adversely affect the results of all types of calculations. We subsequently show a way to avoid these and proceed consistently. The extended framework we develop here should be widely applicable.

abstract: Following the development of a scheme to bosonize and debosonize consistently [N. Shah and C.J. Bolech, companion paper], we present in detail the Toulouse-point analytic solution of the two-lead Kondo junction model. The existence and location of the solvable point is not modified, but the calculational methodology and the final expressions for observable quantities change markedly as compared to the existent results. This solvable point is one of the remarkably few exact results for non-equilibrium transport in correlated systems. It yields relatively simple analytical expressions for the current in the full range of temperature, magnetic field and voltage. It also shows precisely, within the limitations of the Toulouse fine-tuning, how the transport evolves depending on the relative strengths of inter-lead and intra-lead Kondo exchange couplings ranging from weak to strong. Thus its improved understanding is an important stepping stone for future research.

abstract: The recent advances in creating nearly degenerate quantum dipolar gases in optical lattices are opening the doors for the exploration of equilibrium physics of quantum systems with anisotropic and long-range dipolar interactions. In this paper we study the zero- and finite-temperature phase diagrams of a system of hard-core dipolar bosons at half-filling, trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice. The dipoles are aligned parallel to one another and tilted out of the optical lattice plane by means of an external electric field. At zero-temperature, the system is a superfluid at all tilt angles $\theta$ provided that the strength of dipolar interaction is below a critical value $V_c(\theta)$. Upon increasing the interaction strength while keeping $\theta$ fixed, the superfluid phase is destabilized in favor of a checkerboard or a stripe solid depending on the tilt angle. We explore the nature of the phase transition between the two solid phases and find evidence of a micro-emulsion phase, following the Spivak-Kivelson scenario, separating these two solid phases. Additionally, we study the stability of these quantum phases against thermal fluctuations and find that the stripe solid is the most robust, making it the best candidate for experimental observation.

abstract: A shortcut to adiabaticity is a finite-time process that produces the same final state as would result from infinitely slow driving. We show that such shortcuts can be found for weak perturbations from linear response theory. With the help of phenomenological response functions a simple expression for the excess work is found -- quantifying the nonequilibrium excitations. For two specific examples, the quantum parametric oscillator and the spin-1/2 in a time-dependent magnetic field, we show that finite-time zeros of the excess work indicate the existence of shortcuts. Finally, we propose a degenerate family of protocols, which facilitate shortcuts to adiabaticity for specific and very short driving times.

abstract: We present simple lattice realizations of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with $q$-form global symmetries where charged excitations have $q$ spatial dimensions. Specifically, we construct $d$ space-dimensional models supported on a $(d+1)$-colorable graph by using a family of unitary phase gates, known as multi-qubit control-$Z$ gates in quantum information community. In our construction, charged excitations of different dimensionality may coexist and form a short-range entangled state which is protected by symmetry operators of different dimensionality. Non-triviality of proposed models, in a sense of quantum circuit complexity, is confirmed by studying protected boundary modes, gauged models and corresponding gapped domain walls. We also comment on applications of our construction to quantum error-correcting codes, and discuss corresponding fault-tolerant logical gates.

abstract: Correlations exhibited by neutrino oscillations are studied via quantum information theoretic quantities. We show that the strongest type of entanglement, genuine multipartite entanglement, is persistent in the flavour changing states. We prove the existence of Bell-type nonlocal features, in both its absolute and genuine avatars. Finally, we show that a measure of nonclassicality, dissension, which is a generalization of quantum discord to the tripartite case, is nonzero for almost the entire range of time in the evolution of an initial electron-neutrino. Via these quantum information theoretic quantities capturing different aspects of quantum correlations, we elucidate the differences between the flavour types, shedding light on the quantum-information theoretic aspects of the weak force.

abstract: We introduce the spectrum bifurcation renormalization group (SBRG) as a generalization of the real-space renormalization group for the many-body localized (MBL) system without truncating the Hilbert space. Starting from a disordered many-body Hamiltonian in the full MBL phase, the SBRG flows to the MBL fixed-point Hamiltonian, and generates the local conserved quantities and the matrix product state representations for all eigenstates. The method is applicable to both spin and fermion models with arbitrary interaction strength on any lattice in all dimensions, as long as the models are in the MBL phase. In particular, we focus on the $1d$ interacting Majorana chain with strong disorder, and map out its phase diagram using the entanglement entropy. The SBRG flow also generates an entanglement holographic mapping, which duals the MBL state to a fragmented holographic space decorated with small blackholes.

abstract: A general tension-reduction (GTR) model was recently considered to derive quantum probabilities as (universal) averages over all possible forms of non-uniform fluctuations, and explain their considerable success in describing experimental situations also outside of the domain of physics, for instance in the ambit of quantum models of cognition and decision. Yet, this result also highlighted the possibility of observing violations of the predictions of the Born rule, in those situations where the averaging would not be large enough, or would be altered because of the combination of multiple measurements. In this article we show that this is indeed the case in typical psychological measurements exhibiting question order effects, by showing that their statistics of outcomes are inherently non-Hilbertian, and require the larger framework of the GTR-model to receive an exact mathematical description. We also consider another unsolved problem of quantum cognition: response replicability. It is has been observed that when question order effects and response replicability occur together, the situation cannot be handled anymore by quantum theory. However, we show that it can be easily and naturally described in the GTR-model. Based on these findings, we motivate the adoption in cognitive science of a hidden-measurements interpretation of the quantum formalism, and of its GTR-model generalization, as the natural interpretational framework explaining the data of psychological measurements on conceptual entities.

abstract: The problem of deep laser cooling of $^{24}$Mg atoms is theoretically studied. We propose two-stage sub-Doppler cooling strategy using electro-dipole transition $3^3P_2$$\to$$3^3D_3$ ($\lambda$=383.9 nm). The first stage implies exploiting magneto-optical trap with $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ light beams, while the second one uses a lin$\perp$lin molasses. We focus on achieving large number of ultracold atoms (T$_{eff}$ < 10 $\mu$K) in a cold atomic cloud. The calculations have been done out of many widely used approximations and based on quantum treatment with taking full account of recoil effect. Steady-state average kinetic energies and linear momentum distributions of cold atoms are analysed for various light-field intensities and frequency detunings. The results of conducted quantum analysis have revealed noticeable differences from results of semiclassical approach based on the Fokker-Planck equation. At certain conditions the second cooling stage can provide sufficiently lower kinetic energies of atomic cloud as well as increased fraction of ultracold atoms than the first one. We hope that the obtained results can assist overcoming current experimental problems in deep cooling of $^{24}$Mg atoms by means of laser fields. Cold magnesium atoms, being cooled in large number down to several microkelvins, have certain interest, for example, in quantum metrology.

abstract: We study entanglement growth in quantum many-body systems and propose a method to experimentally measure it. We show that entanglement growth is related to the spreading of local operators. In ergodic systems, linear spreading of operators results in a universal, linear in time growth of entanglement for initial product states, in contrast to the logarithmic growth of entanglement in many-body localized (MBL) systems. Furthermore, we show that entanglement growth is directly related to the decay of the Loschmidt echo in a composite system comprised of many copies of the original system, subject to a perturbation that reconnects different parts of the system. Exponential decay of the Loschmidt echo, characteristic of ergodic systems, implies linear growth of entanglement. Our proposal to experimentally measure entanglement growth uses a quantum switch (two-level system) which controls connections in the composite system. By measuring only the switch's dynamics, the growth of the R\'enyi entropies can be extracted. Our work provides a way to directly probe dynamical properties of many-body systems, in particular, allowing for a direct observation of many-body localization.

abstract: We propose and analyze a quantum Maxwell's demon on a single qubit with avoided level crossing. Its operation is based on moving the control gate to the point of minimum energy separation adiabatically, measuring the state of the qubit and providing conditional feedback based on the information gathered in the measurement. Ideally the heat extracted from the bath at temperature $T$ approaches the Landauer limit $k_BT\ln 2$ per operation cycle for small minimum level separation. The practical efficiency of the qubit demon, in terms of heat extracted in each cycle, is limited by the interplay of Landau-Zener dynamics and coupling to the bath. We suggest that an experimental demonstration of this effect is fully feasible for instance by employing one of the standard superconducting qubits.

abstract: We demonstrate a simple scheme to reach Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of metastable triplet helium atoms using a single beam optical dipole trap with moderate power of less than 3 W. Our scheme is based on RF-induced evaporative cooling in a quadrupole magnetic trap and transfer to a single beam optical dipole trap that is located below the magnetic trap center. We transfer 1x10^6 atoms into the optical dipole trap, with an initial temperature of 14 \mu K, and observe efficient forced evaporative cooling both in a hybrid trap, in which the quadrupole magnetic trap operates just below the levitation gradient, and in the pure optical dipole trap, reaching the onset of BEC with 2x10^5 atoms and a pure BEC of 5x10^4 atoms. Our work shows that a single beam hybrid trap can be applied for a light atom, for which evaporative cooling in the quadrupole magnetic trap is strongly limited by Majorana spin-flips, and the very small levitation gradient limits the axial confinement in the hybrid trap.

abstract: Reducing work fluctuation and energy dissipation in heat engines or, more generally, information heat engines that perform feedback control is vital to maximize their efficiency. The same problem arises when we attempt to maximize the efficiency of a given thermodynamic task that undergoes nonequilibrium processes for arbitrary initial and final states as in information processing. We find that the most general trade-off relation between work fluctuation and energy dissipation applicable to arbitrary nonequilibrium processes is bounded from below by the information distance characterizing how far the system is from thermal equilibrium. In the regime of vanishing work fluctuation, we recover the single-shot results with deterministic work extraction protocols. In the regime of vanishing dissipation, we recover the thermodynamically reversible protocols and the fluctuation-dissipation relations for nonequilibrium initial and final states. In the intermediate regime, the minimum amount of dissipation is found to be given by the relative entropy and the Renyi divergence, both of which quantify the information distance between the state of the system and the canonical distribution. We give an explicit protocol that achieves the fundamental lower bounds of the trade-off relations.

abstract: A central question in information theory is to determine the maximum success probability that can be achieved in sending a fixed number of messages over a noisy channel. This was first studied in the pioneering work of Shannon who established a simple expression characterizing this quantity in the limit of multiple independent uses of the channel. Here we consider the general setting with only one use of the channel. We observe that the maximum success probability can be expressed as the maximum value of a submodular function. Using this connection, we establish the following results: 1. There is a simple greedy polynomial-time algorithm that computes a code achieving a (1-1/e)-approximation of the maximum success probability. Moreover, for this problem it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation ratio strictly better than (1-1/e). 2. Shared quantum entanglement between the sender and the receiver can increase the success probability by a factor of at most 1/(1-1/e). In addition, this factor is tight if one allows an arbitrary non-signaling box between the sender and the receiver. 3. We give tight bounds on the one-shot performance of the meta-converse of Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu.

abstract: Quantum spin models have been studied extensively in one and higher dimensions. Furthermore, these systems have been doped with holes to study $t$--$J$ models of $SU(2)$ spin-1/2. Their anyonic counterparts can be built from non-Abelian anyons, such as Fibonacci anyons described by $SU(2)_3$ theories, which are quantum deformations of the $SU(2)$ algebra. Inspired by the physics of $SU(2)$ spins, several works have explored ladders of Fibonacci anyons and also one-dimensional (1D) $t$--$J$ models. Here we aim to explore the combined effects of extended dimensionality and doping by studying ladders composed of coupled chains of interacting itinerant Fibonacci anyons. We show analytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be mapped onto effective 1D models. These effective models can either be gapped models of hole pairs, or gapless models described by $t$--$J$ (or modified $t$--$J$--$V$) chains of Fibonacci anyons, whose spectrum exhibits a fractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom. By using exact diagonalizations for two-leg and three-leg ladders, we show that indeed the doped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of $t$--$J$ chains. In the strong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two different kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\tau$'s and light $\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian) topological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map the two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and light $\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the appearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological gapped phase is suggested for another density regime.

abstract: We analyze the power output of a quantum dot machine coupled to two electronic reservoirs via thermoelectric contacts, and to two thermal reservoirs - one hot and one cold. This machine is a nanoscale analogue of a conventional thermocouple heat-engine, in which the active region being heated is unavoidably also exchanging heat with its cold environment. Heat exchange between the dot and the thermal reservoirs is treated as a capacitive coupling to electronic fluctuations in localized levels, modeled as two additional quantum dots. The resulting multiple-dot setup is described using a master equation approach. We observe an "exotic" power generation, which remains finite even when the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs is zero (in other words the heat coming from the hot reservoir all escapes into the cold environment). This effect can be understood in terms of a non-local effect in which the heat flow from heat source to the cold environment generates power via a mechanism which we refer to as Coulomb heat drag. It relies on the fact that there is no relaxation in the quantum dot system, so electrons within it have a non-thermal energy distribution. More poetically, one can say that we find a spatial separation of the first-law of thermodynamics (heat to work conversion) from the second-law of thermodynamics (generation of entropy). We present circumstances in which this non-thermal system can generate more power than any conventional macroscopic thermocouple (with local thermalization), even when the latter works with Carnot efficiency.

The present method takes advantage of the approximate lognormal distributions that characterize the signal-to-noise properties of other approaches. We test our technique by implementing it in combination with the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm and calculating the second R\'enyi entanglement entropy of the 1D Hubbard model.

Its subspaces provide finite models for each of the real and complex quadratic spaces with dimension 4 or less. A model for the representations of these Heisenberg groups and automorphism groups is constructed. A pseudo-differential operator enables a parallel treatment of spaces defined over finite and real fields.

abstract: Many-body systems relaxing to equilibrium can exhibit complex dynamics even if their steady state is trivial. At low temperatures or high densities their evolution is often dominated by steric hindrances affecting particle motion [1,2,3]. Local rearrangements are highly constrained, giving rise to collective - and often slow - relaxation.This dynamics can be difficult to analyse from first principles, but the essential physical ingredients are captured by idealized lattice models with so- called kinetic constraints [4]. Here we experimentally realize a many-body system exhibiting manifest kinetic constraints and measure its dynamical properties. In the cold Rydberg gas used in our experiments, the nature of the constraints can be tailored through the detuning of the excitation lasers from resonance [5,6,7,8], which controls whether the system undergoes correlated or anti- correlated dynamics. Our results confirm recent theoretical predictions [5,6], and highlight the analogy between the dynamics of interacting Rydberg gases and that of soft-matter systems.

abstract: We consider non-equilibrium time evolution after a quench of a global Hamiltonian parameter in a system described by a Hamiltonian with local interactions. Within this background, we propose a protocol that allows to change global properties of the state by flipping a switch that modifies a local term of the Hamiltonian. A light-cone that separates two globally different regions originates from the switch. The expectation values of macroscopic observables, that is to say local observables that are spatially averaged within a subsystem, experience a characteristic linear time evolution. Remarkably, the process is almost reversible: flipping again the switch produces a new light-cone with the same morphology. Finally, we test the protocol under repeated projective measurements. As explicit example we study the dynamics in a simple exactly solvable model, but the same description applies to more general situations.

abstract: We apply the $AdS/CFT$ holography to the simplest possible eternal time machine solution in $AdS_3$ based on two conical defects moving around their center of mass along a circular orbit. Closed timelike curves in this space-time extend all the way to the boundary of $AdS_3$, violating causality of the boundary field theory. By use of the geodesic approximation we address the "grandfather paradox" in the dual $1+1$ dimensional field theory and calculate the two-point retarded Green function. It has a non-trivial analytical structure both at negative and positive times, providing us with an intuition on how an interacting quantum field could behave once causality is broken. In contrast with the previous considerations our calculations reveal the possibility of a consistent and controllable evolution of a quantum system without any need to impose additional consistency constraints.

abstract: The problem of two Aharonov-Bohm (AB) vortices for the Helmholtz equation is examined in detail. It is demonstrated that the method proposed in [J. M. Myers, J. Math. Phys. \textbf{6}, 1839 (1963)] for diffraction on a slit can be generalized to get an explicit solution for AB vortices. Due to singular nature of AB interaction the Green function and the scattering amplitude for two AB vortices obey a series of partial differential equations. Coefficients entering these equations, in their turn, fulfill ordinary non-linear differential equations whose solutions can be obtained from a solution of the Painleve V (or III) equation. The asymptotics of necessary functions for very large and very small distances between two vortices are calculated explicitly. Taken together, it means that the problem of two AB vortices is integrable.

abstract: The classical max-flow min-cut theorem describes transport through certain idealized classical networks. We consider the quantum analog for tensor networks. By associating a tensor to each node in an integral flow network, we can also interpret it as a tensor network, and more specifically, as a linear map. The quantum max flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this linear map over all choices for the tensors in the tensor network. We show that every cut in the tensor network provides an upper-bound on this rank, and therefore the quantum max flow is no more than the quantum min cut. Unlike the classical case (where the converse is also true, i.e., max flow = min cut) we show examples where the quantum inequality is strict. We also found connections of quantum max-flow/min-cut with entropy of entanglement and the quantum satisfiability problem. We speculate that the phenomena revealed may be of interest both in spin systems in condensed matter and in quantum gravity.

abstract: Dzhafarov, Zhang, and Kujala (arXiv:1504.07422) reviewed several behavioral data sets imitating the formal design of the quantum-mechanical contextuality experiments (such as EPR-Bell or Leggett-Garg ones), the conclusion was that contextuality was not present in any of these data sets. Aerts and Sozzo recently announced a new experiment (arXiv:1508.00434) whose results, they claimed, prove the presence of contextuality of the EPR-Bell type (entanglement) in conceptual combinations. We show that their experimental data exhibit no contextuality in the sense of the general definition of contextuality proposed in Dzhafarov, Kujala, and Larsson (Foundation of Physics 7, 762-782, 2015), while the traditional, narrow definition of contextuality does not apply to their data because they violate the condition of consistent connectedness (also known as marginal selectivity, no-signaling condition, no-disturbance principle, etc.). To circumvent the latter problem Aerts and Sozzo transform their experimental data using a computational procedure that makes all marginal probabilities equal to one half. We argue that this procedure is unjustifiable. It only works because it turns out to be a special version of the "depolarization" procedure described by Masanes, Acin, and Gisin (Physical Review A 73, 012112, 2006). Because this "correction" of probabilities is universally applicable, a definition of contextuality that would allow it would amount to simply ignoring marginal probabilities altogether. This would make the concept of contextuality trivial if not entirely empty.

abstract: An efficient numerical method is developed using the matrix product formalism for computing the properties at finite energy densities in one-dimensional (1D) many-body localized (MBL) systems. Arguing that any efficient (possibly quantum) algorithm can only have a polynomially small energy resolution, we propose a (rigorous) polynomial-time (classical) algorithm that outputs a diagonal density operator supported on a microcanonical ensemble of an inverse polynomial bandwidth. The proof uses no other conditions for MBL but assumes that the effect of any local perturbation (e.g., injecting conserved charges) is restricted to a region whose radius grows logarithmically with time. A non-optimal version of this algorithm efficiently simulates the quantum phase estimation algorithm in 1D MBL systems; a heuristic version of the algorithm can be easily coded and used to, e.g., detect energy-tuned dynamical quantum phase transitions between MBL phases. We extend the algorithm to two and higher spatial dimensions using the projected entangled pair formalism.

abstract: The Lieb-Liniger model describes one-dimensional bosons interacting through a repulsive contact potential. In this work, we introduce an extended version of this model by replacing the contact potential with a decaying exponential. Using the recently developed continuous matrix product states techniques, we explore the ground state phase diagram of this model by examining the superfluid and density correlation functions. At weak coupling superfluidity governs the ground state, in a similar way as in the Lieb-Liniger model. However, at strong coupling quasi-crystal and super-Tonks-Girardeau regimes are also found, which are not present in the original Lieb-Liniger case. Therefore the presence of the exponentially-decaying potential leads to a superfluid/super-Tonks-Girardeau/quasi-crystal crossover, when tuning the coupling strength from weak to strong interactions. This corresponds to a Luttinger liquid parameter in the range $K \in (0, \infty)$; in contrast with the Lieb-Liniger model, where $K \in [1, \infty)$, and the screened long-range potential, where $K \in (0, 1]$.

abstract: The quantized lateral motional states and the spin states of electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed as basic building blocks of a scalable quantum computer. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) allows strong dipole coupling between electrons and a high-Q superconducting microwave resonator, enabling such sensitive detection and manipulation of electron degrees of freedom. Here we present the first realization of a hybrid circuit in which a large number of electrons are trapped on the surface of superfluid helium inside a coplanar waveguide resonator. The high finesse of the resonator allows us to observe large dispersive shifts that are many times the linewidth and make fast and sensitive measurements on the collective vibrational modes of the electron ensemble, as well as the superfluid helium film underneath. Furthermore, a large ensemble coupling is observed in the dispersive regime during experiment, and it shows excellent agreement with our numeric model. The coupling strength of the ensemble to the cavity is found to be >1 MHz per electron, indicating the feasibility of achieving single electron strong coupling.

abstract: On-demand creation of entanglement between distant qubits is desirable for quantum communication devices but so far not available for superconducting qubits. We propose an entanglement scheme that allows for single-shot deterministic entanglement creation by detecting a single photon passing through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one transmon qubit in each arm. The entanglement production essentially relies on the fact that superconducting microwave structures allow to achieve strong coupling between the qubit and the photon. By detecting the photon via a photon counter, a parity measurement is implemented and the wave function of the two qubits is projected onto a maximally entangled state. Moreover, due to the indivisible nature of single photons, our scheme promises full security for entanglement-based quantum key distribution.

This allows for probe times longer than the laser coherence time, avoids the Dick effect, and supports Heisenberg-limited scaling of measurement precision. We present a model for such frequency comparisons and develop numerical simulations of the protocol with realistic noise sources. This provides a route to reduce frequency ratio measurement durations by more than an order of magnitude as clock inaccuracies reach 1x10^-18.

abstract: Understanding the decoherence of electron spins in semiconductors due to their interaction with nuclear spins is of fundamental interest as they realize the central spin model and of practical importance for using electron spins as qubits. Interesting effects arise from the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear spins with electric field gradients, which have been shown to suppress diffusive nuclear spin dynamics. One might thus expect them to enhance electron spin coherence. Here we show experimentally that for gate-defined GaAs quantum dots, quadrupolar broadening of the nuclear Larmor precession can also reduce electron spin coherence due to faster decorrelation of transverse nuclear fields. However, this effect can be eliminated for appropriate field directions. Furthermore, we observe an additional modulation of spin coherence that can be attributed to an anisotropic electronic $g$-tensor. These results complete our understanding of dephasing in gated quantum dots and point to mitigation strategies. They may also help to unravel unexplained behaviour in related systems such as self-assembled quantum dots and III-V nanowires.

abstract: The mechanical properties of light have found widespread use in the manipulation of gas-phase atoms and ions, helping create new states of matter and realize complex quantum interactions. The field of cavity-optomechanics strives to scale this interaction to much larger, even human-sized mechanical objects. Going beyond the canonical Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, here we explore a new paradigm in which multiple cavity-optomechanical elements are wired together to form optomechanical circuits. Using a pair of optomechanical cavities coupled together via a phonon waveguide we demonstrate a tunable delay and filter for microwave-over-optical signal processing. In addition, we realize a tight-binding form of mechanical coupling between distant optomechanical cavities, leading to direct phonon exchange without dissipation in the waveguide. These measurements indicate the feasibility of phonon-routing based information processing in optomechanical crystal circuitry, and further, to the possibility of realizing topological phases of photons and phonons in optomechanical cavity lattices.

abstract: We study the effect that the amount of correlation in a bipartite distribution has on the communication complexity of a problem under that distribution. We introduce a new family of complexity measures that interpolates between the two previously studied extreme cases: the (standard) randomised communication complexity and the case of distributional complexity under product distributions. We give a tight characterisation of the randomised complexity of Disjointness under distributions with mutual information $k$, showing that it is $\Theta(\sqrt{n(k+1)})$ for all $0\leq k\leq n$. This smoothly interpolates between the lower bounds of Babai, Frankl and Simon for the product distribution case ($k=0$), and the bound of Razborov for the randomised case. The upper bounds improve and generalise what was known for product distributions, and imply that any tight bound for Disjointness needs $\Omega(n)$ bits of mutual information in the corresponding distribution. We study the same question in the distributional quantum setting, and show a lower bound of $\Omega((n(k+1))^{1/4})$, and an upper bound, matching up to a logarithmic factor. We show that there are total Boolean functions $f_d$ on $2n$ inputs that have distributional communication complexity $O(\log n)$ under all distributions of information up to $o(n)$, while the (interactive) distributional complexity maximised over all distributions is $\Theta(\log d)$ for $6n\leq d\leq 2^{n/100}$. We show that in the setting of one-way communication under product distributions, the dependence of communication cost on the allowed error $\epsilon$ is multiplicative in $\log(1/\epsilon)$ -- the previous upper bounds had the dependence of more than $1/\epsilon$.

abstract: Although substantial progress has been achieved in solving quantum impurity problems, the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method generally performs poorly when applied to quantum lattice systems in a real-space blocking form. The approach was thought to be unpromising for most lattice systems owing to its flaw in dealing with the boundaries of the block. Here the discovery of intrinsic prescriptions to cure interblock interactions is reported which clears up the boundary obstacle and is expected to reopen the application of NRG to quantum lattice systems. While the resulting RG transformation turns out to be strict in the thermodynamic limit, benchmark tests of the algorithm on a one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet and a two-dimensional tight-binding model demonstrate its numerical efficiency in resolving low-energy spectra for the lattice systems.

abstract: Environmental two-level systems (TLS) have been identified as significant decoherence sources in Josephson junction (JJ) based circuits. For such quantum devices to be functional, the removal or control of the TLS is a necessity. Understanding the microscopic origins of the 'strongly coupled' TLS type is one current path of investigation to that end. The delocalized oxygen model suggests the atomic position of an oxygen atom is spatially delocalized in the oxide forming the JJ barrier. In this report we extend this model from its previous 2+1D construction to a complete 3D description using a Wick-rotated time-dependent Schrodinger equation to solve for time-independent solutions in three dimensions. We compute experimentally observable parameters for phase qubits and compare the results to the 2+1D framework. We devise a Voronoi classification scheme to investigate oxygen atoms delocalizing within strained and non-strained crystalline lattices, as well as realistic atomic positions a JJ amorphous tunnel barrier constructed in previous density functional studies.

The error decays almost exponentially in the size of the neighbourhood and grows with the square of the area~$\vert \partial X\vert^2$.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the backaction of a sensor quantum dot with strong local Coulomb repulsion on the transient dynamics of a qubit that is probed capacitively. We show that the measurement backaction induced by the noise of electron cotunneling through the sensor is surprisingly mitigated by the recently identified coherent backaction [PRB 89, 195405] arising from quantum fluctuations. This renormalization effect is missing in semiclassical stochastic fluctuator models and typically also in Born-Markov approaches, which try to avoid the calculation of the nonstationary, nonequilibrium state of the qubit plus sensor. Technically, we integrate out the current-carrying electrodes to obtain kinetic equations for the joint, nonequilibrium detector-qubit dynamics. We show that the sensor-current response, level renormalization, cotunneling, and leading non-Markovian corrections always appear together and cannot be turned off individually in an experiment or ignored theoretically. We analyze the backaction on the reduced qubit state - capturing the full non-Markovian effects imposed by the sensor quantum dot on the qubit - by applying a Liouville-space decomposition into quasistationary and rapidly decaying modes. Importantly, the sensor cannot be eliminated completely even in the simplest high-temperature, weak-measurement limit: The qubit state experiences an initial slip that persists over many qubit cycles and depends on the initial preparation of qubit plus sensor quantum dot. A quantum-dot sensor can thus not be modeled as a 'black box' without accounting for its dynamical variables. We furthermore find that the Bloch vector relaxes (T1) along an axis that is not orthogonal to the plane in which the Bloch vector dephases (T2), blurring the notions of T1 and T2 times. Finally, the precessional motion of the Bloch vector is distorted into an ellipse in the tilted dephasing plane.

abstract: Fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, formed by micro-machined mirrors on the end-facets of optical fibers, are used in an increasing number of technical and scientific applications, where they typically require precise stabilization of their optical resonances. Here, we study two different approaches to construct fiber Fabry-Perot resonators and stabilize their length for experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics with neutral atoms. A piezo-mechanically actuated cavity with feedback based on the Pound-Drever-Hall locking technique is compared to a novel rigid cavity design that makes use of the high passive stability of a monolithic cavity spacer and employs thermal self-locking and external temperature tuning. Furthermore, we present a general analysis of the mode matching problem in fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, which explains the asymmetry in their reflective line shapes and has important implications for the optimal alignment of the fiber resonators. Finally, we discuss the issue of fiber-generated background photons. We expect that our results contribute towards the integration of high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities into compact and robust quantum-enabled devices in the future.

abstract: Significant work has gone into determining the minimal set of entropy inequalities that determine the holographic entropy cone. Holographic systems with three or more parties have been shown to obey additional inequalities that generic quantum systems do not. We consider a two dimensional conformal field theory that is a single boundary of a holographic system and find four additional non-linear inequalities which are derived from strong subadditivity and the formula for the entanglement entropy of a region on the conformal field theory. We also present an equality obtained by application of a hyperbolic extension of Ptolemy's theorem to a two dimensional conformal field theory.

abstract: We report our theoretical and experimental investigation of chirped zero-area pulse interaction with a two-state system. With femto-second laser pulses shaped to have a frequency chirp and a spectral hole at resonance, we demonstrate three major coherent dynamics in two-state systems: zero-area pulse excitations, Rabi-like oscillations, and rapid adiabatic passage. The underlying mechanism behind these rich coherent phenomena is the interplay between the adiabatic evolution and the Rabi-like evolution, respectively, induced by the chirp and the spectral hole. The result suggests that a Rabi-like oscillation can be embedded in an adiabatic evolution, offering a new control scheme towards selective excitation in multi-state quantum systems.

abstract: Quantum trapping potentials for ultracold gases change the landscape of classical properties of scattered light and matter. The atoms in a quantum many-body correlated phase of matter change the properties of light and vice versa. The properties of both light and matter can be tuned by design and depend on the interplay between long-range (nonlocal) interactions mediated by an optical cavity and short-range processes of the atoms. Moreover, the quantum properties of light get significantly altered by this interplay, leading the light to have nonclassical features. Further, these nonclassical features can be designed and optimised.

abstract: We study random matrices acting on tensor product spaces which have been transformed by a linear block operation. Using operator-valued free probability theory, under some mild assumptions on the linear map acting on the blocks, we compute the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the modified matrices in terms of the initial asymptotic distribution. Moreover, using recent results on operator-valued subordination, we present an algorithm that computes, numerically but in full generality, the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the modified matrices. Our analytical results cover many cases of interest in quantum information theory: we unify some known results and we obtain new distributions and various generalizations.

abstract: We report Ramsey interference in the excitonic population of a negatively charged quantum dot revealing the coherence of the state in the limit where radiative decay is dominant. Our experiments show that the decay time of the Ramsey interference is limited by the spectral width of the transition. Applying a vertical magnetic field induces Zeeman split transitions that can be addressed by changing the laser detuning to reveal 2, 3 and 4 level system behaviour. We show that under finite field the phase-sensitive control of two optical pulses from a single laser can be used to prepare both population and spin qubits simultaneously.

abstract: We obtain thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) from exact quantum dynamics via Matsubara dynamics, a recently-derived form of linearization which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. Performing a contour integral in the complex quantum Boltzmann distribution of Matsubara dynamics, replacement of the imaginary Liouvillian which results with a Fokker-Planck term gives TRPMD. We thereby provide error terms between TRPMD and quantum dynamics and predict the systems in which they are likely to be small. Using a harmonic analysis we show that careful addition of friction causes the correct oscillation frequency of the higher ring-polymer normal modes in a harmonic well, which we illustrate with calculation of the position-squared autocorrelation function. However, no physical friction parameter will produce the correct fluctuation dynamics for a parabolic barrier. The results in this paper are consistent with previous numerical studies and advise the use of TRPMD for the computation of spectra.

abstract: A quantum-mechanical analysis of hyper-fast (faster than ballistic) diffusion of a quantum wave packet in random optical lattices is presented. The main motivation of the presented analysis is experimental demonstrations of hyper-diffusive spreading of a wave packet in random photonic lattices [L. Levi \textit{et al.}, Nature Phys. \textbf{8}, 912 (2012)]. A rigorous quantum-mechanical calculation of the mean probability amplitude is suggested, and it is shown that the power law spreading of the mean squared displacement (MSD) is $< x^2(t)>\sim t^{\alpha}$, where $2<\alpha\leq 3$. The values of the transport exponent $\alpha$ depend on the correlation properties of the random potential $V(x,t)$, which describes random inhomogeneities of the medium. In particular, when the random potential is $\delta$ correlated in time, the quantum wave packet spreads according Richardson turbulent diffusion with the MSD $\sim t^3$. Hyper-diffusion with $\alpha=12/5$ is also obtained for arbitrary correlation properties of the random potential.

We investigate how well the theories assuming strong interaction and/or many particles compare with results for finite interactions and finite particle numbers. Thus we try to answer the questions of how strong is strong interaction, and how many is many particles in this context. We also make a comparison of different models to recent experimental results with few-atom systems.

abstract: The possibility that quantum processing with nuclear spins might be operative in the brain is proposed and then explored. Phosphorus is identified as the unique biological element with a nuclear spin that can serve as a qubit for such putative quantum processing - a neural qubit - while the phosphate ion is the only possible qubit-transporter. We identify the "Posner molecule", $\text{Ca}_9 (\text{PO}_4)_6$, as the unique molecule that can protect the neural qubits on very long times and thereby serve as a (working) quantum-memory. A central requirement for quantum-processing is quantum entanglement. It is argued that the enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction which breaks a pyrophosphate ion into two phosphate ions can quantum entangle pairs of qubits. Posner molecules, formed by binding such phosphate pairs with extracellular calcium ions, will inherit the nuclear spin entanglement. A mechanism for transporting Posner molecules into presynaptic neurons during a "kiss and run" exocytosis, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, is proposed. Quantum measurements can occur when a pair of Posner molecules chemically bind and subsequently melt, releasing a shower of intra-cellular calcium ions that can trigger further neurotransmitter release and enhance the probability of post-synaptic neuron firing. Multiple entangled Posner molecules, triggering non-local quantum correlations of neuron firing rates, would provide the key mechanism for neural quantum processing. Implications, both in vitro and in vivo, are briefly mentioned.

abstract: In this article, we show that eigenenergies and eigenstates of a system consisting of four one-dimensional hard-core particles with masses $6m$, $2m$, $m$, and $3m$ in a hard-wall box can be found exactly using Bethe Ansatz. The Ansatz is based on the exceptional affine reflection group $\tilde{F}_{4}$ associated with the symmetries and tiling properties of an octacube---a Platonic solid unique to four dimensions, with no three-dimensional analogues. We also uncover the Liouville integrability structure of our problem: the four integrals of motion in involution are identified as invariant polynomials of the finite reflection group $F_{4}$, taken as functions of the components of momenta.

abstract: The Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorems of bijectivity between the external scalar potential and the gauge invariant nondegenerate ground state density, and the consequent Euler variational principle for the density, are proved for arbitrary electrostatic field and the constraint of fixed electron number. The HK theorems are generalized for spinless electrons to the added presence of an external uniform magnetostatic field by introducing the new constraint of fixed canonical orbital angular momentum. Thereby a bijective relationship between the external scalar and vector potentials, and the gauge invariant nondegenerate ground state density and physical current density, is proved. A corresponding Euler variational principle in terms of these densities is also developed. These theorems are further generalized to electrons with spin by imposing the added constraint of fixed canonical orbital and spin angular momentum. The proofs differ from the original HK proof, and explicitly account for the many-to-one relationship between the potentials and the nondegenerate ground state wave function.

Three sets of four or five days measurements as well as systematic uncertainty of the clock at $8.6\times 10^{-17}$ have resulted in an absolute frequency of $^{87}{\rm Sr}\ {}^1S_0 - {}^3P_0$ clock transition to be 429 228 004 229 872.85 (47) Hz.

abstract: The efficiency of laser-cooling relies on the existence of an almost closed optical-transition cycle in the energy spectrum of the considered species. In this respect rare-earth elements exhibit many transitions which are likely to induce noticeable leaks from the cooling cycle. In this work, to determine whether laser-cooling of singly-ionized erbium Er$^+$ is feasible, we have performed accurate electronic-structure calculations of energies and spontaneous-emission Einstein coefficients of Er$^+$, using a combination of \textit{ab initio} and least-square-fitting techniques. We identify five weak closed transitions suitable for laser-cooling, the broadest of which is in the kilohertz range. For the strongest transitions, by simulating the cascade dynamics of spontaneous emission, we show that repumping is necessary, and we discuss possible repumping schemes. We expect our detailed study on Er$^+$ to give a good insight into laser-cooling of neighboring ions like Dy$^+$.

abstract: Using the multipolar expansion of electrostatic and magnetostatic potential energies, we characterize the long-range interactions between two weakly-bound diatomic molecules, taking as an example the paramagnetic Er$_2$ Feshbach molecules which were produced recently. Since inside each molecule, individual atoms conserve their identity, the intermolecular potential energy can be expanded as the sum of pairwise atomic potential energies. In the case of Er$_2$ Feshbach molecules, we show that the interaction between atomic magnetic dipoles gives rise to the usual $R^{-3}$ term of the multipolar expansion, with $R$ the intermolecular distance, but also to additional terms scaling as $R^{-5}$, $R^{-7}$, and so on. Those terms are due to the interaction between effective molecular multipole moments, and are strongly anisotropic with respect to the orientation of the molecules. Similarly the atomic pairwise van der Waals interaction results in $R^{-6}$, $R^{-8}$, ... terms in the intermolecular potential energy. By calculating the reduced electric-quadrupole moment of erbium ground level $\langle J=6||\hat{Q}_2||J=6\rangle = -1.305$ a.u., we also demonstrate that the electric-quadrupole interaction energy is negligible with respect to the magnetic-dipole and van der Waals interaction energies. The general formalism presented in this article can be applied to calculate the long-range potential energy between arbitrary charge distributions composed of almost free subsystems.

The tensor method of projection operators for the calculation of the hyperfine structure of P-states with definite quantum numbers of total atomic momentum F and total muon momentum j in muonic deuterium is formulated. We take into account vacuum polarization, relativistic, quadrupole and structure corrections of orders alpha^4, alpha^5 and alpha^6. The obtained numerical values of hyperfine splittings are useful for the analysis of new experimental data of the CREMA collaboration regarding to muonic deuterium.

abstract: We solve a multi-period portfolio optimization problem using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer. We derive a formulation of the problem, discuss several possible integer encoding schemes, and present numerical examples that show high success rates. The formulation incorporates transaction costs (including permanent and temporary market impact), and, significantly, the solution does not require the inversion of a covariance matrix. The discrete multi-period portfolio optimization problem we solve is significantly harder than the continuous variable problem. We present insight into how results may be improved using suitable software enhancements, and why current quantum annealing technology limits the size of problem that can be successfully solved today. The formulation presented is specifically designed to be scalable, with the expectation that as quantum annealing technology improves, larger problems will be solvable using the same techniques.

abstract: We investigate how nontrivial topology affects the entanglement dynamics between a detector and a quantum field and between two detectors mediated by a quantum field. Nontrivial topology refers to both that of the base space and that of the bundle. Using a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt-like detector model interacting with a quantum scalar field in an Einstein cylinder S1 (space) x R1 (time), we see the beating behaviors in the dynamics of the detector-field entanglement and the detector-detector entanglement, which distinguish from the results in the non-compact (1+1) dimensional Minkowski space. The beat patterns of entanglement dynamics in an untwisted and twisted fields with the same parameter values are different simply because of different spectrum of the eigen-modes. In terms of the physically measurable momentum of the detectors, we find that the contribution by the zero mode in a normal field to entanglement dynamics has no qualitative difference from those by the nonzero modes.

abstract: Zitterbewegung, as it was originally described by Schr\"odinger, is an unphysical, non-observable effect. We verify whether the effect can be observed in non-inertial reference frames/curved spacetimes, where the ambiguity in defining particle states results in a mixing of positive and negative frequency modes. We explicitly demonstrate that such a mixing is in fact necessary to obtain the correct classical value for a particle's velocity in a uniformly accelerated reference frame, whereas in cosmological spacetime a particle does indeed exhibit Zitterbewegung.

abstract: Electronic excitations in metallic nanoparticles in the optical regime that have been of great importance in surface enhanced spectroscopy and emerging applications of molecular plasmonics, due to control and confinement of electromagnetic energy, may also be of potential to control the motion of nanoparticles and molecules. Here, we propose a concept for trapping polarizable particles and molecules using toroidal metallic nanoparticles. Specifically, gold nanorings are investigated for their scattering properties and field distribution to computationally show that the response of these optically resonant particles to incident photons permit the formation of a nanoscale trap when proper aspect ratio, photon wavelength and polarization are considered. However, interestingly the resonant plasmonic response of the nanoring is shown to be detrimental to the trap formation. The results are in good agreement with analytic calculations in the quasi-static limit within the first-order perturbation of the scalar electric potential. The possibility of extending the single nanoring trapping properties to two-dimensional arrays of nanorings is suggested by obtaining the field distribution of nanoring dimers and trimers.

For example, relevant quantities such as molecular alignment and orientation, calculated numerically by using large basis sets, have lately appeared in the literature. In this work, based on our recent exact solution to an effective eight-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian for the molecular ground state, we present analytic expressions for the stereochemical properties of OH. Our results require the solution of algebraic equations only, agree well with the aforementioned fully numerical calculations, provide compact expressions for simple field geometries, allow ready access to relatively unexplored parameter space, and yield straightforwardly higher moments of the molecular axis distribution.

abstract: Theoretical prediction of phonon transport in modern semiconductor nanodevices requires atomic resolution of device features and quantum transport models covering coherent and incoherent effects. The nonequilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) is known to serve this purpose very well, but is numerically very expensive. This work extends the very efficient B\"uttiker probe concept to phonon NEGF and discusses all implications of this method. B\"uttiker probe parameters are presented that reproduce within NEGF experimental phonon conductances of Si and Ge between 10K and 1000K. Results of this method in SiGe heterojunctions illustrate the impact of interface relaxation on the device heat conductance and the importance of inelastic scattering for the phonon distribution.

abstract: Manipulating the flow of energy in nanoscale and molecular photonic devices is of both fundamental interest and central importance for applications in light harvesting optoelectronics. Under erratic solar irradiance conditions, unregulated power fluctuations in a light harvesting photocell lead to inefficient energy storage in conventional solar cells and potentially fatal oxidative damage in photosynthesis. Here, we show that regulation against these fluctuations arises naturally within a two-channel quantum heat engine photocell, thus enabling the efficient conversion of varying incident solar spectrum at Earth's surface. Remarkably, absorption in the green portion of the spectrum is avoided, as it provides no inherent regulatory benefit. Our findings illuminate a quantum structural origin of regulation, provide a novel optoelectronic design strategy, and may elucidate the link between photoprotection in photosynthesis and the predominance of green plants on Earth.

abstract: We realize tunable coupling between two superconducting transmission line resonators. The coupling is mediated by a non-hysteretic rf SQUID acting as a flux-tunable mutual inductance between the resonators. From the mode distance observed in spectroscopy experiments, we derive a coupling strength ranging between -320MHz and 37 MHz. In the case where the coupling strength is about zero, the microwave power cross transmission between the two resonators can be reduced by almost four orders of magnitude compared to the case where the coupling is switched on. In addition, we observe parametric amplification by applying a suitable additional drive tone.

Due to the thermal assistance, the Kane model parameters get modified, which consequently modulate the spin orbit coupling(SOC). This modified SOC causes the spin current to change in a finite amount.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.06857
abstract: It is will known that quantum field theory at the formal level is gauge invariant. However a calculation of the vacuum polarization tensor will include non-gauge invariant terms. These terms must be removed from the calculation in order to get a physically correct result. One common way to do this today is the technique of "dimensional regularization". It has recently been noted [2] that at one time a supersymmetric-like solution to the problem was explored - that is, the right combination of fields would cause the offending terms to cancel out. I will examine some of this early work and pose the question - why do the non-gauge invariant terms appear in the first place? I will show that this is due to an improper mathematical step in the formulation of the pertubative expansion. I will then show that when this step is corrected the result is gauge invariant. However a supersymmetric-like solution is still required to cancel out a divergent term.

abstract: Ordered phases in Landau paradigm can be diagnosed by a local order parameter, whereas topologically ordered phases cannot be detected in such a way. In this paper, we propose long-range mutual information(LRMI) as a unified diagnostic for both conventional long-range order and topological order. Using the LRMI, we characterize orders in $n+1$D gapped systems as $m$-membrane condensates with $ 0 \leq m \leq n-1$. The familiar conventional order and 2+1D topological orders are respectively identified as $0$-membrane and $1$-membrane condensates. We propose and study the topological uncertainty principle, which describes the non-commuting nature of non-local order parameters in topological orders.

abstract: Classical statistical physics has developed a powerful set of tools for analyzing complex systems, chief among them complex networks, in which connectivity and topology predominate over other system features. Complex networks model systems as diverse as the brain and the internet; however, they have had little application to quantum systems, till now. Framing connectivity in terms of quantum non-locality, we bring complex network theory into the quantum realm via an adjacency matrix constructed from mutual information, or long-range entanglement. Using matrix-product-state computational methods, we apply this new set of quantum tools to an emergent feature, quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate rapid finite size-scaling for both transverse Ising and Bose-Hubbard models, including $Z_2$, mean field, and BKT transitions. This work opens the door for a new set of tools for complex quantum systems, as well as providing an operator-independent alternative approach to the study of critical phenomena.

abstract: We propose the algorithm for determining vibrational quantum eigenstates of periodic linear chain of atoms coupled by harmonic and third order anharmonic interactions (Fermi-Ulam-Pasta $\alpha$ problem) in the long wavelength limit within the resonant approach. Eigenstates can be encoded by the sequence of integer numbers determining their energies and wavefunctions. Using these eigenstates we described a single phonon state time evolution showing coherent oscillations. The applications of theory to vibrational energy transport and quantum informatics are discussed.

The Small Photon Entangling Quantum System is an integrated instrument where the pump, photon pair source and detectors are combined within a single optical tray and electronics package that is no larger than 10 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm. This footprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the CubeLab structure aboard the International Space Station.

This footprint enables the instrument to be placed onboard nanosatellites or the CubeLab facility within the International Space Station. The first mission is to understand the different environmental conditions that may affect the operation of an entangled photon source in low Earth orbit. This understanding is crucial for the construction of cost-effective entanglement based experiments that utilize nanosatellite architecture.

abstract: A quantum heat engine of a specific type is studied. This engine contains a single particle confined in the infinite square well potential with variable width and consists of three processes: the isoenergetic process (which has no classical analogs) as well as the isothermal and adiabatic processes. It is found that the engine possesses exotic properties in its performance. The efficiency takes the maximum value when the engine size is appropriately set, and, in addition, the lower the temperature is, the higher the efficiency becomes, highlighting aspects of the influence of quantum effects on thermodynamics. A comment is also made on the relevance of this engine to that of Carnot.

abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of a microwave cavity as a mediator of interactions between two resonant exchange (RX) qubits in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) over long distances, limited only by the extension of the cavity. Our interaction model includes the orthonormalized Wannier orbitals constructed from Fock-Darwin states under the assumption of a harmonic QD confinement potential. We calculate the qubit-cavity coupling strength $g_r$ in a Jaynes Cummings Hamiltonian, and find that dipole transitions between two states with an asymmetric charge configuration constitute the relevant RX qubit-cavity coupling mechanism. The effective coupling between two RX qubits in a shared cavity yields a universal two-qubit iSWAP-gate with gate times on the order of nanoseconds over distances on the order of up to a millimeter.

abstract: One-dimensional multi-component Fermi or Bose systems with strong zero-range interactions can be described in terms of local exchange coefficients and mapping the problem into a spin model is thus possible. For arbitrary external confining potentials the local exchanges are given by highly non-trivial geometric factors that depend solely on the geometry of the confinement through the single-particle eigenstates of the external potential. To obtain accurate effective Hamiltonians to describe such systems one needs to be able to compute these geometric factors with high precision which is difficult due to the computational complexity of the high-dimensional integrals involved. An approach using the local density approximation would therefore be a most welcome approximation due to its simplicity. Here we assess the accuracy of the local density approximation by going beyond the simple harmonic oscillator that has been the focus of previous studies and consider some double-wells of current experimental interest. We find that the local density approximation works quite well as long as the potentials resemble harmonic wells but break down for larger barriers. In order to explore the consequences of applying the local density approximation in a concrete setup we consider quantum state transfer in the effective spin models that one obtains. Here we find that even minute deviations in the local exchange coefficients between the exact and the local density approximation can induce large deviations in the fidelity of state transfer for four, five, and six particles.

abstract: A prominent example of a topologically ordered system is Kitaev's quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for finite groups $G$ (which in particular includes $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$, the toric code). We will look at these models from the point of view of local quantum physics. In particular, we will review how in the abelian case, one can do a Doplicher-Haag-Roberts analysis to study the different superselection sectors of the model. In this way one finds that the charges are in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of $\mathcal{D}(G)$, and that they are in fact anyons. Interchanging two of such anyons gives a non-trivial phase, not just a possible sign change. The case of non-abelian groups $G$ is more complicated. We outline how one could use amplimorphisms, that is, morphisms $A \to M_n(A)$ to study the superselection structure in that case. Finally, we give a brief overview of applications of topologically ordered systems to the field of quantum computation.

abstract: We build the first analytic empirical potential for the most deeply bound $\mbox{Li}_{2}$ state: $b\left(1^{3}\Pi_{u}\right)$. Our potential is based on experimental energy transitions covering $v=0-34$, and very high precision theoretical long-range constants. It provides high accuracy predictions up to $v=100$ which pave the way for high-precision long-range measurements, and hopefully an eventual resolution of the age old discrepancy between experiment and theory for the $\mbox{Li}\left(2^{2}S\right)+\mbox{Li}\left(2^{2}P\right)$ $C_{3}$ value. State of the art ab initio calculations predict vibrational energy spacings that are all in at most 0.8 cm$^{-1}$ disagreement with the empirical potential.

abstract: The two-point function and VEV of the current density are investigated for a massive charged scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in the geometry of a brane on background of AdS spacetime with partial toroidal compactification.The presence of a gauge field flux enclosed by compact dimensions is assumed.On the brane the field obeys Robin boundary condition and along compact dimensions periodicity conditions with general phases are imposed.There is a range in the space of values for the coefficient in the boundary condition where Poincare vacuum is unstable.This range depends on the brane location.In models with compact dimensions the stability condition is less restrictive than for AdS bulk with trivial topology.Vacuum charge density and components of current along non-compact dimensions vanish. VEV of the current density along compact dimensions is a periodic function of the gauge field flux with a period equal to the flux quantum.It is decomposed into the boundary-free and brane-induced contributions.The asymptotic behavior of the latter is investigated near the brane, AdS boundary and horizon.In contrast to VEVs of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor, current density is finite on brane and vanishes for the special case of Dirichlet boundary condition.Both boundary-free and brane-induced contributions vanish on AdS boundary.Brane-induced contribution vanishes on the horizon and for points near the horizon the current is dominated by the boundary-free part.In the near-horizon limit, the latter is connected to the corresponding quantity for a massless field in the Minkowski bulk by a simple conformal relation.Depending on the value of the Robin coefficient, the presence of the brane can either increase or decrease the vacuum currents. Applications are given for a higher-dimensional version of the Randall-Sundrum 1-brane model

abstract: The many-body localization transition (MBLT) between ergodic and many-body localized phase in disordered interacting systems is a subject of much recent interest. Statistics of eigenenergies is known to be a powerful probe of crossovers between ergodic and integrable systems in simpler examples of quantum chaos. We consider the evolution of the spectral statistics across the MBLT, starting with mapping to a Brownian motion process that analytically relates the spectral properties to the statistics of matrix elements. We demonstrate that the flow from Wigner-Dyson to Poisson statistics is a two-stage process. First, fractal enhancement of matrix elements upon approaching the MBLT from the metallic side produces an effective power-law interaction between energy levels, and leads to a plasma model for level statistics. At the second stage, the gas of eigenvalues has local interaction and level statistics belongs to a semi-Poisson universality class. We verify our findings numerically on the XXZ spin chain. We provide a microscopic understanding of the level statistics across the MBLT and discuss implications for the transition that are strong constraints on possible theories.

abstract: We investigate the behavior of the local quantum uncertainty (LQU) between a block of L qubits and one single qubit in a composite system of n qubits driven through a quantum phase transition (QPT). In this scenario, we provide an analysis of the scaling of the LQU at a first-order and a second-order QPT. For a first-order QPT, we consider a Hamiltonian implementation of the quantum search through a space of N=2^n elements. By analytical evaluation, we show that the LQU exponentially saturates to a constant value at the critical point as we increase the block length L, with the saturation enhanced by the system size n. On the other hand, at non-critical points, the LQU tends to vanish for large n. In the case of second-order QPTs, we consider the transverse-field Ising model with open boundary conditions. By implementing a numerical analysis via density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we show that the concavity of the LQU as a function of the block size L characterizes the QPT. For both first-order and second-order QPTs, we also consider the LQU as a function of the coupling parameter, showing that the LQU exhibits a pronounced behavior at the quantum critical point for fixed block sizes of L qubits.

abstract: We demonstrate a method to extend the range of pulsed laser spin noise measurements to long spin lifetimes. We use an analog time-domain detection scheme with a bandwidth limited only by laser pulse duration. Our model uses statistics and Bloch-Torrey equations to extract the Lande g-factor, Faraday cross-section $\sigma_F$, and spin lifetime $\tau_S$, while accounting for finite detector response. Varying the magnetic field with a fixed probe-probe delay yields $\tau_S$ when it is longer than the laser repetition period. Varying the probe-probe delay with a fixed field produces a time-domain measurement of the correlation function.

abstract: The exciton binding energy, the energy required to dissociate an excited electron-hole pair into free charge carriers, is one of the key factors to the optoelectronic performance of organic materials. However, it remains unclear whether modern quantum-mechanical calculations, mostly based on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), are reliably accurate for exciton binding energies. In this study, the exciton binding energies and related optoelectronic properties (e.g., the ionization potentials, electron affinities, fundamental gaps, and optical gaps) of 121 small- to medium-sized molecules are calculated using KS-DFT and TDDFT with various density functionals. Our KS-DFT and TDDFT results are compared with those calculated using highly accurate CCSD and EOM-CCSD methods, respectively. The omegaB97, omegaB97X, and omegaB97X-D functionals are shown to generally outperform (with a mean absolute error of 0.36 eV) other functionals for the properties investigated.

abstract: The method for quantization of constrained theories that was suggested originally by Faddeev and Jackiw along with later modifications is discussed. The particular emphasis of this paper is to show how it is simple to implement their method within the path integral framework using the natural geometric structure that their method utilizes. The procedure is exemplified with the analysis of two models: a quantum mechanical particle constrained to a surface (of which the hypersphere is a special case), and a quantized Schr\"odinger field interacting with a quantized vector field for both the massive and the massless cases. The results are shown to agree with what is found using the Dirac method for constrained path integrals. We comment on a previous path integral analysis of the Faddeev-Jackiw method. We also discuss why a previous criticism of the Faddeev-Jackiw method is unfounded and why suggested modifications of their method are unnecessary.

abstract: The dielectric properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) have previously been reported from room temperature to low temperatures with conflicting results. In this work, precision measurement of the permittivity is undertaken by simultaneously measuring transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes within a single crystal. It is unequivocally shown that the permittivity is isotropic at room temperature with a permittivity of order $316.3\pm2.2$ by measuring multiple modes of different electric field polarisations. As the crystal is cooled to 5 K and undergoes well known phase transitions, we show the material becomes uniaxial anisotropic with the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular permittivity to the cylinder z-axis of the sample as high as 2.4 below 6 K.

abstract: We present a numerical approach to calculate non-equilibrium eigenstates of a periodically time-modulated quantum system. The approach is based on the use of a chain of single-step time-independent propagating operators. Each operator is time-specific and constructed by combining the Magnus expansion of the time-dependent system Hamiltonian with the Chebyshev expansion of an operator exponent. A construction of a unitary matrix of the Floquet operator, which evolves a system state over the full modulation period, is performed by propagating the identity matrix over the period. The independence of the evolutions of basis vectors makes the propagation stage suitable for implementation on a parallel cluster. Once the propagation stage is completed, a routine diagonalization of the Floquet matrix is performed. Finally, an additional propagation round, now with the eigenvectors as the initial states, allows to resolve the time-dependence of the Floquet states and calculate their characteristics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm by applying it to calculate the Floquet states of two quantum models, namely (i) a synthesized random-matrix Hamiltonian and (ii) a many-body Bose-Hubbard dimer, both of the size up to $10^4$ states.

abstract: There are several approximations to the exchange-correlation functional in density-functional theory that accurately predict total energy-related properties of many-electron systems, such as binding energies, bond lengths, and crystal structures. Other approximations are designed to describe potential-related processes, such as charge transfer and photoemission. However, the development of a functional which can serve the two purposes simultaneously is a long-standing challenge. Trying to address it, we employ in the current work the ensemble generalization procedure proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 126403 (2013). Focusing on the prediction of the ionization potential via the highest occupied Kohn-Sham eigenvalue, we examine a variety of exchange-correlation approximations: the local spin-density approximation, semi-local generalized gradient approximations, and global and local hybrid functionals. Results for a test set of 26 diatomic molecules and single atoms are presented. We find that the aforementioned ensemble generalization systematically improves the prediction of the ionization potential, for various systems and exchange-correlation functionals, without compromising the accuracy of total energy-related properties. We specifically examine hybrid functionals. These depend on a parameter controlling the ratio of semi-local to non-local functional components. The ionization potential obtained with ensemble-generalized functionals is found to depend only weakly on the parameter value, contrary to common experience with non-generalized hybrids, thus eliminating one aspect of the so-called `parameter dilemma' of hybrid functionals.

abstract: In the Relativistic Quantum Geometry (RQG) formalism recently introduced, was explored the possibility that the variation of the tensor metric can be done in a Weylian-like integrable manifold using a geometric displacement, from a Riemannian to a Weylian-like integrable manifold, described by the dynamics of an auxiliary geometrical scalar field $\theta$, in order that the Einstein tensor (and the Einstein equations) can be represented on a Weyl-like manifold. In this framework we study jointly the dynamics of electromagnetic fields produced by quantum complex vector fields, which describes charges without charges. We demonstrate that complex fields act as a source of tetra-vector fields which describe an extended Maxwell dynamics.

abstract: We consider the defect production of a quantum system, initially prepared in a current-carrying non-equilibrium state, during its unitary driving through a quantum critical point. At low values of the initial current, the quantum Kibble-Zurek scaling for the production of defects is recovered. However, at large values of the initial current, i.e., very far from an initial equilibrium situation, a universal scaling of the defect production is obtained which shows an algebraic dependence with respect to the initial current value. These scaling predictions are demonstrated by the exactly solvable Ising quantum chain where the current-carrying state is selected through the imposition of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction term.

Starting with the Lagrangian of the complete system, we provide an analytical expression for the linear response function for the motion of the resonator. This shows that the resonance frequency and effective dissipation factor can change due to relaxation times of the spin. The same calculations are applied to electromagnetic resonators, providing a key to understand some of the problems of two level systems in quantum computing devices.

After deriving the exact dynamics of the system, we prove that one can effectively describe the exact dynamics by considering a suitable shorter chain. We provide the explicit expression for such an effective dynamics and we provide an upper bound on the error one makes considering it instead of the dynamics of the full chain. We eventually prove how error, timescale and number of modes in the truncated chain are related.

In order to develop a comprehensive description of the charge carriers in these Weyl semimetals, we performed systematic electronic structure calculations which reveal the nature of Fermi surfaces and their complex interconnectivity in TaAs, TaP, NbAs, and NbP. Our work report the first comparative and comprehensive study of Fermi surface topology and band structure details of all known members of the Weyl semimetal family and provide the necessary building blocks for advancing our understanding of their unique topologically protected low-energy Weyl fermion physics.
