abstract: This paper is an investigation of the class of real classical Markov processes without a birth process that will generate the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions. The Markov process is assumed to evolve in an extra (ordinal) time dimension. The derivation requires that occupation by the Dirac particle of a space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector. Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time (including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of observation.
