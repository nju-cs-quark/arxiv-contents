abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) has emerged as the primary tool in quantum algorithms which achieve exponential advantage over classical computation and lies at the heart of the solution to the abelian hidden subgroup problem, of which Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log algorithms are a special case. We begin by addressing various computational issues surrounding the QFT and give improved parallel circuits for both the QFT over a power of 2 and the QFT over an arbitrary cyclic group. These circuits are based on new insight into the relationship between the discrete Fourier transform over different cyclic groups. We then exploit this insight to extend the class of hidden subgroup problems with efficient quantum solutions. First we relax the condition that the underlying hidden subgroup function be distinct on distinct cosets of the subgroup in question and show that this relaxation can be solved whenever G is a finitely-generated abelian group. We then extend this reasoning to the hidden cyclic subgroup problem over the reals, showing how to efficiently generate the bits of the period of any sufficiently piecewise-continuous function on R. Finally, we show that this problem of period-finding over R, viewed as an oracle promise problem, is strictly harder than its integral counterpart. In particular, period-finding over R lies outside the complexity class MA, a class which contains period-finding over the integers.

abstract: A simplified Bogoliubov transform reduces a fully-interacting many-fermion spin-1/2 system-plus-environment to a more tractable many-to-one variant. The transform additionally yields exact solutions for bosonic multi-particle interactions sans the approximation introduced by using discrete time steps to deal with quantum parallelism. The decohering effect of relatively general finite environments is therewith modeled and compared to the decohering effect of an infinite environmental "bath." The anti-symmetric singlet state formed by two maximally-entangled two-state particles is shown to be inherently decoherence-free. As a quantum bit ("qubit") it is thus potentially superior to any single-particle state.

Due to the inherent computational complexity of the problem, an efficient strategy to accomplish this task is desirable, which is presented in the paper. Furthermore, we provide all main steps for the various proofs pertaining to different combinations of triple modes in the orthogonality integral.

abstract: The "pushing gate" proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 2000 for quantum logic in ion traps is discussed, in which a force is used to give a controlled push to a pair of trapped ions and thus realize a phase gate. The original proposal had a weakness in that it involved a hidden extreme sensitivity to the size of the force. Also, the physical origin of this force was not fully addressed. Here, we discuss the sensitivity and present a way to avoid it by choosing the spatial form of the pushing force in an optimal way. We also analyse the effect of imperfections in a pair of pi pulses which are used to implement a "spin-echo" to cancel correlated errors. We present a physical model for the force, namely the dipole force, and discuss the impact of unwanted photon scattering, and of finite temperature of the ions. The main effect of the temperature is to blur the phase of the gate owing to the ions exploring a range of values of the force. When the distance scale of the force profile is smaller than the ion separation, this effect is more important than the high-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion which were originally discussed. Overall, we find that whereas the "pushing gate" is not as resistant to imperfections as was supposed, it remains a significant candidate for ion trap quantum computing since it does not require ground state cooling, and in some cases it does not require the Lamb-Dicke limit, while the gate rate is fast, close to (rather than small compared to) the trap vibrational frequency.

abstract: Identifying the real and imaginary parts of wave functions with coordinates and momenta, quantum evolution may be mapped onto a classical Hamiltonian system. In addition to the symplectic form, quantum mechanics also has a positive-definite real inner product which provides a geometrical interpretation of the measurement process. Together they endow the quantum Hilbert space with the structure of a K\"{a}ller manifold. Quantum control is discussed in this setting. Quantum time-evolution corresponds to smooth Hamiltonian dynamics and measurements to jumps in the phase space. This adds additional power to quantum control, non unitarily controllable systems becoming controllable by ``measurement plus evolution''. A picture of quantum evolution as Hamiltonian dynamics in a classical-like phase-space is the appropriate setting to carry over techniques from classical to quantum control. This is illustrated by a discussion of optimal control and sliding mode techniques.

abstract: We investigate the properties of three entanglement measures that quantify the statistical distinguishability of a given state with the closest disentangled state that has the same reductions as the primary state. In particular, we concentrate on the relative entropy of entanglement with reversed entries. We show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone which is strongly additive, thereby demonstrating that monotonicity under local quantum operations and strong additivity are compatible in principle. In accordance with the presented statistical interpretation which is provided, this entanglement monotone, however, has the property that it diverges on pure states, with the consequence that it cannot distinguish the degree of entanglement of different pure states. We also prove that the relative entropy of entanglement with respect to the set of disentangled states that have identical reductions to the primary state is an entanglement monotone. We finally investigate the trace-norm measure and demonstrate that it is also a proper entanglement monotone.

abstract: We study the coupled translational, electronic, and field dynamics of the combined system "a two-level atom + a single-mode quantized field + a standing-wave ideal cavity". We derive Hamilton -- Schr\"odinger equations for probability amplitudes and averaged position and momentum of a point-like atom interacting with the quantized field in a standing-wave cavity. They constitute, in general, an infinite-dimensional set of equations with an infinite number of integrals of motion which may be reduced to a dynamical system with four degrees of freedom if the quantized field is supposed to be initially prepared in a Fock state. This system is found to produce semiquantum chaos with positive values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. At large values of detuning $|\delta|\gg 1$, the Rabi atomic oscillations are usually shallow, and the dynamics is found to be almost regular. The Doppler -- Rabi resonance, deep Rabi oscillations that may occur at any large value of $|\delta|$ to be equal to $|\alpha p_0|$, is found numerically and described analytically (with $\alpha$ to be the normalized recoil frequency and $p_0$ the initial atomic momentum). Two gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of semiquantum chaos in real experiments. In the chaotic regime values of the population inversion $z_{out}$, measured with atoms after transversing a cavity, are so sensitive to small changes in the initial inversion $z_{in}$ that the probability of detecting any value of $z_{out}$ in the admissible interval becomes almost unity in a short time. Chaotic wandering of a two-level atom in a quantized Fock field is shown to be fractal. Fractal-like structures, typical for chaotic scattering, are numerically found in the dependence of the time of exit of atoms from the cavity on their initial momenta.

abstract: This paper deals with the dissipative dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a bosonic reservoir. The Master Equations based on the Rotating Wave and on the Feynman-Vernon system--reservoir couplings are compared highlighting differences and analogies. We discuss quantitatively and qualitatively the conditions under which the counter rotating terms can be neglected. By comparing the analytic solution of the heating function relative to the two different coupling models we conclude that, even in the weak coupling limit, the counter rotating terms give rise to a significant contribution in the non--Markovian short time regime. The main result of this paper is that such a contribution is actually experimentally measurable and thus relevant for a correct description of the system dynamics.

Pauli used this symmetry to compute the perturbed energy levels of an hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field (Stark effect) and in uniform electric and magnetic fields. Although the experimental check of the single Stark effect on the hydrogen atom has been studied experimentally, Pauli's results in mixed fields have been studied only for Rydberg states of rubidium atoms in crossedfields and lithium atoms in parallel fields.

Echo spectroscopy can serve as an extremely sensitive experimental tool for investigating quantum dynamics of trapped atoms even when a large number of states are thermally populated. We show numerical results for the stability of eigenstates of an atom-optics billiard of the Bunimovich type, and discuss its behavior under different types of perturbations. Finally, we propose to use special geometrical constructions to make a dephasing free dipole trap.

abstract: We introduce phase operators associated with the algebra su(3), which is the appropriate tool to describe three-level systems. The rather unusual properties of this phase are caused by the small dimension of the system and are explored in detail. When a three-level atom interacts with a quantum field in a cavity, a polynomial deformation of this algebra emerges in a natural way. We also introduce a polar decomposition of the atom-field relative amplitudes that leads to a Hermitian relative-phase operator, whose eigenstates correctly describe the corresponding phase properties. We claim that this is the natural variable to deal with quantum interference effects in atom-field interactions. We find the probability distribution for this variable and study its time evolution in some special cases.

abstract: Shannon's information entropies in position- and momentum- space and their sum $S$ are calculated for various $s$-$p$ and $s$-$d$ shell nuclei using a correlated one-body density matrix depending on the harmonic oscillator size $b_0$ and the short range correlation parameter $y$ which originates from a Jastrow correlation function. It is found that the information entropy sum for a nucleus depends only on the correlation parameter $y$ through the simple relation $S= s_{0A} + s_{1A} y^{-\lambda_{sA}}$, where $s_{0A}$, $s_{1A}$ and $\lambda_{sA}$ depend on the mass number $A$. A similar approximate expression is also valid for the root mean square radius of the nucleus as function of $y$ leading to an approximate expression which connects $S$ with the root mean square radius. Finally, we propose a method to determine the correlation parameter from the above property of $S$ as well as the linear dependence of $S$ on the logarithm of the number of nucleons.

abstract: For states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces entanglement quantities like the entanglement of distillation can become infinite. This leads naturally to the question, whether one system in such an infinitely entangled state can serve as a resource for tasks like the teleportation of arbitrarily many qubits. We show that appropriate states cannot be obtained by density operators in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However, using techniques for the description of infinitely many degrees of freedom from field theory and statistical mechanics, such states can nevertheless be constructed rigorously. We explore two related possibilities, namely an extended notion of algebras of observables, and the use of singular states on the algebra of bounded operators. As applications we construct the essentially unique infinite analogue of maximally entangled states, and the singular state used heuristically in the fundamental paper of Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky.

In an experiment, we employ the first-order Hermite-Gaussian modes in order to show that, by manipulating the pump beam, one can control the resulting two-photon interference behavior. We expect these results to play an important role in the engineering of quantum states of light for use in quantum information processing and quantum imaging.

abstract: Transformations from pure to mixed states are usually associated with information loss and irreversibility. Here, a protocol is demonstrated allowing one to make these transformations reversible. The pure states are diluted with a random noise source. Using this protocol one can study optimal transformations between states, and from this derive the unique measure of information. This is compared to irreversible transformations where one does not have access to noise. The ideas presented here shed some light on attempts to understand entanglement manipulations and the inevitable irreversibility encountered there where one finds that mixed states can contain "bound entanglement".

abstract: We study the local implementation of POVMs when we require only the faithful reproduction of the statistics of the measurement outcomes for all initial states. We first demonstrate that any POVM with separable elements can be implemented by a separable super-operator, and develop techniques for calculating the extreme points of POVMs under a certain class of constraint that includes separability and PPT-ness. As examples we consider measurements that are invariant under various symmetry groups (Werner, Isotropic, Bell-diagonal, Local Orthogonal), and demonstrate that in these cases separability of the POVM elements is equivalent to implementability via LOCC. We also calculate the extrema of these classes of measurement under the groups that we consider, and give explicit LOCC protocols for attaining them. These protocols are hence optimal methods for locally discriminating between states of these symmetries. One of many interesting consequences is that the best way to locally discriminate Bell diagonal mixed states is to perform a 2-outcome POVM using local von Neumann projections. This is true regardless of the cost function, the number of states being discriminated, or the prior probabilities. Our results give the first cases of local mixed state discrimination that can be analysed quantitatively in full, and may have application to other problems such as demonstrations of non-locality, experimental entanglement witnesses, and perhaps even entanglement distillation.

abstract: A cavity QED system is analyzed which duplicates the dynamics of a two-level atom in free space interacting exclusively with broadband squeezed light. We consider atoms in a three or four-level Lambda-configuration coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity which is driven by a squeezed light field. Raman transitions are induced between a pair of stable atomic ground states via the squeezed cavity mode and coherent driving fields. An analysis of the reduced master equation for the atomic ground states shows that a three-level atomic system has insufficient parameter flexibility to act as an effective two-level atom interacting exclusively with a squeezed reservoir. However, the inclusion of a fourth atomic level, coupled dispersively to one of the two ground states by an auxiliary laser field, introduces an extra degree of freedom and enables the desired interaction to be realised. As a means of detecting the reduced quadrature decay rate of the effective two-level system, we examine the transmission spectrum of a weak coherent probe field incident upon the cavity.

abstract: Quantum mechanics, information theory, and relativity theory are the basic foundations of theoretical physics. The acquisition of information from a quantum system is the interface of classical and quantum physics. Essential tools for its description are Kraus matrices and positive operator valued measures (POVMs). Special relativity imposes severe restrictions on the transfer of information between distant systems. Quantum entropy is not a Lorentz covariant concept. Lorentz transformations of reduced density matrices for entangled systems may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field theory, which is necessary for a consistent description of interactions, implies a fundamental trade-off between detector reliability and localizability. General relativity produces new, counterintuitive effects, in particular when black holes (or more generally, event horizons) are involved. Most of the current concepts in quantum information theory may then require a reassessment.

As before, I conclude that my previous results are an (order-of-magnitude) accurate estimate of the error probability introduced in quantum logical operations by the quantum nature of the laser field. While this error will typically (for a paraxial beam) be smaller than the total error due to spontaneous emission, a unified treatment of both effects reveals that they lead to formally similar constraints on the minimum number of photons per pulse required to perform an operation with a given accuracy; these constraints agree with those I have derived elsewhere.

abstract: Quantum correlations can be naturally formulated in a classical statistical system of infinitely many degrees of freedom. This realizes the underlying non-commutative structure in a classical statistical setting. We argue that the quantum correlations offer a more robust description with respect to the precise definition of observables.

abstract: We analyze the problem of sending classical information through qubit channels where successive uses of the channel are correlated. This work extends the analysis of C. Macchiavello and G. M. Palma to the case of a non-Pauli channel - the amplitude damping channel. Using the channel description outlined in S. Daffer, et al, we derive the correlated amplitude damping channel. We obtain a similar result to C. Macchiavello and G. M. Palma, that is, that under certain conditions on the degree of channel memory, the use of entangled input signals may enhance the information transmission compared to the use of product input signals.

abstract: This work shows how two parties A and B can securely share sequences of random bits at optical speeds. A and B possess true-random physical sources and exchange random bits by using a random sequence received to cipher the following one to be sent. A starting shared secret key is used and the method can be described as an unlimited one-time-pad extender. It is demonstrated that the minimum probability of error in signal determination by the eavesdropper can be set arbitrarily close to the pure guessing level. Being based on the $M$-ry encryption protocol this method also allows for optical amplification without security degradation, offering practical advantages over the BB84 protocol for key distribution.

abstract: We investigate the generation of multipartite entangled state in a system of N quantum dots embedded in a microcavity and examine the emergence of genuine multipartite entanglement by three different characterizations of entanglement. At certain times of dynamical evolution one can generate multipartite entangled coherent exciton states or multiqubit $W$ states by initially preparing the cavity field in a superposition of coherent states or the Fock state with one photon, respectively. Finally we study environmental effects on multipartite entanglement generation and find that the decay rate for the entanglement is proportional to the number of excitons.

We introduce the concept of the operator entanglement rate, and find that the maximal operator entanglement rate gives a lower bound on the entanglement capability of a general Hamiltonian.

abstract: In this paper we provide an analytical procedure which leads to a system of $(n-2)^2$ polynomial equations whose solutions give the parameterisation of the complex $n\times n$ Hadamard matrices. It is shown that in general the Hadamard matrices depend on a number of arbitrary phases and a lower bound for this number is given. The moduli equations define interesting geometrical objects whose study will shed light on the parameterisation of Hadamard matrices, as well as on some interesting geometrical varieties defined by them.

Coherent and squeezed states and their time evolution are discussed in detail.

The dynamics of the atoms crossing the beam splitter maps to a 1D spin model with controllable time dependent parameters, which allows the creation of maximally entangled states of atoms by crossing a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, we show that this system realizes protected quantum memory, and we discuss the implementation of one- and two-qubit gates in this setup.

authors: Sougato Bose

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212041
abstract: We propose a scheme for using an unmodulated and unmeasured spin-chain as a channel for short distance quantum communications. The state to be transmitted is placed on one spin of the chain and received later on a distant spin with some fidelity. We first obtain simple expressions for the fidelity of quantum state transfer and the amount of entanglement sharable between any two sites of an arbitrary Heisenberg ferromagnet using our scheme. We then apply this to the realizable case of an open ended chain with nearest neighbor interactions. The fidelity of quantum state transfer is obtained as an inverse discrete cosine transform and as a Bessel function series. We find that in a reasonable time, a qubit can be directly transmitted with better than classical fidelity across the full length of chains of up to 80 spins. Moreover, the spin-chain channel allows distillable entanglement to be shared over arbitrarily large distances.

abstract: We suggest a novel proposal to express decoherence in open quantum systems by jointly employing spectral and stochastic methods. This proposal, which basically perturbs the unitary evolution operator in a random fashion, allows us to embrace both markovian and nonmarkovian situations with little extra effort. We argue that it can be very suitable to deal with models where an approximation neglecting some degrees of freedom is undertaken. Mathematical simplicity is also obtained both to solve some master equations and to arrive at experimentally measured decoherence functions.

abstract: In quantum cryptography, the level of security attainable by a protocol which implements a particular task $N$ times bears no simple relation to the level of security attainable by a protocol implementing the task once. Useful partial security, and even near-perfect security in an appropriate sense, can be obtained for $N$ copies of a task which itself cannot be securely implemented. We illustrate this with protocols for quantum bit string commitment and quantum random number generation between mistrustful parties.

abstract: We explore the entanglement of the vacuum of a relativistic field by letting a pair of causally disconnected probes interact with the field. We find that, even when the probes are initially non-entangled, they can wind up to a final entangled state. This shows that entanglement persists between disconnected regions in the vacuum. However the probe entanglement, unlike correlations, vanishes once the regions become sufficiently separated. The relation between entropy, correlations and entanglement is discussed.

abstract: The computable cross norm (CCN) criterion is a new powerful analytical and computable separability criterion for bipartite quantum states, that is also known to systematically detect bound entanglement. In certain aspects this criterion complements the well-known Peres positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion. In the present paper we study important analytical properties of the CCN criterion. We show that in contrast to the PPT criterion it is not sufficient in dimension 2 x 2. In higher dimensions we prove theorems connecting the fidelity of a quantum state with the CCN criterion. We also analyze the behaviour of the CCN criterion under local operations and identify the operations that leave it invariant. It turns out that the CCN criterion is in general not invariant under local operations.

authors: V. Arvind, Rainer Schuler

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212048
abstract: We first give an $\O(2^{n/3})$ quantum algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack problem with $n$ variables. More generally, for 0-1 Integer Linear Programs with $n$ variables and $d$ inequalities we give an $\O(2^{n/3}n^d)$ quantum algorithm. For $d =o(n/\log n)$ this running time is bounded by $\O(2^{n(1/3+\epsilon)})$ for every $\epsilon>0$ and in particular it is better than the $\O(2^{n/2})$ upper bound for general quantum search. To investigate whether better algorithms for these NP-hard problems are possible, we formulate a \emph{symmetric} claw problem corresponding to 0-1 Knapsack and study its quantum query complexity. For the symmetric claw problem we establish a lower bound of $\O(2^{n/4})$ for its quantum query complexity. We have an $\O(2^{n/3})$ upper bound given by essentially the same quantum algorithm that works for Knapsack. Additionally, we consider CNF satisfiability of CNF formulas $F$ with no restrictions on clause size, but with the number of clauses in $F$ bounded by $cn$ for a constant $c$, where $n$ is the number of variables. We give a $2^{(1-\alpha)n/2}$ quantum algorithm for satisfiability in this case, where $\alpha$ is a constant depending on $c$.

abstract: Entanglement sharing among sites of one-particle states is considered using the measure of concurrence. These are the simplest in an hierarchy of number-specific states of many qubits and corresponds to ``one-magnon'' states of spins. We study the effects of onsite potentials that are both integrable and nonintegrable. In the integrable case we point to a metal-insulator transition that reflects on the way entanglement is shared. In the nonintegrable case the average entanglement content increases and saturates along with a transition to classical chaos. Such quantum chaotic states are shown to have universal concurrence distributions that are modified Bessel functions derivable within random matrix theory. Time-reversal breaking and time evolving states are shown to possess significantly higher entanglement sharing capacity that eigenstates of time-reversal symmetric systems. We use the ordinary Harper and kicked Harper Hamiltonians as model systems.

Their violations can be sufficient for genuine multipartite entanglement, provided the combinations contain both conjugate variables of all modes. Hence a complete state determination, for example by detecting the entire correlation matrix of a Gaussian state, is not needed.

abstract: We study the motion of a charged quantum particle, constrained on the surface of a cylinder, in the presence of a radial magnetic field. When the spin of the particle is neglected, the system essentially reduces to an infinite family of simple harmonic oscillators, equally spaced along the axis of the cylinder. Interestingly enough, it can be used as a quantum Fourier transformer, with convenient visual output. When the spin 1/2 of the particle is taken into account, a non-conventional perturbative analysis results in a recursive closed form for the corrections to the energy and the wavefunction, for all eigenstates, to all orders in the magnetic moment of the particle. A simple two-state system is also presented, the time evolution of which involves an approximate precession of the spin perpendicularly to the magnetic field. A number of plots highlight the findings while several three-dimensional animations have been made available on the web.

abstract: In search of a quantum key distribution scheme that could stand up for more drastic eavesdropping attack, I discover a prepare-and-measure scheme using $N$-dimensional quantum particles as information carriers where $N$ is a prime power. Using the Shor-Preskill-type argument, I prove that this scheme is unconditional secure against all attacks allowed by the laws of quantum physics. Incidentally, for $N = 2^n > 2$, each information carrier can be replaced by $n$ entangled qubits. And in this case, I discover an eavesdropping attack on which no unentangled-qubit-based prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution scheme known to date can generate a provably secure key. In contrast, this entangled-qubit-based scheme produces a provably secure key under the same eavesdropping attack whenever $N \geq 16$. This demonstrates the advantage of using entangled particles as information carriers to combat certain eavesdropping strategies.

As entanglement, especially the inaccessable multi-entangled state, is not necessary in the present quantum secret sharing protocol, it may be more applicable when the number of the parties of secret sharing is large. Its theoretic efficiency is also doubled to approach 100%.

It is also shown how Shor's results can be recovered from the p-norm results by considering their behavior for p close to one.

By creating polarization-entangled photons with spontaneous parametric down-conversion using a first-order Hermite-Gaussian pump beam, we invert the usual interference behavior and perform an incomplete Bell-state measurement in the coincidence basis. We discuss the possibility of a complete Bell-state measurement in the coincidence basis using hyperentangled states [Phys. Rev. A, \textbf{58}, R2623 (1998)].

abstract: We represent generalized density matrices of a $d$-complex dimensional quantum system as a subcone of a real pointed cone of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^{d^2}$, or indeed a Minkowskian cone in $\mathbb{E}^{1,d^2-1}$. Generalized pure states correspond to certain future-directed light-like vectors of $\mathbb{E}^{1,d^2-1}$. This extension of the Generalized Bloch Sphere enables us to cater for non-trace-preserving quantum operations, and in particluar to view the per-outcome effects of generalized measurements. We show that these consist of the product of an orthogonal transform about the axis of the cone of revolution and a positive real linear transform. We give detailed formulae for the one qubit case and express the post-measurement states in terms of the initial state vectors and measurement vectors. We apply these results in order to find the information gain versus disturbance tradeoff in the case of two equiprobable pure states. Thus we recover Fuchs and Peres' formula in an elegant manner.

abstract: We give a fully description of the dynamics of an atom dispersively coupled to a field mode in a dissipative environment fed by an external source. The competition between the unitary atom-field (which leads to entanglement) and the dissipative field-environment couplings are investigated in detail. We find the time evolution of the global atom-field system for any initial state and we show that atom-field steady state is at most classically correlated. For an initial state chosen, we evaluate the purity loss of the global system and of atomic and field subsystems as a function of time. We find that the source will tend to compensate for the dissipation of the field intensity and to accelerate decoherence of the global and atomic states. Moreover, we show that the degree of entanglement of the atom-field state, for the particular initial state chosen, can be completely quantified by concurrence. Analytical expression for time evolution of the concurrence is given.

It is shown that N independent particles, initially properly prepared, have a set of observables behaving classically in the thermodynamic limit. This particular set of observables is then coupled to a quantum system that in this way decoheres so to have the density matrix in a mixed form. This gives a proof of the generality of this effect.

In particular do we establish the following equation: Quantitative Probability = Logic + Partiality of Knowledge + Entropy. That is: 1. A finitary probability space \Delta^n (=all probability measures on {1,...,n}) can be fully and faithfully represented by the pair consisting of the abstraction D^n (=the object up to isomorphism) of a partially ordered set (\Delta^n,\sqsubseteq), and, Shannon entropy; 2. D^n itself can be obtained via a systematic purely order-theoretic procedure (which embodies introduction of partiality of knowledge) on an (algebraic) logic. This procedure applies to any poset A; D_A\cong(\Delta^n,\sqsubseteq) when A is the n-element powerset and D_A\cong(\Omega^n,\sqsubseteq), the domain of mixed quantum states, when A is the lattice of subspaces of a Hilbert space.

abstract: We prove the security of the Bennett-Brassard (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol in the case where the source and detector are under the limited control of an adversary. Our proof applies when both the source and the detector have small basis-dependent flaws, as is typical in practical implementations of the protocol. We derive a general lower bound on the asymptotic key generation rate for weakly basis-dependent eavesdropping attacks, and also estimate the rate in some special cases: sources that emit weak coherent states with random phases, detectors with basis-dependent efficiency, and misaligned sources and detectors.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212068
abstract: The aim of this work is to find ways to trap an atom in a cavity. In contrast to other approaches we propose a method where the cavity is basically in the vacuum state and the atom in the ground state. The idea is to induce a spatial dependent AC Stark shift by irradiating the atom with a weak laser field, so that the atom experiences a trapping force. The main feature of our setup is that dissipation can be strongly suppressed. We estimate the lifetime of the atom as well as the trapping potential parameters and compare our estimations with numerical simulations.

abstract: We present protocols for implementation of universal quantum gates on an arbitrary superposition of quantum states in a scalable solid-state Ising spin quantum computer. The spin chain is composed of identical spins 1/2 with the Ising interaction between the neighboring spins. The selective excitations of the spins are provided by the gradient of the external magnetic field. The protocols are built of rectangular radio-frequency pulses. The phase and probability errors caused by unwanted transitions are minimized and computed numerically.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212071
abstract: We apply algorithmic information theory to quantum mechanics in order to shed light on an algorithmic structure which inheres in quantum mechanics. There are two equivalent ways to define the (classical) Kolmogorov complexity K(s) of a given classical finite binary string s. In the standard way, K(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for the universal self-delimiting Turing machine to output s. In the other way, we first introduce the so-called universal probability m, and then define K(s) as -log_2 m(s) without using the concept of program-size. We generalize the universal probability to a matrix-valued function, and identify this function with a POVM (positive operator-valued measure). On the basis of this identification, we study a computable POVM measurement with countable measurement outcomes performed upon a finite dimensional quantum system. We show that, up to a multiplicative constant, 2^{-K(s)} is the upper bound for the probability of each measurement outcome s in such a POVM measurement. In what follows, the upper bound 2^{-K(s)} is shown to be optimal in a certain sense.

abstract: For any function F(x) having a Taylor expansion we solve the boson normal ordering problem for F[(a*)^r a^s], with r,s positive integers,[a,a*]=1, i.e. we provide exact and explicit expressions for its normal form which has all a's to the right. The solution involves integer sequences of numbers which, for r,s >=1, are generalizations of the conventional Bell and Stirling numbers whose values they assume for r=s=1. A complete theory of such generalized combinatorial numbers is given including closed-form expressions (extended Dobinski - type formulas), recursion relations and generating functions. These last are special expectation values in boson coherent states.

abstract: The correspondence between classical and quantum invariants is established. The Ermakov Lewis quantum invariant of the time dependent harmonic oscillator is translated from the coordinate and momentum operators into amplitude and phase operators. In doing so, Turski's phase operator as well as Susskind-Glogower operators are generalized to the time dependent harmonic oscillator case. A quantum derivation of the Manley-Rowe relations is shown as an example.

abstract: We introduce a new class of quantum models with time-dependent Hamiltonians of a special scaling form. By using a couple of time-dependent unitary transformations, the time evolution of these models is expressed in terms of related systems with time-independent Hamiltonians. The mapping of dynamics can be performed in any dimension, for an arbitrary number of interacting particles and for any type of the scaling interaction potential. The exact solvability of a "dual" time-independent Hamiltonian automatically means the exact solvability of the original problem with model time-dependence.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212076
abstract: We present first experimental data on the high energy behavior of helium atoms quantum reflecting from the nanoscopically disordered surface of a quartz crystal. The use of the light, stable and inert He atom not only opens the unique possibility of measuring quantum reflectivity in the thusfar inaccessible limit of high energies, but also allows the determination of the gas-solid interaction potential. The specularly reflected intensity from the rough surface shows a change of 5 orders of magnitude within an incident angular range of less than 6 degrees. By separating out the influence of surface disorder the quantum reflection coefficient for the smooth surface is deduced. Firstly, the data confirm the high energy asymptotic behavior of the reflection, defined by the non-retarded attractive van der Waals potential. The experiment shows very good agreement with our calculations covering the entire energy region, in which also Casimir forces play a role. Parameters for the gas-solid interaction perfectly match those reported in literature in the vicinity of the potential minimum.

abstract: We study the apparent nonlocality of quantum mechanics as a transport problem. If space is a physical entity through which quantum information (QI) must be transported, then one can define its speed. If not, QI exists apart from space, making space in some sense `nonphysical'. But we can still assign a `speed' of QI to such models based on their properties. In both cases, classical information must still travel at $c$, though in the latter case the origin of local spacetime itself is a puzzle. We consider the properties of different regimes for this speed of QI, and relevant quantum interpretations. For example, we show that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) is nonlocal because it is what we call `spatially complete'.

abstract: The fast phase gate scheme, in which the qubits are atoms confined in sites of an optical lattice, and gate operations are mediated by excitation of Rydberg states, was proposed by Jaksch et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 2208 (2000). A potential source of decoherence in this system derives from motional heating, which occurs if the ground and Rydberg states of the atom move in different optical lattice potentials. We propose to minimize this effect by choosing the lattice photon frequency \omega so that the ground and Rydberg states have the same frequency-dependent polarizability \alpha(omega). The results are presented for the case of Rb.

abstract: We derive explicit semiclassical quantisation conditions for the Dirac and Pauli equations. We show that the spin degree of freedom yields a contribution which is of the same order of magnitude as the Maslov correction in Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantisation. In order to obtain this result a generalisation of the notion of integrability for a certain skew product flow of classical translational dynamics and classical spin precession has to be derived. Among the examples discussed is the relativistic Kepler problem with Thomas precession, whose treatment sheds some light on the amazing success of Sommerfeld's theory of fine structure [Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) 51 (1916) 1--91].

By controlling the splitting and fusing of potential wells, we show how to interconvert Mott-insulator-like and trapped BEC-like states. We also discuss the generation of "Schr\"odinger cat" states by splitting a microtrap and taking into practical consideration the asymmetry between the resulting wells. These schemes can be used to perform multiparticle interferometry with neutral atoms, where interference effects can be observed only when all the participating particles are measured.

abstract: Niels Bohr wrote: "There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature." In an analogous way, von Weizsaecker suggested that the notion of the elementary alternative, the "Ur", should play a pivotal role when constructing physics. Both approaches suggest that the concept of information should play an essential role in the foundations of any scientific description of Nature. We show that if, in our description of Nature, we use one definite proposition per elementary constituent of Nature, some of the essential characteristics of quantum physics, such as the irreducible randomness of individual events, quantum complementary and quantum entanglement, arise in a natural way. Then quantum physics is an elementary theory of information.

The problem of an adiabatic stabilization is discussed, in particular it is shown that a quick drift in the direction of the electric field and a magnetic drift cannot be avoided simultaneously. A qualitative behavior of the packet for a short-range binding potential is contrasted with that for a soft-core potential, in particular dynamical effects due to a rescattering of the fragments separated from the main packet are demonstrated.

abstract: The explicit semiclassical treatment of logarithmic perturbation theory for the bound-state problem within the framework of the radial Klein-Gordon equation with attractive real-analytic screened Coulomb potentials, contained time-component of a Lorentz four-vector and a Lorentz-scalar term, is developed. Based upon $\hbar$-expansions and suitable quantization conditions a new procedure for deriving perturbation expansions is offered. Avoiding disadvantages of the standard approach, new handy recursion formulae with the same simple form both for ground and excited states have been obtained. As an example, the perturbation expansions for the energy eigenvalues for the Hulth\'en potential containing the vector part as well as the scalar component are considered.

abstract: For the Josephson junction charge qubits with macroscopically quantum natures, we propose a theoretical scheme to observe the loss of quantum coherence through coupling such qubit system to an engineered reservoir, the harmonic oscillator mode in the LC circuit formed by the inductor and the separated capacitors. Similar to the usual cavity QED system in form, this charge qubit system with engineered couplings shows the quantum jumps (C.P.Sun et al Fortschr. Phys. \textbf{43}, 585 (1995))in a progressive decoherence process. Corresponding to two components of superposition of two charge states, the inductor evolves simultaneously towards two distinct quasi-classical states entangling with two states of the charge qubit. Then it induces the quantum decoherence for the induced squeezing macroscopically in the LC mode.

abstract: Using first principles, it is demonstrated that radiative damping alone cannot lead to a nonvanishing electro-optic effect in a chiral isotropic medium. This conclusion is in contrast with that obtained by a calculation in which damping effects are included using the standard phenomenological model. We show that these predictions differ because the phenomenological damping equations are valid only in regions where the frequencies of the applied electromagnetic fields are nearly resonant with the atomic transitions. We also show that collisional damping can lead to a nonvanishing electrooptic effect, but with a strength sufficiently weak that it is unlikely to be observable under realistic laboratory conditions.

The violation of such local uncertainty relations may be used as an experimental test of entanglement generation.

This property reflects the fact that the measurement outcome probabilities for the values of such observables can be made arbitrary close to one with suitable state preparations. Some general implications of the norm-1-property are investigated. As case studies, localization observables, phase observables, and phase space observables are considered.

abstract: The dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle in a time-independent potential are found to contain many interesting phenomena. These are direct consequences of the (typical) existence of more than one time scale governing the problem. This gives rise to full revivals of initial wavepackets, fractional revivals (multiple wavepackets appearing at fractions of the revival time) and the striking quantum carpets. A variety of analytic techniques are used to consider the interference that gives rise to these phenomena while skirting calculations involving cross-terms. Novel results include a new theorem on the weighting coefficients $a_m$ that govern fractional revivals, a demonstration that $\Psi_{cl}$, the function that governs the distribution and features of these fractional revivals, really does behave classically, a treatment of the wavepacket dephasing in the infinite square well by means of the Poisson summation formula, and a correct analysis of the spatial distribution of intermode traces. Also, this work presents a coherent treatment of these phenomena, which before now did not exist.

abstract: Motivated by the need to uncover some underlying mathematical structure of optimal quantum computation, we carry out a systematic analysis of a wide variety of quantum algorithms from the majorization theory point of view. We conclude that step-by-step majorization is found in the known instances of fast and efficient algorithms, namely in the quantum Fourier transform, in Grover's algorithm, in the hidden affine function problem, in searching by quantum adiabatic evolution and in deterministic quantum walks in continuous time solving a classically hard problem. On the other hand, the optimal quantum algorithm for parity determination, which does not provide any computational speed-up, does not show step-by-step majorization. Lack of both speed-up and step-by-step majorization is also a feature of the adiabatic quantum algorithm solving the 2-SAT ``ring of agrees'' problem. Furthermore, the quantum algorithm for the hidden affine function problem does not make use of any entanglement while it does obey majorization. All the above results give support to a step-by-step Majorization Principle necessary for optimal quantum computation.

abstract: Contrary to common belief, it is not difficult to construct deterministic models where stochastic behavior is correctly described by quantum mechanical amplitudes, in precise accordance with the Copenhagen-Bohr-Bohm doctrine. What is difficult however is to obtain a Hamiltonian that is bounded from below, and whose ground state is a vacuum that exhibits complicated vacuum fluctuations, as in the real world. Beneath Quantum Mechanics, there may be a deterministic theory with (local) information loss. This may lead to a sufficiently complex vacuum state, and to an apparent non-locality in the relation between the deterministic ("ontological") states and the quantum states, of the kind needed to explain away the Bell inequalities. Theories of this kind would not only be appealing from a philosophical point of view, but may also be essential for understanding causality at Planckian distance scales.

abstract: We study the computational complexity of the problem SFT (Sum-free Formula partial Trace): given a tensor formula F over a subsemiring of the complex field (C,+,.) plus a positive integer k, under the restrictions that all inputs are column vectors of L2-norm 1 and norm-preserving square matrices, and that the output matrix is a column vector, decide whether the k-partial trace of $F\dagg{F}$ is superior to 1/2. The k-partial trace of a matrix is the sum of its lowermost k diagonal elements. We also consider the promise version of this problem, where the 1/2 threshold is an isolated cutpoint. We show how to encode a quantum or reversible gate array into a tensor formula which satisfies the above conditions, and vice-versa; we use this to show that the promise version of SFT is complete for the class BPP for formulas over the semiring (Q^+,+,.) of the positive rational numbers, for BQP in the case of formulas defined over the field (Q,+,.), and for P in the case of formulas defined over the Boolean semiring, all under logspace-uniform reducibility. This suggests that the difference between probabilistic and quantum polynomial-time computers may ultimately lie in the possibility, in the latter case, of having destructive interference between computations occuring in parallel.

abstract: We demonstrate that decoherence of many-spin systems can drastically differ from decoherence of single-spin systems. The difference originates at the most basic level, being determined by parity of the central system, i.e. by whether the system comprises even or odd number of spin-1/2 entities. Therefore, it is very likely that similar distinction between the central spin systems of even and odd parity is important in many other situations. Our consideration clarifies the physical origin of the unusual two-step decoherence found previously in the two-spin systems.

It is well known that asymptotic local operations and classical communication (LOCC) are required to get a simple operational measure of bipartite pure state entanglement. For bipartite mixed states and multipartite pure states it is likely that a more powerful class of operations will be needed. To this end \cite{BPRST01} have defined more powerful versions of state transformations (or reducibilities), namely LOCCq (asymptotic LOCC with a sublinear amount of quantum communication) and CLOCC (asymptotic LOCC with catalysis). In this paper we show that {\em LOCCq state transformations are only as powerful as asymptotic LOCC state transformations} for multipartite pure states. We first generalize the concept of entanglement gambling from two parties to multiple parties: any pure multipartite entangled state can be transformed to an EPR pair shared by some pair of parties and that any irreducible $m$ $(m\ge 2)$ party pure state can be used to create any other state (pure or mixed), using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then use this tool to prove the result. We mention some applications of multipartite entanglement gambling to multipartite distillability and to characterizations of multipartite minimal entanglement generating sets. Finally we discuss generalizations of this result to mixed states by defining the class of {\em cat distillable states}.

abstract: Quantum Measurement problem studied in Information Theory approach of systems selfdescription which exploits the information acquisition incompleteness for the arbitrary information system. The studied model of measuring system (MS) consist of measured state S environment E and observer $O$ processing input S signal. $O$ considered as the quantum object which interaction with S,E obeys to Schrodinger equation (SE). MS incomplete or restricted states for $O$ derived by the algebraic QM formalism which exploits Segal and $C^*$-algebras. From Segal theorem for systems subalgebras it's shown that such restricted states $V^O=|O_j> < O_j|$ describes the classical random 'pointer' outcomes $O_j$ observed by $O$ in the individual events. The 'preferred' basis $|O_j>$ defined by $O$ state decoherence via $O$ - E interactions.

abstract: The paper provides an introduction into p-mechanics, which is a consistent physical theory suitable for a simultaneous description of classical and quantum mechanics. p-Mechanics naturally provides a common ground for several different approaches to quantisation (geometric, Weyl, coherent states, Berezin, deformation, Moyal, etc.) and has a potential for expansions into field and string theories. The backbone of p-mechanics is solely the representation theory of the Heisenberg group.

abstract: In 1983, Wigner outlined a modified Schr\"odinger--von-Neumann equation of motion for macroobjects, to describe their typical coupling to the environment. This equation has become a principal model of environmental decoherence which is beleived responsible for the emergence ofclassicality in macroscopic quantum systems. Typically, this happens gradually and asymptotically after a certain characteristic decoherence time. For the Wigner-function, however, one can prove that it evolves perfectly into a classical (non-negative) phase space distribution after a finite time of decoherence.

In the special case of harmonic oscillator the known familiar master equation describing its frictionally driven Brownian motion is obtained. A thermal reservoir as a measuring environment is considered.

Similarities and differences between decoherence dynamics examined quantum mechanically and classically are exposed via a second-order perturbative treatment and via a strong decoherence theory, showing a strong dependence on the nature of the system-environment coupling. For example, for the traditionally assumed linear coupling, the classical and quantum results are shown to be in exact agreement.

A452 (1996) 953) in a manifestly covariant, differential-geometric framework, and examine the resulting quantum evolution on some specific examples of K\"ahler manifolds with many symmetries. We find conditions on the curvature for the evolution to be a `collapse process' in the sense of Brody and Hughston (Proc.Roy.Soc.Lond. A458 (2002) 1117) or, more generally, a `reduction process', and give examples that satisfy these conditions. For some of these examples, we show that the L\"uders projection postulate admits a consistent interpretation and remains valid in the nonlinear regime.

This is shown to provide explicit construction of a universal quantum circuit that exactly simulates arbitrary two-qubit operations in SU(4). Each block in this circuit is given in a closed form solution. We also provide a uniform upper bound of the applications of the given entangling gates, and find that exactly half of all the Controlled-Unitary gates satisfy the same upper bound as the CNOT gate. These results allow for the efficient implementation of operations in SU(4) required for both quantum computation and quantum simulation.

abstract: The restricted-path-integral (RPI) theory of continuous quantum measurements including the evolution of the measured systems and phenomenon of decoherence is reviewed. The measured system is considered as an open quantum system but without usage of any model of the measurement (of the measuring medium or the system's environment). The propagator of a measured system (conditioned by the measurement readout) is presented by RPI. In the important special case of monitoring an observable the propagator and the system's wave function satisfy Schroedinger equation with a complex Hamiltonian (depending on the measurement readout). Going over to the non-selective description of the measurement leads to the Lindblad master equation. In case of non-minimally disturbing measurements this gives theory of dissipative systems avoiding difficulties of other approaches. The whole theory is deduced from first principles of quantum mechanics. This proves that quantum mechanics includes theory of measurements and is therefore conceptually closed.

The source is a nondegenerate, single-mode, continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator in Na:KTP, operated at frequency degeneracy and just above threshold, which is also of interest for the study of critical fluctuations at the transition point. The residual frequency-difference jitter is $\pm$ 150 kHz for a 3 MHz cold cavity half-width at half maximum. We observe 4 dB of photon-number-difference squeezing at 200 kHz. The Na:KTP crystal is noncritically phase-matched for a 532 nm pump and polarization crosstalk is therefore practically nonexistent.

abstract: We analyze the entanglement of SU(2)-invariant density matrices of two spins $\vec S_{1}$, $\vec S_{2}$ using the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Such density matrices arise from thermal equilibrium states of isotropic spin systems. The partial transpose of such a state has the same multiplet structure and degeneracies as the original matrix with eigenvalue of largest multiplicity being non-negative. The case $S_{1}=S$, $S_{2}=1/2$ can be solved completely and is discussed in detail with respect to isotropic Heisenberg spin models. Moreover, in this case the Peres-Horodecki ciriterion turns out to be a sufficient condition for non-separability. We also characterize SU(2)-invariant states of two spins of length 1.

All the diagonal elements are detected in another one-dimensional experiment. The method is efficient and applicable to a wide range of spin systems. The proposed method is explained using a 2 qubit system and demonstrated by tomographing arbitrary complex density matrices of 2 and 4 qubit systems using simulations.

abstract: In this paper we show a Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality for two three-level quantum systems or qutrits, alternative to the CH inequality given by Kaszlikowski et al. [PRA 65, 032118 (2002)]. In contrast to this latter CH inequality, the new one is shown to be equivalent to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for two qutrits given by Collins et al. [PRL 88, 040404 (2002)]. Both the CH and CHSH inequalities exhibit the strongest resistance to noise for a nonmaximally entangled state for the case of two von Neumann measurements per site, as first shown by Acin et al. [PRA 65, 052325 (2002)]. This equivalence, however, breaks down when one takes into account the less-than-perfect quantum efficiency of detectors. Indeed, for the noiseless case, the threshold quantum efficiency above which there is no local and realistic description of the experiment for the optimal choice of measurements is found to be 0.814 for the CH inequality, whereas it is equal to 0.828 for the CHSH inequality.

abstract: It is shown that a macroscopic superposition state of radiation, strongly interacting with an ensemble of two-level atoms, is removed generating a coherent state describing a classical radiation field, when the thermodynamic limit is taken on the unitary evolution obtained by the Schroedinger equation. Decoherence appears as a dynamical effect in agreement with a recent proposal [M. Frasca, Phys. Lett. A 283, 271 (2001)]. To prove that this effect is quite general, we show that this same behavior appears when a superposition of two Fock number states is also considered. Higher order corrections are computed showing that this result tends to become exact in the thermodynamic limit. It appears as a genuine example of intrinsic collapse of the wave function.

For the particular case of the Cournot's Duopoly, we find that, even though the two players both act as "selfishly" in the quantum game as they do in the classical game, they are found to virtually cooperate due to the quantum entanglement between them. We also find that the original Einstein-Podolksy-Rosen state contributes to the best profits that the two firms could ever attain. Moreover, we propose a practical experimental setup for the implementation of such quantum games.

abstract: The enormous theoretical potential of Quantum Information Processing (QIP) is driving the pursuit for its practical realization by various physical techniques. Currently Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has been the forerunner by demonstrating a majority of quantum algorithms. In NMR, spin systems consisting of coupled nuclear spins are utilized as qubits. In order to carry out QIP, a spin system has to meet two major requirements: (i) qubit addressability and (ii) mutual coupling among the qubits. It has been demonstrated that the magnitude of the mutual coupling among qubits can be increased by orienting the spin-systems in a liquid crystal matrix and utilizing the residual dipolar couplings. While utilizing residual dipolar couplings may be useful to increase the number of qubits, nuclei of same species (homonuclei) might become strongly coupled. In strongly coupled spin-systems, spins loose their individual identity of being qubits. We propose that even such strongly coupled spin-systems can be used for QIP and the qubit-manipulation can be achieved by transition-selective pulses. We demonstrate experimental preparation of pseudopure states, creation of maximally entangled states, implementation logic gates and implementation of Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm in strongly coupled 2,3 and 4 spin systems. The energy levels of the strongly coupled 3 and 4 spin systems were obtained by using a Z-COSY experiment.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: This thesis establishes a number of connections between foundational issues in quantum theory, and some quantum information applications. It starts with a review of quantum contextuality and non-locality, multipartite entanglement characterisation, and of a few quantum information protocols. Quantum non-locality and contextuality are shown to be essential for different implementations of quantum information protocols known as quantum random access codes and quantum communication complexity protocols. I derive sufficient experimental conditions for tests of these quantum properties. I also discuss how the distribution of quantum information through quantum cloning processes can be useful in quantum computing. Regarding entanglement characterisation, some results are obtained relating two problems, that of additivity of the relative entropy of entanglement, and that of identifying different types of tripartite entanglement in the asymptotic regime of manipulations of many copies of a given state. The thesis ends with a description of an information processing task in which a single qubit substitutes for an arbitrarily large amount of classical communication. This result is interpreted in different ways: as a gap between quantum and classical computation space complexity; as a bound on the amount of classical communication necessary to simulate entanglement; and as a basic result on hidden-variable theories for quantum mechanics. I also show that the advantage of quantum over classical communication can be established in a feasible experiment.

abstract: The finite temperature Casimir free energy, entropy, and internal energy are considered anew for a conventional parallel-plate configuration, in the light of current discussions in the literature. In the case of an "ideal" metal, characterized by a refractive index equal to infinity for all frequencies, we recover, via a somewhat unconventional method, conventional results for the temperature dependence, meaning that the zero-frequency transverse electric mode contributes the same as the transverse magnetic mode. For a real metal, however, approximately obeying the Drude dispersive model at low frequencies, we find that the zero-frequency transverse electric mode does not contribute at all. This would appear to lead to an observable temperature dependence and a violation of the third law of thermodynamics. It had been suggested that the source of the difficulty was the behaviour of the reflection coefficient for perpendicular polarization but we show that this is not the case. By introducing a simplified model for the Casimir interaction, consisting of two harmonic oscillators interacting via a third one, we illustrate the behavior of the transverse electric field. Numerical results are presented based on the refractive index for gold. A linear temperature correction to the Casimir force between parallel plates is indeed found which should be observable in room-temperature experiments, but this does not entail any thermodynamic inconsistency.

abstract: The list of basic axioms of quantum mechanics as it was formulated by von Neumann includes only the mathematical formalism of the Hilbert space and its statistical interpretation. We point out that such an approach is too general to be considered as the foundation of quantum mechanics. In particular in this approach any finite-dimensional Hilbert space describes a quantum system. Though such a treatment might be a convenient approximation it can not be considered as a fundamental description of a quantum system and moreover it leads to some paradoxes like Bell's theorem. I present a list from seven basic postulates of axiomatic quantum mechanics. In particular the list includes the axiom describing spatial properties of quantum system. These axioms do not admit a nontrivial realization in the finite-dimensional Hilbert space. One suggests that the axiomatic quantum mechanics is consistent with local realism.

abstract: It is currently widely accepted, as a result of Bell's theorem and related experiments, that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with local realism and there is the so called quantum non-locality. We show that such a claim can be justified only in a simplified approach to quantum mechanics when one neglects the fundamental fact that there exist space and time. Mathematical definitions of local realism in the sense of Bell and in the sense of Einstein are given. We demonstrate that if we include into the quantum mechanical formalism the space-time structure in the standard way then quantum mechanics might be consistent with Einstein's local realism. It shows that loopholes are unavoidable in experiments aimed to establish a violation of Bell`s inequalities. We show how the space-time structure can be considered from the contextual point of view. A mathematical framework for the contextual approach is outlined.

abstract: We show that the modern quantum mechanics, and particularly the theory of decoherence, allows formulating a sort of a physical metatheory of consciousness. Particularly, the analysis of the necessary conditions for the occurrence of decoherence, along with the hypothesis that consciousness bears (more-or-less) well definable physical origin, leads to a wider physical picture naturally involving consciousness. This can be considered as a sort of a psycho-physical parallelism, but on very wide scales bearing some cosmological relevance.

abstract: We investigate distinguishability (measured by fidelity) of the initial and the final state of a qubit, which is an object of the so-called nonideal quantum measurement of the first kind. We show that the fidelity of a nonideal measurement can be greater than the fidelity of the corresponding ideal measurement. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, and can be traced back to the quantum parallelism in quantum operations, in analogy with the quantum parallelism manifested in the quantum computing theory. In particular, while the quantum parallelism in quantum computing underlies efficient quantum algorithms, the quantum parallelism in quantum information theory underlies this, classically unexpected, increase of the fidelity.

abstract: A slight modification of one axiom of quantum theory changes a reversible theory into a time asymmetric theory. Whereas the standard Hilbert space axiom does not distinguish mathematically between the space of states (in-states of scattering theory) and the space of observables (out-``states'' of scattering theory) the new axiom associates states and observables to two different Hardy subspaces which are dense in the same Hilbert space and analytic in the lower and upper complex energy plane, respectively. As a consequence of this new axiom the dynamical equations (Schr\"{o}dinger or Heisenberg) integrate to a semigroup evolution. Extending this new Hardy space axiom to a relativistic theory provides a relativistic theory of resonance scattering and decay with Born probablilities that fulfill Einstein causality and the exponential decay law.

abstract: We consider a three-port single-level quantum dot system with one input and two output leads. Instead of considering an empty dot, we study the situations that two input electrons co-tunnel through the quantum dot occupied by one or two dot electrons. We show that electron entanglement can be generated via the co-tunneling processes when the dot is occupied by two electrons, yielding non-local spin-singlet states at the output leads. When the dot is occupied by a single electron, net spin-singlet final states could be generated by injecting polarized electrons to the dot system. When the input electrons are unpolarized, we show that by carefully arranging model parameters non-local spin-triplet electrons can also be obtained at the output leads if the dot-electron spin remains unchanged in the final state.

We show how the Kirkwood-Rihaczek distribution reflects properties of the hydrogen atom wave functions in position and momentum representations.

abstract: In the first part of this review we introduce the basics theory behind geometric phases and emphasize their importance in quantum theory. The subject is presented in a general way so as to illustrate its wide applicability, but we also introduce a number of examples that will help the reader understand the basic issues involved. In the second part we show how to perform a universal quantum computation using only geometric effects appearing in quantum phases. It is then finally discussed how this geometric way of performing quantum gates can lead to a stable, large scale, intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computer.

abstract: For a practical quantum computer to operate, it will be essential to properly manage decoherence. One important technique for doing this is the use of "decoherence-free subspaces" (DFSs), which have recently been demonstrated. Here we present the first use of DFSs to improve the performance of a quantum algorithm. An optical implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be made insensitive to a particular class of phase noise by encoding information in the appropriate subspaces; we observe a reduction of the error rate from 35% to essentially its pre-noise value of 8%.

abstract: We exploit a well-known isomorphism between complex hermitian $2\times 2$ matrices and $\mathbb{R}^4$, which yields a convenient real vector representation of qubit states. Because these do not need to be normalized we find that they map onto a Minkowskian future cone in $\mathbb{E}^{1,3}$, whose vertical cross-sections are nothing but Bloch spheres. Pure states are represented by light-like vectors, unitary operations correspond to special orthogonal transforms about the axis of the cone, positive operations correspond to pure Lorentz boosts. We formalize the equivalence between the generalized measurement formalism on qubit states and the Lorentz transformations of special relativity, or more precisely elements of the restricted Lorentz group together with future-directed null boosts. The note ends with a discussion of the equivalence and some of its possible consequences.

abstract: If the statement by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen on incompleteness of Quantum-Mechanical description of nature is correct, then we can regard Quantum Mechanics as a Method of Indirect Computation. The problem is, whether the theory is incomplete or the nature itself does not allow complete description? And if the first option is correct, how is it possible to complete the Quantum-Mechanical description? Here we try to complement de-Broglie's idea on wave-pilot the stochastic gravitation gives origin to. We assume that de-Broglie's wave-pilots are gravitational stochastic ones, and we shall regard micro-objects as test classical particles being subject to the influence of de-Broglie's waves stochastic gravitation.

abstract: In this paper we survey, in an elementary fashion, some of the questions that arise when one considers how entanglement and relativity are related via the notion of non-locality. We begin by reviewing the role of entangled states in Bell inequality violation and question whether the associated notions of non-locality lead to problems with relativity. The use of entanglement and wavefunction collapse in Einstein's famous incompleteness argument is then considered, before we go on to see how the issue of non-locality is transformed if one considers quantum mechanics without collapse to be a complete theory, as in the Everett interpretation. The opportunity is taken to consider whether teleportation and dense coding might constitute a source of non-locality within the Everett interpretation.

abstract: Given two arbitrary pure states $ |\phi>$ and $ |\psi>$ of qubits or higher level states, we provide arguments in favor of states of the form $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi> |\phi> + i |\phi> |\psi>) $ instead of symmetric or anti-symmetric states, as natural candidates for optimally entangled states constructed from these states. We show that such states firstly have on the average a high value of concurrence, secondly can be constructed by a universal unitary operator independent of the input states. We also show that these states are the only ones which can be produced with perfect fidelity by any quantum operation designed for intertwining two pure states with a relative phase. A probabilistic method is proposed for producing any pre-determined relative phase into the combination of any two arbitrary states.

Consequently, these relations cannot imply a general physical principle. The explanation by the theory of functional analysis is given : for these states even the definition of the uncertainty notion through the dispersion notion in the probability theory is irrelevant.

abstract: We classify multipartite entanglement in a unified manner, focusing on a duality between the set of separable states and that of entangled states. Hyperdeterminants, derived from the duality, are natural generalizations of entanglement measures, the concurrence, 3-tangle for 2, 3 qubits respectively. Our approach reveals how inequivalent multipartite entangled classes of pure states constitute a partially ordered structure under local actions, significantly different from a totally ordered one in the bipartite case. Moreover, the generic entangled class of the maximal dimension, given by the nonzero hyperdeterminant, does not include the maximally entangled states in Bell's inequalities in general (e.g., in the 4 or more qubits), contrary to the widely known bipartite or 3-qubit cases. It suggests that not only are they never locally interconvertible with the majority of multipartite entangled states, but they would have no grounds for the canonical n-partite entangled states. Our classification is also useful for that of mixed states.

abstract: The quantum random walk has drawn special interests because its remarkable features to the classical counterpart could lead to new quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a feasible scheme to implement quantum random walks on a line using only linear optics elements. With current single-photon interference technology, the steps that could be experimentally implemented can be extended to very large numbers. We also show that, by decohering the quantum states, our scheme for quantum random walk tends to be classical.

It is found that the symmetric sharing of the entanglement (measured by the concurrence) between any pair of the excitonic state with $N$ qubits defined by the number states (vacuum and a single-exciton states) or the coherent states (odd and even coherent states) can be prepared by the cavity field for this system.

We narrow down the model by assuming the state space of a physical entity is a complex Hilbert space and introduce the principle of consistent interaction which effectively partitions the space of apparatus states. The normalized measure of the set of apparatus states that interact with a pure state giving rise to a fixed outcome is shown to be in accordance with the probability obtained using the Born rule.

abstract: Entanglement transformation of composite quantum systems is investigated in the context of group representation theory. Representation of the direct product group $SL(2,C)\otimes SL(2,C)$, composed of local operators acting on the binary composite system, is realized in the four-dimensional complex space in terms of a set of novel bases that are pseudo orthonormalized. The two-to-one homomorphism is then established for the group $SL(2,C)\otimes SL(2,C)$ onto the $SO(4,C)$. It is shown that the resulting representation theory leads to the complete characterization for the entanglement transformation of the binary composite system.

abstract: Chaotic evolutions exhibit exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. This suggests that even very small perturbations resulting from weak coupling of a quantum chaotic environment to the position of a system whose state is a non-local superposition will lead to rapid decoherence. However, it is also known that quantum counterparts of classically chaotic systems lose exponential sensitivity to initial conditions, so this expectation of enhanced decoherence is by no means obvious. We analyze decoherence due to a "toy" quantum environment that is analytically solvable, yet displays the crucial phenomenon of exponential sensitivity to perturbations. We show that such an environment, with a single degree of freedom, can be far more effective at destroying quantum coherence than a heat bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This also means that the standard "quantum Brownian motion" model for a decohering environment may not be as universally applicable as it once was conjectured to be.

abstract: Recently the influence of dielectric and geometrical properties on the Casimir force between dispersing and absorbing multilayered plates in the zero-temperature limit has been studied within a 1D quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in the presence of causal media [R. Esquivel-Sirvent, C. Villarreal, and G.H. Cocoletzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 052108 (2001)]. In the present paper a rigorous 3D analysis is given, which shows that for complex heterostructures the 1D theory only roughly reflects the dependence of the Casimir force on the plate separation in general. Further, an extension of the very recently derived formula for the Casimir force at zero temperature [M.S. Toma\v{s}, Phys. Rev. A 66, 052103 (2002)] to finite temperatures is given, and analytical expressions for specific distance laws in the zero-temperature limit are derived. In particular, it is shown that the Casimir force between two single-slab plates behaves asymptotically like $d^{-6}$ in place of $d^{-4}$ ($d$, plate separation).

abstract: We study the measurement process by treating classical detectors entirely quantum mechanically. As a generic model we use a point-contact detector coupled to an electron in a quantum dot and tunneling into the continuum. Transition to the classical description and the mechanism of decoherence are investigated. We concentrate on the influence of the measurement on the electron decay rate to the continuum. We demonstrate that the Zeno (or the anti-Zeno) effect requires a nonuniform density of states in the continuum. In this case we show that the anti-Zeno effect relates only to the average decay rate, whereas for sufficiently small time the Zeno effect always takes place. We discuss the experimental consequences of our results and the role of the projection postulate in a measurement process.

abstract: We have observed the phenomenon of stochastic resonance on the Brillouin propagation modes of a dissipative optical lattice. Such a mode has been excited by applying a moving potential modulation with phase velocity equal to the velocity of the mode. Its amplitude has been characterized by the center-of-mass (CM) velocity of the atomic cloud. At Brillouin resonance, we studied the CM-velocity as a function of the optical pumping rate at a given depth of the potential wells. We have observed a resonant dependence of the CM velocity on the optical pumping rate, corresponding to the noise strength. This corresponds to the experimental observation of stochastic resonance in a periodic potential in the low-damping regime.

We found that in one configuration the scattering on the propagation mode results in a resonance in the probe transmission spectrum while in the other configuration no modification of the scattering spectrum occurs, i.e. the mode is dark. A theoretical explanation of this behaviour is provided.

We show that a charge superselection rule implies no restriction on the operations that can be executed on any individual qbit.

abstract: A random matrix theory approach is applied in order to analyze the localization properties of local spectral density for a generic system of coupled quantum states with strong static imperfection in the unperturbed energy levels. The system is excited by an external periodic field, the temporal profile of which is close to monochromatic one. The shape of local spectral density is shown to be well described by the contour obtained from a relevant model of periodically driven two-states system with irreversible losses to an external thermal bath. The shape width and the inverse participation ratio are determined as functions both of the Rabi frequency and of parameters specifying the localization effect for our system in the absence of external field.

abstract: The security of two-state quantum key distribution against individual attack is estimated when the channel has losses and noises. We assume that Alice and Bob use two nonorthogonal single-photon polarization states. To make our analysis simple, we propose a modified B92 protocol in which Alice and Bob make use of inconclusive results and Bob performs a kind of symmetrization of received states. Using this protocol, Alice and Bob can estimate Eve's information gain as a function of a few parameters which reflect the imperfections of devices or Eve's disturbance. In some parameter regions, Eve's maximum information gain shows counter-intuitive behavior, namely, it decreases as the amount of disturbances increases. For a small noise rate Eve can extract perfect information in the case where the angle between Alice's two states is small or large, while she cannot extract perfect information for intermediate angles. We also estimate the secret key gain which is the net growth of the secret key per one pulse. We show the region where the modified B92 protocol over a realistic channel is secure against individual attack.

abstract: We prove the unconditional security of the Bennett 1992 protocol, by using a reduction to an entanglement distillation protocol initiated by a local filtering process. The bit errors and the phase errors are correlated after the filtering, and we can bound the amount of phase errors from the observed bit errors by an estimation method involving nonorthogonal measurements. The angle between the two states shows a trade-off between accuracy of the estimation and robustness to noises.

abstract: A time-dependent Casimir-Polder force is shown to arise during the time evolution of a partially dressed two-level atom. The partially dressed atom is obtained by a rapid change of an atomic parameter such as its transition frequency, due to the action of some external agent. The electromagnetic field fluctuations around the atom, averaged over the solid angle for simplicity, are calculated as a function of time, and it is shown that the interaction energy with a second atom yields a dynamical Casimir-Polder potential between the two atoms.

abstract: Quantum information theory has revolutionized the way in which information is processed using quantum resources such as entangled states, local operations and classical communications. Two important protocols in quantum communications are quantum teleportation and remote state preparation. In quantum teleportation neither the sender nor the receiver know the identity of a state. In remote state preparation the sender knows the state which is to be remotely prepared without ever physically sending the object or the complete classical description of it. Using one unit of entanglement and one classical bit Alice can remotely prepare a photon (from special ensemble) of her choice at Bob's laboratory. In remote state measurement Alice asks Bob to simulate any single particle measurement statistics on an arbitrary photon. In this talk we will present these ideas and discuss the latest developments and future open problems.

abstract: We calculate the force and impulse operators for a charged particle in the field of an Aharonov-Bohm flux line. The force operator is formally the Lorentz force, with the magnetic field operator modified to include quantum corrections due to anomolous commutation relations. Expectation values for stationary states are calculated. Nonstationary states are treated by integrating the force operator in time to obtain the impulse operator. Expectation values of the impulse are calculated for slow wavepackets (which spread faster than they move) and for fast wavepackets (which spread only negligibly before their closest approach to the flux line). We give two derivations of the force and impulse operators, the first a simple derivation based on formal arguments, and the second a rigorous calculation of wavepacket expectation values. We also show that the same expressions for the force and impulse are obtained if the flux line is enclosed in an impenetrable cylinder,or distributed uniformly over a flux cylinder, in the limit that the radius of the cylinder goes to zero.

abstract: We propose to measure the superradiance effect by observing the current through a semiconductor double-dot ststem. An electron and a hole are injected separately into one of the quantum dots to form an exciton and then recombine radiatively. We find that the stationary current shows oscillatory behavior as one varies the inter-dot distance. The amplitude of oscillation can be increased by incorporating the system into a microcavity. Furthermore, the current is suppressed if the dot distance is small compared to the wavelength of the emitted photon. This photon trapping phenomenon generates the entangled state and may be used to control the emission of single photons at predetermined times.

abstract: A local quantum phenomenon that gives rise to generic for all surface reactions macroscopic fluctuations is studied. The issue is viewed with respect to the necessary conditions for a long-term stable evolution of any natural and artificial system. It is shown that global coupling of the local fluctuations is necessary for providing a long-term stability of the system. A successful coupling mechanism is achieved on the grounds of new assumptions about the Hamiltonian response to certain perturbations. The coupling mechanism acts towards a global synchronisation, i.e. to a coherent response of the excited species to any further perturbation. It is proven that the synchronisation is a scale-free process that has universal properties, e.g. it is insensitive to the chemical identity of the reacting species and to the particularities of the surface reaction. Its hallmark is that the global adsorption rate exhibits permanent temporal variations whose amplitude is independent of the system size. The presence of these fluctuations fundamentally changes the temporal behavior of the system, namely it becomes pulse-like both on the quantum and the macro-level. The pulse-like behavior gives rise to a persistent continuous band at the quantum spectra whose major properties are: (I) it does not correspond to any real radiation; (ii) its presence is insensitive to the particularities of the system and the incident radiation; (iii) its shape and the infrared edge are typical for the -type noise. These properties give rise to its name: alias -type noise.

abstract: Solid state quantum bits are promising candidates for the realization of a {\em scalable} quantum computer. However, they are usually strongly limited by decoherence due to the many extra degrees of freedom of a solid state system. We investigate a system of two solid state qubits that are coupled via $\sigma_z^{(i)} \otimes \sigma_z^{(j)}$ type of coupling. This kind of setup is typical for {\em pseudospin} solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors in the presence of a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to $\sigma_z$, respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a common bath, optimum gate performance of a CPHASE gate can be reached at very low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling attractive as compared to previously studied proposals with $\sigma_y^{(i)} \otimes \sigma_y^{(j)}$ -coupling. Although less pronounced, this advantage also applies to the CNOT gate.

abstract: The dark soliton created in a Bose-Einstein condensate becomes grey in course of time evolution because its notch fills up with depleted atoms. This is the result of quantum mechanical calculations which describes output of many experimental repetitions of creation of the stationary soliton, and its time evolution terminated by a destructive density measurement. However, such a description is not suitable to predict the outcome of a single realization of the experiment were two extreme scenarios and many combinations thereof are possible: one will see (1) a displaced dark soliton without any atoms in the notch, but with a randomly displaced position, or (2) a grey soliton with a fixed position, but a random number of atoms filling its notch. In either case the average over many realizations will reproduce the mentioned quantum mechanical result. In this paper we use N-particle wavefunctions, which follow from the number-conserving Bogoliubov theory, to settle this issue.

abstract: We examine a 31P donor electron spin in a Si crystal to be used for the purposes of quantum computation. The interaction with an uncontrolled system of 29Si nuclear spins influences the electron spin dynamics appreciably. The hyperfine field at the 29Si nuclei positions is non-collinear with the external magnetic field. Quantum operations with the electron wave function, i.e. using magnetic field pulses or electrical gates, change the orientation of hyperfine field and disturb the nuclear spin system. This disturbance produces a deviation of the electron spin qubit from an ideal state, at a short time scale in comparison with the nuclear spin diffusion time. For H_ext=9 T, the estimated error rate is comparable to the threshold value required by the quantum error correction algorithms. The rate is lower at higher external magnetic fields.

This formulation can be considered in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect-FQHE and number theory.

abstract: We study the in-plane transport of spin-polarized electrons in III-V semiconductor quantum wells. The spin dynamics is controlled by the spin-orbit interaction, which arises via the Dresselhaus (bulk asymmetry) and Rashba (well asymmetry) mechanisms. This interaction, owing to its momentum dependence, causes rotation of the spin polarization vector, and also produces effective spin dephasing. The density matrix approach is used to describe the evolution of the electron spin polarization, while the spatial motion of the electrons is treated semiclassically. Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for temperatures in the range 77-300 K.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum area spectrum for a rotating and charged (Kerr-Newman) black hole. Generalizing a recent study on Kerr black holes (which was inspired by the static-black hole formalism of Barvinsky, Das and Kunstatter), we show that the quantized area operator can be expressed in terms of three quantum numbers (roughly related to the mass, charge and spin sectors). More precisely, we find that $A=8\pi\hbar[n+{1\over 2}+{p_1\over 2}+p_2]$, where $n$, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are strictly non-negative integers. In this way, we are able to confirm a uniformly spaced spectrum even for a fully general Kerr-Newman black hole. Along the way, we derive certain selection rules and use these to demonstrate that, in spite of appearances, the charge and spin spectra are not completely independent.

abstract: It is shown that, for systems in which the entropy is an extensive function of the energy and volume, the Bekenstein and the holographic entropy bounds predict new results. More explicitly, the Bekenstein entropy bound leads to the entropy of thermal radiation (the Unruh-Wald bound) and the spherical entropy bound implies the "causal entropy bound". Surprisingly, the first bound shows a close relationship between black hole physics and the Stephan-Boltzmann law (for the energy and entropy flux densities of the radiation emitted by a hot blackbody). Furthermore, we find that the number of different species of massless fields is bounded by $\sim 10^{4}$.

The action also yields the gravitationally induced phase shifts in quantum interference experiments due to the coupling of all multipole moments.

abstract: We investigate a U(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical system on a 2D noncommutative space with coordinates generating a generalized deformed oscillator algebra. The Hamiltonian is taken as a quadratic form in gauge covariant derivatives obeying the nonlinear Dolan-Grady relations. This restricts the structure function of the deformed oscillator algebra to a quadratic polynomial. The cases when the coordinates form the su(2) and sl(2,R) algebras are investigated in detail. Reducing the Hamiltonian to 1D finite-difference quasi-exactly solvable operators, we demonstrate partial algebraization of the spectrum of the corresponding systems on the fuzzy sphere and noncommutative hyperbolic plane. A completely covariant method based on the notion of intrinsic algebra is proposed to deal with the spectral problem of such systems.

The effective potential successfully describes the transition of the system from the false vacuum to the true vacuum. The present method well describes the long time evolution of the wave-function of the system after the symmetry breaking, which is shown in comparison with the direct numerical computations of wave-function.

Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to point interactions and an extension to higher N-extended supersymmetry are also discussed.

Energy quantization is a direct consequences of the local homeomorphicity of the trivializing map. We review the EP and show that the quantum potential for two free particles, which depends on constants which may have a geometrical interpretation, plays the role of interaction term that admits solutions which do not vanish in the classical limit.

abstract: We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for Type A N-fold supersymmetry by direct calculation of the intertwining relation and show the complete equivalence between this analytic construction and the sl(2) construction based on quasi-solvability. An intimate relation between the pair of algebraic Hamiltonians is found. The classification problem on Type A N-fold supersymmetric models is investigated by considering the invariance of both the Hamiltonians and N-fold supercharge under the GL(2,K) transformation. We generalize the Bender-Dunne polynomials to all the Type A N-fold supersymmetric models without requiring the normalizability of the solvable sector. Although there is a case where weak orthogonality of them is not guaranteed, this fact does not cause any difficulty on the generalization. It is shown that the anti-commutator of the Type A N-fold supercharges is expressed as the critical polynomial of them in the original Hamiltonian, from which we establish the complete Type A N-fold superalgebra. A novel interpretation of the critical polynomials in view of polynomial invariants is given.

abstract: Relativistic resonances and decaying states are described by representations of Poincar\'e transformations, similar to Wigner's definition of stable particles. To associate decaying state vectors to resonance poles of the $S$-matrix, the conventional Hilbert space assumption (or asymptotic completeness) is replaced by a new hypothesis that associates different dense Hardy subspaces to the in- and out-scattering states. Then one can separate the scattering amplitude into a background amplitude and one or several ``relativistic Breit-Wigner'' amplitudes, which represent the resonances per se. These Breit-Wigner amplitudes have a precisely defined lineshape and are associated to exponentially decaying Gamow vectors which furnish the irreducible representation spaces of causal Poincar\'e transformations into the forward light cone.

abstract: A relativistic resonance which was defined by a pole of the $S$-matrix, or by a relativistic Breit-Wigner line shape, is represented by a generalized state vector (ket) which can be obtained by analytic extension of the relativistic Lippmann-Schwinger kets. These Gamow kets span an irreducible representation space for Poincar\'e transformations which, similar to the Wigner representations for stable particles, are characterized by spin (angular momentum of the partial wave amplitude) and complex mass (position of the resonance pole). The Poincar\'e transformations of the Gamow kets, as well as of the Lippmann-Schwinger plane wave scattering states, form only a semigroup of Poincar\'e transformations into the forward light cone. Their transformation properties are derived. From these one obtains an unambiguous definition of resonance mass and width for relativistic resonances. The physical interpretation of these transformations for the Born probabilities and the problem of causality in relativistic quantum physics is discussed.

abstract: We calculate the partition function $Z(t)$ and the asymptotic integrated level density $N(E)$ for Yang-Mills-Higgs Quantum Mechanics for two and three dimensions ($n = 2, 3$). Due to the infinite volume of the phase space $\Gamma$ on energy shell for $n= 2$, it is not possible to disentangle completely the coupled oscillators ($x^2 y^2$-model) from the Higgs sector. The situation is different for $n = 3$ for which $\Gamma$ is finite. The transition from order to chaos in these systems is expressed by the corresponding transitions in $Z(t)$ and $N(E)$, analogous to the transitions in adjacent level spacing distribution from Poisson distribution to Wigner-Dyson distribution. We also discuss a related system with quartic coupled oscillators and two dimensional quartic free oscillators for which, contrary to YMHQM, both coupling constants are dimensionless.

abstract: For a maximally entangled eigenstate of a system of two non-interacting identical one dimensional harmonic oscilators, at the semiclassical level, it is not obviously true that a nonlinear interaction with one of the subsystems leaves the reduced semiclassical Wigner function of the other subsystem unaffected. Once stated, we advance some wild speculations regarding this seeming puzzle.

abstract: We have generated, using an sl(2,R) formalism, several new classes of quasi-solvable elliptic potentials, which in the appropriate limit go over to the exactly solvable forms. We have obtained exact solutions of the corresponding spectral problems for some real values of the potential parameters. We have also given explicit expressions of the families of associated orthogonal polynomials in the energy variable.

abstract: We study a free quantum motion on periodically structured manifolds composed of elementary two-dimensional "cells" connected either by linear segments or through points where the two cells touch. The general theory is illustrated with numerous examples in which the elementary components are spherical surfaces arranged into chains in a straight or zigzag way, or two-dimensional square-lattice "carpets". We show that the spectra of such systems have an infinite number of gaps and that the latter dominate the spectrum at high energies.

abstract: We study spectral properties of a spinless quantum particle confined to an infinite planar layer with hard walls which interacts with a periodic lattice of point perturbations and a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the layer. It is supposed that the lattice cell contains a finite number of impurities and the flux through the cell is rational. Using the Landau-Zak transformation, we convert the problem into investigation of the corresponding fiber operators which is performed by means of Krein's formula. This yields an explicit description of the spectral bands which may be absolutely continuous or degenerate, depending on the parameters of the model.

abstract: In [J. Math. Phys. {\bf 40}, 1237 (1999)] Kudaka and Matsumoto derive the uncertainty relation $c^2 \Delta m \Delta \tau \geq \hbar/2$ between the rest mass $m$ and the proper time $\tau$, by considering the Lagrangian $M(\dot \tau - c^{-1} \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}) + e A_\mu (x) \dot x^\mu$. In this note we give an alternative derivation based on a special case of the time-like geodesic equation obtained using the general relativistic Lagrangian $g_{\mu \nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d \tau}\frac{dx^\nu}{d \tau}$.

abstract: Spinors have played an essential but enigmatic role in modern physics since their discovery. Now that quantum-gravitational theories have started to become available, the inclusion of a description of spin in the development is natural and may bring about a profound understanding of the mathematical structure of fundamental physics. A program to attempt this is laid out here. Concepts from a known quantum-geometrical theory are reviewed: (1) Classical physics is replaced by a suitable geometry as a fundamental starting point for quantum mechanics. (2) In this context, a resolution is found for the enigma of wave-particle duality. (3) It is shown how to couple the quantum density to the geometrical density. (4) The mechanical gauge is introduced to allow dimensional reduction. (5) Absolute geometrical equivalence is enforced. The concordant five-dimensional quantum-geometrical theory is summarized to provide an orderly basis for the introduction of spinors. It is supposed that the Pauli--Dirac theory is adaptable. A search is begun for a description that will generate spinors as a natural tangent space. Interactions other than gravity and electrodynamics should then appear intrinsically. These are conjectured to be weak effects for electrons.

title: A class of preservers on Hilbert space effects including ortho-order automorphisms and sequential automorphisms

abstract: In this paper we study a new class of transformations on the set of all Hilbert space effects. This consists of the bijective maps which preserve the order and zero product in both directions. The main result of the paper gives a complete description of the structure of those transformations. As applications we obtain additional new results and some former ones as easy corollaries. In particular, we obtain the form of the ortho-order automorphisms as well as that of the sequential automorphisms. In the last paragraph of the paper we show that these two kinds of automorphisms belong to our class of transformations even when their domain is the set of all effects in a general von Neumann algebra.

abstract: We study accelerator modes of a particle, confined in an one-dimensional infinite square well potential, subjected to a time-periodic pulsed field. Dynamics of such a particle can be described by one generalization of the kicked rotor. In comparison with the kicked rotor, this generalization is shown to have a much larger parametric space for existence of the modes. Using this freedom we provide evidence that accelerator mode assisted anomalous transport is greatly enhanced when low order resonances are exposed at the border of chaos. We also present signature of the enhanced transport in the quantum domain.

abstract: We derive an expression for the mean square displacement of a particle whose motion is governed by a uniform, periodic, quantum multi-baker map. The expression is a function of both time, $t$, and Planck's constant, $\hbar$, and allows a study of both the long time, $t\to\infty$, and semi-classical, $\hbar\to 0$, limits taken in either order. We evaluate the expression using random matrix theory as well as numerically, and observe good agreement between both sets of results. The long time limit shows that particle transport is generically ballistic, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. The mean square displacement for non-zero Planck's constant, and finite time, exhibits a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant. We argue, that these results are generic for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum multi-baker, and that a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Some connections between our work and the other literature on quantum random walks are discussed. These walks are of some interest in the theory of quantum computation.

abstract: Using optical Ramsey interferometry, we precisely measure the laser-induced AC-stark shift on the $S_{1/2}$ -- $D_{5/2}$ "quantum bit" transition near 729 nm in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We cancel this shift using an additional laser field. This technique is of particular importance for the implementation of quantum information processing with cold trapped ions. As a simple application we measure the atomic phase evolution during a $n \times 2\pi$ rotation of the quantum bit.

abstract: Collective two-color photoassociation of a freely-interacting 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate is theoretically examined, focusing on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from an atomic to a stable molecular condensate. In particular, Drummond et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 063619 (2002); cond-mat/0110578] have predicted that particle-particle interactions can limit the efficiency of collective atom-molecule STIRAP, and that optimizing the laser parameters can partially overcome this limitation. We suggest that the molecular conversion efficiency can be further improved by treating the initial condensate density as an optimization parameter.
