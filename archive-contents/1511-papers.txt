abstract: We investigate decoherence of quantum superpositions induced by gravitational time dilation and spontaneous emission between two atomic levels. It has been shown that gravitational time dilation can be an universal decoherence source. Here, we consider decoherence induced by gravitational time dilation only in the situation of spontaneous emission. Then, we obtain that the coherence of particle's position state depends on reference frame due to the time dilation changing the distinguishability of emission photon from two positions of particle. Changing the direction of light field can also result in the difference about the coherence of quantum superpositions. For observing the decoherence effect mainly due to gravitational time dilation, time-delayed feedback can be utilized to increase the decoherence of particle's superpositions.

abstract: Recently, Lechner, Hauke and Zoller [Science Advances, 1(9)e1500838, (2015)] have proposed a quantum annealing architecture, in which a classical spin glass with all-to-all connectivity is simulated by a spin glass with geometrically local interactions. We interpret this architecture as a classical error-correcting code, which is highly robust against weakly correlated bit-flip noise.

abstract: We present a simplified version of a repeater protocol in a cold neutral-atom ensemble with Rydberg excitations optimized for two-node entanglement generation and describe a protocol for quantum teleportation. Our proposal draws from previous proposals [Zhao, et al., Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{81}$, 052329 (2010)] and [Han, et al. Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{81}$, 052311 (2010)] who described efficient and robust protocols for long-distance entanglement with many nodes. Using realistic experimental values we predict an entanglement generation rate of $\sim$30 Hz and teleportation rate of $\sim$8 Hz. Our predicted rates match the current state of the art experiments for entanglement generation and teleportation between quantum memories [Hucul, et al., Nature Phys. $\mathbf{11}$, p. 37-42 (2015)] and [Nolleke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{110}$, 140403 (2013)]. With improved efficiencies we predict entanglement generation and teleportation rates of $\sim$5 kHz and $\sim$2 kHz respectively, representing a two order of magnitude improvement over the currently realized values. Cold-atom ensembles with Rydberg excitations are promising candidates for repeater nodes because collective effects in the ensemble can be used to deterministically generate a long-lived ground state memory which may be efficiently mapped onto a directionally emitted single photon.

abstract: In this work, a quantum error correction (QEC) procedure with the concatenated five-qubit code is used to construct a near-perfect effective qubit channel (with a error below $10^{-5}$) from arbitrary noise channels. The exact performance of the QEC is characterized by a Choi matrix, which can be obtained via a simple and explicit protocol. In a noise model with five free parameters, our numerical results indicate that the concatenated five-qubit code is general: To construct a near-perfect effective channel from the noise channels, the necessary size of the concatenated five-qubit code depends only on the entanglement fidelity of the initial noise channels.

abstract: We present an efficient proposal for error-rejecting quantum computing with quantum dots (QD) embedded in single-sided optical microcavities based on the interface between the circularly-polarized photon and the QDs. A unity fidelity of the quantum entangling gate (EG) can be implemented with a detectable error that leads to a recycling EG procedure, which improves further the efficiency of our proposal for EG along with robustness to the errors involved in the imperfect input-output process. Meanwhile, we discuss the performance of our proposal for EG on two solid state spins with currently achieved experiment parameters, showing that it is feasible with current experimental technology. It provides a promising building block for solid-state quantum computing and quantum networks.

abstract: We present two one-step schemes to generate the Bell state and construct the controlled-phase gate deterministically on remote transmon qutrits trapped in different resonators connected by a superconducting transmission line for a quantum network. They are implemented with coherent evolutions of the entire system in the all-resonance regime assisted by the dark microwave photons which are robust against the transmission line loss. Different from previous works in other quantum systems for a quantum network, the present proposals do not require classical pulses and ancillary qubits. Our simulations with feasible parameters show that the fidelities of both these schemes exceed 99% which is beyond the fault-tolerant threshold for quantum communication.

abstract: Hyperentanglement, the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, has attracted much attention as it can be used to increase the channel capacity of quantum communication and its security largely. Here, we present the first scheme to completely distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states of two-photon systems in three DOFs with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity without destruction, including two longitudinal momentum DOFs and the polarization DOF. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition detectors which can be used to make a parity-check measurement and analyze Bell states of two-photon systems in different DOFs. Our complete scheme for two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell-state analysis may be useful for the practical applications in quantum information, especially in long-distance high-capacity quantum communication. We show its applications in hyperentanglement swapping and hyperdense coding with two-photon systems entangled in three DOFs simultaneously.

abstract: Quantum repeater is one of the important building blocks for long distance quantum communication network. The previous quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles and linear optical elements can only be performed with a maximal success probability of 1/2 during the entanglement creation and entanglement swapping procedures. Meanwhile, the polarization noise during the entanglement distribution process is harmful to the entangled channel created. Here we introduce a general interface between a polarized photon and an atomic ensemble trapped in a single-sided optical cavity, and with which we propose a high-efficiency quantum repeater protocol in which the robust entanglement distribution is accomplished by the stable spatial-temporal entanglement and it can in principle create the deterministic entanglement between neighboring atomic ensembles in a heralded way as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Meanwhile, the simplified parity check gate makes the entanglement swapping be completed with unity efficiency, other than 1/2 with linear optics. We detail the performance of our protocol with current experimental parameters and show its robustness to the imperfections, i.e., detuning and coupling variation, involved in the reflection process. These good features make it a useful building block in long distance quantum communication.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00142
abstract: This work derives a generalized quantum Fokker-Planck equation (GQFPE) for photo-induced nonequilibrium quantum dynamical processes by extending the path integral method pioneered by Caldeira and Leggett (CL) [Caldeira and Leggett, Physica A {\bf 121}, 587 (1983)]. The present work accounts for non-Markovian effects by expanding the Feynman-Vernon influence functional up to the second order of time consistently. The nonequilibrium effects due to the difference of the ground and the excited electronic state baths are also included naturally within this approach. This results in single time integration forms for the influence functional but with new time dependent boundary terms, which are ignored in the original derivation of CL and complicate the derivation of a time evolution equation. These however do not affect position dependent physical observables. For an effective density operator with the boundary terms factored out, a time evolution equation is derived through short time expansion of the effective action followed by Gaussian integrations in analytically continued complex domain. This leads to a compact form of equation with time dependent kernels and additional terms that were absent in the original CL's derivation. Analysis of major terms in the new GQFPE is provided for the case of Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff, and it is shown that positive definiteness condition is satisfied in medium to high temperature limit.

abstract: We examine the role of interactions for a Bose gas trapped in a double-well potential ("Bose-Josephson junction") when external noise is applied and the system is initially delocalized with equal probability amplitudes in both sites. The noise may have two kinds of effects: loss of atoms from the trap, and random shifts in the relative phase or number difference between the two wells. The effects of phase noise are mitigated by atom-atom interactions and tunneling, such that the dephasing rate may be reduced to half its single-atom value. Decoherence due to number noise (which induces fluctuations in the relative atom number between the wells) is considerably enhanced by the interactions. A similar scenario is predicted for the case of atom loss, even if the loss rates from the two sites are equal. In fact, interactions convert the increased uncertainty in atom number (difference) into (relative) phase diffusion and reduce the coherence across the junction. We examine the parameters relevant for these effects using a simple model of the trapping potential based on an atom chip device. These results provide a framework for mapping the dynamical range of barriers engineered for specific applications and sets the stage for more complex circuits ("atomtronics").

abstract: A quantum open system formed by an atom with two levels inside a cavity in a low temperature reservoir ($ T \rightarrow 0 $) is studied. The system is described by the three levels of combined atom plus cavity that loses coherence, depending on the quality of the cavity. We analyze the properties of the system, solving the evolution of a Hilbert space of three dimensions from the Lindblad equation including a decoherence term. This calculation was confirmed by mapping the Kraus operators obtained from the development of a structure of time-dependent functions from the system evolution. Because the analytical solution of the Lindblad equation is a solution of a matrix differential equation, we have compared it with a sequence of discrete time steps using the first order approximation to a Kraus operators with the aim of finding a physical interpretation of the evolution in discrete time and its relation to the search for decoherence-free spaces in quantum information.

abstract: We experimentally test quantum contextuality of a single qutrit using NMR. The contextuality inequalities based on nine observables developed by Kurzynski et. al. are first reformulated in terms of traceless observables which can be measured in an NMR experiment. These inequalities reveal the contextuality of almost all single-qutrit states. We demonstrate the violation of the inequality on four different initial states of a spin-1 deuterium nucleus oriented in a liquid crystal matrix, and follow the violation as the states evolve in time. We also describe and experimentally perform a single-shot test of contextuality for a subclass of qutrit states whose density matrix is diagonal in the energy basis.

abstract: The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information (EUR-QSI) from [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating two distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two incompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the "uncertainty witness" lower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An insightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative entropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish a tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower bound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement. As such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement causes. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum mechanics with the others mentioned above.

abstract: An ordering between the quantum states emerging from a single mode gauge-covariant bosonic Gaussian channel is proven. Specifically, we show that within the set of input density matrices with the same given spectrum, the element passive with respect to the Fock basis (i.e. diagonal with decreasing eigenvalues) produces an output which majorizes all the other outputs emerging from the same set. When applied to pure input states, our finding includes as a special case the result of A. Mari, et al., Nat. Comm. 5, 3826 (2014) which implies that the output associated to the vacuum majorizes the others.

abstract: The Rabi model plays a fundamental role in understanding light-matter interaction. It reduces to the Jaynes-Cummings model via the rotating-wave approximation, which is applicable only to the cases of near resonance and weak coupling. However, recent experimental breakthroughs in upgrading light-matter coupling order require understanding the physics of the full quantum Rabi model (QRM). Despite the fact that its integrability and energy spectra have been exactly obtained, the challenge to formulate an exact wavefunction in a general case still hinders physical exploration of the QRM. Here we unveil a ground-state phase diagram of the QRM, consisting of a quadpolaron and a bipolaron as well as their changeover in the weak-, strong- and intermediate-coupling regimes, respectively. An unexpected overweighted antipolaron is revealed in the quadpolaron state, and a hidden scaling behavior relevant to symmetry breaking is found in the bipolaron state. An experimentally accessible parameter is proposed to test these states, which might provide novel insights into the nature of the light-matter interaction for all regimes of the coupling strengths.

abstract: The absorption of broadband photons in atomic ensembles requires either an effective broadening of the atomic transition linewidth, or an off-resonance Raman interaction. Here we propose a scheme for a quantum memory capable of storing and retrieving ultrafast photons in an ensemble of two-level atoms by using a propagation medium with a time-dependent refractive index generated from aligning an ensemble of gas-phase diatomic molecules. The refractive index dynamics generates an effective longitudinal inhomogeneous broadening of the two-level transition frequency. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for storage and retrieval of a weak pulse as short as 10 fs, with a storage time of 150 fs. With additional optical control of the molecular alignment dynamics, the storage time can be extended to nanosecond timescales leading to time-bandwidth products of order $10^5$. This scheme could in principle be achieved using either a hollow-core fiber or a high-pressure gas cell, in a gaseous host medium comprised of diatomic molecules and a two-level atomic vapour at room temperature.

With linear contraction methods, the proposed criteria can be used to detect the multipartite entangled states that are biseparable under any bipartite partitions. Moreover, we show by examples that the presented multipartite separability criteria can be more efficient than the corresponding multipartite realignment criterion based on CCNR, multipartite correlation tensor criterion and multipartite covariance matrix criterion.

abstract: A dressed-state perturbation theory beyond the rotating waveapproxi-mation (RWA) is presented to investigate the interaction between a two level electronic transition of the polar molecules and a quantized cavity field. Analytical expressions can be explicitly derived for both the ground- and excited-state-energy spectrums and wave functions of the system, where the contribution of permanent dipole moments (PDM) and the counter-rotating wave term (CRT) can be shown separately. The validity of these explicit results is discussed by comparing with the direct numerical simulation. Comparing to CRT coupling, PDM results in the coupling of more dressed states and the energy shift proportional to the square of the normalized permanent dipole difference, and a greater Bloch-Siegert shift could be produced in giant dipole molecule cavity QED. In addition, our method could also be extended to the solution of two-level atom Rabi model Hamiltonian beyond the RWA.

abstract: Quantum repeater holds the promise for scalable long-distance quantum communication. Towards a first quantum repeater based on memory-photon entanglement, significant progresses have made in improving performances of the building blocks. Further development is hindered by the difficulty of integrating key capabilities such as long storage time and high memory efficiency into a single system. Here we report an efficient light-matter interface with sub-second lifetime by confining laser-cooled atoms with 3D optical lattice and enhancing the atom-photon coupling with a ring cavity. An initial retrieval efficiency of 76(5)% together with an 1/e lifetime of 0.22(1) s have been achieved simultaneously, which already support sub-Hz entanglement distribution up to 1000 km through quantum repeater. Together with an efficient telecom interface and moderate multiplexing, our result may enable a first quantum repeater system that beats direct transmission in the near future.

abstract: A four-dimensional photon polarization space, such that gives a different interpretation of the ladder operators for the time-like degree comparing with the Gupta-Bleuler formulation is presented. This interpretation, coming from a construction of a covariant Hamiltonian, gives positive defined norms for all the four polarization degrees of freedom. This paper is written in the background of reducible representations of quantum field theory introduced by Czachor, although such interpretation of the ladder operators as presented here could be done independently also in standard irreducible representation theory. Further states that reproduce standard electromagnetic fields (i.e. photons with two polarization degrees of freedom) from the four-dimensional covariant formalism (i.e. with two additional transversal and time-like polarization degrees of freedom) are shown explicitly and discussed.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is a counterintuitive phenomenon that is beyond the purview of causal influences. Recently, Bell inequalities have been generalized to the case of quantum inputs, leading to a powerful family of semi-quantum Bell inequalities that are capable of detecting a large class of entangled states. Here, we focus on a different problem and investigate how the local-indistinguishability of quantum inputs and postselection affect the requirements to detect semi-quantum nonlocality. To this end, we derive the postselected local bound and the postselected maximum quantum bound for a semi-quantum Bell inequality based on locally-indistinguishable quantum inputs. Interestingly, we find that the postselected local bound is independent of the measurement efficiency, and the achievable postselected Bell violation increases with decreasing measurement efficiency.

This enables one to create entanglement using just LOCC. Furthermore, we point out how the existence of CTCs would imply entanglement can be polygamous, and thus contradicting the prior known notions of monogamy of entanglement.

abstract: We prove that Rayleigh's criterion is fundamentally irrelevant to the localization of two incoherent point sources in far-field optical imaging. This is done in two ways: (1) We derive the quantum Cram\'er-Rao error bound for the problem under standard assumptions for thermal optical sources, and the bound shows little sign of the accuracy degradation that plagues conventional imaging when Rayleigh's criterion is violated. (2) We propose a linear optical measurement method called spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) that can attain the quantum bound for separation estimation regardless of the distance between the sources, a task conventional methods perform poorly for close sources. These results demonstrate that Rayleigh's criterion is nothing but a technicality specific to conventional imaging, and cleverer quantum measurements can locate two incoherent sources with arbitrary separation almost as accurately as conventional methods do for isolated sources.

abstract: We report the continuous and partially nondestructive measurement of optical photons. For a weak light pulse traveling through a slow-light optical medium (signal), the associated atomic-excitation component is detected by another light beam (probe) with the aid of an optical cavity. We observe strong correlations of $g^{(2)}_{sp}=4.4(5)$ between the transmitted signal and probe photons. The observed (intrinsic) conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency ranges between 10% and 1% (50% and 5%) for a signal transmission range of 2% to 22%, at a typical time resolution of 2.5 \mu s. The maximal observed (intrinsic) device nondestructive quantum efficiency, defined as the product of the conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency and the signal transmission, is 0.5% (2.4%). The normalized cross-correlation function violates the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, confirming the non-classical character of the correlations.

abstract: Entanglement, one of the central mysteries of quantum mechanics, plays an essential role in numerous applications of quantum information theory. A natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for any non-adaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine in detail a previously implemented experiment, which claimed to detect entanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without full state tomography. By performing the experiment and analyzing the data, we demonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct the state. These results reveal a fundamental limit for single-copy measurements in entanglement detection, and provides a general framework to study the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as the positivity of partial transpose and the $k$-symmetric extendibility.

The exact solutions of this equation on finite or infinite Aharonov-Bohm cylinders allow one to derive the relativistic circular and longitudinal currents pointing out their principal features. It is shown that all the circular currents are related to the energy in the same manner on cylinders or rings either in the relativistic approach or in the non-relativistic one. The specific relativistic effect is the saturation of the circular currents for high values of the total angular momentum. Based on this property some approximative closed formulas are deduced for the total persistent current at $T=0$ on finite Aharonov-Bohm cylinders. Moreover, it is shown that all the persistent currents on finite cylinders or rings have similar non-relativistic limits.

abstract: Quantum noise with exchange and tunneling is studied within time-dependent wave packets. A novel expression for the quantum noise of two identical particles injected simultaneously from opposite sides of a tunneling barrier is presented. Such quantum noise expression provides a physical (non-spurious) explanation for the experimental detection of two electrons at the same side under static potentials. Numerical simulations of the two-particle scattering probabilities in a double barrier potential with an oscillatory well are performed. The dependence of the quantum noise on the electron energy and oscillatory frequency are analyzed. The peculiar behaviour of the dependence of the quantum noise on such parameters is proposed as a test about the soundness of this novel quantum noise expression, for either static or oscillatory potentials.

abstract: We investigate the intermediate permutational symmetries of a system of qubits, which lie in between the perfect symmetric and antisymmetric cases. We prove that in average pure states of qubits picked at random with respect to the uniform measure on the unit sphere of the Hilbert space are almost as antisymmetric as they are allowed to be. We then observe that multipartite entanglement, measured by the generalized Meyer- Wallach measure, tends to be larger in subspaces that are more antisymmetric than the complete symmetric one. Eventually, we prove that all states contained in the most antisymmetric subspace are relevant multipartite entangled states in the sense that their 1-qubit reduced states are all maximally mixed.

abstract: The electric-field noise above a layered structure composed of a planar metal electrode covered by a thin dielectric is evaluated and it is found that the dielectric film considerably increases the noise level, in proportion to its thickness. Importantly, even a thin (mono) layer of a low-loss dielectric can enhance the noise level by several orders of magnitude compared to the noise above a bare metal. Close to this layered surface, the power spectral density of the electric field varies with the inverse fourth power of the distance to the surface, rather than with the inverse square, as it would above a bare metal surface. Furthermore, compared to a clean metal, where the noise spectrum does not vary with frequency (in the radio-wave and microwave bands), the dielectric layer can generate electric-field noise which scales in inverse proportion to the frequency. For various realistic scenarios, the noise levels predicted from this model are comparable to those observed in trapped-ion experiments. Thus, these findings are of particular importance for the understanding and mitigation of unwanted heating and decoherence in miniaturized ion traps.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00657
abstract: From an information processing point of view, two of the key properties of quantum physics are the no-signaling principle and the Grover search lower bound. That is, despite admitting stronger-than-classical correlations, quantum mechanics does not imply superluminal signaling, and despite a form of exponential parallelism, quantum mechanics does not imply polynomial-time brute force solution of NP-complete problems. Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are connected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for which we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information paradox: nonunitary dynamics, non-Born-rule measurement, cloning, and postselection. We find that each model admits superluminal signaling if and only if it admits a query complexity speedup over Grover's algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the physical resources required to send a superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up Grover's algorithm. Hence, one can perform a physically reasonable experiment demonstrating superluminal signaling if and only if one can perform a reasonable experiment inducing a speedup over Grover's algorithm.

abstract: Bath engineering, which utilizes coupling to lossy modes in a quantum system to generate non-trivial steady states, is a tantalizing alternative to gate- and measurement-based quantum science. Here, we demonstrate dissipative stabilization of entanglement between two superconducting transmon qubits in a symmetry-selective manner. We utilize the engineered symmetries of the dissipative environment to stabilize a target Bell state; we further demonstrate suppression of the Bell state of opposite symmetry due to parity selection rules. This implementation is resource-efficient, achieves a steady-state fidelity $\mathcal{F} = 0.70$, and is scalable to multiple qubits.

abstract: Achieving effectively adiabatic dynamics in finite time is a ubiquitous goal in virtually all areas of modern physics. So-called shortcuts to adiabaticity refer to a set of methods and techniques that allow to produce in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. In the present work we generalize one of these methods -- the fast-forward technique -- to driven Dirac dynamics. As a main result we find that shortcuts to adiababticity for the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac equation are facilitated by a combination of both, scalar and pseudoscalar potentials. Our findings are illustrated for two analytically solvable examples, namely charged particles driven in spatially homogeneous and linear vector fields.

abstract: Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum computation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary transformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum circuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources can `derandomize' circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles quantum mechanically, (analogously to a quantum random number generator). Furthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose statistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution over all unitaries up to order $t$, while foregoing adaptive feed-forward entirely. Such ensembles -- known as $t$-designs -- often cannot be distinguished from the `truly' random ensemble, and so they find use in many applications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness.

abstract: Fibonacci anyons are non-Abelian particles for which braiding is universal for quantum computation. Reichardt has shown how to systematically generate nontrivial braids for three Fibonacci anyons which yield unitary operations with off-diagonal matrix elements that can be made arbitrarily small in a particular natural basis through a simple and efficient iterative procedure. This procedure does not require brute force search, the Solovay-Kitaev method, or any other numerical technique, but the phases of the resulting diagonal matrix elements cannot be directly controlled. We show that despite this lack of control the resulting braids can be used to systematically construct entangling gates for two qubits encoded by Fibonacci anyons.

abstract: Rigorously establishing that the error in an experimental quantum operation is beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently requires considering the worst-case error, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the average gate infidelities routinely reported in experiments. We show that an improved bound on the worst-case error can be obtained by also considering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of $\approx 2.45$ for unital qubit channels. We prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most on the order of the average gate infidelity and so is negligible relative to any coherent contribution. We also show that the ``average'' error rate when measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the system exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent noise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for the diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known).

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00729
abstract: A local and deterministic model of quantum correlations is always possible, as shown explicitly by Brans in 1988: one simply needs the physical systems being measured to have a suitable statistical correlation with the physical systems performing the measurement, via some common cause. Hence, to derive no-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement independence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption --- less than 1/15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state of two qubits --- with ramifications for the security of quantum communication protocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations whatsoever --- even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling --- have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that `quantum nonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not equate to `experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that no more than 2 log d bits of prior correlation are required for a local deterministic model of the correlations between any two d-dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: The goal of adiabatic ground-state preparation is to start a simple quantum system in its ground state and adiabatically evolve the Hamiltonian to a complex one, maintaining the ground state throughout the evolution. In ion-trap-based quantum simulations, coherence times are too short to allow for adiabatic evolution for large chains, so the system evolves diabatically, creating excitations to higher energy states. Because the probability for diabatic excitation depends exponentially on the excitation energy and because the thermal distribution also depends exponentially on the excitation energy, we investigate whether the diabatic excitation can create a thermal distribution; as this could serve as an alternative for creating thermal states of complex quantum systems without requiring contact with a heat bath. In this work, we explore this relationship and determine situations where diabatic excitation can approximately create such a thermal state.

abstract: Realizing systems that support robust, controlled interactions between individual photons is an exciting frontier of nonlinear optics. To this end, one approach that has emerged recently is to leverage atomic interactions to create strong and spatially non-local interactions between photons. In particular, effective interactions have been successfully created via interactions between atoms excited to Rydberg levels. Here, we investigate an alternative approach, in which atomic interactions arise via their common coupling to photonic crystal waveguides. This technique takes advantage of the ability to separately tailor the strength and range of interactions via the dispersion engineering of the structure itself, which can lead to qualitatively new types of phenomena. As an example, we discuss the formation of correlated transparency windows, in which photonic states of a certain number and shape selectively propagate through the system. Through this technique, we show in particular that one can create molecular-like potentials that lead to molecular bound states of photon pairs.

The protocol relies on a local collisional interaction between an embedded impurity and the surrounding atomic ensemble. By tuning a few controllable external parameters the impurity-lattice interaction can be engineered and information regarding the dispersion relation of the superfluid phonons can be reliably extracted. We describe the general theory and provide an example to show its validity.

abstract: We investigate two-photon quantum interference in an opaque scattering medium that intrinsically supports $10^6$ transmission channels. By adaptive spatial phase-modulation of the incident wavefronts, the photons are directed at targeted speckle spots or output channels. From $10^3$ experimentally available coupled channels, we select two channels and enhance their transmission, to realize the equivalent of a fully programmable $2\times2$ beam splitter. By sending pairs of single photons from a parametric down-conversion source through the opaque scattering medium, we observe two-photon quantum interference. The programmed beam splitter need not fulfill energy conservation over the two selected output channels and hence could be non-unitary. Consequently, we have the freedom to tune the quantum interference from bunching (Hong-Ou-Mandel-like) to antibunching. Our results establish opaque scattering media as a platform for high-dimensional quantum interference that is notably relevant for boson sampling and physical-key-based authentication.

abstract: Generating entangled photons from a monolithic chip is a major milestone towards real-life applications of optical quantum information processing including quantum key distribution and quantum computing. Ultrabroadband entangled photons are of particular interest to various applications such as quantum metrology and multi-party entanglement distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the direct generation of broadband wavelength multiplexed polarization entangled photons from a semiconductor chip for the first time. Without the use of any on-chip compensation, interferometry, entangled photons with a signal-idler separation as large as 95 nm in the telecom band were observed. The highest concurrence of 0.98$\pm$0.01 achieved in this work is also the highest, to the best of our knowledge, comparing to all previously demonstrated semiconductor waveguide sources. This work paves the way for fully integrated, ultrabroadband sources of polarization entangled photons.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation has received increasing attention due to its robustness against control errors. However, all the previous schemes have to use at least two sequentially implemented gates to realize a general one-qubit gate. In this paper, we put forward a novelty scheme by which one can directly realize an arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gate with a single-shot implementation, avoiding the extra work of combining two gates into one. Based on a three-level model driven by laser pulses, we show that any single-qubit holonomic gate can be realized by varying the detuning, amplitude, and phase of lasers. Our scheme is compatible with previously proposed non-adiabatic holonomic two-qubit gates, combining with which the arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gates can play universal non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We also investigate the effects of some unavoidable realistic errors on our scheme.

abstract: Superradiance, i.e., spontaneous emission of coherent radiation by an ensemble of identical two-level atoms in collective states introduced by Dicke in 1954, is one of the enigmatic problems of quantum optics. The startling gist is that even though the atoms have no dipole moment they radiate with increased intensity in particular directions. Following the advances in our understanding of superradiant emission by atoms in entangled $W$ states we examine the quantum statistical properties of superradiance. Such investigations require the system to have at least two excitations as one needs to explore the photon-photon correlations of the radiation emitted by such states. We present specifically results for the spatially resolved photon-photon correlations of systems prepared in doubly excited $W$ states and give conditions when the atomic system emits nonclassial light. Equally, we derive the conditions for the occurrence of bunching and even of superbunching, a rare phenomenon otherwise known only from nonclassical states of light like the squeezed vacuum. We finally investigate the photon-photon cross correlations of the spontaneously scattered light and highlight the nonclassicalty of such correlations.

abstract: The existence of incompatible measurement setups is one of the distinctive features of quantum theory. Here we extend the notion of incompatibility from measurements that test preparations to measurements that test dynamical processes. Such measurements, known as testers, consist of the preparation of an input state, the application of the tested process, and a measurement on the output. Mathematically, testers are described by a suitable generalization of the notion of positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Unlike in the case of POVMs, however, testers that commute are not necessarily compatible, and testers that are compatible do not necessarily commute. Given a set of testers, we define the robustness of incompatibility as the minimum amount of mixing needed to make the testers compatible. We show that (i) the robustness is lower bounded by the distinguishability of the input states prepared by the different testers, and (ii) maximum robustness is attained when the input states are orthogonal. An extensive analysis of incompatibility is provided for factorized qubit testers with two outcomes. All our results can be extended to measurements that test quantum processes consisting of multiple time steps.

We show this provides a framework to enhance quantum simulations of novel physical phenomena, including reservoir models and dynamical gauge fields, beyond current methods.

We show that for dipolar interaction the separation of time scales between system and bath can not produce pure dephasing, the process being accompained by dissipation. Activated and non activated dephasing processes are demonstrated in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center.

abstract: We identify and study a new security loophole in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) implementations, related to the imperfect linearity of the homodyne detector. By exploiting this loophole, we propose an active side-channel attack on the Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol combining an intercept-resend attack with an induced saturation of the homodyne detection on the receiver side (Bob). We show that an attacker can bias the excess noise estimation by displacing the quadratures of the coherent states received by Bob. We propose a saturation model that matches experimental measurements on the homodyne detection and use this model to study the impact of the saturation attack on parameter estimation in CV-QKD.We demonstrate that this attack can bias the excess noise estimation beyond the null key threshold for any system parameter, thus leading to a full security break. If we consider an additional criteria imposing that the channel transmission estimation should not be affected by the attack, then the saturation attack can only be launched if the attenuation on the quantum channel is sufficient, corresponding to attenuations larger than approximately 6 dB. We moreover discuss the possible counter-measures against the saturation attack and propose a new counter- measure based on Gaussian post-selection that can be implemented by classical post-processing and may allow to distill secret key when the raw measurement data is partly saturated.

abstract: The gravitational field of a laser pulse of finite lifetime, is investigated in the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small, they may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the gravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the norm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise for circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent of the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are confined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these shells are associated with the emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby test particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled from the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption. Examples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that massless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are co-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test particles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger than for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational effect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed out. The spacetime curvature close to the pulse is compared to that induced by gravitational waves from astronomical sources.

In this work we analytically calculate this new quantity, the volume of violation, for the spin-singlet state with respect to the settings of the first Bell's inequality. The full characterization of these settings corresponds to three directions in space, or three arbitrary points on the unit sphere. It is shown that the triples of directions that lead to violations in local causality correspond to $1/3$ of all possible orientation triples.

abstract: In our quantum mechanics courses, measurement is usually taught in passing, as an ad-hoc procedure involving the ugly collapse of the wave function. No wonder we search for more satisfying alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation. But this overlooks the fact that the approach fits very well with modern measurement theory with its notions of the conditioned state and quantum trajectory. In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen interpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers like Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these earlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more satisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the collapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device. Along the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that spread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states are the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories. We then describe how the conditioned state of a quantum system depends crucially on how the system is monitored illustrating this with the example of a decaying atom monitored with a time of arrival photon detector, leading to Bohr's quantum jumps. On the other hand, other kinds of detection lead to much smoother behaviour, providing yet another example of complementarity. Finally we explain how classical behaviour emerges, including classical mechanics but also thermodynamics.

However, SO-coupling and corresponding topological-features have not been examined in optical-cavity with one vibrational-mirror. Here we report cavity-optomechanics with SO-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, inducing non-Abelian gauge-field in cavity. We ascertain the influences of SO-coupling and long-range atomic-interactions on low-temperature dynamics which can be experimentally measured by maneuvering area underneath density-noise spectrum. It is detected that not only optomechanical-coupling is modifying topological properties of atomic dressed-states but SO-coupling induced topological-effects are also enabling us to control effective-temperature of mechanical-mirror and dynamic structure factor, which is measurable by detecting neutron-scattering. Our findings are testable in a realistic setup and provide foundations to manipulate SO-coupling in the field of quantum optics and quantum computation.

abstract: We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary rules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely operational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S; no ontic assumptions are necessary. From the rules we derive the state spaces for N qubits and show that (a) they coincide with the set of density matrices over N qubit Hilbert spaces; (b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) the binary questions by means of which O interrogates the systems corresponds to projective measurements on Pauli operators with outcome probabilities given by the Born rule. Besides offering a novel conceptual perspective on qubit quantum theory, the reconstruction also unravels new structural insights. Namely, we show that, in a quadratic information measure, (d) qubits satisfy informational complementarity inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually complementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually complementary questions for 2 qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of information in pure states. The latter relations constitute 6 conserved informational charges which define the unitary group and, together with their 15 conservation conditions, the set of pure states. This underscores the benefits of this informational approach and emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to an observer's information in order to reconstruct the theory. This article completes the work started in arXiv:1412.8323.

abstract: Within the hierarchy of inseparable quantum correlations, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is distinguished from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality by its asymmetry -- there exist conditions where the steering phenomenon changes from being observable to not observable, simply by exchanging the role of the two measuring parties. Whilst this one-way steering feature has been previously demonstrated for the restricted class of Gaussian measurements, for the general case of positive-operator-valued measures even its theoretical existence has only recently been settled. Here, we prove, and then experimentally observe, the one-way steerability of an experimentally practical class of entangled states in this general setting. As well as its foundational significance, the demonstration of fundamentally asymmetric nonlocality also has practical implications for the distribution of the trust in quantum communication networks.

abstract: A maximal steady-state fermionic entanglement of a nanoelectronic system is generated in finite temperature non-Markovian environments. The fermionic entanglement dynamics is presented by connecting the exact solution of the system with an appropriate definition of fermionic entanglement. We prove that the two understandings of the dissipationless non-Markovian dynamics, namely the bound state and the modified Laplace transformation are completely equivalent. For comparison, the steady-state entanglement is also studied in the wide-band limit and Born-Markovian approximation. When the environments have a finite band structure, we find that the system presents various kinds of relaxation processes. The final states can be: thermal or thermal-like states, quantum memory states and oscillating quantum memory states. Our study provide an analytical way to explore the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of identical fermions in a realistic setting, i.e., finite temperature reservoirs with a cutoff spectrum.

abstract: We investigate dynamics of an optomechanical system under the Non-Markovian environment. In the weak optomechanical single-photon coupling regime, we provide an analytical approach fully taking into account the non-Markovian memory effects. When the cavity-bath coupling strength crosses a certain threshold, an oscillating memory state for the classical cavity field (called bound state) is formed. Due to the existence of the non-decay optical bound state, a nonequilibrium optomechanical thermal entanglement is preserved even without external driving laser. Our results provide a potential usage to generate and protect entanglement via Non-Markovian environment engineering.

abstract: Coherent evolution governs the behaviour of all quantum systems, but in nature it is often subjected to influence of a classical environment. For analysing quantum transport phenomena quantum walks emerge as suitable model systems. In particular, quantum walks on percolation structures constitute an attractive platform for studying open system dynamics of random media. Here, we present an implementation of quantum walks differing from the previous experiments by achieving dynamical control of the underlying graph structure. We demonstrate the evolution of an optical time-multiplexed quantum walk over six double steps, revealing the intricate interplay between the internal and external degrees of freedom. The observation of clear non-Markovian signatures in the coin space testifies the high coherence of the implementation and the extraordinary degree of control of all system parameters. Our work is the proof-of-principle experiment of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph, paving the way towards complex simulation of quantum transport in random media.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the coupling of an ultracold three-level atomic gas and a nano-mechanical mirror via classical electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pressure on the mirror is modulated by absorption of a probe light field, caused by the atoms which are electromagnetically rendered nearly transparent, allowing the gas to affect the mirror. In turn, the mirror can affect the gas as its vibrations generate opto-mechanical sidebands in the control field. We show that the sidebands cause modulations of the probe intensity at the mirror frequency, which can be enhanced near atomic resonances. Through the radiation pressure from the probe beam onto the mirror, this results in resonant driving of the mirror. Controllable by the two photon detuning, the phase relation of the driving to the mirror motion decides upon amplification or damping of mirror vibrations. This permits direct phase locking of laser amplitude modulations to the motion of a nano-mechanical element opening a perspective for cavity-free cooling through coupling to an atomic gas.

abstract: A central tenet of theoretical cryptography is the study of the minimal assumptions required to implement a given cryptographic primitive. One such primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here, we show how to use quantum information, together with the assumption of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure OTMs. This is in sharp contrast with the classical case, where stateless hardware tokens alone cannot yield OTMs. In addition, our scheme is technologically simple. We prove security in the quantum universal composability framework, employing semi-definite programming results of Molina, Vidick and Watrous [TQC 2013] and combinatorial techniques of Pastawski et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2012].

abstract: We study the behavior of the non-adiabatic population transfer between resonances at an exceptional point in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. It is known that, when the exceptional point is encircled, the system always ends up in the same state, independent of the initial occupation within the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the states coalescing at the exceptional point. We verify this behavior for a realistic quantum system, viz. the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields. It is also shown that the non-adiabatic hypothesis can be violated when resonances in the vicinity are taken into account. In addition, we study the non-adiabatic population transfer in the case of a third-order exceptional point, in which three resonances are involved.

abstract: Processing and distributing quantum information using photons through fibre-optic or free-space links is essential for building future quantum networks. The scalability needed for such networks can be achieved by employing photonic quantum states that are multiplexed into time and/or frequency, and light-matter interfaces that are able to store and process such states with large time-bandwidth product and multimode capacities. Despite important progress in developing such devices, the demonstration of these capabilities using non-classical light remains challenging. Employing the atomic frequency comb quantum memory protocol in a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped optical fibre, we report the quantum storage of heralded single photons at a telecom-wavelength (1.53 {\mu}m) with a time-bandwidth product approaching 800. Furthermore we demonstrate frequency-multimode storage as well as memory-based spectral-temporal photon manipulation. Notably, our demonstrations rely on fully integrated quantum technologies operating at telecommunication wavelengths, i.e. a fibre-pigtailed nonlinear waveguide for the generation of heralded single photons, an erbium-doped fibre for photon storage and manipulation, and fibre interfaced superconducting nanowire devices for efficient single photon detection. With improved storage efficiency, our light-matter interface may become a useful tool in future quantum networks.

abstract: Transfer matrix is an indispensable tool in the study of scattering phenomena in (effectively) one-dimensional systems. We introduce a genuine multidimensional notion of transfer matrix and use it to develop a powerful alternative to the standard S-matrix formulation of scattering theory. Because this transfer matrix shares the composition property of its one-dimensional analog, our formulation allows for the determination of the scattering properties of any scattering potential $v$ from that of any collection of its truncations $v_j$ along the scattering axis as long as $v=\sum_jv_j$. This is the main advantage of our approach particularly with regard to the numerical solution of multidimensional scattering problems. We demonstrate its application in solving the scattering problem for delta-function potentials in two and three-dimensions and provide an analytic treatment of the scattering of electromagnetic waves from an infinite slab of optically active material with a surface line defect. In particular, we determine the laser threshold condition for the latter system and show that the presence of the defect makes the slab begin lasing for arbitrarily small gain coefficients.

abstract: A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.

abstract: We study the dynamical entanglement of two identical atoms interacting with a quantum field. As a simplified model for this physical system we consider two harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to a massless scalar field in the dressed coordinates and states approach and enclose the whole system inside a spherical cavity of radius R. Through a quantity called concurrence, the entanglement evolution for the two-atom system will be discussed, for a range of initial states composed of a superposition of atomic states. Our results reveals how the concurrence of the two atoms behaves through the time evolution, for arbitrary cavity size and for arbitrary coupling constant, weak, intermediate or strong. All our computations are exact and only the final step is numerical. These numerical solutions give us fascinating results for the concurrence, such as quasi-random fluctuations, with a resemblance of periodicity. Another interesting result we found is when the system is initially maximally entangled (disentangled), after the time t = 2R, the system becomes again strongly entangled (disentangled) particularly during the first oscillations, later this phenomenon could be wrecked depending on the initial condition. We also show the concurrence after a too long time elapsed with a good precision.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.01433
abstract: We study the problem of quantum-state tomography under the realistic assumption that the state of the system is close to pure. In the context of pure-state tomography we typically wish to formulate measurements that distinguish a pure state from any other pure state. However, since the set of pure states is nonconvex, in general such measurements cannot be used to robustly estimate of the state. Nevertheless, we prove that the physical constraint that the density matrix is positive semidefinite allows us to define measurements that, in fact, yield a robust estimation of the state. Furthermore, the estimation can be obtained by solving essentially any convex program. We argue that one can implement such tomography relatively simply by measuring only a few random orthonormal bases. Our conjecture is supported by strong numerical evidence. These results are generalized for estimation of states close to bounded-rank.

abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers can couple to confined phonons in diamond mechanical resonators via the effect of lattice strain on their energy levels. Access to the strong spin-phonon coupling regime with this system requires resonators with nanoscale dimensions in order to overcome the weak strain response of the NV ground state spin sublevels. In this work, we study NVs in diamond cantilevers with lateral dimensions of a few hundred nm. Coupling of the NV ground state spin to the mechanical mode is detected in electron spin resonance (ESR), and its temporal dynamics are measured via spin echo. Our small mechanical mode volume leads to a 10-100X enhancement in spin-phonon coupling strength over previous NV-strain coupling demonstrations. This is an important step towards strong spin-phonon coupling, which can enable phonon-mediated quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

We apply the modern quantum mechanics of closed systems to calculate the probabilities for alternative histories of how we move through the universe and what we see. After passing through the screen with the slits, the quantum state of the universe is a superposition of classically distinguishable histories. We are then living in a superposition. Some frequently asked questions about such situations are answered using this model. The model's relationship to more realistic quantum cosmologies is briefly discussed.

abstract: Lattice models of fermions, bosons, and spins have long served to elucidate the essential physics of quantum phase transitions in a variety of systems. Generalizing such models to incorporate driving and dissipation has opened new vistas to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena and dissipative phase transitions in interacting many-body systems. We present a framework for the treatment of such open quantum lattices based on a resummation scheme for the Lindblad perturbation series. Employing a convenient diagrammatic representation, we utilize this method to obtain relevant observables for the open Jaynes-Cummings lattice, a model of special interest for open-system quantum simulation. We demonstrate that the resummation framework allows us to reliably predict observables for both finite and infinite Jaynes-Cummings lattices with different lattice geometries. The resummation of the Lindblad perturbation series can thus serve as a valuable tool in validating open quantum simulators, such as circuit-QED lattices, currently being investigated experimentally.

abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computation and communication. It is necessary for many protocols and computations, but causes unexpected disturbance of computational states. Hence, static analysis of quantum entanglement in quantum programs is necessary. Several papers studied the problem. They decided qubits were entangled if multiple qubits unitary gates are applied to them, and some refined this reasoning using information about the state of each separated qubit. However, they do not care about the fact that unitary gate undoes entanglement and that measurement may separate multiple qubits. In this paper, we extend prior work using stabilizer formalism. It refines reasoning about separability of quantum variables in quantum programs.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering describes the ability of one observer to nonlocally "steer" the other observer's state through local measurements. It exhibits a unique asymmetric property, i.e., the steerability of one observer to steer the other's state could be different from each other, which can even lead to a one-way EPR steering, i.e., only one observer obtains the steerability in the two-observer case. This property is inherently different from the symmetric concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality and has been attracted increasing interests. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the asymmetric EPR steering for a class of two-qubit states in the case of two measurement settings. We propose a practical method to quantify the steerability. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for EPR steering and clearly show the case of one-way EPR steering. Our work provides a new insight on the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality and would find potential application in asymmetric quantum information processing.

abstract: Strongly interacting particles in one dimension subject to external confinement have become a topic of considerable interest due to recent experimental advances and the development of new theoretical methods to attack such systems. In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more internal degrees of freedom, one can map the problem onto the well-known Heisenberg spin models. However, many interesting physical systems contain mixtures of particles with different masses. Therefore, a generalization of the recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable. This is particularly important since such problems are generally considered non-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach cannot be applied. Here we discuss some initial steps towards this goal by investigating small ensembles of one-dimensional harmonically trapped particles where pairwise interactions are either vanishing or infinitely strong with focus on the mass-imbalanced case. We discuss a possible (semi)-analytical approach to describe systems using hyperspherical coordinates where the interaction is effectively decoupled from the trapping potential. As an illustrative example we analyze mass-imbalanced four-particle two-species mixtures with strong interactions between the two species. For such systems we calculate the energies, densities and pair-correlation functions.

abstract: A method is introduced which allows to measure normal-ordered moments of the displaced photon-number operator up to high orders. It is based on unbalanced homodyne correlation measurements, the local oscillator being replaced by a displaced dephased laser. The measured moments yield a simple approximation of the full quantum state, which is obtained without the need of photon-number resolution. Quantum properties of light are efficiently certified through the direct detection of normal-ordered observables, which is illustrated for a weakly squeezed vacuum and a single-photon-added thermal state.

abstract: We present a simple and efficient Bayesian recursive algorithm for the data-pattern scheme for quantum state reconstruction, which is applicable to situations where measurement settings can be controllably varied efficiently. The algorithm predicts the best measurements required to accurately reconstruct the unknown signal state in terms of a fixed set of probe states. In each iterative step, this algorithm seeks the measurement setting that minimizes the variance of the data-pattern estimator, which essentially measures the reconstruction accuracy, with the help of a data-pattern bank that was acquired prior to the signal reconstruction. We show that with this algorithm, it is possible to minimize the number of measurement settings required to obtain a reasonably accurate state estimator by using just the optimal settings and, at the same time, increasing the numerical efficiency of the data-pattern reconstruction.

abstract: The states of an open quantum system interact ("talk") with one another via the (extended) environment into which the (localized) system is embedded. This interaction is involved in the source term of the Schr\"odinger equation which describes the coupling between system and environment. The source term is strong only in the neighborhood of singular (exceptional) points. It is nonlinear and causes (dynamical) phase transitions in multi-level systems. We sketch the formalism and provide typical results. The relation to superradiance; to PT-symmetry breaking; and also to the violation of the Bell inequality is discussed.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, a generalization of the original concept of "steering" proposed by Schr\"{o}dinger, describes the ability of one system to nonlocally affect another system's states through local measurements. Some experimental efforts to test EPR steering in terms of inequalities have been made, which usually require many measurement settings. Analogy to the "All-Versus-Nothing" (AVN) proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities, testing steerability without inequalities would be more strong and require less resource. Moreover, the practical meaning of steering implies that it should also be possible to store the state information on the side to be steered, a result that has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Using a recent AVN criterion for two qubit entangled states, we experimentally implement a practical steering game using quantum memory. Further more, we develop a theoretical method to deal with the noise and finite measurement statistics within the AVN framework and apply it to analyze the experimental data. Our results clearly show the facilitation of the AVN criterion for testing steerability and provide a particularly strong perspective for understanding EPR steering.

This provides an analytical understanding of the recent experimental results of W. Muessel et al. Phys. Rev. A 92, 023603 (2015).

abstract: We show that trace distance measure of coherence is a strong monotone for all qubit and, so called, $X$ states. An expression for the trace distance coherence for all pure states and a semi definite program for arbitrary states is provided. We explore also the relation between $l_1$-norm and relative entropy based measures of coherence, and give a sharp inequality connecting the two. In addition, it is also shown that both $l_p$-norm and Schatten-$p$ norm based measures violate the strong monotonicity for all $p\in(1,\infty)$.

abstract: The ability to transfer quantum information from one location to another with high fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science. Unfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or a particle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time grows exponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we show that the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniform chain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelity state transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can be tuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\propto N^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with large amplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues. The state transfer time scales as $t\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$ approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$; the error scales as $1-F\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptotically perfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence of external control.

abstract: Free-electron lasers (FELs) produce short and very intense light pulses in the XUV and x-ray regimes. We investigate the possibility to drive Rabi oscillations in xenon with an intense FEL pulse by using the unusually large dipole strength of the giant-dipole resonance (GDR). The GDR decays within less than 30 as due to its position, which is above the $4d$ ionization threshold. We find that intensities around 10$^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ are required to induce Rabi oscillations with a period comparable to the lifetime. The pulse duration should not exceed 100 as because xenon will be fully ionized within a few lifetimes. Rabi oscillations reveal themselves also in the photoelectron spectrum in form of Autler-Townes splittings extending over several tens of electronvolt.

abstract: We study corner contributions to holographic mutual information for entangling regions composed of a set of disjoint sectors of a single infinite circle in three-dimensional conformal field theories. In spite of the UV divergence of holographic mutual information, it exhibits a first order phase transition. We show that tripartite information is also divergent for disjoint sectors, which is in contrast with the well-known feature of tripartite information being finite even when entangling regions share boundaries. We also verify the locality of corner effects by studying mutual information between regions separated by a sharp annular region. Possible extensions to higher dimensions and hyperscaling violating geometries is also considered for disjoint sectors.

abstract: The strong interaction of individual quantum emitters with resonant cavities is of fundamental interest for understanding light matter interactions, as well as for quantum information processing and quantum communication applications. Plasmonic cavities hold the promise of attaining the strong coupling regime even under ambient conditions and within subdiffraction volumes. Recent experiments revealed strong coupling between individual plasmonic structures and multiple organic molecules, but so far strong coupling at the limit of a single quantum emitter has not been reported. Here we demonstrate vacuum Rabi splitting, a manifestation of strong coupling, using silver bowtie plasmonic cavities loaded with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). A transparency dip is observed in the scattering spectra of individual bowties with one to a few QDs in their gaps. Rabi splitting values as high as 180 meV are registered with a single QD. These observations are verified by polarization-dependent experiments and validated by electromagnetic calculations.

abstract: A generalization of the MIT bag boundary condition for spinor matter is proposed basing on the requirement that the Dirac hamiltonian operator be self-adjoint. An influence of a background magnetic field on the vacuum of charged spinor matter confined between two parallel material plates is studied. Employing the most general set of boundary conditions at the plates in the case of the uniform magnetic field directed orthogonally to the plates, we find the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates. In physically plausible situations, the Casimir effect is shown to be repulsive, independently of a choice of boundary conditions and of a distance between the plates.

Our general results reproduce many predictions obtained in the literature, using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method (NU) and the Improved Quantization Rule approach, particulary those derived by considering Woods-Saxon potential without deformation and/or without ring shape interaction.

abstract: Suppression of wave scattering and the realization of transparency effects in engineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the past recent years. In this work the problem of transparency is considered for optical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second-order $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility. Because of nonlinear interaction, a reference signal wave at carrier frequency $\omega_1$ can exchange power, thus being amplified or attenuated,when phase matching conditions are satisfied and frequency conversion takes place. Therefore, rather generally the medium is not transparent to the signal wave because of 'scattering' in the frequency domain. Here we show that broadband transparency, corresponding to the full absence of frequency conversion in spite of phase matching, can be observed for the signal wave in the process of sum frequency generation whenever the effective susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a suitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is properly tuned. While broadband transparency is observed under such conditions, the nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective dispersion for the signal wave introduced by the nonlinear interaction.

abstract: In this letter we analyze an optical Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a time-periodic driving of the (2D) optical field repeatedly traversing the resonator, uncovering that resonator twist produces a synthetic magnetic field applied to the light within the resonator, while mirror aberrations produce relativistic dynamics, anharmonic trapping, and spacetime curvature. We develop a Floquet formalism to compute the effective Hamiltonian for the 2D field, generalizing the idea that the intra-cavity optical field corresponds to an ensemble of non-interacting, massive, harmonically trapped particles. This work illuminates the extraordinary potential of optical resonators for exploring the physics of quantum fluids in gauge fields and exotic space-times.

abstract: Photoelectron spectra and photoelectron angular distributions obtained in photoionization reveal important information on e.g. charge transfer or hole coherence in the parent ion. Here we show that optimal control of the underlying quantum dynamics can be used to enhance desired features in the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. To this end, we combine Krotov's method for optimal control theory with the time-dependent configuration interaction singles formalism and a splitting approach to calculate photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. The optimization target can account for specific desired properties in the photoelectron angular distribution alone, in the photoelectron spectrum, or in both. We demonstrate the method for hydrogen and then apply it to argon under strong XUV radiation, maximizing the difference of emission into the upper and lower hemispheres, in order to realize directed electron emission in the XUV regime.

abstract: The Schwinger model, or 1+1 dimensional QED, offers an interesting object of study, both at zero and non-zero temperature, because of its similarities to QCD. In this proceeding, we present the a full calculation of the temperature dependent chiral condensate of this model in the continuum limit using Matrix Product States (MPS). MPS methods, in general tensor networks, constitute a very promising technique for the non-perturbative study of Hamiltonian quantum systems. In the last few years, they have shown their suitability as ansatzes for ground states and low-lying excita- tions of lattice gauge theories. We show the feasibility of the approach also for finite temperature, both in the massless and in the massive case.

abstract: We show that all sequentially growing networks yield the same universal behavior at the breakdown of single-particle quantum transport. For this, we study the global time-averaged transport efficiency of excitations on complex quantum networks. Further, we observe the transition to optimal transport by starting from a network with complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs and systematically reducing the number of loops. These effects are explained on the basis of the spectral properties of the network's Hamiltonian. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical Monte-Carlo simulations for complex quantum networks with a scale-free size distribution of sequential subgraphs and a small-world-type transition to optimal transport.

Gerritsma et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 080402 (2012)] as a source of entanglement between a Bose-Einstein condensate and an ion. Compared to the previous study, the present work aims at performing a detailed and accurate many-body analysis of such combined atomic quantum system by means of the ab-initio multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons, which allows to take into account all correlations in the system. The analysis elucidates the importance of quantum correlations in the bosonic ensemble and reveals that entanglement generation between an ion and a condensate is indeed possible, as previously predicted. Moreover, we provide an intuitive picture of the impact of the correlations on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by employing a natural orbital analysis which we show to be indeed experimentally verifiable.

abstract: The micro-world is governed by the laws of Quantum Theory. Although we cannot directly experience Quantum Mechanics in action, it imperceptibly enters our everyday life. It explains the structure of matter on the one hand and stands behind all modern technologies on the other. It also gives a completely different meaning to the classical concept of identical objects. Quantum identical particles are identical not only because they share the same mass, spin, charge, etc., but also because they cannot be identified by tracing their history. Indistinguishability results in a division of the world of elementary particles into fundamentally different families: fermions (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons) and bosons (e.g. photons, gluons, Higgs boson). Identical fermions subjected to the Fermi-Dirac statistics cannot occupy the same quantum state. Here we show yet another, so far undiscovered, consequence of quantum indistinguishability. We show that identical fermions confined by an external trapping potential arrange themselves in spectacular geometric structures although no mutual interaction is present. This is because the indistinguishability of fermions, formulated in the language of the Pauli exclusion principle, prevents any two fermions from being at the same location. These unexplored geometric structures, Pauli crystals, emerge repeatedly in single-shot pictures of the many-body system. Pauli crystals form a previously unknown form of particles' organization. Our results shed some light on the role of quantum statistics -- one of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics of many-body systems.

abstract: The definition of classical transition state theory (TST) as the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that simultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical process. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime impossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as any kind of quantum rate theory that can reproduce the TST in the proper classical limit, which is not guaranteed to be unique. Indeed, there have been various versions of QTST based on different formulations and approximations. Recently, contrary to this commonly accepted view, Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 138}, 084108 (2013)] made an argument that a true and unique QTST can be defined as the exact $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a certain quantum flux-side time correlation function and that it is equivalent to the rate expression from the ring polymer molecular dynamics TST. However, the starting expression for HA's QTST does not appear to have a clear physical basis. In addition, a careful analysis of the formulation underlying HA's arguments clarifies that a key step implicit in their conclusion amounts to an incorrect application of a quantum mechanical identity. As an alternative, we provide a new quantum rate expression by applying a recently developed formalism of real time dynamics of imaginary time path integrals [S. Jang, A. V. Sinitskiy, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 140}, 154103 (2014)] to a well-established rate expression based on quantum linear response theory. In turn, the new rate expression satisfies the property that the $t\rightarrow 0_+ $ limit of QTST should vanish due to quantum delocalization as well as noncommutativity of population and flux operators.

abstract: Light beams can carry a discrete, in principle unbounded amount of angular momentum. Examples of such beams, the Laguerre-Gauss modes, are frequently expressed as solutions of the paraxial wave equation. There, they are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator. The paraxial solutions predict that beams with large OAM could be used to resolve arbitrarily small distances - a dubious situation. Here we show how to solve that situation by calculating the properties of beams free from the paraxial approximation. We find the surprising result that indeed one can resolve smaller distances with larger OAM, although with decreased visibility. If the visibility is kept constant (for instance at the Rayleigh criterion, the limit where two points are reasonably distinguishable), larger OAM does not provide an advantage. The drop in visibility is due to a field in the direction of propagation, which is neglected within the paraxial limit.

abstract: Burning something, (e.g. the proverbial lump of coal, or an encyclopaedia for that matter), in a blackbody furnace leads to an approximately Planck emission spectrum with an average entropy/information transfer of approximately $3.9 \pm 2.5$ bits per emitted photon. This quantitative and qualitative result depends only on the underlying unitarity of the quantum physics of burning, combined with the statistical mechanics of blackbody radiation. The fact that the utterly standard and unitarity preserving process of burning something (in fact, burning anything) nevertheless *has* an associated entropy/information budget, and the quantitative *size* of that entropy/information budget, is a severely under-appreciated feature of standard quantum statistical physics.

abstract: We develop a new lower bound method for analysing the complexity of the Equality function (EQ) in the Simultaneous Message Passing (SMP) model of communication complexity. The new technique gives tight lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ for both EQ and its negation NE in the non-deterministic version of quantum-classical SMP, where Merlin is also quantum $-$ this is the strongest known version of SMP where the complexity of both EQ and NE remain high (previously known techniques seem to be insufficient for this). Besides, our analysis provides to a unified view of the communication complexity of EQ and NE, allowing to obtain tight characterisation in all previously studied and a few newly introduced versions of SMP, including all possible combination of either quantum or randomised Alice, Bob and Merlin in the non-deterministic case. Some of our results highlight that NE is easier than EQ in the presence of classical proofs, whereas the problems have (roughly) the same complexity when a quantum proof is present.

abstract: We review some features of BEC models of black holes obtained by means of the HWF formalism. We consider the KG equation for a toy graviton field coupled to a static matter current in spherical symmetry. The classical field reproduces the Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding quantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with continuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for bound states to form, so that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the system of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the Schwarzschild radius. The HWF is then used to show that the radius of such a system corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the horizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with the increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), in agreement with semiclassical calculations and different from a single very massive particle. The spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$ (the bosons forming the black hole), and a continuous spectrum with energy $\omega > m$ (representing the Hawking radiation and modelled with a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature). The $N$-particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian distribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition function is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a logarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of modes with $\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass.

abstract: We present a proposal for controlling the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules by fixing the phase difference between two oscillating magnetic fields. The scheme is based on the use of a magnetic Feshbach resonance with a field modulation that incorporates terms oscillating with frequencies corresponding to the main resonance and one of the subharmonics. The interference between the two association processes activated by the oscillating terms is controlled via the phase difference. As a result, significant increase or decrease of the effective interaction strength can be achieved. The realization of the proposal is feasible under standard technical conditions. In particular, the method is found to be robust against the effect of the sources of decoherence present in the practical setup. The applicability of the approach to deal with quadratic terms in the field modulation is discussed.

We present a new model of light-induced loss spectra, employing continuum-dressed basis states, that agrees in shape and magnitude with measurements for both broad and narrow resonances.

abstract: We provide a self-contained review of master equation approaches to modelling phonon effects in optically driven self-assembled quantum dots. Coupling of the (quasi) two-level excitonic system to phonons leads to dissipation and dephasing, the rates of which depend on the excitation conditions, intrinsic properties of the QD sample, and its temperature. We describe several techniques, which include weak-coupling master equations that are perturbative in the exciton-phonon coupling, as well as those based on the polaron transformation that can remain valid for strong phonon interactions. We additionally consider the role of phonons in altering the optical emission characteristics of quantum dot devices, outlining how we must modify standard quantum optics treatments to account for the presence of the solid-state environment.

abstract: We examine the performance of our recently developed LFAs-PBE exchange-correlation (XC) potential [C.-R. Pan, P.-T. Fang, and J.-D. Chai, Phys. Rev. A, 2013, 87, 052510] for the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra and related properties of H2+ molecules aligned parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of an intense linearly polarized laser pulse, employing the real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT). The results are compared with the exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation as well as those obtained with other XC potentials in RT-TDDFT. Owing to its correct $(-1/r)$ asymptote, the LFAs-PBE potential significantly outperforms conventional XC potentials for the HHG spectra and the properties that are sensitive to the XC potential asymptote. Accordingly, the LFAs-PBE potential, which has a computational cost similar to that of the popular Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential, can be very promising for the study of the ground-state, excited-state, and time-dependent properties of large electronic systems, extending the applicability of density functional methods for a diverse range of applications.

abstract: The structure of Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex has long been recognized as containing seven bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. Recently, an additional BChl molecule was discovered in the crystal structure of the FMO complex, which may serve as a link between baseplate and the remaining seven molecules. Here, we investigate excitation energy transfer (EET) process by simulating single-molecule pump-dump experiment in the eight-molecules complex. We adopt the coherent modified Redfield theory and non-Markovian quantum jump method to simulate EET dynamics. This scheme provides a practical approach of detecting the realistic EET pathway in BChl complexes with currently available experimental technology. And it may assist optimizing design of artificial light-harvesting devices.

abstract: We study supercurrent and proximity vortices in a Josephson junction made of disordered surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator with a proximity induced in-plane helical magnetization. In a regime where the rotation period of helical magnetization is larger than the junction width, we find supercurrent 0-{\pi} crossovers as a function of junction thickness, magnetization strength, and parameters inherent to the helical modulation and surface states. The supercurrent reversals are associated with proximity induced vortices, nucleated along the junction width, where the number of vortices and their locations can be manipulated by means of the superconducting phase difference and the parameters mentioned above.

abstract: In low-rank matrix recovery, one aims to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a minimal number of linear measurements. Within the paradigm of compressed sensing, this is made computationally efficient by minimizing the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate for rank. In this work, we identify an improved regularizer based on the so-called diamond norm, a concept imported from quantum information theory. We show that - for a class of matrices saturating a certain norm inequality - the descent cone of the diamond norm is contained in that of the nuclear norm. This suggests superior reconstruction properties for these matrices and we explicitly characterize this set. We demonstrate numerically that the diamond norm indeed outperforms the nuclear norm in a number of relevant applications: These include signal analysis tasks such as blind matrix deconvolution or the retrieval of certain unitary basis changes, as well as the quantum information problem of process tomography with random measurements. The diamond norm is defined for matrices that can be interpreted as order-4 tensors and it turns out that the above condition depends crucially on that tensorial structure. In this sense, this work touches on an aspect of the notoriously difficult tensor completion problem.

abstract: Maxwell's Demon, 'a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course', has been the centre of much debate about its abilities to violate the second law of thermodynamics. Landauer's hypothesis, that the Demon must erase its memory and incur a thermodynamic cost, has become the standard response to Maxwell's dilemma, and its implications for the thermodynamics of computation reach into many areas of quantum and classical computing. It remains, however, still a hypothesis. Debate has often centred around simple toy models of a single particle in a box. Despite their simplicity, the ability of these systems to accurately represent thermodynamics (specifically to satisfy the second law) and whether or not they display Landauer Erasure, has been a matter of ongoing argument. The recent Norton-Ladyman controversy is one such example. In this paper we introduce a programming language to describe these simple thermodynamic processes, and give a formal operational semantics and program logic as a basis for formal reasoning about thermodynamic systems. We formalise the basic single-particle operations as statements in the language, and then show that the second law must be satisfied by any composition of these basic operations. This is done by finding a computational invariant of the system. We show, furthermore, that this invariant requires an erasure cost to exist within the system, equal to kTln2 for a bit of information: Landauer Erasure becomes a theorem of the formal system. The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be resolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a set of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are provably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

abstract: We propose a notion of quantum control in a quantum programming language which permits the superposition of finitely many quantum operations without performing a measurement. This notion takes the form of a conditional construct similar to the IF statement in classical programming languages. We show that adding such a quantum IF statement to the QPL programming language simplifies the presentation of several quantum algorithms. This motivates the possibility of extending the denotational semantics of QPL to include this form of quantum alternation. We give a denotational semantics for this extension of QPL based on Kraus decompositions rather than on superoperators. Finally, we clarify the relation between quantum alternation and recursion, and discuss the possibility of lifting the semantics defined by Kraus operators to the superoperator semantics defined by Selinger.

abstract: This paper uncovers the fundamental relationship between total and partial computation in the form of an equivalence of certain categories. This equivalence involves on the one hand effectuses, which are categories for total computation, introduced by Jacobs for the study of quantum/effect logic. On the other hand, it involves what we call FinPACs with effects; they are finitely partially additive categories equipped with effect algebra structures, serving as categories for partial computation. It turns out that the Kleisli category of the lift monad (-)+1 on an effectus is always a FinPAC with effects, and this construction gives rise to the equivalence. Additionally, state-and-effect triangles over FinPACs with effects are presented.

Towards this end, we will study algebraic valued set-theoretic structures whose truth values correspond to the clopen subobjects of the spectral presheaf of an orthomodular lattice of projections onto a given Hilbert space. In particular, we will attempt to recreate, in these new structures, Takeuti's original isomorphism between the set of all Dedekind real numbers in a suitably constructed model of set theory and the set of all self adjoint operators on a chosen Hilbert space.

abstract: In a spinor Bose-Einstein gas, the non-zero hyperfine spin of the gas becomes an accessible degree of freedom. At low temperature, such a gas shows both magnetic and superfluid order, and undergoes both density and spin dynamics. These lecture notes present a general overview of the properties of spinor Bose-Einstein gases. The notes are divided in five sections. In the first, we summarize basic properties of multi-component quantum fluids, focusing on the specific case of spinor Bose-Einstein gases and the role of rotational symmetry in defining their properties. Second, we consider the magnetic state of a spinor Bose-Einstein gas, highlighting effects of thermodynamics and Bose-Einstein statistics and also of spin-dependent interactions between atoms. In the third section, we discuss methods for measuring the properties of magnetically ordered quantum gases and present newly developed schemes for spin-dependent imaging. We then discuss the dynamics of spin mixing in which the spin composition of the gas evolves through the spin-dependent interactions within the gas. We discuss spin mixing first from a microscopic perspective, and then advance to discussing collective and beyond-mean-field dynamics. The fifth section reviews recent studies of the magnetic excitations of quantum-degenerate spinor Bose gases. We conclude with some perspectives on future directions for research.

abstract: Motivated by recent results in multiphoton interferometry, we expand a result of Kostant on immanants of an arbitrary $m\times m$ unitary matrix $T\in$ su$(m)$ to the submatrices of $T$. Specifically, we show that immanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum $\sum_{t} D^{(\lambda)}_{tt}(\Omega)$ of the diagonal $D$-functions of group element $\Omega$, with $t$ determined {by} the choice of submatrix, and the irrep $(\lambda)$ determined by the immanant under consideration. We also provide evidence that this result extends to some submatrices that are not principal diagonal, and we discuss how this result can be extended to cases where $T$ carries an su$(m)$ representation that is different from the defining representation.

abstract: We demonstrate hybridization of optical cavity photons with atomic Rydberg excitations using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The resulting dark state Rydberg polaritons exhibit a compressed frequency spectrum and enhanced lifetime indicating strong light-matter mixing. We study the coherence properties of cavity Rydberg polaritons and identify the generalized EIT linewidth for optical cavities. Strong collective coupling suppresses polariton losses due to inhomogeneous broadening, which we demonstrate by using different Rydberg levels with a range of polarizabilities. Our results point the way towards using cavity Rydberg polaritons as a platform for creating photonic quantum materials.

abstract: We investigate decoherence of quantum superpositions induced by gravitational time dilation and spontaneous emission between two atomic levels. It has been shown that gravitational time dilation can be an universal decoherence source. Here, we consider decoherence induced by gravitational time dilation only in the situation of spontaneous emission. Then, we obtain that the coherence of particle's position state depends on reference frame due to the time dilation changing the distinguishability of emission photon from two positions of particle. Changing the direction of light field can also result in the difference about the coherence of quantum superpositions. For observing the decoherence effect mainly due to gravitational time dilation, time-delayed feedback can be utilized to increase the decoherence of particle's superpositions.

We interpret this architecture as a classical error-correcting code, which is highly robust against weakly correlated bit-flip noise.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00025
abstract: We present a simplified version of a repeater protocol in a cold neutral-atom ensemble with Rydberg excitations optimized for two-node entanglement generation and describe a protocol for quantum teleportation. Our proposal draws from previous proposals [Zhao, et al., Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{81}$, 052329 (2010)] and [Han, et al. Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{81}$, 052311 (2010)] who described efficient and robust protocols for long-distance entanglement with many nodes. Using realistic experimental values we predict an entanglement generation rate of $\sim$30 Hz and teleportation rate of $\sim$8 Hz. Our predicted rates match the current state of the art experiments for entanglement generation and teleportation between quantum memories [Hucul, et al., Nature Phys. $\mathbf{11}$, p. 37-42 (2015)] and [Nolleke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{110}$, 140403 (2013)]. With improved efficiencies we predict entanglement generation and teleportation rates of $\sim$5 kHz and $\sim$2 kHz respectively, representing a two order of magnitude improvement over the currently realized values. Cold-atom ensembles with Rydberg excitations are promising candidates for repeater nodes because collective effects in the ensemble can be used to deterministically generate a long-lived ground state memory which may be efficiently mapped onto a directionally emitted single photon.

abstract: In this work, a quantum error correction (QEC) procedure with the concatenated five-qubit code is used to construct a near-perfect effective qubit channel (with a error below $10^{-5}$) from arbitrary noise channels. The exact performance of the QEC is characterized by a Choi matrix, which can be obtained via a simple and explicit protocol. In a noise model with five free parameters, our numerical results indicate that the concatenated five-qubit code is general: To construct a near-perfect effective channel from the noise channels, the necessary size of the concatenated five-qubit code depends only on the entanglement fidelity of the initial noise channels.

abstract: We present an efficient proposal for error-rejecting quantum computing with quantum dots (QD) embedded in single-sided optical microcavities based on the interface between the circularly-polarized photon and the QDs. A unity fidelity of the quantum entangling gate (EG) can be implemented with a detectable error that leads to a recycling EG procedure, which improves further the efficiency of our proposal for EG along with robustness to the errors involved in the imperfect input-output process. Meanwhile, we discuss the performance of our proposal for EG on two solid state spins with currently achieved experiment parameters, showing that it is feasible with current experimental technology. It provides a promising building block for solid-state quantum computing and quantum networks.

abstract: We present two one-step schemes to generate the Bell state and construct the controlled-phase gate deterministically on remote transmon qutrits trapped in different resonators connected by a superconducting transmission line for a quantum network. They are implemented with coherent evolutions of the entire system in the all-resonance regime assisted by the dark microwave photons which are robust against the transmission line loss. Different from previous works in other quantum systems for a quantum network, the present proposals do not require classical pulses and ancillary qubits. Our simulations with feasible parameters show that the fidelities of both these schemes exceed 99% which is beyond the fault-tolerant threshold for quantum communication.

abstract: Hyperentanglement, the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, has attracted much attention as it can be used to increase the channel capacity of quantum communication and its security largely. Here, we present the first scheme to completely distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states of two-photon systems in three DOFs with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity without destruction, including two longitudinal momentum DOFs and the polarization DOF. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition detectors which can be used to make a parity-check measurement and analyze Bell states of two-photon systems in different DOFs. Our complete scheme for two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell-state analysis may be useful for the practical applications in quantum information, especially in long-distance high-capacity quantum communication. We show its applications in hyperentanglement swapping and hyperdense coding with two-photon systems entangled in three DOFs simultaneously.

abstract: Quantum repeater is one of the important building blocks for long distance quantum communication network. The previous quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles and linear optical elements can only be performed with a maximal success probability of 1/2 during the entanglement creation and entanglement swapping procedures. Meanwhile, the polarization noise during the entanglement distribution process is harmful to the entangled channel created. Here we introduce a general interface between a polarized photon and an atomic ensemble trapped in a single-sided optical cavity, and with which we propose a high-efficiency quantum repeater protocol in which the robust entanglement distribution is accomplished by the stable spatial-temporal entanglement and it can in principle create the deterministic entanglement between neighboring atomic ensembles in a heralded way as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Meanwhile, the simplified parity check gate makes the entanglement swapping be completed with unity efficiency, other than 1/2 with linear optics. We detail the performance of our protocol with current experimental parameters and show its robustness to the imperfections, i.e., detuning and coupling variation, involved in the reflection process. These good features make it a useful building block in long distance quantum communication.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00142
abstract: This work derives a generalized quantum Fokker-Planck equation (GQFPE) for photo-induced nonequilibrium quantum dynamical processes by extending the path integral method pioneered by Caldeira and Leggett (CL) [Caldeira and Leggett, Physica A {\bf 121}, 587 (1983)]. The present work accounts for non-Markovian effects by expanding the Feynman-Vernon influence functional up to the second order of time consistently. The nonequilibrium effects due to the difference of the ground and the excited electronic state baths are also included naturally within this approach. This results in single time integration forms for the influence functional but with new time dependent boundary terms, which are ignored in the original derivation of CL and complicate the derivation of a time evolution equation. These however do not affect position dependent physical observables. For an effective density operator with the boundary terms factored out, a time evolution equation is derived through short time expansion of the effective action followed by Gaussian integrations in analytically continued complex domain. This leads to a compact form of equation with time dependent kernels and additional terms that were absent in the original CL's derivation. Analysis of major terms in the new GQFPE is provided for the case of Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff, and it is shown that positive definiteness condition is satisfied in medium to high temperature limit.

abstract: We examine the role of interactions for a Bose gas trapped in a double-well potential ("Bose-Josephson junction") when external noise is applied and the system is initially delocalized with equal probability amplitudes in both sites. The noise may have two kinds of effects: loss of atoms from the trap, and random shifts in the relative phase or number difference between the two wells. The effects of phase noise are mitigated by atom-atom interactions and tunneling, such that the dephasing rate may be reduced to half its single-atom value. Decoherence due to number noise (which induces fluctuations in the relative atom number between the wells) is considerably enhanced by the interactions. A similar scenario is predicted for the case of atom loss, even if the loss rates from the two sites are equal. In fact, interactions convert the increased uncertainty in atom number (difference) into (relative) phase diffusion and reduce the coherence across the junction. We examine the parameters relevant for these effects using a simple model of the trapping potential based on an atom chip device. These results provide a framework for mapping the dynamical range of barriers engineered for specific applications and sets the stage for more complex circuits ("atomtronics").

abstract: A quantum open system formed by an atom with two levels inside a cavity in a low temperature reservoir ($ T \rightarrow 0 $) is studied. The system is described by the three levels of combined atom plus cavity that loses coherence, depending on the quality of the cavity. We analyze the properties of the system, solving the evolution of a Hilbert space of three dimensions from the Lindblad equation including a decoherence term. This calculation was confirmed by mapping the Kraus operators obtained from the development of a structure of time-dependent functions from the system evolution. Because the analytical solution of the Lindblad equation is a solution of a matrix differential equation, we have compared it with a sequence of discrete time steps using the first order approximation to a Kraus operators with the aim of finding a physical interpretation of the evolution in discrete time and its relation to the search for decoherence-free spaces in quantum information.

abstract: We experimentally test quantum contextuality of a single qutrit using NMR. The contextuality inequalities based on nine observables developed by Kurzynski et. al. are first reformulated in terms of traceless observables which can be measured in an NMR experiment. These inequalities reveal the contextuality of almost all single-qutrit states. We demonstrate the violation of the inequality on four different initial states of a spin-1 deuterium nucleus oriented in a liquid crystal matrix, and follow the violation as the states evolve in time. We also describe and experimentally perform a single-shot test of contextuality for a subclass of qutrit states whose density matrix is diagonal in the energy basis.

abstract: The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information (EUR-QSI) from [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating two distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two incompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the "uncertainty witness" lower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An insightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative entropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish a tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower bound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement. As such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement causes. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum mechanics with the others mentioned above.

abstract: An ordering between the quantum states emerging from a single mode gauge-covariant bosonic Gaussian channel is proven. Specifically, we show that within the set of input density matrices with the same given spectrum, the element passive with respect to the Fock basis (i.e. diagonal with decreasing eigenvalues) produces an output which majorizes all the other outputs emerging from the same set. When applied to pure input states, our finding includes as a special case the result of A. Mari, et al., Nat. Comm. 5, 3826 (2014) which implies that the output associated to the vacuum majorizes the others.

abstract: The Rabi model plays a fundamental role in understanding light-matter interaction. It reduces to the Jaynes-Cummings model via the rotating-wave approximation, which is applicable only to the cases of near resonance and weak coupling. However, recent experimental breakthroughs in upgrading light-matter coupling order require understanding the physics of the full quantum Rabi model (QRM). Despite the fact that its integrability and energy spectra have been exactly obtained, the challenge to formulate an exact wavefunction in a general case still hinders physical exploration of the QRM. Here we unveil a ground-state phase diagram of the QRM, consisting of a quadpolaron and a bipolaron as well as their changeover in the weak-, strong- and intermediate-coupling regimes, respectively. An unexpected overweighted antipolaron is revealed in the quadpolaron state, and a hidden scaling behavior relevant to symmetry breaking is found in the bipolaron state. An experimentally accessible parameter is proposed to test these states, which might provide novel insights into the nature of the light-matter interaction for all regimes of the coupling strengths.

Here we propose a scheme for a quantum memory capable of storing and retrieving ultrafast photons in an ensemble of two-level atoms by using a propagation medium with a time-dependent refractive index generated from aligning an ensemble of gas-phase diatomic molecules. The refractive index dynamics generates an effective longitudinal inhomogeneous broadening of the two-level transition frequency. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for storage and retrieval of a weak pulse as short as 10 fs, with a storage time of 150 fs. With additional optical control of the molecular alignment dynamics, the storage time can be extended to nanosecond timescales leading to time-bandwidth products of order $10^5$. This scheme could in principle be achieved using either a hollow-core fiber or a high-pressure gas cell, in a gaseous host medium comprised of diatomic molecules and a two-level atomic vapour at room temperature.

abstract: The gauge invariance of the evolution equations of tomographic probability distribution functions of quantum particles in an electromagnetic field is illustrated. Explicit expressions for the transformations of ordinary tomograms of states under a gauge transformation of electromagnetic field potentials are obtained. Gauge-independent optical and symplectic tomographic quasi-distributions and tomographic probability distributions of states of quantum system are introduced, and their evolution equations having the Liouville equation in corresponding representations as the classical limit are found.

abstract: We study the quantum separability problem by using general symmetric informationally complete measurements and derive separability criteria for arbitrary high dimensional bipartite systems of a $d_1$-dimensional subsystem and a $d_2$-dimensional subsystem and multipartite systems of multipartite-level subsystems. These criteria are of more effective and wider application range than previous criteria. They provide experimental implementation in detecting entanglement of unknown quantum states.

abstract: By combining a parameterized Hermitian matrix, the realignment matrix of the bipartite density matrix $\rho$ and the vectorization of its reduced density matrices, we present a family of separability criteria, which are stronger than the computable cross norm or realignment (CCNR) criterion. With linear contraction methods, the proposed criteria can be used to detect the multipartite entangled states that are biseparable under any bipartite partitions. Moreover, we show by examples that the presented multipartite separability criteria can be more efficient than the corresponding multipartite realignment criterion based on CCNR, multipartite correlation tensor criterion and multipartite covariance matrix criterion.

abstract: A dressed-state perturbation theory beyond the rotating waveapproxi-mation (RWA) is presented to investigate the interaction between a two level electronic transition of the polar molecules and a quantized cavity field. Analytical expressions can be explicitly derived for both the ground- and excited-state-energy spectrums and wave functions of the system, where the contribution of permanent dipole moments (PDM) and the counter-rotating wave term (CRT) can be shown separately. The validity of these explicit results is discussed by comparing with the direct numerical simulation. Comparing to CRT coupling, PDM results in the coupling of more dressed states and the energy shift proportional to the square of the normalized permanent dipole difference, and a greater Bloch-Siegert shift could be produced in giant dipole molecule cavity QED. In addition, our method could also be extended to the solution of two-level atom Rabi model Hamiltonian beyond the RWA.

abstract: Quantum repeater holds the promise for scalable long-distance quantum communication. Towards a first quantum repeater based on memory-photon entanglement, significant progresses have made in improving performances of the building blocks. Further development is hindered by the difficulty of integrating key capabilities such as long storage time and high memory efficiency into a single system. Here we report an efficient light-matter interface with sub-second lifetime by confining laser-cooled atoms with 3D optical lattice and enhancing the atom-photon coupling with a ring cavity. An initial retrieval efficiency of 76(5)% together with an 1/e lifetime of 0.22(1) s have been achieved simultaneously, which already support sub-Hz entanglement distribution up to 1000 km through quantum repeater. Together with an efficient telecom interface and moderate multiplexing, our result may enable a first quantum repeater system that beats direct transmission in the near future.

abstract: A four-dimensional photon polarization space, such that gives a different interpretation of the ladder operators for the time-like degree comparing with the Gupta-Bleuler formulation is presented. This interpretation, coming from a construction of a covariant Hamiltonian, gives positive defined norms for all the four polarization degrees of freedom. This paper is written in the background of reducible representations of quantum field theory introduced by Czachor, although such interpretation of the ladder operators as presented here could be done independently also in standard irreducible representation theory. Further states that reproduce standard electromagnetic fields (i.e. photons with two polarization degrees of freedom) from the four-dimensional covariant formalism (i.e. with two additional transversal and time-like polarization degrees of freedom) are shown explicitly and discussed.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is a counterintuitive phenomenon that is beyond the purview of causal influences. Recently, Bell inequalities have been generalized to the case of quantum inputs, leading to a powerful family of semi-quantum Bell inequalities that are capable of detecting a large class of entangled states. Here, we focus on a different problem and investigate how the local-indistinguishability of quantum inputs and postselection affect the requirements to detect semi-quantum nonlocality. To this end, we derive the postselected local bound and the postselected maximum quantum bound for a semi-quantum Bell inequality based on locally-indistinguishable quantum inputs. Interestingly, we find that the postselected local bound is independent of the measurement efficiency, and the achievable postselected Bell violation increases with decreasing measurement efficiency.

This enables one to create entanglement using just LOCC. Furthermore, we point out how the existence of CTCs would imply entanglement can be polygamous, and thus contradicting the prior known notions of monogamy of entanglement.

abstract: We prove that Rayleigh's criterion is fundamentally irrelevant to the localization of two incoherent point sources in far-field optical imaging. This is done in two ways: (1) We derive the quantum Cram\'er-Rao error bound for the problem under standard assumptions for thermal optical sources, and the bound shows little sign of the accuracy degradation that plagues conventional imaging when Rayleigh's criterion is violated. (2) We propose a linear optical measurement method called spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) that can attain the quantum bound for separation estimation regardless of the distance between the sources, a task conventional methods perform poorly for close sources. These results demonstrate that Rayleigh's criterion is nothing but a technicality specific to conventional imaging, and cleverer quantum measurements can locate two incoherent sources with arbitrary separation almost as accurately as conventional methods do for isolated sources.

abstract: We report the continuous and partially nondestructive measurement of optical photons. For a weak light pulse traveling through a slow-light optical medium (signal), the associated atomic-excitation component is detected by another light beam (probe) with the aid of an optical cavity. We observe strong correlations of $g^{(2)}_{sp}=4.4(5)$ between the transmitted signal and probe photons. The observed (intrinsic) conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency ranges between 13% and 1% (65% and 5%) for a signal transmission range of 2% to 35%, at a typical time resolution of 2.5 $\mu$s. The maximal observed (intrinsic) device nondestructive quantum efficiency, defined as the product of the conditional nondestructive quantum efficiency and the signal transmission, is 0.5% (2.4%). The normalized cross-correlation function violates the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, confirming the non-classical character of the correlations.

abstract: Entanglement, one of the central mysteries of quantum mechanics, plays an essential role in numerous applications of quantum information theory. A natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for any non-adaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine in detail a previously implemented experiment, which claimed to detect entanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without full state tomography. By performing the experiment and analyzing the data, we demonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct the state. These results reveal a fundamental limit for single-copy measurements in entanglement detection, and provides a general framework to study the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as the positivity of partial transpose and the $k$-symmetric extendibility.

abstract: The relativistic theory of the Dirac fermions moving on cylinders in external Aharonov-Bohm field is built starting with a suitably restricted Dirac equation whose spin degrees of freedom are not affected. The exact solutions of this equation on finite or infinite Aharonov-Bohm cylinders allow one to derive the relativistic circular and longitudinal currents pointing out their principal features. It is shown that all the circular currents are related to the energy in the same manner on cylinders or rings either in the relativistic approach or in the non-relativistic one. The specific relativistic effect is the saturation of the circular currents for high values of the total angular momentum. Based on this property some approximative closed formulas are deduced for the total persistent current at $T=0$ on finite Aharonov-Bohm cylinders. Moreover, it is shown that all the persistent currents on finite cylinders or rings have similar non-relativistic limits.

abstract: Quantum noise with exchange and tunneling is studied within time-dependent wave packets. A novel expression for the quantum noise of two identical particles injected simultaneously from opposite sides of a tunneling barrier is presented. Such quantum noise expression provides a physical (non-spurious) explanation for the experimental detection of two electrons at the same side under static potentials. Numerical simulations of the two-particle scattering probabilities in a double barrier potential with an oscillatory well are performed. The dependence of the quantum noise on the electron energy and oscillatory frequency are analyzed. The peculiar behaviour of the dependence of the quantum noise on such parameters is proposed as a test about the soundness of this novel quantum noise expression, for either static or oscillatory potentials.

abstract: We investigate the intermediate permutational symmetries of a system of qubits, which lie in between the perfect symmetric and antisymmetric cases. We prove that in average pure states of qubits picked at random with respect to the uniform measure on the unit sphere of the Hilbert space are almost as antisymmetric as they are allowed to be. We then observe that multipartite entanglement, measured by the generalized Meyer- Wallach measure, tends to be larger in subspaces that are more antisymmetric than the complete symmetric one. Eventually, we prove that all states contained in the most antisymmetric subspace are relevant multipartite entangled states in the sense that their 1-qubit reduced states are all maximally mixed.

abstract: From an information processing point of view, two of the key properties of quantum physics are the no-signaling principle and the Grover search lower bound. That is, despite admitting stronger-than-classical correlations, quantum mechanics does not imply superluminal signaling, and despite a form of exponential parallelism, quantum mechanics does not imply polynomial-time brute force solution of NP-complete problems. Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are connected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for which we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information paradox: nonunitary dynamics, non-Born-rule measurement, cloning, and postselection. We find that each model admits superluminal signaling if and only if it admits a query complexity speedup over Grover's algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the physical resources required to send a superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up Grover's algorithm. Hence, one can perform a physically reasonable experiment demonstrating superluminal signaling if and only if one can perform a reasonable experiment inducing a speedup over Grover's algorithm.

abstract: Bath engineering, which utilizes coupling to lossy modes in a quantum system to generate non-trivial steady states, is a tantalizing alternative to gate- and measurement-based quantum science. Here, we demonstrate dissipative stabilization of entanglement between two superconducting transmon qubits in a symmetry-selective manner. We utilize the engineered symmetries of the dissipative environment to stabilize a target Bell state; we further demonstrate suppression of the Bell state of opposite symmetry due to parity selection rules. This implementation is resource-efficient, achieves a steady-state fidelity $\mathcal{F} = 0.70$, and is scalable to multiple qubits.

abstract: Achieving effectively adiabatic dynamics in finite time is a ubiquitous goal in virtually all areas of modern physics. So-called shortcuts to adiabaticity refer to a set of methods and techniques that allow to produce in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. In the present work we generalize one of these methods -- the fast-forward technique -- to driven Dirac dynamics. As a main result we find that shortcuts to adiababticity for the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac equation are facilitated by a combination of both, scalar and pseudoscalar potentials. Our findings are illustrated for two analytically solvable examples, namely charged particles driven in spatially homogeneous and linear vector fields.

abstract: Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum computation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary transformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum circuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources can `derandomize' circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles quantum mechanically, (analogously to a quantum random number generator). Furthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose statistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution over all unitaries up to order $t$, while foregoing adaptive feed-forward entirely. Such ensembles -- known as $t$-designs -- often cannot be distinguished from the `truly' random ensemble, and so they find use in many applications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness.

abstract: Fibonacci anyons are non-Abelian particles for which braiding is universal for quantum computation. Reichardt has shown how to systematically generate nontrivial braids for three Fibonacci anyons which yield unitary operations with off-diagonal matrix elements that can be made arbitrarily small in a particular natural basis through a simple and efficient iterative procedure. This procedure does not require brute force search, the Solovay-Kitaev method, or any other numerical technique, but the phases of the resulting diagonal matrix elements cannot be directly controlled. We show that despite this lack of control the resulting braids can be used to systematically construct entangling gates for two qubits encoded by Fibonacci anyons.

abstract: Rigorously establishing that the error in an experimental quantum operation is beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently requires considering the worst-case error, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the average gate infidelities routinely reported in experiments. We show that an improved bound on the worst-case error can be obtained by also considering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of $\approx 2.45$ for unital qubit channels. We prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most on the order of the average gate infidelity and so is negligible relative to any coherent contribution. We also show that the ``average'' error rate when measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the system exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent noise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for the diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known).

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.00729
abstract: A local and deterministic model of quantum correlations is always possible, as shown explicitly by Brans in 1988: one simply needs the physical systems being measured to have a suitable statistical correlation with the physical systems performing the measurement, via some common cause. Hence, to derive no-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement independence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption -- less than 1/15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state of two qubits -- with ramifications for the security of quantum communication protocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations whatsoever -- even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling -- have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that 'quantum nonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not equate to 'experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that no more than 2 log d bits of prior correlation are required for a local deterministic model of the correlations between any two d-dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: The goal of adiabatic ground-state preparation is to start a simple quantum system in its ground state and adiabatically evolve the Hamiltonian to a complex one, maintaining the ground state throughout the evolution. In ion-trap-based quantum simulations, coherence times are too short to allow for adiabatic evolution for large chains, so the system evolves diabatically, creating excitations to higher energy states. Because the probability for diabatic excitation depends exponentially on the excitation energy and because the thermal distribution also depends exponentially on the excitation energy, we investigate whether the diabatic excitation can create a thermal distribution; as this could serve as an alternative for creating thermal states of complex quantum systems without requiring contact with a heat bath. In this work, we explore this relationship and determine situations where diabatic excitation can approximately create such a thermal state.

abstract: Realizing systems that support robust, controlled interactions between individual photons is an exciting frontier of nonlinear optics. To this end, one approach that has emerged recently is to leverage atomic interactions to create strong and spatially non-local interactions between photons. In particular, effective interactions have been successfully created via interactions between atoms excited to Rydberg levels. Here, we investigate an alternative approach, in which atomic interactions arise via their common coupling to photonic crystal waveguides. This technique takes advantage of the ability to separately tailor the strength and range of interactions via the dispersion engineering of the structure itself, which can lead to qualitatively new types of phenomena. As an example, we discuss the formation of correlated transparency windows, in which photonic states of a certain number and shape selectively propagate through the system. Through this technique, we show in particular that one can create molecular-like potentials that lead to molecular bound states of photon pairs.

By tuning a few controllable external parameters the impurity-lattice interaction can be engineered and information regarding the dispersion relation of the superfluid phonons can be reliably extracted. We describe the general theory and provide an example to show its validity.

abstract: We investigate two-photon quantum interference in an opaque scattering medium that intrinsically supports $10^6$ transmission channels. By adaptive spatial phase-modulation of the incident wavefronts, the photons are directed at targeted speckle spots or output channels. From $10^3$ experimentally available coupled channels, we select two channels and enhance their transmission, to realize the equivalent of a fully programmable $2\times2$ beam splitter. By sending pairs of single photons from a parametric down-conversion source through the opaque scattering medium, we observe two-photon quantum interference. The programmed beam splitter need not fulfill energy conservation over the two selected output channels and hence could be non-unitary. Consequently, we have the freedom to tune the quantum interference from bunching (Hong-Ou-Mandel-like) to antibunching. Our results establish opaque scattering media as a platform for high-dimensional quantum interference that is notably relevant for boson sampling and physical-key-based authentication.

abstract: Generating entangled photons from a monolithic chip is a major milestone towards real-life applications of optical quantum information processing including quantum key distribution and quantum computing. Ultrabroadband entangled photons are of particular interest to various applications such as quantum metrology and multi-party entanglement distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the direct generation of broadband wavelength multiplexed polarization entangled photons from a semiconductor chip for the first time. Without the use of any on-chip compensation, interferometry, entangled photons with a signal-idler separation as large as 95 nm in the telecom band were observed. The highest concurrence of 0.98$\pm$0.01 achieved in this work is also the highest, to the best of our knowledge, comparing to all previously demonstrated semiconductor waveguide sources. This work paves the way for fully integrated, ultrabroadband sources of polarization entangled photons.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation has received increasing attention due to its robustness against control errors. However, all the previous schemes have to use at least two sequentially implemented gates to realize a general one-qubit gate. In this paper, we put forward a novelty scheme by which one can directly realize an arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gate with a single-shot implementation, avoiding the extra work of combining two gates into one. Based on a three-level model driven by laser pulses, we show that any single-qubit holonomic gate can be realized by varying the detuning, amplitude, and phase of lasers. Our scheme is compatible with previously proposed non-adiabatic holonomic two-qubit gates, combining with which the arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gates can play universal non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We also investigate the effects of some unavoidable realistic errors on our scheme.

abstract: Superradiance, i.e., spontaneous emission of coherent radiation by an ensemble of identical two-level atoms in collective states introduced by Dicke in 1954, is one of the enigmatic problems of quantum optics. The startling gist is that even though the atoms have no dipole moment they radiate with increased intensity in particular directions. Following the advances in our understanding of superradiant emission by atoms in entangled $W$ states we examine the quantum statistical properties of superradiance. Such investigations require the system to have at least two excitations as one needs to explore the photon-photon correlations of the radiation emitted by such states. We present specifically results for the spatially resolved photon-photon correlations of systems prepared in doubly excited $W$ states and give conditions when the atomic system emits nonclassial light. Equally, we derive the conditions for the occurrence of bunching and even of superbunching, a rare phenomenon otherwise known only from nonclassical states of light like the squeezed vacuum. We finally investigate the photon-photon cross correlations of the spontaneously scattered light and highlight the nonclassicalty of such correlations.

abstract: The existence of incompatible measurement setups is one of the distinctive features of quantum theory. Here we extend the notion of incompatibility from measurements that test preparations to measurements that test dynamical processes. Such measurements, known as testers, consist of the preparation of an input state, the application of the tested process, and a measurement on the output. Mathematically, testers are described by a suitable generalization of the notion of positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Unlike in the case of POVMs, however, testers that commute are not necessarily compatible, and testers that are compatible do not necessarily commute. Given a set of testers, we define the robustness of incompatibility as the minimum amount of mixing needed to make the testers compatible. We show that (i) the robustness is lower bounded by the distinguishability of the input states prepared by the different testers, and (ii) maximum robustness is attained when the input states are orthogonal. An extensive analysis of incompatibility is provided for factorized qubit testers with two outcomes. All our results can be extended to measurements that test quantum processes consisting of multiple time steps.

abstract: Interactions between many-body atomic systems and light in cavities induce new atomic dynamics, which we show can be tailored by projective light measurement backaction, leading to collective effects such as density-density interactions, perfectly-correlated atomic tunneling, superexchange, and effective pair creation and annihilation. These can be long- and short-range, with tunable strengths, based on the optical setup. We show this provides a framework to enhance quantum simulations of novel physical phenomena, including reservoir models and dynamical gauge fields, beyond current methods.

abstract: We analyze different decoherence processes in a system coupled to a bath. Apart from the well known standard dephasing mechanism which is temperature dependent an alternative mechanism is presented, the spin-swap dephasing which does not need initial bath activation and is temperature independent. We show that for dipolar interaction the separation of time scales between system and bath can not produce pure dephasing, the process being accompained by dissipation. Activated and non activated dephasing processes are demonstrated in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center.

abstract: We identify and study a new security loophole in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) implementations, related to the imperfect linearity of the homodyne detector. By exploiting this loophole, we propose an active side-channel attack on the Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol combining an intercept-resend attack with an induced saturation of the homodyne detection on the receiver side (Bob). We show that an attacker can bias the excess noise estimation by displacing the quadratures of the coherent states received by Bob. We propose a saturation model that matches experimental measurements on the homodyne detection and use this model to study the impact of the saturation attack on parameter estimation in CV-QKD.We demonstrate that this attack can bias the excess noise estimation beyond the null key threshold for any system parameter, thus leading to a full security break. If we consider an additional criteria imposing that the channel transmission estimation should not be affected by the attack, then the saturation attack can only be launched if the attenuation on the quantum channel is sufficient, corresponding to attenuations larger than approximately 6 dB. We moreover discuss the possible counter-measures against the saturation attack and propose a new counter- measure based on Gaussian post-selection that can be implemented by classical post-processing and may allow to distill secret key when the raw measurement data is partly saturated.

abstract: The gravitational field of a laser pulse of finite lifetime, is investigated in the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small, they may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the gravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the norm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise for circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent of the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are confined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these shells are associated with the emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby test particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled from the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption. Examples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that massless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are co-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test particles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger than for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational effect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed out. The spacetime curvature close to the pulse is compared to that induced by gravitational waves from astronomical sources.

abstract: Recently an alternative way to quantify Bell nonlocality has been proposed [Phys. Rev. A 92, 030101(R) (2015)]. In this work we analytically calculate this new quantity, the volume of violation, for the spin-singlet state with respect to the settings of the first Bell's inequality. The full characterization of these settings corresponds to three directions in space, or three arbitrary points on the unit sphere. It is shown that the triples of directions that lead to violations in local causality correspond to $1/3$ of all possible orientation triples.

abstract: In our quantum mechanics courses, measurement is usually taught in passing, as an ad-hoc procedure involving the ugly collapse of the wave function. No wonder we search for more satisfying alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation. But this overlooks the fact that the approach fits very well with modern measurement theory with its notions of the conditioned state and quantum trajectory. In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen interpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers like Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these earlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more satisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the collapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device. Along the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that spread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states are the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories. We then describe how the conditioned state of a quantum system depends crucially on how the system is monitored illustrating this with the example of a decaying atom monitored with a time of arrival photon detector, leading to Bohr's quantum jumps. On the other hand, other kinds of detection lead to much smoother behaviour, providing yet another example of complementarity. Finally we explain how classical behaviour emerges, including classical mechanics but also thermodynamics.

abstract: Cavity-optomechanics, an exploitation of mechanical-effects of light to couple optical-field with mechanical-objects, has made remarkable progress. Besides, spin-orbit (SO)-coupling, interaction between spin of a quantum-particle and its momentum, has provided foundation to analyze various phenomena like spin-Hall effect and topological-insulators. However, SO-coupling and corresponding topological-features have not been examined in optical-cavity with one vibrational-mirror. Here we report cavity-optomechanics with SO-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, inducing non-Abelian gauge-field in cavity. We ascertain the influences of SO-coupling and long-range atomic-interactions on low-temperature dynamics which can be experimentally measured by maneuvering area underneath density-noise spectrum. It is detected that not only optomechanical-coupling is modifying topological properties of atomic dressed-states but SO-coupling induced topological-effects are also enabling us to control effective-temperature of mechanical-mirror and dynamic structure factor, which is measurable by detecting neutron-scattering. Our findings are testable in a realistic setup and provide foundations to manipulate SO-coupling in the field of quantum optics and quantum computation.

abstract: We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary rules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely operational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S; no ontic assumptions are necessary. From the rules we derive the state spaces for N qubits and show that (a) they coincide with the set of density matrices over N qubit Hilbert spaces; (b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) the binary questions by means of which O interrogates the systems corresponds to projective measurements on Pauli operators with outcome probabilities given by the Born rule. Besides offering a novel conceptual perspective on qubit quantum theory, the reconstruction also unravels new structural insights. Namely, we show that, in a quadratic information measure, (d) qubits satisfy informational complementarity inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually complementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually complementary questions for 2 qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of information in pure states. The latter relations constitute 6 conserved informational charges which define the unitary group and, together with their 15 conservation conditions, the set of pure states. This underscores the benefits of this informational approach and emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to an observer's information in order to reconstruct the theory. This article completes the work started in arXiv:1412.8323.

abstract: Within the hierarchy of inseparable quantum correlations, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is distinguished from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality by its asymmetry -- there exist conditions where the steering phenomenon changes from being observable to not observable, simply by exchanging the role of the two measuring parties. Whilst this one-way steering feature has been previously demonstrated for the restricted class of Gaussian measurements, for the general case of positive-operator-valued measures even its theoretical existence has only recently been settled. Here, we prove, and then experimentally observe, the one-way steerability of an experimentally practical class of entangled states in this general setting. As well as its foundational significance, the demonstration of fundamentally asymmetric nonlocality also has practical implications for the distribution of the trust in quantum communication networks.

abstract: A maximal steady-state fermionic entanglement of a nanoelectronic system is generated in finite temperature non-Markovian environments. The fermionic entanglement dynamics is presented by connecting the exact solution of the system with an appropriate definition of fermionic entanglement. We prove that the two understandings of the dissipationless non-Markovian dynamics, namely the bound state and the modified Laplace transformation are completely equivalent. For comparison, the steady-state entanglement is also studied in the wide-band limit and Born-Markovian approximation. When the environments have a finite band structure, we find that the system presents various kinds of relaxation processes. The final states can be: thermal or thermal-like states, quantum memory states and oscillating quantum memory states. Our study provide an analytical way to explore the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of identical fermions in a realistic setting, i.e., finite temperature reservoirs with a cutoff spectrum.

abstract: We investigate dynamics of an optomechanical system under the Non-Markovian environment. In the weak optomechanical single-photon coupling regime, we provide an analytical approach fully taking into account the non-Markovian memory effects. When the cavity-bath coupling strength crosses a certain threshold, an oscillating memory state for the classical cavity field (called bound state) is formed. Due to the existence of the non-decay optical bound state, a nonequilibrium optomechanical thermal entanglement is preserved even without external driving laser. Our results provide a potential usage to generate and protect entanglement via Non-Markovian environment engineering.

abstract: Coherent evolution governs the behaviour of all quantum systems, but in nature it is often subjected to influence of a classical environment. For analysing quantum transport phenomena quantum walks emerge as suitable model systems. In particular, quantum walks on percolation structures constitute an attractive platform for studying open system dynamics of random media. Here, we present an implementation of quantum walks differing from the previous experiments by achieving dynamical control of the underlying graph structure. We demonstrate the evolution of an optical time-multiplexed quantum walk over six double steps, revealing the intricate interplay between the internal and external degrees of freedom. The observation of clear non-Markovian signatures in the coin space testifies the high coherence of the implementation and the extraordinary degree of control of all system parameters. Our work is the proof-of-principle experiment of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph, paving the way towards complex simulation of quantum transport in random media.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the coupling of an ultracold three-level atomic gas and a nano-mechanical mirror via classical electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pressure on the mirror is modulated by absorption of a probe light field, caused by the atoms which are electromagnetically rendered nearly transparent, allowing the gas to affect the mirror. In turn, the mirror can affect the gas as its vibrations generate opto-mechanical sidebands in the control field. We show that the sidebands cause modulations of the probe intensity at the mirror frequency, which can be enhanced near atomic resonances. Through the radiation pressure from the probe beam onto the mirror, this results in resonant driving of the mirror. Controllable by the two photon detuning, the phase relation of the driving to the mirror motion decides upon amplification or damping of mirror vibrations. This permits direct phase locking of laser amplitude modulations to the motion of a nano-mechanical element opening a perspective for cavity-free cooling through coupling to an atomic gas.

abstract: A central tenet of theoretical cryptography is the study of the minimal assumptions required to implement a given cryptographic primitive. One such primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here, we show how to use quantum information, together with the assumption of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure OTMs. This is in sharp contrast with the classical case, where stateless hardware tokens alone cannot yield OTMs. In addition, our scheme is technologically simple. We prove security in the quantum universal composability framework, employing semi-definite programming results of Molina, Vidick and Watrous [TQC 2013] and combinatorial techniques of Pastawski et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2012].

abstract: We study the behavior of the non-adiabatic population transfer between resonances at an exceptional point in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. It is known that, when the exceptional point is encircled, the system always ends up in the same state, independent of the initial occupation within the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the states coalescing at the exceptional point. We verify this behavior for a realistic quantum system, viz. the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields. It is also shown that the non-adiabatic hypothesis can be violated when resonances in the vicinity are taken into account. In addition, we study the non-adiabatic population transfer in the case of a third-order exceptional point, in which three resonances are involved.

abstract: Processing and distributing quantum information using photons through fibre-optic or free-space links is essential for building future quantum networks. The scalability needed for such networks can be achieved by employing photonic quantum states that are multiplexed into time and/or frequency, and light-matter interfaces that are able to store and process such states with large time-bandwidth product and multimode capacities. Despite important progress in developing such devices, the demonstration of these capabilities using non-classical light remains challenging. Employing the atomic frequency comb quantum memory protocol in a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped optical fibre, we report the quantum storage of heralded single photons at a telecom-wavelength (1.53 {\mu}m) with a time-bandwidth product approaching 800. Furthermore we demonstrate frequency-multimode storage as well as memory-based spectral-temporal photon manipulation. Notably, our demonstrations rely on fully integrated quantum technologies operating at telecommunication wavelengths, i.e. a fibre-pigtailed nonlinear waveguide for the generation of heralded single photons, an erbium-doped fibre for photon storage and manipulation, and fibre interfaced superconducting nanowire devices for efficient single photon detection. With improved storage efficiency, our light-matter interface may become a useful tool in future quantum networks.

abstract: Transfer matrix is an indispensable tool in the study of scattering phenomena in (effectively) one-dimensional systems. We introduce a genuine multidimensional notion of transfer matrix and use it to develop a powerful alternative to the standard S-matrix formulation of scattering theory. Because this transfer matrix shares the composition property of its one-dimensional analog, our formulation allows for the determination of the scattering properties of any scattering potential $v$ from that of any collection of its truncations $v_j$ along the scattering axis as long as $v=\sum_jv_j$. This is the main advantage of our approach particularly with regard to the numerical solution of multidimensional scattering problems. We demonstrate its application in solving the scattering problem for delta-function potentials in two and three-dimensions and provide an analytic treatment of the scattering of electromagnetic waves from an infinite slab of optically active material with a surface line defect. In particular, we determine the laser threshold condition for the latter system and show that the presence of the defect makes the slab begin lasing for arbitrarily small gain coefficients.

abstract: A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.

abstract: We study the dynamical entanglement of two identical atoms interacting with a quantum field. As a simplified model for this physical system we consider two harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to a massless scalar field in the dressed coordinates and states approach and enclose the whole system inside a spherical cavity of radius R. Through a quantity called concurrence, the entanglement evolution for the two-atom system will be discussed, for a range of initial states composed of a superposition of atomic states. Our results reveals how the concurrence of the two atoms behaves through the time evolution, for arbitrary cavity size and for arbitrary coupling constant, weak, intermediate or strong. All our computations are exact and only the final step is numerical. These numerical solutions give us fascinating results for the concurrence, such as quasi-random fluctuations, with a resemblance of periodicity. Another interesting result we found is when the system is initially maximally entangled (disentangled), after the time t = 2R, the system becomes again strongly entangled (disentangled) particularly during the first oscillations, later this phenomenon could be wrecked depending on the initial condition. We also show the concurrence after a too long time elapsed with a good precision.

abstract: We study the problem of quantum-state tomography under the realistic assumption that the state of the system is close to pure. In the context of pure-state tomography we typically wish to formulate measurements that distinguish a pure state from any other pure state. However, since the set of pure states is nonconvex, in general such measurements cannot be used to robustly estimate of the state. Nevertheless, we prove that the physical constraint that the density matrix is positive semidefinite allows us to define measurements that, in fact, yield a robust estimation of the state. Furthermore, the estimation can be obtained by solving essentially any convex program. We argue that one can implement such tomography relatively simply by measuring only a few random orthonormal bases. Our conjecture is supported by strong numerical evidence. These results are generalized for estimation of states close to bounded-rank.

abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers can couple to confined phonons in diamond mechanical resonators via the effect of lattice strain on their energy levels. Access to the strong spin-phonon coupling regime with this system requires resonators with nanoscale dimensions in order to overcome the weak strain response of the NV ground state spin sublevels. In this work, we study NVs in diamond cantilevers with lateral dimensions of a few hundred nm. Coupling of the NV ground state spin to the mechanical mode is detected in electron spin resonance (ESR), and its temporal dynamics are measured via spin echo. Our small mechanical mode volume leads to a 10-100X enhancement in spin-phonon coupling strength over previous NV-strain coupling demonstrations. This is an important step towards strong spin-phonon coupling, which can enable phonon-mediated quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

abstract: This essay considers a model quantum universe consisting of a very large box containing a screen with two slits and an observer (us) that can pass though the slits. We apply the modern quantum mechanics of closed systems to calculate the probabilities for alternative histories of how we move through the universe and what we see. After passing through the screen with the slits, the quantum state of the universe is a superposition of classically distinguishable histories. We are then living in a superposition. Some frequently asked questions about such situations are answered using this model. The model's relationship to more realistic quantum cosmologies is briefly discussed.

abstract: Lattice models of fermions, bosons, and spins have long served to elucidate the essential physics of quantum phase transitions in a variety of systems. Generalizing such models to incorporate driving and dissipation has opened new vistas to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena and dissipative phase transitions in interacting many-body systems. We present a framework for the treatment of such open quantum lattices based on a resummation scheme for the Lindblad perturbation series. Employing a convenient diagrammatic representation, we utilize this method to obtain relevant observables for the open Jaynes-Cummings lattice, a model of special interest for open-system quantum simulation. We demonstrate that the resummation framework allows us to reliably predict observables for both finite and infinite Jaynes-Cummings lattices with different lattice geometries. The resummation of the Lindblad perturbation series can thus serve as a valuable tool in validating open quantum simulators, such as circuit-QED lattices, currently being investigated experimentally.

abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computation and communication. It is necessary for many protocols and computations, but causes unexpected disturbance of computational states. Hence, static analysis of quantum entanglement in quantum programs is necessary. Several papers studied the problem. They decided qubits were entangled if multiple qubits unitary gates are applied to them, and some refined this reasoning using information about the state of each separated qubit. However, they do not care about the fact that unitary gate undoes entanglement and that measurement may separate multiple qubits. In this paper, we extend prior work using stabilizer formalism. It refines reasoning about separability of quantum variables in quantum programs.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering describes the ability of one observer to nonlocally "steer" the other observer's state through local measurements. It exhibits a unique asymmetric property, i.e., the steerability of one observer to steer the other's state could be different from each other, which can even lead to a one-way EPR steering, i.e., only one observer obtains the steerability in the two-observer case. This property is inherently different from the symmetric concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality and has been attracted increasing interests. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the asymmetric EPR steering for a class of two-qubit states in the case of two measurement settings. We propose a practical method to quantify the steerability. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for EPR steering and clearly show the case of one-way EPR steering. Our work provides a new insight on the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality and would find potential application in asymmetric quantum information processing.

abstract: Strongly interacting particles in one dimension subject to external confinement have become a topic of considerable interest due to recent experimental advances and the development of new theoretical methods to attack such systems. In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more internal degrees of freedom, one can map the problem onto the well-known Heisenberg spin models. However, many interesting physical systems contain mixtures of particles with different masses. Therefore, a generalization of the recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable. This is particularly important since such problems are generally considered non-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach cannot be applied. Here we discuss some initial steps towards this goal by investigating small ensembles of one-dimensional harmonically trapped particles where pairwise interactions are either vanishing or infinitely strong with focus on the mass-imbalanced case. We discuss a possible (semi)-analytical approach to describe systems using hyperspherical coordinates where the interaction is effectively decoupled from the trapping potential. As an illustrative example we analyze mass-imbalanced four-particle two-species mixtures with strong interactions between the two species. For such systems we calculate the energies, densities and pair-correlation functions.

abstract: A method is introduced which allows to measure normal-ordered moments of the displaced photon-number operator up to high orders. It is based on unbalanced homodyne correlation measurements, the local oscillator being replaced by a displaced dephased laser. The measured moments yield a simple approximation of the full quantum state, which is obtained without the need of photon-number resolution. Quantum properties of light are efficiently certified through the direct detection of normal-ordered observables, which is illustrated for a weakly squeezed vacuum and a single-photon-added thermal state.

abstract: We present a simple and efficient Bayesian recursive algorithm for the data-pattern scheme for quantum state reconstruction, which is applicable to situations where measurement settings can be controllably varied efficiently. The algorithm predicts the best measurements required to accurately reconstruct the unknown signal state in terms of a fixed set of probe states. In each iterative step, this algorithm seeks the measurement setting that minimizes the variance of the data-pattern estimator, which essentially measures the reconstruction accuracy, with the help of a data-pattern bank that was acquired prior to the signal reconstruction. We show that with this algorithm, it is possible to minimize the number of measurement settings required to obtain a reasonably accurate state estimator by using just the optimal settings and, at the same time, increasing the numerical efficiency of the data-pattern reconstruction.

abstract: The states of an open quantum system interact ("talk") with one another via the (extended) environment into which the (localized) system is embedded. This interaction is involved in the source term of the Schr\"odinger equation which describes the coupling between system and environment. The source term is strong only in the neighborhood of singular (exceptional) points. It is nonlinear and causes (dynamical) phase transitions in multi-level systems. We sketch the formalism and provide typical results. The relation to superradiance; to PT-symmetry breaking; and also to the violation of the Bell inequality is discussed.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, a generalization of the original concept of "steering" proposed by Schr\"{o}dinger, describes the ability of one system to nonlocally affect another system's states through local measurements. Some experimental efforts to test EPR steering in terms of inequalities have been made, which usually require many measurement settings. Analogy to the "All-Versus-Nothing" (AVN) proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities, testing steerability without inequalities would be more strong and require less resource. Moreover, the practical meaning of steering implies that it should also be possible to store the state information on the side to be steered, a result that has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Using a recent AVN criterion for two qubit entangled states, we experimentally implement a practical steering game using quantum memory. Further more, we develop a theoretical method to deal with the noise and finite measurement statistics within the AVN framework and apply it to analyze the experimental data. Our results clearly show the facilitation of the AVN criterion for testing steerability and provide a particularly strong perspective for understanding EPR steering.

We explore also the relation between $l_1$-norm and relative entropy based measures of coherence, and give a sharp inequality connecting the two. In addition, it is also shown that both $l_p$-norm and Schatten-$p$ norm based measures violate the strong monotonicity for all $p\in(1,\infty)$.

abstract: We show clear evidence of a speedup of a quantum annealing (QA) Schr\"odinger dynamics over a Glauber master-equation simulated annealing (SA) for a random Ising model in one dimension. Annealings are tackled on equal footing, by a deterministic dynamics of the resulting Jordan-Wigner fermionic problems. We find that disorder, without frustration, makes both SA and real-time QA logarithmically slow in the annealing time $\tau$, but QA shows a quadratic speedup with respect to SA. We also find that an imaginary-time Schr\"odinger QA dynamics provides a further exponential speedup, with an asymptotic residual error compatible with a power-law $\tau^{-\mu}$.

abstract: We show a power 2.5 separation between bounded-error randomized and quantum query complexity for a total Boolean function, refuting the widely believed conjecture that the best such separation could only be quadratic (from Grover's algorithm). We also present a total function with a power 4 separation between quantum query complexity and approximate polynomial degree, showing severe limitations on the power of the polynomial method. Finally, we exhibit a total function with a quadratic gap between quantum query complexity and certificate complexity, which is optimal (up to log factors). These separations are shown using a new, general technique that we call the cheat sheet technique. The technique is based on a generic transformation that converts any (possibly partial) function into a new total function with desirable properties for showing separations. The framework also allows many known separations, including some recent breakthrough results of Ambainis et al., to be shown in a unified manner.

abstract: Generating nonclassical states of photons such as polarization entangled states on a monolithic chip is a crucial step towards practical applications of optical quantum information processing such as quantum computing and quantum key distribution. Here we demonstrate two polarization entangled photon sources in a single monolithic semiconductor waveguide. The first source is achieved through the concurrent utilization of two spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) processes, namely type-0 and type-I SPDC processes. The chip can also generate polarization entangled photons via the type-II SPDC process, enabling the generation of both co-polarized and cross-polarized entangled photons in the same device. In both cases, polarization entanglement is generated directly on the chip without the use of any off-chip compensation, interferometry or bandpass filtering. This enables direct, chip-based generation of both Bell states $(|H,H\rangle+|V,V\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ and $(|H,V\rangle+|V,H\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ simultaneously utilizing the same pump source. In addition, based on compound semiconductors, this chip can be directly integrated with it own pump laser. This technique ushers an era of self-contained, integrated, electrically pumped, room-temperature polarization entangled photon sources.

abstract: The ability to live in coherent superposition states is a signature trait of quantum systems and constitutes an unexpendable resource for quantum-enhanced technologies. However, decoherence effects usually destroy quantum superpositions. Here we show that, in a composite quantum system exposed to decohering noise, quantum coherence in a reference basis can stay protected for indefinite time. This occurs for a class of quantum states independently of the measure used to quantify coherence, and requires no control on the system during the dynamics. Such an invariant coherence phenomenon is observed experimentally in a two-qubit room temperature nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator. Our study reveals a novel interplay between coherence and various forms of correlations, and highlights the natural resilience of quantum effects in complex systems.

abstract: Physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control multi-body interactions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with Hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile challenge. A common approach to robust storage of quantum information is to encode it in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian. Even allowing particles with high Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information from single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian containing only commuting two-local terms. Here, we demonstrate how to get around this no-go result by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of non-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against single-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge generators from Bacon-Shor codes and generalized-Bacon-Shor code. Our results imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more error-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. Finally, we comment briefly on the robustness of the whole scheme.

abstract: Weak measurements are a subset of measurement processes in quantum mechanics wherein the system which is being measured interacts very weakly with the measuring apparatus. Measurement values of observables undergoing a weak interaction and their amplification, are concepts that have sharpened our understanding of interaction processes in quantum mechanics. Recent experiments show that naturally occurring processes such as resonance fluorescence from excited states of an atom can exhibit weak value amplification effect. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the process of elastic resonance fluorescence from a V-type three level atomic system, using the well known Weiskopff-Wigner (W-W) theory of spontaneous emission. Within this theory, we show that, a weak interaction regime can be identified and for suitable choices of initial and final excited states, the mean scattering time between these states show an amplification effect during interaction with the vacuum bath modes of the electromagnetic field. We thus show for the first time that a system bath interaction can show weak value amplification. Using our theory we reproduce the published experimental results carried out in such a system. More importantly, our theory can calculate scattering timescales in elastic resonance scattering between multiple excited states of a single atom or between common excited state configurations of interacting multi-atom systems.

abstract: We define an entanglement witness in a composite quantum system as an observable having nonnegative expectation value in every separable state. Then a state is entangled if and only if it has a negative expectation value of some entanglement witness. Equivalent representations of entanglement witnesses are as nonnegative biquadratic forms or as positive linear maps of Hermitian matrices. As reported elsewhere, we have studied extremal entanglement witnesses in dimension $3\times 3$ by constructing numerical examples of generic extremal nonnegative forms. These are so complicated that we do not know how to handle them other than by numerical methods. However, the corresponding extremal positive maps can be presented graphically, as we attempt to do in the present paper. We understand that a positive map is extremal when the image of $\mathcal{D}$, the set of density matrices, fills out $\mathcal{D}$ maximally, in a certain sense. For the graphical presentation of a map we transform it to a standard form where it is unital and trace preserving. We present an iterative algorithm for the transformation, which converges rapidly in all our numerical examples and presumably works for any positive map. This standard form of an entanglement witness is unique up to unitary product transformations.

abstract: Conditional preparation is a well-established technique for quantum state engineering of light. A general trend is to increase the number of heralding detection events in such realization to reach larger photon-number states or their arbitrary superpositions. In contrast to pulsed implementations, where detections only occur within the pulse window, for continuous-wave light the temporal separation of the conditioning detections is an additional degree of freedom and a critical parameter. Based on the theoretical study by A.E.B. Nielsen and K. Molmer and on a continuous-wave two-mode squeezed vacuum from a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator, we experimentally investigate the generation of two-photon state with tunable delay between the heralding events. The present work illustrates the temporal multimode features in play for conditional state generation based on continuous-wave light sources.

abstract: Technology based on memristors, resistors with memory whose resistance depends on the history of the crossing charges, has lately enhanced the classical paradigm of computation with neuromorphic architectures. However, in contrast to the known quantized models of passive circuit elements, such as inductors, capacitors or resistors, the design and realization of a quantum memristor is still missing. Here, we introduce the concept of a quantum memristor as a quantum dissipative device, whose decoherence mechanism is controlled by a continuous-measurement feedback scheme, which accounts for the memory. Indeed, we provide numerical simulations showing that memory effects actually persist in the quantum regime. Our quantization method, specifically designed for superconducting circuits, may be extended to other quantum platforms, allowing for memristor-type constructions in different quantum technologies. The proposed quantum memristor is then a building block for neuromorphic quantum computation and quantum simulations of non-Markovian systems.

abstract: Many non-classicality indicators are used to measure quantum effects of different systems. Kenfack's and Sadeghi's non-classicality indicators are introduced in terms of the amount of Wigner function's negativities and interferences in phase space quantum mechanics, respectively. They are, effectively, applied for some real distribution functions. In this paper, we compared these non-classicality indicators for the entangled state of photonic number states in the Wigner, Husimi and Rivier representations. It is shown that for a two-level entangled state, Sadeghi's indicator has more benefits with respect to the Kenfack's indicator. For the two-level entangled state, we show a correspondence between the Sadeghi's non-classicality indicator and the Von Neumann entropy. It is also shown that for the superposition of squeezed number state the Sadeghi's (and no Kenfack's) non-classicality indicators is sensible with respect to the squeezing parameter for a superposition of squeezed number states.

abstract: We show that the quantum query complexity of evaluating NAND-tree instances with average choice complexity at most $W$ is $O(W)$, where average choice complexity is a measure of the difficulty of winning the associated two-player game. This generalizes a superpolynomial speedup over classical query complexity due to Zhan et al. [Zhan et al., ITCS 2012, 249-265]. We further show that the player with a winning strategy for the two-player game associated with the NAND-tree can win the game with an expected $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/4}\sqrt{{\cal C}(x)})$ quantum queries against a random opponent, where ${\cal C }(x)$ is the average choice complexity of the instance. This gives an improvement over the query complexity of the naive strategy, which costs $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries. The results rely on a connection between NAND-tree evaluation and $st$-connectivity problems on certain graphs, and span programs for $st$-connectivity problems. Our results follow from relating average choice complexity to the effective resistance of these graphs, which itself corresponds to the span program witness size.

abstract: Quantum technologies will ultimately require manipulating many-body quantum systems with high precision. Cold atom experiments represent a stepping stone in that direction: a high degree of control has been achieved on systems of increasing complexity, however, this control is still sub-optimal. Optimal control theory is the ideal candidate to bridge the gap between early stage and optimal experimental protocols, particularly since it was extended to encompass many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate optimal control applied to two dynamical processes subject to interactions: the coherent manipulation of motional states of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate and the crossing of a quantum phase transition in small systems of cold atoms in optical lattices. We show theoretically that these transformations can be made fast and robust with respect to perturbations, including temperature and atom number fluctuations, resulting in a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

Here we report the experimental creation of such a non-separable, tripartite GHZ-like state of path, polarization and transverse modes of a classical laser beam. We use a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an additional mirror and other optical elements to perform measurements that violate Mermin's inequality. This demonstration of a classical optical analogue of tripartite entanglement paves the path to novel optical applications inspired by multipartite quantum information protocols.

abstract: Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd showed that for a suitably specified $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and $N$-dimensional vector $\vec{b}$, there is a quantum algorithm that outputs a quantum state proportional to the solution of the linear system of equations $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. If $A$ is sparse and well-conditioned, their algorithm runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(\log N, 1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output state. We improve this to an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, exponentially improving the dependence on precision while keeping essentially the same dependence on other parameters. Our algorithm is based on a general technique for implementing any operator with a suitable Fourier or Chebyshev series representation. This allows us to bypass the quantum phase estimation algorithm, whose dependence on $\epsilon$ is prohibitive.

When the states are all pure, acquiring the entropic lower bound requires only the density operator and the number of the possible states. This entropic bound shows a relation between the von Neumann entropy and the distinguishability.

abstract: Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are studied in a symmetric nonlinear optical coupler, which is composed of two nonlinear ($\chi^{\left(2\right)}$) waveguides that are interacting with each other via the evanescent waves. Both the waveguides operate under second harmonic generation. However, to study quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects one of them is considered as the system and the other one is considered as the probe. Considering all the fields involved as weak, a completely quantum mechanical description is provided, and the analytic solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for all the field modes are obtained using a perturbative technique. Photon number statistics of the second harmonic mode of the system is shown to depend on the presence of the probe, and this dependence is considered as quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. Further, it is established that as a special case of the momentum operator for $\chi^{\left(2\right)}-\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ symmetric coupler we can obtain momentum operator of $\chi^{\left(2\right)}-\chi^{\left(1\right)}$ asymmetric coupler with linear ($\chi^{\left(1\right)}$) waveguide as the probe, and in such a particular case, the expressions obtained for Zeno and anti-Zeno effects with nonlinear probe (which we referred to as nonlinear quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects) may be reduced to the corresponding expressions with linear probe (which we referred to as the linear quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects). Linear and nonlinear quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are rigorously investigated, and it is established that in the stimulated case, we may switch between quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects just by controlling the phase of the second harmonic mode of the system or probe.

abstract: This research note II introduces a way to understand a basic concept of the quantum enigma cipher. The conventional cipher is designed by a mathematical algorithm and its security is evaluated by the complexity of the algorithm in security analysis and ability of computers. This kind of cipher can be decrypted with probability one in principle by the Brute force attack in which an eavesdropper tries all the possible keys based on the correct ciphertext and some known plaintext. A cipher with quantum effects in physical layer may protect the system from the Brute force attack by means of the quantum no cloning theorem and randomizations based on quantum noise effect. The randomizations for the ciphertext which is the output from the mathematical encryption box is crucial to realize a quantum enigma cipher. Especially, by randomizations, it is necessary to make a substantial difference in accuracy of ciphertext in eavesdropper's observation and legitimate user's observation. The quantum illumination protocol can make a difference in error performance of the legitimate's receiver and the eavesdropper's receiver. This difference is due to differences in ability of the legitimate's receiver with entanglement and the eavesdropper's receiver without entanglement. It is shown in this note that the quantum illumination can be employed as an element of the most simple quantum enigma cipher.

abstract: Recently, the theoretical work of Fr\"owis and W. D\"ur (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{106}, 110402 (2011)) and the experiment of Lu \emph{et al.} (Nat. Photon. \textbf{8}, 364 (2014)) both showed that the logic-qubit entanglement has its potential application in future quantum communication and quantum network. However, the entanglement will suffer from the noise and decoherence. In this paper, we will investigate the entanglement purification for logic-qubit entanglement. We show that both the bit-flip error and phase-flip error in logic-qubit entanglement can be well purified. Moreover, the bit-flip error and in physical-qubit entanglement can be completely corrected. The phase-flip error equals to the bit-flip error in logic-qubit entanglement which can also be purified. This EPP may provide some potential applications in future quantum communication and quantum network.

abstract: We experimentally perform the simulation of open quantum dynamics in single-qudit systems. Using a spatial light modulator as a dissipative optical device, we implement dissipative-dynamical maps onto qudits encoded in the transverse momentum of spontaneous parametric down-converted photon pairs. We show a well-controlled technique to prepare entangled qudits states as well as to implement dissipative local measurements; the latter realize two specific dynamics: dephasing and amplitude damping. Our work represents a new analogy-dynamical experiment for simulating an open quantum system.

abstract: Nonlinear Kronig-Penney model has been frequently employed to study transmission problem of electron wave in a nonlinear electrified chain or in a doped semiconductor superlattice. Here from an integral equation we derive a novel exact solution of the problem, which contains a simple nonlinear map connecting transmission coefficient with system parameters. Consequently, we suggest a scheme for manipulating electronic distribution and transmission by adjusting the system parameters. A new effect of quantum coherence is evidenced in the strict expression of transmission coefficient by which for some different system parameters we obtain the similar aperiodic distributions and arbitrary transmission coefficients including the approximate zero transmission and total transmission, and the multiple transmissions. The method based on the concise exact solution can be applied directly to some nonlinear cold atomic systems and a lot of linear Kronig-Penney systems, and also can be extended to investigate electron transport in different discrete nonlinear systems.

abstract: We analyze the dynamics and steady state of a linear ion array when some of the ions are continuously laser cooled. We calculate the ions' local temperature measured by its position fluctuation under various trapping and cooling configurations, taking into account background heating due to the noisy environment. For a large system, we demonstrate that by arranging the cooling ions evenly in the array, one can suppress the overall heating considerably. We also investigate the effect of different cooling rates and find that the optimal cooling efficiency is achieved by an intermediate cooling rate. We discuss the relaxation time for the ions to approach the steady state, and show that with periodic arrangement of the cooling ions, the cooling efficiency does not scale down with the system size.

abstract: We construct an entanglement witness for many-qubit systems, based on symmetric two-body correlations with two measurement settings. This witness is able to detect the entanglement of some Dicke states for any number of particles, and such detection exhibits some robustness against white noise and thermal noise under the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian. In addition, it detects the entanglement of spin-squeezed states, with a detection strength that approaches the maximal value for sufficiently large numbers of particles. As spin-squeezed states can be experimentally generated, the properties of the witness with respect to these states may be amenable to experimental investigation. Finally, we show that while the witness is unable to detect GHZ states, it is instead able to detect superpositions of Dicke states with GHZ states.

abstract: In this present paper we study the entanglement dynamics in qubit A-qutrit B pair under x component of Dzyaloshinshkii-Moriya $(D_{x})$ by taking an auxiliary qubit C. Here we consider an entangled qubit-qutrit pair initially prepared in two parameter qubit-qutrit states and one auxiliary qubit prepared in pure state interacts with the qutrit of the pair through DM interaction. We trace away the auxiliary qubit and calculate the reduced dynamics in qubit A-qutrit B pair to study the influence of the state of auxiliary qubit C and $D_{x}$ on entanglement. We find that the state (probability amplitude) of auxiliary qubit does not influence the entanglement, only $D_{x}$ influences the same. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) induced by $D_{x}$ has also been observed. We also present the affected and unaffected two parameter qubit-qutrit states by $D_{x}$.

abstract: We study the lensing effect experienced by a weak probe field under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) involving a Rydberg state. A Gaussian coupling beam tightly focused on a laser-cooled atomic cloud produces an inhomogeneity in the coupling Rabi frequency along the transverse direction and makes the EIT area acting like a gradient-index medium. We image the probe beam at the position where it exits the atomic cloud, and observe that a red-detuned probe light is strongly focused with a greatly enhanced intensity whereas a blue-detuned one is de-focused with a reduced intensity. Our experimental results agree very well with the numerical solutions of Maxwell-Bloch equations.

abstract: At separations below 100 nm, Casimir-Lifshitz forces strongly influence the actuation dynamics of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) in dry vacuum conditions. For a micron size plate oscillating near a surface, which mimics a frequently used setup in experiments with MEMS, we show that the roughness of the surfaces significantly influences the qualitative dynamics of the oscillator. Via a combination of analytical and numerical methods, it is shown that surface roughness leads to a clear increase of initial conditions associated with chaotic motion, that eventually lead to stiction between the surfaces. Since stiction leads to malfunction of MEMS oscillators, our results are of central interest for the design of microdevices. Moreover, they are of significance for fundamentally motivated experiments performed with MEMS.

abstract: We investigate the maximally coherent states to provide a refinement in quantifying coherence and give a measure-independent definition of the coherence-preserving operations. A maximally coherent state can be considered as the resource to create arbitrary quantum states of the same dimension by merely incoherent operations. We propose that only the maximally coherent states should achieve the maximal value for a coherence measure. Using this condition as an additional criterion for coherence measures, we can obtain a refinement in quantifying coherence and exclude the invalid and inefficient coherence measures. Under this new criterion, we then give a measure-independent definition of the coherence-preserving operations, which play a similar role in quantifying coherence as that palyed by the local unitary operations in the scenario of studying entanglement.

abstract: We show that quantum diffusion near the quantum critical point can provide an efficient mechanism of open-system quantum annealing. It is based on the diffusion-mediated recombination of excitations. Our analysis refers to an Ising spin chain coupled to transverse field and bosonic bath. It shows that the diffusion sharply slows down as the system moves away from the quantum critical region. This leads to spatial correlations and effective freezing of the excitation density at the value that non-monotonically depends on the annealing rate. We find analytically that obtaining an approximate solution via the diffusion-mediated quantum annealing can be faster than via closed-system quantum annealing or Glauber dynamics.

abstract: We propose a scheme that converts a stabilizer code into another stabilizer code in a fault tolerant manner. The scheme first puts both codes in specific forms, and proceeds the conversion from a source code to a target code by applying Clifford gates. The Clifford gates are chosen from the comparisons between both codes. The fault tolerance of the conversion is guaranteed by quantum error correction in every step during the entire conversion process. As examples, we show three conversions: the $[[5,1,3]]$ stabilizer code and Steane code, Steane code and $[[15,1,3]]$ Reed-Muller code, and Steane code and $(3,4)$-QPC code.

We propose the generalization of Schro\"edinger equation in momentum representation on the case of deformed Heisenberg algebra with minimal length. Assuming that the kernel of potential energy operator do not change in the case of deformation, we obtain exact solution of eigenproblem of a particle in delta potential as well as double delta potential. Particle in Coulomb like potential is revisited and the problem of inversibility and hermicity of inverse coordinate operator is solved.

abstract: In the study of Markovian processes, one of the principal achievements is the equivalence between the $\Phi$-Sobolev inequalities and an exponential decrease of the $\Phi$-entropies. In this work, we develop a framework of Markov semigroups on matrix-valued functions and generalize the above equivalence to the exponential decay of matrix $\Phi$-entropies. This result also specializes to spectral gap inequalities and modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in the random matrix setting. To establish the main result, we define a non-commutative generalization of the carr\'e du champ operator, and prove a de Bruijn's identity for matrix-valued functions. The proposed Markov semigroups acting on matrix-valued functions have immediate applications in the characterization of the dynamical evolution of quantum ensembles. We consider two special cases of quantum unital channels, namely, the depolarizing channel and the phase-damping channel. In the former, since there exists a unique equilibrium state, we show that the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of the resulting quantum ensemble decays exponentially as time goes on. Consequently, we obtain a stronger notion of monotonicity of the Holevo quantity - the Holevo quantity of the quantum ensemble decays exponentially in time and the convergence rate is determined by the modified log-Sobolev inequalities. However, in the latter, the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of the quantum ensemble that undergoes the phase-damping Markovian evolution generally will not decay exponentially. This is because there are multiple equilibrium states for such a channel. Finally, we also consider examples of statistical mixing of Markov semigroups on matrix-valued functions. We can explicitly calculate the convergence rate of a Markovian jump process defined on Boolean hypercubes, and provide upper bounds of the mixing time on these types of examples.

abstract: Quantum steering has recently attracted a growing interest from both fundamental and practical aspects. It is a strong form of quantum correlation that can be verified even when one party or its measuring device is fully untrusted thereby offering some important practical applications, e.g. one-sided device independent cryptography. In continuous-variable systems, Gaussian states among others have been extensively studied, but most of studies have so far considered only Gaussian measurements for their steerability. It was even conjectured that Gaussian measurements are optimal for steering of Gaussian states. Here, we introduce a formalism based on local uncertainty relations of non-Gaussian measurements and show that there exist some two-mode Gaussian states for which Gaussian measurements cannot detect steerability but our non-Gaussian formulation can. To this aim, we specifically look into Gaussian states of practical relevance, i.e. two-mode squeezed states under a lossy and an amplifying Gaussian channel. Our finding significantly modifies the characteristics of Gaussian-state steering so far established such as monogamy relations and one-way steering under Gaussian measurements, thus opening a new direction for critical studies beyond Gaussian regime.

A model for the four Bell states, such that maintains maximally correlated in two bases: linear and circular in all reference frames is developed. Relativistic correlation functions are derived for two cases: when the detectors are transformed under Lorentz transformation in such a way that they still remain in the same reference frame and when just one of the detectors is transformed.

abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_d$ Parafermions are exotic non-Abelian quasiparticles generalizing Majorana fermions, which correspond to the case $d=2$. In contrast to Majorana fermions, braiding of parafermions with $d>2$ allows to perform an entangling gate. This has spurred interest in parafermions and a variety of condensed matter systems have been proposed as potential hosts for them. In this work, we study the computational power of braiding parafermions more systematically. We make no assumptions on the underlying physical model but derive all our results from the algebraical relations that define parafermions. We find a familiy of $2d$ representations of the braid group that are compatible with these relations. The braiding operators derived this way reproduce those derived previously from physical grounds as special cases. We show that if a $d$-level qudit is encoded in the fusion space of four parafermions, braiding of these four parafermions allows to generate the entire single-qudit Clifford group (up to phases), for any $d$. If $d$ is odd, then we show that in fact the entire many-qudit Clifford group can be generated.

abstract: Quantum metrology protocols allow to surpass precision limits typical to classical statistics. However, in recent years, no-go theorems have been formulated, which state that typical forms of uncorrelated noise can constrain the quantum enhancement to a constant factor, and thus bound the error to the standard asymptotic scaling. In particular, that is the case of time-homogeneous (Lindbladian) dephasing and, more generally, all semigroup dynamics that include phase covariant terms, which commute with the system Hamiltonian. We show that the standard scaling can be surpassed when the dynamics is no longer ruled by a semigroup and becomes time-inhomogeneous. In this case, the ultimate precision is determined by the system short-time behaviour, which when exhibiting the natural Zeno regime leads to a non-standard asymptotic resolution. In particular, we demonstrate that the relevant noise feature dictating the precision is the violation of the semigroup property at short timescales, while non-Markovianity does not play any specific role.

abstract: A generalized version of the coupled coherent states method for coherent states of arbitrary Lie groups is developed. In contrast to the original formulation, which is restricted to frozen-Gaussian basis sets, the extended method is suitable for propagating quantum states of systems featuring diversified physical properties, such as spin degrees of freedom or particle indistinguishability. The approach is illustrated with systems of interacting bosons trapped in double- and triple-well potentials, most adequately described in terms of SU(2) and SU(3) bosonic coherent states, respectively.

abstract: We propose an interferometric scheme based on an untrapped nano-object subjected to classical gravity. The center of mass (CM) of the free object is coupled to its internal spin system magnetically, and a free flight scheme is developed in which the matter wave of the test object is split and merged in a double slit interferometry fashion. It shows the capability of generating a large spatially separated superposition of the composite system and consequently evidencing it via a Ramsey interferometry that reveals a gravity induced dynamical phase accrued solely on the spin. We find a remarkable immunity to the motional noise in the CM so that our scheme would work for a thermal initial state with moderate cooling. The mass independence of our scheme makes it viable for nano-object ensembles with a high mass variability. The $100$ nm scale of spatial separation of the superposed components, as well as the high visibility of the resulting Ramsey interference over $100 \mu$s provides a route to test postulated modifications of quantum theory such as continuous spontaneous localisation.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the effects of vacuum-induced coherence (VIC) on magneto-optical rotation (MOR). We carry out a model study to show that VIC in the presence of a control laser and a magnetic field can lead to large enhancement in the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized weak laser with vanishing circular dichroism. This effect can be realized in cold molecular gases and may be used as a sensitive probe for VIC. Such a large MOR angle can also be used to detect weak magnetic field with large measurement sensitivity.

abstract: We analyze the operation of a novel sensor based on atom interferometry, which can achieve supra-classical sensitivity by exploiting quantum correlations in mixed states of many qubits. The interferometer is based on quantum gates which use coherently-controlled Rydberg interactions between a single atom (which acts as a control qubit) and an atomic ensemble (which provides register qubits). In principle, our scheme can achieve precision scaling with the size of the ensemble - which can extend to large numbers of atoms - while using only single-qubit operations on the control and bulk operations on the ensemble. We investigate realistic implementation of the interferometer, and our main aim is to develop a new approach to quantum metrology that can achieve quantum-enhanced measurement precision by exploiting coherent operations on large impure quantum states. We propose an experiment to demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity of the protocol, and to investigate a transition from classical to supra-classical sensitivity which occurs when using highly-mixed probe states.

abstract: We suggest a novel optical parametric generator (OPG) in which one of the down-converted beams is spontaneously generated along the Poynting vector of the pump beam. In this configuration, the generation takes advantage of the walk-off of the extraordinary pump rather than being degraded by it. As a result the generated beams, signal and idler, are bright, due to a high conversion efficiency, spatially nearly single-mode, due to the preferred direction of the Poynting vector, tuneable over a wide range of wavelengths, and broadband. The two beams are also correlated in frequency and in the photon number per pulse. Furthermore due to their thermal statistics these beams can be used as a pump to efficiently generate other nonlinear processes.

abstract: The instantaneous non-local quantum computation task requires multiple parties to jointly perform a quantum operation, using pre-shared entanglement and a single round of simultaneous communication. We study this task for its close connection to position-based quantum cryptography, but it also has natural applications in the context of foundations of quantum physics and in distributed computing. The best known general construction for instantaneous non-local quantum computation requires a pre-shared state which is exponentially large in the number of qubits involved in the operation, while efficient constructions are known for very specific cases only. We partially close this gap by presenting new schemes for efficient instantaneous non-local computation of several classes of quantum circuits, using the Clifford+T gate set. Our main result is a protocol which uses entanglement exponential in the T-depth of a quantum circuit, able to perform non-local computation of quantum circuits with a (poly-)logarithmic number of layers of T gates with quasi-polynomial entanglement. Our proofs combine ideas from blind and delegated quantum computation with the garden-hose model, a combinatorial model of communication complexity which was recently introduced as a tool for studying certain schemes for quantum position verification. As application of our results, we additionally present an efficient attack on a recently-proposed scheme for position verification by Chakraborty and Leverrier.

abstract: We propose a simple experimental test of the quantum equivalence principle introduced by Zych and Brukner [arXiv:1502.00971], which generalises the Einstein equivalence principle to superpositions of internal energy states. We consider a harmonically-trapped spin-$\frac12$ atom in the presence of both gravity and an external magnetic field and show that when the external magnetic field is suddenly switched off, various violations of the equivalence principle would manifest as otherwise forbidden transitions. Performing such an experiment would put bounds on the various phenomenological violating parameters. We further demonstrate that the classical weak equivalence principle can be tested by suddenly putting the apparatus into free fall, effectively 'switching off' gravity.

abstract: We develop a Bloch vector representation of Unruh channel for a Dirac field mode. This is used to provide a unified, analytical treatment of quantum Fisher and Skew information for a qubit subjected to the Unruh channel, both in its pure form as well as in the presence of experimentally relevant external noise channels. The time evolution of Fisher and Skew information is studied along with the impact of external environment parameters such as temperature and squeezing. The external noises are modelled by both purely dephasing phase damping as well as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels. An interesting interplay between the external reservoir temperature and squeezing on the Fisher and Skew information is observed, in particular, for the action of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel. It is seen that for some regimes, squeezing can enhance the quantum information against the deteriorating influence of the ambient environment. Similar features are also observed for the analogous study of Skew information, highlighting the similar origin of the Fisher and Skew information.

abstract: We propose two different setups to generate single photons on demand using an atom in front of a mirror, along with either a beam-splitter or a tunable coupling. We show that photon generation efficiency ~ 99% is straightforward to achieve. The proposed schemes are simple and easily tunable in frequency. The operation is relatively insensitive to dephasing and can be easily extended to generate correlated pairs of photons. They can also in principle be used to generate any photonic qubit in arbitrary wave-packets, making them very attractive for quantum communication applications.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation of atom-light entanglement via Raman superradiance in an optical cavity, and show how this can be used to enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometry. We model a realistic optical cavity, and show that by careful temporal shaping of the optical local oscillator used to measure the light emitted from the cavity, information in the optical mode can be combined with the signal from the atom interferometer to reduce the quantum noise, and thus increase the sensitivity. It was found in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 053002 (2013) that an atomic `seed' was required in order to reduce spontaneous emission and allow for single mode behaviour of the device. In this paper we find that the optical cavity reduces the need for an atomic seed, which allows for stronger atom-light correlations and a greater level of quantum enhancement.

abstract: We calculate the bound state spectrum of the highly excited valence electron in the heavy alkali atoms solving the radial Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem numerically with an accurate spectral collocation algorithm that applies also for a large principal quantum number $n\gg1$. As an effective single-particle potential we favor the reputable potential of Marinescu \emph{et al}., {[}Phys. Rev.A \textbf{49}, 982(1994){]}. Recent quasiclassical calculations of the quantum defect of the valence electron agree for orbital angular momentum $l=0,1,2,...$ overall remarkably well with the results of the numerical calculations, but for the Rydberg states of rubidium and also cesium with $l=3$ this agreement is less fair. The reason for this anomaly is that the potential acquires for $l=3$ deep inside the ionic core a tiny second classical region, thus invalidating a standard WKB calculation with two widely spaced turning points. Comparing then our numerical solutions of the radial Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem with the uniform analytic WKB approximation of Langer we observe everywhere a remarkable agreement, apart from a tiny region around the inner turning point. With help of an ansatz proposed by Fock we obtain for the \emph{s}-states a second uniform analytic approximation to the radial wave function complementary to the WKB approximation of Langer, which is exact for $r\to0^{+}$. The value of the radial \emph{s}-wave function at $r=0$ is analytically found, thus validating the Fermi-Segr\`e formula for the magnetic dipole interaction constant $A_{n,j,0}^{\left(\mathrm{HFS}\right)}$.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the creation of squeezed states of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) trapped in a magnetic double well potential. The number or phase squeezed states are created by modulating the tunnel coupling between the two wells periodically with twice the Josephson frequency, i.e., through parametric amplification. Simulations are performed with the multi configurational Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). We employ optimal control theory to bring the condensate to a complete halt at a final time, thus creating a highly squeezed state (squeezing factor of 0.12, $\xi_S^2=-18$ dB) suitable for atom interferometry.

abstract: Mixed states of a quantum system, represented by density operators, can be decomposed as a statistical mixture of pure states in a number of ways where each decomposition can be viewed as a different preparation recipe. However the fact that the density matrix contains full information about the ensemble makes it impossible to estimate the preparation basis for the quantum system. Here we present a measurement scheme to (seemingly) improve the performance of unsharp measurements. We argue that in some situations this scheme is capable of providing statistics from a single copy of the quantum system, thus, making it possible to perform state tomography from a single copy. One of the byproduct of the scheme is a way to distinguish between different preparation methods used to prepare the state of the quantum system. However, our numerical simulations disagree with our intuitive predictions. We show that a counter-intuitive property of biased classical random walk is responsible for the proposed mechanism to not work.

abstract: Entanglement is the resource to overcome the restriction of operations to Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). The Maximally Entangled Set (MES) of states is the minimal set of n-partite pure states with the property that any truly n-partite entangled pure state can be obtained deterministically via LOCC from some state in this set. Hence, this set contains the most useful states for applications. In this work we characterize the MES for generic three qutrit states. Moreover, we analyze which generic three qutrit states are reachable (and convertible) under LOCC transformations. To this end we study reachability via separable operations (SEP), a class of operations that is strictly larger than LOCC. Interestingly, we identify a family of pure states that can be obtained deterministically via SEP but not via LOCC. To our knowledge these are the first examples of transformations among pure states that can be implemented via SEP but not via LOCC.

abstract: We present a loophole-free violation of local realism using entangled photon pairs. We ensure that all relevant events in our Bell test are spacelike separated by placing the parties far enough apart and by using fast random number generators and high-speed polarization measurements. A high-quality polarization-entangled source of photons, combined with high-efficiency, low-noise, single-photon detectors, allows us to make measurements without requiring any fair-sampling assumptions. Using a hypothesis test, we compute p-values as small as $5.9\times 10^{-9}$ for our Bell violation while maintaining the spacelike separation of our events. We estimate the degree to which a local realistic system could predict our measurement choices. Accounting for this predictability, our smallest adjusted p-value is $2.3 \times 10^{-7}$. We therefore reject the hypothesis that local realism governs our experiment.

abstract: Local realism is the worldview in which physical properties of objects exist independently of measurement and where physical influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Bell's theorem states that this worldview is incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics, as is expressed in Bell's inequalities. Previous experiments convincingly supported the quantum predictions. Yet, every experiment performed to date required assumptions that provide loopholes for a local realist explanation. Here we report a Bell test that closes the most significant of these loopholes simultaneously. Using a well-optimized source of entangled photons, rapid setting generation, and highly efficient superconducting detectors, we observe a violation of a Bell inequality with high statistical significance.

abstract: Entangled quantum states can be given a separable decomposition if we relax the restriction that the local operators be quantum states. Motivated by the construction of classical simulations and local hidden variable models, we construct `smallest' local sets of operators that achieve this. In other words, given an arbitrary bipartite quantum state we construct convex sets of local operators that allow for a separable decomposition, but that cannot be made smaller while continuing to do so. We then consider two further variants of the problem where the local state spaces are required to contain the local quantum states, and obtain solutions for a variety of cases including a region of pure states around the maximally entangled state. The methods involve calculating certain forms of cross norm. Two of the variants of the problem have a strong relationship to theorems on ensemble decompositions of positive operators, and our results thereby give those theorems an added interpretation. The results generalise those obtained in our previous work on this topic [New J. Phys. 17, 093047 (2015)].

abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system with internal degrees of freedom undergoing spontaneous collapse in the position basis are analyzed. Such systems are for example neutral mesons or neutrinos. We show that final probabilities crucially depend on the value of the Heaviside function $\theta(x)$ at $x=0$ that can in general be chosen in the interval [0,1]. Indeed for the QMUPL (Quantum Mechanics with Universal Position Localization) model only a single value leads to probabilities conserving the particle number. Consequently, the physical properties of the noise field are constrained. Since this affects the general structure of collapse models we expect it to hold also for other collapse models such as the CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization) model.

As a byproduct, a rule of how to construct all the anti-symmetric states in these high spin systems is given. Finally, by employing the negativity as the entanglement measure, we explore the entanglement properties for spin-$1$ cases including certain pure states of two particles and many-particle Dicke states.

abstract: We introduce a shortcut to the adiabatic gate teleportation model of quantum computation. More specifically, we determine fast local counter-diabatic Hamiltonians able to implement teleportation as a primitive for universal quantum computing. In this scenario, we provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary n-qubit gates, which allows to achieve universality through a variety of gate sets. Remarkably, our approach maps the superadiabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary n-qubit gate teleportation into the implementation of a rotated superadiabatic dynamics of an n-qubit state teleportation. This result is rather general, with the speed of the evolution only dictated by the quantum speed limit. In particular, we analyze the energetic cost for different Hamiltonian interpolations in the context of the energy-time complementarity.

abstract: A major challenge in quantum computing is to solve general problems with limited physical hardware. Here, we implement digitized adiabatic quantum computing, combining the generality of the adiabatic algorithm with the universality of the digital approach, using a superconducting circuit with nine qubits. We probe the adiabatic evolutions, and quantify the success of the algorithm for random spin problems. We find that the system can approximate the solutions to both frustrated Ising problems and problems with more complex interactions, with a performance that is comparable. The presented approach is compatible with small-scale systems as well as future error-corrected quantum computers.

abstract: We present quantum fidelity benchmarks for continuous-variable (CV) quantum devices to outperform quantum channels which can transmit at most $k$-dimensional coherences for positive integers~$k$. We determine an upper bound of an average fidelity over Gaussian distributed coherent states for quantum channels whose Schmidt class is $k$. This settles fundamental fidelity steps where the known classical limit and quantum limit correspond to the two endpoints of $k=1$ and $k= \infty $, respectively. It turns out that the average fidelity is useful to verify to what extent an experimental CV gate can transmit a high dimensional coherence. The result is also extended to be applicable to general quantum operations. While the fidelity is directly associated with heterodyne measurements in quantum optics, we can also obtain similar criteria based on mean square quadrature deviations via homodyne measurements.

abstract: We present a model of a spin-squeezed rotation sensor utilising the Sagnac effect in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring trap. The two input states for the interferometer are seeded using Raman pulses with Laguerre-Gauss beams and are amplified by the bosonic enhancement of spin-exchange collisions, resulting in spin-squeezing and potential quantum enhancement in the interferometry. The ring geometry has an advantage over separated beam path atomic rotation sensors due to the uniform condensate density. We model the interferometer both analytically and numerically for realistic experimental parameters and find that significant quantum enhancement is possible, but this enhancement is partially degraded when working in a regime with strong atomic interactions.

abstract: A protocol based on quantum error correction based characterization of quantum dynamics (QECCD) is developed for quantum process tomography on a two-qubit system interacting dissipatively with a vacuum bath. The method uses a 5-qubit quantum error correcting code that corrects arbitrary errors on the first two qubits, and also saturates the quantum Hamming bound. The dissipative interaction with a vacuum bath allows for both correlated and independent noise on the two-qubit system. We study the dependence of the degree of the correlation of the noise on evolution time and inter-qubit separation.

abstract: Control over nuclear spin fluctuations is essential for processes that rely on preserving the quantum state of an embedded system. For this purpose, squeezing is a viable alternative, so far that has not been properly exploited for the nuclear spin bath. Of particular relevance in solids is the electric quadrupole interaction (QI), which operates on nuclei having spin higher than 1/2. In its general form, QI involves an electric field gradient (EFG) biaxiality term. Together with this, it intrinsically offers a direct means for single-particle squeezing, which can be termed as mixed-axis twisting (MAT), as it combines the one-axis twisting (OAT) and two-axis countertwisting (TAC) models. Here, we show that MAT alleviates squeezing blind spots over the Bloch sphere that arise at different locations in the cases of OAT and TAC. A detailed analysis of QI squeezing is provided, exhibiting the intricate consequences of EFG biaxiality. Dependence on the initial coherent spin state over the Bloch sphere is mapped out, also in regard to squeezing rate, and its connection to the quantum speed limit is established. Furthermore, the evolution of squeezing in the presence of a phase-damping channel and an external magnetic field are investigated. We observe that dephasing drives toward an anti-squeezed terminal state, the degree of which increases with the spin angular momentum. Finally, QI squeezing in the limiting case of a two-dimensional EFG with a perpendicular magnetic field is discussed, which is of importance for two-dimensional materials, and the associated beat patterns in squeezing are revealed.

abstract: We perform a microscopic derivation of the effective flux action of a hybrid quantum system consisting of a superconducting flux qubit (SFQ) in the presence of a spin-$F$ atomic Bose gas. For a magnetized Bose-Einstein condensed state (BEC) of $N_{B}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^6)$ atoms in an experimentally realistic geometry, we demonstrate a two- to five-fold amplification of the quantum superposition macroscopicity $\mathcal{M}$ of the ground state screening current superposition over the bare value without the BEC. Exploiting the connection between $\mathcal M$ and the maximal metrological usefulness of a multimode superposition state, we show that amplification of $\mathcal{M}$ in the ground state of the hybrid system is equivalent to a decrease in the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for estimation of an externally-applied flux. Our result therefore demonstrates the increased usefulness of the BEC--SFQ hybrid system as a sensor of ultraweak magnetic fields below the standard quantum limit.

abstract: Quantum entanglement of identical particles is essential in quantum information theory. Yet, its correct determination remains an open issue hindering the general understanding and exploitation of many-particle systems. Operator-based methods have been developed that attempt to overcome the issue. We introduce a state-based method which, as second quantization, does not label identical particles and presents conceptual and technical advances compared to the previous ones. It establishes the quantitative role played by arbitrary wave function overlaps, local measurements and particle nature (bosons or fermions) in assessing entanglement by notions commonly used in quantum information theory for distinguishable particles, like partial trace. Our approach furthermore shows that bringing identical particles into the same spatial location functions as an entangling gate, providing fundamental theoretical support to recent experimental observations with ultracold atoms. These results pave the way to set and interpret experiments for utilizing quantum correlations in realistic scenarios where overlap of particles can count, as in Bose-Einstein condensates, quantum dots and biological molecular aggregates.

abstract: The indeterminacy inherent in quantum measurement is an outstanding character of quantum theory, which manifests itself typically in Heisenberg's error-disturbance uncertainty relation. In the last decade, Heisenberg's relation has been generalized to hold for completely general quantum measurements. Nevertheless, the strength of those relations has not been clarified yet for mixed quantum states. Recently, a new error-disturbance uncertainty relation (EDUR), stringent for generalized input states, has been introduced by one of the present authors. A neutron-optical experiment is carried out to investigate this new relation: it is tested whether error and disturbance of quantum measurements disappear or persist in mixing up the measured ensemble. Our results exhibit that measurement error and disturbance remain constant independent of the degree of mixture. The tightness of the new EDUR is confirmed, thereby validating the theoretical prediction.

abstract: The progress in high-precision spectroscopy requires one to check the accuracy of theoretical models such as the master equation describing spontaneous emission of atoms. For this purpose, we systematically derive a master equation of an atom interacting with the modes of the electromagnetic field which naturally includes interference in the decay channels and fulfills the requirements of the Lindblad theorem without the need of phenomenological assumptions. We apply our model to the 2S-4P transition in atomic Hydrogen and show that interference effects in the dissipative dynamics can alter the lineshape of the spectroscopic line, leading to frequency shifts ranging from few to tens of kHz, depending on the collection angle of the photodetection setup. These results can contribute in understanding spectroscopic measurements in atomic Hydrogen performed in recent experiments for testing the validity of quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: The recent Bell test performed in Delft [B. Hensen et al. Nature 526, 682 (2015), arXiv:1508.05949], claimed as loophole-free, has shown violation of local realism with 96% confidence level. However, the raw data indicate violation of no-signaling principle (microcausality) around 99% confidence level. While violation of local realism is consistent with quantum mechanics, it is not the case of no-signaling. Violation of the latter would be a groundbreaking revolution in physics but also invalidate the conclusion of the Bell theorem, where it no-signaling assumed and must be verified or at least not falsified. If the signature of signaling is believed to be a statistical error, a fair calculation of the Bell parameter gives $S=1.86<2$, in accordance with local realism. Therefore further experimental tests are urgent to clarify with better confidence level whether local realism or no-signaling is violated or none of them.

In contrast to the traditional characterization based on the full Stokes parameters, we experimentally determine the Stokes vector of each excitation manifold separately. Only for states with a fixed photon number do the methods coincide; when the photon number is indefinite, our approach gives a richer and deeper description. By capitalising on the properties of the Husimi Q function, we map this notion onto the Poincare space, providing a full account of the measured squeezing.

abstract: We present a conditionally exactly solvable singular potential for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation which involves the exactly solvable inverse square root potential. Each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the problem is given by a linear combination with non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric functions. Discussing the bound-state wave functions vanishing both at infinity and in the origin, we derive the exact equation for the energy spectrum which is written using two Hermite functions of non-integer order. In specific auxiliary variables this equation becomes a mathematical equation that does not refer to a specific physical context discussed. In the two-dimensional space of these auxiliary variables the roots of this equation draw a countable infinite set of open curves with hyperbolic asymptotes. We present an analytic description of these curves by a transcendental algebraic equation for the involved variables. The intersections of the curves thus constructed with a certain cubic curve provide a highly accurate description of the energy spectrum.

abstract: We report on the state of the art of quantum walk experiments with neutral atoms in state-dependent optical lattices. We demonstrate a novel state-dependent transport technique enabling the control of two spin-selective sublattices in a fully independent fashion. This transport technique allowed us to carry out a test of single-particle quantum interference based on the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality and, more recently, to probe two-particle quantum interference effects with neutral atoms cooled into the motional ground state. These experiments lay the groundwork for the study of discrete-time quantum walks of strongly interacting, indistinguishable particles to demonstrate quantum cellular automata of neutral atoms.

abstract: A dielectric body couples with electromagnetic fields through radiation pressure and electrostrictive forces, which mediate phonon-photon coupling in cavity optomechanics. In a magnetic medium, according to Korteweg-Helmholtz formula, magnetostrictive forces should arise and lead to phonon-magnon interaction. Here we report such a coupled phonon-magnon system based on ferrimagnetic spheres, which we term as cavity magnomechanics, by analogy to cavity optomechanics. Coherent phonon-magnon interactions, including electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption, are demonstrated. Excitingly, due to strong hybridization of magnon and microwave photon modes and their high tunability, our platform exhibits new features including parametric amplification of magnons and phonons, triply resonant photon-magnon-phonon coupling and phonon lasing. Our work demonstrates the fundamental principle of cavity magnomechanics and its application as a new information transduction platform based on coherent coupling between photons, phonons and magnons.

abstract: We study the localization of probability distribution in a discrete quantum random walk on an infinite chain. With a phase defect introduced in any position of the quantum random walk (QRW), we have found that the localization of the probability distribution in the QRW emerges. Different localized behaviors of the probability distribution in the QRW are presented when the defect occupies different positions. Given that the coefficients of the localized stationary eigenstates relies on the coin operator, we reveal that when the defect occupies different positions, the amplitude of localized probability distribution in the QRW exhibits a non-trivial dependence on the coin operator.

The generated states play central roles in linear optics, quantum computation and teleportation. We especially focus on qubit, qutrit and qufit like ECS's and investigate their entanglement by concurrence measure. Moreover, we illustrate decoherence properties of ECS's due to noisy channels, using negativity measure. At the end the effect of noise on monogamy inequality is discussed.

abstract: We investigate how the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) can entangle quantum systems in different coupling regimes of circuit quantum electrodynamics, and show the robustness of such entanglement generation against dissipative effects with current technology. We consider two qubit-resonator systems, which are coupled by a SQUID driven with an external magnetic field, and explore the entire range of coupling regimes between each qubit and its respective resonator. In this scheme, we derive a semianalytic explanation for the entanglement generation between both superconducting qubits when they are coupled to their resonators in the strong coupling (SC) regime. For the ultrastrong (USC) and deep strong coupling (DSC) regimes, we design feasible protocols to generate maximally-entangled polaritonic states.

abstract: A one-dimensional quantum oscillator is monitored by taking repeated position measurements. As a first con- tribution, it is shown that, under a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme applied to a system initially at the ground state, (i) the observed sequence of measurements (quantum tracks) corresponding to a single experiment converges to a limit point, and that (ii) the limit point is random over the ensemble of the experiments, being distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with a variance at most equal to the ground-state variance. As a second contribution, the richer scenario where the oscillator is coupled with a frozen (i.e., at the ground state) ensemble of independent quantum oscillators is considered. A sharply different behavior emerges: under the same measurement scheme, here we observe that the measurement sequences are essentially divergent. Such a rigorous statistical analysis of the sequential measurement process might be useful for characterizing the main quantities that are currently used for inference, manipulation, and monitoring of many quantum systems. Several interesting properties of the quantum tracks evolution, as well as of the associated (quantum) threshold crossing times, are discussed and the dependence upon the main system parameters (e.g., the choice of the measurement sampling time, the degree of interaction with the environment, the measurement device accuracy) is elucidated. At a more fundamental level, it is seen that, as an application of basic quantum mechanics principles, a sharp difference exists between the intrinsic randomness unavoidably present in any quantum system, and the extrinsic randomness arising from the environmental coupling, i.e., the randomness induced by an external source of disturbance.

abstract: In typical discrete-time quantum walk algorithms, one measures the position of the walker while ignoring its internal spin/coin state. Rather than neglecting the information in this internal state, we show that additionally measuring it doubles the success probability of many quantum spatial search algorithms. For example, this allows Grover's unstructured search problem to be solved with certainty, rather than with probability 1/2 if only the walker's position is measured, so the additional measurement yields a search algorithm that is twice as fast as without it, on average. Thus the internal state of discrete-time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to improve algorithms. Furthermore, we determine conditions for which spatial search problems are amenable to this doubling of the success probability, and this involves diagrammatically analyzing search using degenerate perturbation theory and deriving a useful formula for how the quantum walk acts in its reduced subspace.

abstract: In this work we use the extremization method of various information-theoretic measures (Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy) for $d$-dimensional quantum systems, which complementary describe the spreading of the quantum states of natural systems. Under some given constraints, usually one or two radial expectation values, this variational method allows us to determine an extremum-entropy distribution, which is the \textit{least-biased} one to characterize the state among all those compatible with the known data. Then we use it, together with the spin-dependent uncertainty-like relations of Daubechies-Thakkar type, as a tool to obtain relationships between the position and momentum radial expectation values of the type $\langle r^{\alpha}\rangle^{\frac{k}{\alpha}}\langle p^k\rangle\geq f(k,\alpha,q,N), q=2s+1$, for $d$-dimensional systems of $N$ fermions with spin $s$. The resulting uncertainty-like products, which take into account both spatial and spin degrees of freedom of the fermionic constituents of the system, are shown to often improve the best corresponding relationships existing in the literature.

abstract: Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a powerful tool for a wide variety of measurements, has been realized with Bose-Einstein condensates in recent experiments. In this report, we propose and analyze a realizable scheme for performing a Heisenberg-limited Mach-Zehnder interferometry with dipolar spin-1 condensate. Based upon adiabatic processes of sweeping the transverse magnetic field, we demonstrate a perfect phase transition, which accomplishes the beam splitter, phase shifter and recombiner as for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The attractive dipolar interaction ensures the existence of a path-entangled state which enhances the phase measurement precision to the Heisenberg limit. We also discuss the spin-$1$ squeezing induced in the adiabatic passage and show that the squeezing parameter attains its minimal value near the point of saturation field.

abstract: Relativistic quantum metrology provides an optimal strategy for the estimation of parameters encoded in quantum fields in flat and curved spacetime. These parameters usually correspond to physical quantities of interest such as proper times, accelerations, gravitational field strengths, among other spacetime parameters. The precise estimation of these parameters can lead to novel applications in gravimeters, spacetime probes and gravitational wave detectors. Previous work in this direction only considered pure probe states. In realistic situations, however, probe states are mixed. In this paper, we provide a framework for the computation of optimal precision bounds for mixed single- and two-mode Gaussian states within quantum field theory. This enables the estimation of spacetime parameters in case the field states are initially at finite temperature.

abstract: Tunneling is often claimed to be the key mechanism underlying possible speedups in quantum optimization via quantum annealing (QA), especially for problems featuring a cost function with tall and thin barriers. We present and analyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for these problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be understood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical potential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then provide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is short and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where tunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime. However, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution involving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided level-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic QA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not unique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an exponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a classical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic QA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic transitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling and classical spin vector dynamics.

abstract: We discuss the abstract structure of sequential weak measurement (WM) of general observables. In all orders, the sequential WM correlations without post-selection yield the corresponding correlations of the Wigner function, offering direct quantum tomography through the moments of the canonical variables. Spin-half sequential measurements are, on the contrary, constrained kinematically, they are equivalent with single WMs. In sequential WMs with post-selection, a new anomaly occurs, different from the weak value anomaly of single WMs. In particular, the spread of polarization $\hat\sigma$, as measured in double WMs of $\hat\sigma$, will diverge for certain orthogonal pre- and post-selected states.

abstract: The GBAR experiment will time the free fall of cold antihydrogen atoms dropped onto an annihilation plate to test the universality of free fall on antimatter. In this contribution, we study the quantum reflection of the anti-atom resulting from the Casimir-Polder attraction to the plate. We evaluate the Casimir-Polder potential and the associated quantum reflection amplitudes and find that reflection is enhanced for weaker potentials. A Liouville transformation of the Schr\"odinger equation is used to map the quantum reflection problem onto an equivalent problem of scattering on a barrier, leading to an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon.

abstract: A general expression for the local power of a quantum system is derived. Defined as the time rate of change of the kinetic energy evaluated in a finite volume $\Omega$ of the physical space, the local power exhibits contributions from both many-body classical and quantum correlations. Significantly, quantum correlations are manifested through the presence of non-local sources/sinks of power and through the action of local forces with no classical counterpart. The soundness of our results is proved along three limits of particular relevance: the closed-system limit ($\Omega \to \infty$), the limit of non-interacting particles, and invoking classicality. Interestingly, we show that quantum fingerprints arise on the local power expression only when the volume $\Omega$ is finite. Otherwise we recover a classical-like expression. This work could be of particular interest in the field of nanoelectronics, where the realization of a zero-power technology constitutes a long standing challenge.

abstract: Nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger model is quantised and exactly solved using the canonical framework. It is found that the usual canonical quantisation of the model leads to a theory with pathological inner product. This problem is resolved by constructing another inner product over the vector space of the theory. The resultant theory is found to be identical to that of nonrelativistic bosons with delta function interaction potential, devoid of any nonlocality. The exact eigenstates are found using the Bethe ansatz technique.

abstract: Multiparty quantum states are useful for a variety of quantum information and computation protocols. We define a multiparty entanglement measure based on local measurements on the multiparty quantum state, and an entanglement measure averaged on the post-measurement ensemble. Using the generalized geometric measure as the measure of multipartite entanglement for the ensemble, we demonstrate, in the case of several well-known classes of multipartite pure states, that the localized multipartite entanglement can exceed the entanglement present in the original state. We also show that measurement over multiple parties may be beneficial in enhancing localizable multipartite entanglement. We point out that, compared to the generalized geometric measure, localizable generalized geometric measure works better in signaling quantum critical phenomena occurring in well-known quantum spin models even when considerable finite-size effect is present in the system.

abstract: Quantum light-matter interfaces are at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. Quantum memories for photons are a prominent consequence of superb control over interactions between light and matter, where non-classical states of photons are mapped onto stationary matter states and preserved for subsequent retrieval into photonic excitations. The ability of quantum memories to synchronize probabilistic events makes them a key component in quantum repeaters and quantum computation based on linear optics. This has motivated several groups to dedicate theoretical and experimental research to develop quantum memory devices. In recent years, exciting new applications and more advanced developments of quantum memories have proliferated. In this review, we outline some of the emerging applications of quantum memories in optical signal processing, quantum computation, and nonlinear optics. We review recent experimental and theoretical developments, and their impacts on more advanced photonic quantum technologies based on quantum memories.

abstract: We describe the quantum dynamics of a magnetic rigid rotor in the mesoscopic scale where the Einstein-De Haas effect is predominant. In particular, we consider a single-domain magnetic nanoparticle with uniaxial anisotropy in a magnetic trap. Starting from the basic Hamiltonian of the system under the macrospin approximation, we derive a bosonized Hamiltonian describing the center-of-mass motion, the total angular momentum, and the macrospin degrees of freedom of the particle treated as a rigid body. This bosonized Hamiltonian can be approximated by a simple quadratic Hamiltonian that captures the rich physics of a nanomagnet tightly confined in position, nearly not spinning, and with its macrospin anti-aligned to the magnetic field. The theoretical tools derived and used here can be applied to other quantum mechanical rigid rotors.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.04127
abstract: In the well-studied (2,2,2) Bell experiment consisting of two parties, two measurement settings per party, and two possible outcomes per setting, it is known that if the experiment obeys no-signaling constraints, then the set of admissible experimental probability distributions is fully characterized as the convex hull of 24 distributions: 8 Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes and 16 local deterministic distributions. Here, we refine this result to show that in the (2,2,2) case, any nonlocal nonsignaling distribution can always be uniquely expressed as a convex combination of exactly one PR box and (up to) eight local deterministic distributions. In this representation each PR box will always occur only with a fixed set of eight local deterministic distributions with which it is affiliated. This decomposition has multiple applications: we demonstrate an analytical proof that the minimum detection efficiency for which nonlocality can be observed is $\eta>2/3$ even for theories constrained only by the no-signaling principle, and we develop new algorithms that speed the calculation of important statistical functions of Bell test data. Finally, we enumerate the vertices of the no-signaling polytope for the (2, n, 2) ``chained Bell'' scenario and find that similar decomposition results are possible in this general case. Here, our results allow us to prove the optimality of a bound, derived in Barrett et al. [1], on the proportion of local theories in a local/nonlocal mixture that can be inferred from the experimental violation of a chained Bell inequality.

abstract: Self-testing allows us to determine, through classical interaction only, whether some players in a non-local game share particular quantum states. Most work on self-testing has concentrated on developing tests for small states like one pair of maximally entangled qubits, or on tests where there is a separate player for each qubit, as in a graph state. Here we consider the case of testing many maximally entangled pairs of qubits shared between two players. Previously such a test was shown where testing is sequential, i.e., one pair is tested at a time. Here we consider the parallel case where all pairs are tested simultaneously, giving considerably more power to dishonest players. We derive sufficient conditions for a self-test for many maximally entangled pairs of qubits shared between two players and also two constructions for self-tests where all pairs are tested simultaneously.

abstract: In this work we describe a new kind of quantum scars, or eigenstates resembling classical periodic orbits, caused by randomly scattered impurities in two-dimensional quantum wells. These very strong scars are not a result of periodic orbits in the perturbed system, as in ordinary scar theory. Instead, they are supported by classical resonances in the unperturbed system and the resulting quantum near-degeneracy. Even in the case of a large number of randomly scattered impurities, the scars prefer distinct orientations that extremize the overlap with the impurities. We demonstrate that the preferred orientations can be used for highly efficient transport of quantum wave packets across the perturbed potential landscape. Assisted by the scars, wave-packet recurrences are significantly stronger than in the unperturbed system. Together with the controllability of the preferred orientations, this property may be useful for quantum transport applications.

abstract: Conventional quantum mechanics describes a pre- and post-selected system in terms of virtual (Feynman) paths via which the final state can be reached. In the absence of probabilities, a weak measurement (WM) determines the probability amplitudes for the paths involved. The weak values (VW) can be identified with these amplitudes, or their linear combinations. This allows us to explain the "unusual" properties of the VW, and avoid the "paradoxes" often associated with the WM.

Spacetime curvature affects the frequency distribution of a photon sent from Earth to a satellite, and this change encodes parameters of the spacetime. This allows us to achieve precise measurements of parameters of Earth such as its Schwarzschild radius and equatorial angular velocity. We then are able to provide a comparison with the state-of-the-art in parameter estimation obtained through classical means. Extensions and future directions are also discussed.

abstract: We study mechanisms that allow one to synchronize the quantum phase of two qubits relative to a fixed basis. Starting from one qubit in a fixed reference state and the other in an unknown state, we find that contrary to the impossibility of perfect quantum cloning, the quantum-phase can be synchronized perfectly through a joined unitary operation. When both qubits are initially in a pure unknown state, perfect quantum-phase synchronization through unitary operations becomes impossible. In this situation we determine the optimal average quantum-phase synchronization fidelity, the distribution of relative phases and fidelities, and identify quantum circuits that enable this optimal fidelity. We show that a subset of these optimal quantum circuits achieve perfect quantum-phase synchronization for a class of unknown initial states restricted to the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere.

abstract: We study the problem of remote control of quantum correlations (discord) in a sub-system of two qubits (receiver) via the parameters of the initial state of another sub-system of three qubits (sender) connected with the receiver by the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 chain. We propose two parameters characterizing the creatable correlations. The first one is the discord between the receiver and the rest of spin-1/2 chain, it concerns the mutual correlations between these two subsystems. The second parameter is the discord between the two nodes of the receiver and describes the correlations inside of the receiver. We study the dependence of these two discords on the inhomogeneity degree of spin chain.

abstract: Entanglement is a key resource of quantum science for tasks that require it to be shared among participants. Within atomic, condensed matter and photonic many-body systems the distribution and sharing of entanglement is of particular importance for information processing by progressively larger and larger quantum networks. Here we report a singly-bipartitioned qubit entanglement inequality that applies to any N-party qubit pure state and is completely tight. It provides the first prescription for a direct calculation of the amount of entanglement sharing that is possible among N qubit parties. A geometric representation of the measure is easily visualized via polytopes within entanglement hypercubes.

abstract: We study the entanglement structure of lattice gauge theories from the local operational point of view, and, similar to Soni and Trivedi (arXiv:1510.07455), we show that the usual entanglement entropy for a spatial bipartition can be written as the sum of an undistillable gauge part and of another part corresponding to the LOCC distillable entanglement, which is obtained by depolarizing the local superselection sectors. We demonstrate that the distillable entanglement is zero for pure abelian gauge theories in the weak coupling limit, while it is in general nonzero for the nonabelian case. We also consider gauge theories with matter, and show in a perturbative approach how area laws -- including a topological correction -- emerge for the distillable entanglement.

abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm (SFA), by its ability to efficiently factor large numbers, has the potential to undermine contemporary encryption. At its heart is a process called order finding, which quantum mechanics lets us perform efficiently. SFA thus consists of a quantum order finding algorithm (QOFA), bookended by classical routines which, given the order, return the factors. But, with probability up to $1/2$, these classical routines fail, and QOFA must be rerun. We modify these routines using elementary results in number theory, improving the likelihood that they return the factors. We present a new quantum factoring algorithm based on QOFA which is better than SFA at factoring safe semiprimes, an important class of numbers used in RSA encryption (and reputed to be the hardest to factor). With just one call to QOFA, our algorithm almost always factors safe semiprimes. As well as a speed-up, improving efficiency gives our algorithm other, practical advantages: unlike SFA, it does not need a randomly picked input, making it simpler to construct in the lab; and in the (unlikely) case of failure, the same circuit can be rerun, without modification. We consider generalising this result to other cases, although we do not find a simple extension, and conclude that SFA is still the best algorithm for general numbers (non safe semiprimes, in other words). Even so, we present some simple number theoretic tricks for improving SFA in this case.

abstract: Room-temperature fluorescence detection of the nitrogen-vacancy center electronic spin typically has low signal to noise, requiring long experiments to reveal an averaged signal. Here, we present a simple approach to analysis of time-resolved fluorescence data that permits an improvement in measurement precision through signal processing alone. Applying our technique to experimental data reveals an improvement in signal to noise equivalent to a 14% increase in photon collection efficiency. We further explore the dependence of the signal to noise ratio on excitation power, and analyze our results using a rate equation model. Our results provide a rubric for optimizing fluorescence spin detection, which has direct implications for improving precision of nitrogen-vacancy-based sensors.

abstract: With technology pushing into increasingly quantum-mechanical regimes, there are many motivations for us to deepen the connections between quantum information science and thermodynamics. One recent approach has been via resource-theoretic formulations, and in particular formulations that try to capture genuinely quantum mechanical properties within a thermodynamic context. Here we discuss how the set of free states of thermodynamic theories is strongly constrained in the presence of a microscopic conservation law; we show that for the simplest case of a Hamiltonian with no other conserved quantities the only non-trivial resource theories are either thermal operations or one of a range of coherence theories. We next discuss certain issues that arise when one introduces conserved charges into thermodynamic resource theories. Specifically we consider both commuting and non-commuting conserved charges, and highlight subtleties that exist between dynamical equilibration accounts, maximum entropy approaches and resource formulations. We conclude by constructing Landauer erasure bounds for these conserved charges. For this, we find trade-offs can exist between the energetic and other conserved charges erasure costs. It is found that the particular Landauer erasure bound we obtain is not sensitive to whether the charges commute or not.

abstract: Single-crystal diamond cavity optomechanical devices are a promising example of a hybrid quantum system: by coupling mechanical resonances to both light and electron spins, they can enable new ways for photons to control solid state qubits. However, creating devices from high quality bulk diamond chips is challenging. Here we demonstrate single-crystal diamond cavity optomechanical devices that can enable photon-phonon-spin coupling. Cavity optomechanical coupling to $2\,\text{GHz}$ frequency ($f_\text{m}$) mechanical resonances is observed. In room temperature ambient conditions, the resonances have a record combination of low dissipation ($Q_\text{m} > 9000$) and high frequency, with $Q_\text{m}\cdot f_\text{m} \sim 1.9\times10^{13}$ sufficient for room temperature single phonon coherence. The system is nearly sideband resolved, and radiation pressure is used to excite $\sim 31\,\text{pm}$ amplitude mechanical self-oscillations that can drive diamond color centre electron spin transitions.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.04516
abstract: The issue of realization of the transfer functions of Linear Quantum Stochastic Systems (LQSSs) is of fundamental importance for the practical applications of such systems, especially as coherent controllers of other quantum systems. So far, most works that addressed this problem have used cascade realizations. In this work, a new method is proposed, where the transfer function of a LQSS is realized by a series of a pre-processing linear static network, a reduced LQSS, and a post-processing linear static network. The introduction of the pre- and post-processing static networks leaves an intermediate reduced LQSS with a simple input/output structure, that is realized by a concatenation of simple cavities. A feedback connection of the cavities through a linear static network is used to produce the correct dynamics for the reduced system. The resulting realization has a nice modular design, and provides a structural picture of the system, as well. The mathematical tool that allows for the construction of this realization, is an SVD-like decomposition for doubled-up matrices in Krein spaces. Illustrative examples are provided for the theory developed.

abstract: We study cross-Kerr (CK) effect on an optomechanical system driven by two-tone fields. We show that in the presence of the CK effect, a bistable behavior of the mean photon number in the cavity becomes more robust against the fluctuations of the frequency detuning between the cavity mode and the control field. The bistability can also be turned into a multi-stability within the experimentally accessible range of the system parameters. Also, we find that the symmetric profile of the optomechanically induced transparency is broken and the zero-absorption point is shifted in the presence of the CK effect. This shift can be used to measure the strength of the CK effect, and the asymmetric absorption profiles can be employed to engineer a high quality factor of the cavity.

abstract: We model the bang-bang optimization protocol as a shortcut to adiabaticity in the ground-state preparation of an ion-trap-based quantum simulator. Compared to a locally adiabatic evolution, the bang-bang protocol produces a somewhat lower ground-state probability, but its implementation is so much simpler than the locally adiabatic approach, that it remains an excellent choice to use for maximizing ground-state preparation in systems that cannot be solved with conventional computers. We describe how one can optimize the shortcut and provide specific details for how it can be implemented with current ion-trap-based quantum simulators.

abstract: We begin with the simple model of phase sychronization in open classical nonlinear system which is represented in the language of angular momentum variables. After that we propose the relevant quantum counterpart of this system. Using the appropriate Lindblad master equation for the density matrix of two qubit realization of such system we have revealed that stationary state of this composite system is pure and entangled with small dispersion of phase observable. We believe that such curious connection between entangled stationary states of quantum composite system and phase sychronization between its subsystems may be typical for rather wide class of similar nonlinear open systems as well.

abstract: Since the early work by Ashkin in 1970, optical trapping has become one of the most powerful tools for manipulating small particles, such as micron sized beads or single atoms. The optical trapping mechanism is based on the interaction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In atom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed optical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic particles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two different regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any direct link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one being the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other one being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum optics. Here we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing artificial atoms, so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers, both regimes of optical trapping can be observed at the same time even in a noisy liquid environment. For wavelengths in the vicinity of the zero-phonon line transition of the color centers, we observe a significant modification ($10\%$) of the overall trapping strength. Most remarkably, our experimental findings suggest that owing to the large number of artificial atoms, collective effects greatly contribute to the observed trapping strength modification. Our approach adds the powerful atomic-physics toolbox to the field of nano-manipulation.

abstract: Cloud computing system based on data centers has recently attracted considerable attention. In that system, all data are communicated via a high speed optical network between a customer and data center or between data centers. There is a serious threat so called "Eavesdropper data center business", which means the eavesdropper can get all data from the transmission line and sell specific data selected by the protocol analyzer to malicious people who want to get the secret data. So we need to consider cyber attack against Layer-1 (physical layer). Quantum cryptography has been developed to protect such an attack. In order to apply such a new security technologies, the communication performance is very important as well as its security, because the data speed is more than several Gbit/sec. This research note III will discuss communication performances of quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum enigma cipher, and explaines that QKD based on single photon signals cannot realize appropriate data speed, but quantum enigma cipher can.

abstract: We derive several uncertainty relations for two arbitrary unitary operators acting on physical states of any Hilbert space (finite or infinite dimensional). We show that our bounds are tighter in various cases than the ones existing in the current literature. With regard to the minimum uncertainty state for the cases of both the finite as well as the infinite dimensional unitary operators, we derive the minimum uncertainty state equation by the analytic method. As an application of this, we find a new uncertainty lower bound for the three Pauli matrices. Also, the higher dimensional limit of these uncertainty relations is explored, whereby it is shown that for a certain class of states the uncertainty relations of the unitary operators as well as their minimum uncertainty states reduce to those of the corresponding Hermitian operators. From an operational point of view, we show that the uncertainty in the unitary operator is directly related to the visibility of quantum interference in an interferometer where one arm of the interferometer is affected by a unitary operator. This shows a new principle of preparation uncertainty, i.e., quantum states cannot be prepared which will display maximum visibility in the interference for two non-commuting unitary operators, i.e., the amount of visibility for two general unitary operators is non-trivially lower bounded.

abstract: The conventional Quantum Fourier Transform, with exponential speedup compared to the classical Fast Fourier Transform, has played an important role in quantum computation as a vital part of many quantum algorithms (most prominently, the Shor's factoring algorithm). However, situations arise where it is not sufficient to encode the Fourier coefficients within the quantum amplitudes, for example in the implementation of control operations that depend on Fourier coefficients. In this paper, we detail a new quantum algorithm to encode the Fourier coefficients in the computational basis, with success probability $1-\delta$ and desired precision $\epsilon$. Its time complexity %$\mathcal{O}\big((\log N)^2\log(N/\delta)/\epsilon)\big)$ depends polynomially on $\log(N)$, where $N$ is the problem size, and linearly on $\log(1/\delta)$ and $1/\epsilon$. We also discuss an application of potential practical importance, namely the simulation of circulant Hamiltonians.

abstract: This paper explores the entanglement dynamics generated by interacting two-particle quantum walks on degree-regular and -irregular graphs. We performed spectral analysis of the time-evolution of both the particle probability distribution and the entanglement between the two particles for various interaction strength. While the particle probability distributions are stable and not sensitive to perturbations in the interaction strength, the entanglement dynamics are found to be much more sensitive to system variations. This property may be utilised to probe small differences in the system parameters.

abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forms a fundamental element of quantum mechanics. Uncertainty relations in terms of entropies were initially proposed to deal with conceptual shortcomings in the original formulation of the uncertainty principle, and hence play an important role in quantum foundations. More recently, entropic uncertainty relations have emerged as the central ingredient in the security analysis of almost all quantum cryptographic protocols, ranging from quantum key distribution to two-party quantum cryptography. This review surveys entropic uncertainty relations that capture Heisenberg's idea that the results of incompatible measurements are impossible to predict, covering both finite- and infinite-dimensional measurements. These ideas are then extended to incorporate quantum correlations between the observed object and its environment, allowing for a variety of recent, more general formulations of the uncertainty principle. Finally various applications are discussed, ranging from entanglement witnessing to wave-particle duality to quantum cryptography.

abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme for the generation of a non-classical single-mode motional state of a mechanical resonator (MR) in the three-mode optomechanical systems, in which two optical modes of the cavities are linearly coupled to each other and one mechanical mode of the MR is optomechanically coupled to the two optical modes with the same coupling strength simultaneously. One cavity is driven by a coherent laser light. By properly tuning the frequency of the weak driving field, we obtain engineered Liouvillian superoperator via engineering the selective interaction Hamiltonian confined to the Fock subspaces. In this case, the motional state of the MR can be prepared into a non-Gaussian state, which possesses the sub-Poisson statistics although its Wigner function is positive.

abstract: Self-testing refers to the possibility of characterizing uniquely (up to local isometries) the state and measurements contained in quantum devices, based only on the observed input-output statistics. Already in the basic case of the two-qubit singlet, self-testing is not unique: the two known criteria (the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality and the Mayers-Yao correlations) are not equivalent. It is unknown how many criteria there are. In this paper, we find the whole set of criteria for the ideal self-testing of singlet with two measurements and two outcomes on each side: it coincides with all the extremal points of the quantum set that can be obtained by measuring the singlet.

Here we show a critical divergence of the correlation time and slowing down of quantum fluctuations originating from the feedback mechanism responsible of the MOPO threshold.

abstract: Given any covariance matrix corresponding to a so-called pure Gaussian state, a linear quantum system can be designed to achieve the assigned covariance matrix. In most cases, however, one might obtain a system that is difficult to realize in practice. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a special class of linear quantum systems, i.e., systems with diagonal passive Hamiltonian and a single dissipative channel. The practical implementation of such a system would be relatively simple. We then parametrize the class of pure Gaussian state covariance matrices that can be achieved by this particular type of linear quantum system.

abstract: The theory of invariants of locally symmetric potentials, as developed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 050403 (2014), is applied to static lattices and extended to periodically driven quantum systems. A relation of these symmetry induced invariants to the presence of time-reversal invariance and/or probability current conservation is established within a transfer matrix approach. By means of the invariants, we demonstrate how the positions of local deviations from translation or inversion symmetry in lattice potentials can be reliably extracted from the wave functions in the static as well as driven case. The obtained insights into the wave functions are exploited for a symmetry-based convergence check which is applicable if either local translational or parity symmetry hold within some domain of the system.

abstract: The X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) can enable diffractive structural determination of protein crystals or single molecules that are too small and radiation-sensitive for conventional X-ray analysis. However the electronic form factor could have been modified during the ultrashort X-ray pulse due to photoionization and electron cascade caused by the intense X-ray pulse. For general X-ray imaging techniques, to minimize radiation damage effect is of major concern to ensure faithful reconstruction of the structure. Here we show that a radiation damage free diffraction can be achieved with an atomic spatial resolution, by using X-ray parametric down-conversion (PDC), and two-color biphoton ghost imaging. We illustrate that formation of the diffractive patterns satisfies a condition analogous to the Bragg equation, with a resolution that could be as fine as the lattice length scale of several Angstrom. Because the samples are illuminated by the optical photons of low energy, they can be free of radiation damage.

abstract: The relativistic quantum dynamics of an electrically charged particle subject to the Klein-Gordon oscillator and the Coulomb potential is investigated. By searching for relativistic bound states, a particular quantum effect can be observed: a dependence of the angular frequency of the Klein-Gordon oscillator on the quantum numbers of the system. The meaning of this behaviour of the angular frequency is that only some specific values of the angular frequency of the Klein-Gordon oscillator are permitted in order to obtain bound state solutions. As an example, we obtain both the angular frequency and the energy level associated with the ground state of the relativistic system. Further, we analyse the behaviour of an electrically charged particle subject to the Klein-Gordon oscillator, the Coulomb potential and a linear scalar potential.

abstract: A spin system on a lattice can usually be modelled at large scales by an effective quantum field theory. A key mathematical result relating the two descriptions is the quantum central limit theorem, which shows that certain spin observables satisfy an algebra of bosonic fields under certain conditions. Here, we give an information-theoretical argument explaining why these observables, and those conditions, are the relevant ones for an observer with certain limited abilities to resolve spatial locations as well as spin values. This is done by computing the asymptotic behaviour of a distinguishability metric as function of the resolution parameters. The relevant observables characterise the state perturbations whose distinguishability does not decay too fast as a function of spatial or spin resolution.

Our approach is optimal since it gives a tight lower bound on the quantum Fisher information for the given incomplete information. We apply our method to the results of various multi-particle quantum states prepared in experiments with photons and trapped ions, as well as to spin-squeezed states and Dicke states realized in cold gases.

Quantum nonlocality arises as a natural consequence of this geometry. We also examine the ontology of the wavefunction in this framework. In particular, we show how entanglement swapping in spacetime invalidates the preparation assumption of the PBR theorem.

abstract: We consider the qubit initial state preparation due to the nonselective measurements on an overcomplete basis, when the number of outcomes $N=3$. To be specific, we have chosen the dephasing model and applied the conditions for a post-measurement state to ensure a gradual coherence enhancement at the initial stage of the system evolution. It is shown that contrary to the von Neumann-L\"uders projection scheme with $N=2$, the most mixed post-measurement state of the qubit in the general case can depend on the bath temperature. This remarkable feature allows one to consider a ``temperature controlled'' initial purification of the open quantum system. We also consider some kinds of the repeated nonselective measurements from the viewpoint of an eventual system purification and analyze the important peculiarities of such schemes.

abstract: We describe a feasible logic Bell-state analysis protocol by employing the logic entanglement to be the robust concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state. This protocol only uses polarization beam splitters and half-wave plates, which are available in current experimental technology. We can conveniently identify two of the logic Bell states. This protocol can be easily generalized to the arbitrary C-GHZ state analysis. We can also distinguish two $N$-logic-qubit C-GHZ states. As the previous theory and experiment both showed that the C-GHZ state has the robustness feature, this logic Bell-state analysis and C-GHZ state analysis may be essential for linear-optical quantum computation protocols whose building blocks are logic-qubit entangled state.

abstract: We explore quantum nonlocality in one of the simplest bipartite scenarios. Several new facet-defining Bell inequalities for the {[3 3 3] [3 3 3]} scenario are obtained with their quantum violations analyzed in details. Surprisingly, all these inequalities involving only genuine ternary-outcome measurements can be violated maximally by some two-qubit entangled state, such as the maximally entangled two-qubit state. This gives further evidence that in analyzing the quantum violation of Bell inequalities, or in the application of the latter to device-independent quantum information processing tasks, the commonly-held wisdom of equating the local Hilbert space dimension of the optimal state with the number of measurement outcomes is not necessarily justifiable. In addition, when restricted to the minimal qubit subspace, it can be shown that one of these Bell inequalities requires non-projective measurements to attain maximal quantum violation, thereby giving the first example of a facet-defining Bell inequality where genuine positive-operator-valued measure is relevant. We experimentally demonstrate the quantum violation of this and two other Bell inequalities for this scenario using energy-time entangled photon pairs. Using the obtained measurement statistics, we demonstrate how device-independent characterization of the underlying resource can be achieved. In particular, we discuss how one may get around the fact that, due to finite-size effects, raw measurement statistics typically violate the non-signaling condition.

abstract: Quantum process tomography, the standard procedure to characterize any quantum channel in nature, is affected by a circular argument: in order to characterize the channel, the tomographic preparation and measurement need in turn to be already characterized. We break this loop by designing an operational framework able to optimally characterize any given unknown quantum channel in a device-independent fashion, namely, by only looking at its input-output statistics, under the sole assumption that quantum theory is valid. We provide explicit solutions, in closed form, for practically relevant cases such as the erasure, depolarizing, and amplitude-damping channels.

abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum-key-distribution (QKD)-based quantum private query (QPQ) protocol utilizing single-photon signal of multiple optical pulses. It maintains the advantages of the QKD-based QPQ, i.e., easy to implement and loss tolerant. In addition, different from the situations in the previous QKD-based QPQ protocols, in our protocol, the number of the items an honest user will obtain is always one and the failure probability is always zero. This characteristic not only improves the stability (in the sense that, ignoring the noise and the attack, the protocol would always succeed), but also benefits the privacy of the database (since the database will no more reveal additional secrets to the honest users). Furthermore, for the user's privacy, the proposed protocol is cheat sensitive, and for security of the database, we obtain an upper bound for the leaked information of the database in theory.

abstract: The concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state has great potential application in the future quantum network, for it is robust to the decoherence in a noisy environment. In the paper, we propose a complete C-GHZ state analysis protocol with the help of some auxiliary single atoms trapped in the low-quality cavities. In the protocol, we essentially make the parity check for the photonic states based on the photonic Faraday rotation effect, and complete the analysis task combined with the Hadamard operation and single qubit measurement. The success probability of our protocol can reach 100\% in principle, and the number of physical qubit encoded in each logic qubit does not affect the analysis. Our analysis protocol may have its practical application in future long-distance quantum communication.

These quantities are expressed as functions of the singular values of a measurement operator corresponding to the obtained outcome. As an example, we consider a class of quantum measurements with highly degenerate singular values to discuss tradeoffs among information, fidelity, and reversibility. The tradeoffs are at the level of a single outcome, in the sense that the quantities pertain to each single outcome rather than the average over all possible outcomes.

abstract: With the fast growing interest in quantum technologies it is becoming increasingly important to engineer quantum states for specific applications. We design an evolutionary algorithm for this purpose that produces optical quantum states which have any desired properties and can be created with current technology. The algorithm is applied to the field of optical quantum metrology with the goal of finding states that can measure a phase shift to a high precision. With this method we find states that show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, and can measure with a precision that beats the shot noise limit by over a factor of 4. Furthermore, the states we find can be made experimentally with today's technology, and retain their advantage in the presence of moderate to high photon losses.

abstract: We study the classical and quantum values of one- and two-party linear games, an important class of unique games that generalizes the well-known XOR games to the case of non-binary outcomes. We introduce a ``constraint graph" associated to such a game, with the constraints defining the linear game represented by an edge-coloring of the graph. We use the graph-theoretic characterization to relate the task of finding equivalent games to the notion of signed graphs and switching equivalence from graph theory. We relate the problem of computing the classical value of single-party anti-correlation XOR games to finding the edge bipartization number of a graph, which is known to be MaxSNP hard, and connect the computation of the classical value of more general XOR-d games to the identification of specific cycles in the graph. We construct an orthogonality graph of the game from the constraint graph and study its Lov\'{a}sz theta number as a general upper bound on the quantum value even in the case of single-party contextual XOR-d games. Linear games possess appealing properties for use in device-independent applications such as randomness of the local correlated outcomes in the optimal quantum strategy. We study the possibility of obtaining quantum algebraic violation of these games, and show that no finite linear game possesses the property of pseudo-telepathy leaving the frequently used chained Bell inequalities as the natural candidates for such applications. We also show this lack of pseudo-telepathy for multi-party XOR-type inequalities involving two-body correlation functions.

abstract: Bell non-local correlations cannot be naturally explained in a fixed causal structure. This serves as a motivation for considering models where no global assumption is made beyond logical consistency. The assumption of a fixed causal order between a set of parties, together with free randomness, implies device-independent inequalities --- just as the assumption of locality does. It is known that local validity of quantum theory is consistent with violating such inequalities. Moreover, for three parties or more, even the (stronger) assumption of local classical probability theory plus logical consistency allows for violating causal inequalities. Here, we show that a classical environment (with which the parties interact), possibly containing loops, is logically consistent if and only if whatever the involved parties do, there is exactly one fixed-point, the latter being representable as a mixture of deterministic fixed-points. We further show that the non-causal view allows for a model of computation strictly more powerful than computation in a world of fixed causal orders.

abstract: In this paper we investigate mode nonorthogonal properties and their effects on the sound power attenuation in a waveguide with impedance boundary conditions. By introducing two quantities: self-nonorthogonality $K_p$, which measures the nonorthogonality between left and right eigenfunctions of a mode, and mutual-nonorthogonality $S_{ij}$, which measures the nonorthogonality between modes $i$ and $j$, two opposite limiting cases are clearly identified in the boundary impedance $\mathbb Z$ plane: one is non-dissipation, i.e., acoustic rigid, pressure-release, and purely reactive impedance; the other is Cremer's optimum impedances which are exceptional points --- a subject has attracted much attention in recent years in different physical domains. Variations along an arbitrary path in the complex boundary impedance plane, $K_p$ and $S_{i,j}$ varies between the two opposite extremes. It is found that $K_p$ and $S_{i,j}$ play crucial roles in sound power attenuation.

abstract: We consider a family of quantum channels characterized by the fact that certain (in general nonorthogonal) Pure states at the channel entrance are mapped to (tensor) Products of Pure states (PPP, hence ``pcubed'') at the complementary outputs (the main output and the ``environment'') of the channel. The pcubed construction, a reformulation of the twisted-diagonal procedure, can be used to produce a large class of degradable quantum channels; degradable channels of are interest because their quantum capacities are easy to calculate. Several known types of degradable channels are either pcubed channels, or subchannels (employing a subspace of the channel entrance), or continuous limits of pcubed channels. The pcubed construction also yields channels which are neither degradable nor antidegradable (i.e., the complement of a degradable channel). Determining whether a pcubed channel is degradable (or antidegradable) is quite straightforward given the pure input and output states that characterize the channel. Conjugate degradable pcubed channels are always degradable.

abstract: Active error correction of topological quantum codes - in particular the toric code - remains one of the most viable routes to large scale quantum information processing. In this work, we introduce the concept of a dynamical decoder as a promising route for achieving fault-tolerant quantum memories. We analyze a specific dynamical decoder based on a discrete time cellular automaton decoder and provide evidence of a threshold above 0.05% with measurement errors. Without measurement errors, the threshold increases by a factor of roughly 1.5. We stress that (asynchronous) dynamical decoding gives rise to a Markovian dissipative process, hence equating cellular automaton decoding to a fully dissipative topological quantum memory, which removes errors continuously. Finally, we analyze the required resources, and speculate about an ideal constant resource dynamical decoder.

abstract: Long-distance quantum communication relies on the ability to efficiently generate and prepare single photons at telecom wavelengths. In many applications these photons must also be indistinguishable such that they exhibit interference on a beamsplitter, which implements effective photon-photon interactions. However, deterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons with high brightness remains a challenging problem. We demonstrate a telecom wavelength source of indistinguishable single photons using an InAs/InP quantum dot in a nanophotonic cavity. The cavity enhances the quantum dot emission, resulting in a nearly Gaussian transverse mode profile with high out-coupling efficiency exceeding 46%, leading to detected photon count rates that would exceed 1.5 million counts per second. We also observe Purcell enhanced spontaneous emission rate as large as 4. Using this source, we generate linearly polarized, high purity single photons at telecom-wavelength and demonstrate the indistinguishable nature of the emission using a two-photon interference measurement. Our results provide a promising approach to generate on-demand indistinguishable single photons at telecom wavelength for applications in quantum networking and quantum communication.

In this work, we examine a relation between a graph state and a graph code both obtained from the same graph, and show that a graph state is a superposition of logical qubits of the related graph code. By using the relation, we first discuss that a local complementation which has been used for a graph state can be useful for searching locally equivalent stabilizer codes, and second provide a method to find a stabilizer group of a graph code.

abstract: Can quantum information fundamentally change the way we perceive what is complex? Here, we study statistical complexity, a popular quantifier of complexity that captures the minimal memory required to model a process. We construct a quantum variant of this measure, and evaluate it analytically for a classical Ising spin chain. The resulting complexity measure - quantum statistical complexity - exhibits drastically different qualitative behaviour. Whereas the classical complexity of the spin chain grows monotonically with temperature, its quantum complexity rises to a maximum at some finite temperature then tends back towards zero for higher temperatures. This demonstrates that our notion of what is complex depends fundamentally on which information theory we employ.

abstract: We propose to demonstrate nonreciprocal conversion between microwave photons and optical photons in an electro-optomechanical system where a microwave mode and an optical mode are coupled indirectly via two non-degenerate mechanical modes. The nonreciprocal conversion is obtained in the broken time-reversal symmetry regime, where the conversion of photons from one frequency to the other is enhanced for constructive quantum interference while the conversion in the reversal direction is suppressed due to destructive quantum interference. It is interesting that the nonreciprocal response between the microwave and optical modes in the electro-optomechanical system appears at two different frequencies with opposite directions. The proposal can be used to realize nonreciprocal conversion between photons of any two distinctive modes with different frequencies. Moreover, the electro-optomechanical system can also be used to construct a three-port circulator for three optical modes with distinctively different frequencies by adding an auxiliary optical mode to couple with one of the mechanical modes.

abstract: Quantum communication with systems of dimension larger than two provides advantages in information processing tasks. Examples include higher rates of key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation between randomness certification and computational requirements of the postprocessing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still there. We show that for any given quantum violation, the amount of certified randomness can be increased by more computational postprocessing of the experimental data. Furthermore, we introduce a method that significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification. Our results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the hardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to follow.

abstract: In this work, we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of entanglement. In the first part of the work, we reconceptualize the idea of state dependent quantum cloning machine, and in that process we introduce different types of state dependent cloners like static and dynamic state dependent cloners. We derive the conditions under which we can make these cloners independent of the input state. In the broadcasting part, as our resource initial state, we start with general two qubit state and consider specific examples like, non maximally entangled state (NME), Werner like state (WS), and Bell diagonal state (BDS). We apply both state dependent/ state independent cloners, both locally and non-locally, in each of these cases. Incidentally, we find several instances where state dependent cloners outperform state independent cloners in broadcasting. This work gives us a holistic view on the broadcasting of entanglement in various two qubit states, when we have an almost exhaustive sets of cloning machines in our arsenal.

abstract: A quantum two-state system, weakly coupled to a heat bath, is traditionally studied in the Born-Markov regime under the secular approximation with completely positive linear master equations. Despite its success, this microscopic approach exclusively predicts exponential decays and Lorentzian susceptibility profiles, in disagreement with a number of experimental findings. To leave this limited paradigm, we use a phenomenological positive nonlinear master equation being both thermodynamically and statistically consistent. We find that, beyond a temperature-dependent threshold, a bifurcation in the decoherence time $T_2$ takes place; it gives rise to a biexponential decay and a susceptibility profile being neither Gaussian nor Lorentzian. This implies that, for suitable initial states, a major prolongation of the coherence can be obtained in agreement with recent experiments. Moreover, $T_2$ is no longer limited by the energy relaxation time $T_1$ offering novel perspectives to elaborate devices for quantum information processing.

abstract: Rotating wave approximation (RWA) plays a key rule in quantum optics to solve some Schr\"{o}dinger equation approximately. For example, it is well known that RWA has been used to calculate the transition probability. However, so far no one shows the validity of RWA. Recently Larson [J. Larson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 033601 (2012)] gave the first example showing that the application of RWA in the Jaynes-Cummings model may lead to false conclusions. In this paper, we analytically and numerically show that the application of RWA leads to false conclusions about the transition probability for the near or exact resonance.

abstract: We present a circuit construction for a new fixed-frequency superconducting qubit and show how it can be scaled up to a grid with strictly local interactions. The circuit QED realization we propose implements $\sigma_z$-type coupling between a superconducting qubit and any number of $LC$ resonators. The resulting \textit{longitudinal coupling} is inherently different from the usual $\sigma_x$-type \textit{transverse coupling}, which is the one that has been most commonly used for superconducting qubits. In a grid of fixed-frequency qubits and resonators with a particular pattern of always-on interactions, coupling is strictly confined to nearest and next-nearest neighbor resonators; there is never any direct qubit-qubit coupling. We note that just four distinct resonator frequencies, and only a single unique qubit frequency, suffice for the scalability of this scheme. A controlled phase gate between two neighboring qubits can be realized with microwave drives on the qubits, without affecting the other qubits. This fact is a supreme advantage for the scalability of this scheme.

abstract: We derive composite pulse sequences that achieve high-fidelity excitation of two-state systems in an optically dense, inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. The composite pulses are resistant to distortions due to the back-action of the medium they propagate in and are able to create high-fidelity inversion to optical depths $\alpha z>10$. They function well with smooth pulse shapes used for coherent control of optical atomic transitions in quantum computation and communication. They are an intermediary solution between single $\pi$-pulse excitation schemes and adiabatic passage schemes, being far more error tolerant than the former but still considerably faster than the latter.

Here we seek an alternative entropy of the universe $S_{univ}$ that is in accord with the second law, in a spirit not dissimilar to von Neumann himself in lesser-known work. We perform simulations of time dependent dynamics for a previously developed \cite{polyadbath} model quantum system becoming entangled with a quantum environment. We test the new definition of the entropy of the system-environment "universe" against the standard thermodynamic relation $ \Delta F_{sys} = - T \Delta S_{univ} $, calculating system properties using the reduced density matrix and standard von Neumann entropy. Good agreement is obtained, showing the compatibility of an entropy for a pure state of a universe with the statement of the second law and the concept of free energy. Interesting deviation from microcanonical behavior within the zero order energy shell is observed in a context of effectively microcanonical behavior within the much larger total basis of the time dependent universe.

abstract: We theoretically introduce and experimentally demonstrate the realization of a nonclassicality test that allows for arbitrarily low detection efficiency without invoking any extra assumptions as independence of the devices. Our test and its implementation is set in a prepare-and-measure scenario with an upper limit on the communication capacity of the channel through which the systems are communicated. The essence for our novel test is the use of two preparation and two measurement devices, which are randomly paired in each round. Our work opens up the possibility of experimental realizations of device independent protocols with current off-the-shelf technology.

NV$^-$ centers were created by irradiating a Type 1b single-crystal diamond along the [100] axis with 200 keV electrons from a transmission electron microscope with varying doses to achieve spots of different NV$^-$ center concentrations. Values of ($1/T_1$) were measured for each spot as a function of $B$.

abstract: Thermodynamics is a phenomenological theory of heat and work. Here we analyze to what extent quantum thermodynamic relations are immune to the underlying mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. As a main result, we show that the Jarzynski equality holds true for all non-hermitian quantum systems with real spectrum. This equality expresses the second law of thermodynamics for isothermal processes arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In the quasistatic limit however, the second law is reflected in the Carnot bound and it is fulfilled even if some eigenenergies are complex provided they appear in conjugate pairs. Furthermore, we propose a setup to test our predictions. The quantum system in question consists of strongly interacting excitons and photons in a semiconductor microcavity.

abstract: A quantum walk places a traverser into a superposition of both graph location and traversal "spin." The walk is defined by an initial condition, an evolution determined by a unitary coin/shift-operator, and a measurement based on the sampling of the probability distribution generated from the quantum wavefunction. Simple quantum walks are studied analytically, but for large graph structures with complex topologies, numerical solutions are typically required. For the quantum theorist, the Gremlin graph traversal machine and language can be used for the numerical analysis of quantum walks on such structures. Additionally, for the graph theorist, the adoption of quantum walk principles can transform what are currently side-effect laden traversals into pure, stateless functional flows. This is true even when the constraints of quantum mechanics are not fully respected (e.g. reversible and unitary evolution). In sum, Gremlin allows both types of theorist to leverage each other's constructs for the advancement of their respective disciplines.

abstract: Bit commitment and coin flipping occupy a unique place in the device-independent landscape, as the only device-independent protocols thus far suggested for these tasks are reliant on tripartite GHZ correlations. Indeed, we know of no other bipartite tasks, which admit a device-independent formulation, but which are not known to be implementable using only bipartite nonlocality. Another interesting feature of these protocols is that the pseudo-telepathic nature of GHZ correlations -- in contrast to the generally statistical character of nonlocal correlations, such as those arising in the violation of the CHSH inequality -- is essential to their formulation and analysis. In this work, we present a device-independent bit commitment protocol based on CHSH testing, which achieves the same security as the optimal GHZ-based protocol. The protocol is analyzed in the most general settings, where the devices are used repeatedly and may have long-term quantum memory. We also recast the protocol in a post-quantum setting where both honest and dishonest parties are restricted only by the impossibility of signaling, and find that overall the supra-quantum structure allows for greater security.

abstract: Photocells based on a simple optical transition suffer a fundamental efficiency threshold imposed by the principle of detailed balance, reflecting the fact that good absorbers must necessarily also be fast emitters. This limitation can be overcome by `parking' the energy of an absorbed photon in a `dark state' which neither absorbs nor emits light. Here we argue that suitable dark-states occur naturally as a consequence of the dipole-dipole interaction between two proximal optical dipoles for a wide range of realistic molecular dimers. We develop an intuitive model of a photocell comprising two light-absorbing molecules coupled to an idealised reaction centre, showing asymmetric dimers are capable of providing a significant enhancement of light-to-current conversion under ambient conditions. We conclude by presenting a host of candidate molecules meeting the requirements for realising such a system.

abstract: We quantitatively analyze superradiance (collective emission) in a three-dimensional array of qubits without imposing any restrictions on the size of the sample. We show that even when the spacing between the qubits become arbitrarily large, superradiance produces an error rate on each qubit that scales with the total number of qubits. This is because the sum of the norms of the effective Hamiltonians that decoheres each qubit scales with the total number of qubits and is, therefore, unbounded. In three spatial dimensions, the sum of the norms scales as $N^{2/3}$ where $N$ is the total number of qubits in the computer. Because the sum of the Hamiltonian norms are unbounded, the introduced errors are outside the applicability of the threshold theorem.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: I distinguish two types of reduction within the context of quantum-classical relations, which I designate "formal" and "empirical". Formal reduction holds or fails to hold solely by virtue of the mathematical relationship between two theories; it is therefore a two-place, a priori relation between theories. Empirical reduction requires one theory to encompass the range of physical behaviors that are well-modeled in another theory; in a certain sense, it is a three-place, a posteriori relation connecting the theories and the domain of physical reality that both serve to describe. Focusing on the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, I argue that while certain formal results concerning singular limits as Planck's constant goes to zero have been taken to preclude the possibility of reduction between these theories, such results at most block reduction in the formal sense; little if any reason has been given for thinking that they block reduction in the empirical sense. I then briefly outline a strategy for empirical reduction that is suggested by work on decoherence theory, arguing that this sort of account remains a fully viable route to the empirical reduction of classical to quantum mechanics and is unaffected by such singular limits.

abstract: I show explicitly how concerns about wave function collapse and ontology can be decoupled from the bulk of technical analysis necessary to recover localized, approximately Newtonian trajectories from quantum theory. In doing so, I demonstrate that the account of classical behavior provided by decoherence theory can be straightforwardly tailored to give accounts of classical behavior on multiple interpretations of quantum theory, including the Everett, de Broglie-Bohm and GRW interpretations. I further show that this interpretation-neutral, decoherence-based account conforms to a general view of inter-theoretic reduction in physics that I have elaborated elsewhere, which differs from the oversimplified picture that treats reduction as a matter of simply taking limits. This interpretation-neutral account rests on a general three-pronged strategy for reduction between quantum and classical theories that combines decoherence, an appropriate form of Ehrenfest's Theorem, and a decoherence-compatible mechanism for collapse. It also incorporates a novel argument as to why branch-relative trajectories should be approximately Newtonian, which is based on a little-discussed extension of Ehrenfest's Theorem to open systems, rather than on the more commonly cited but less germane closed-systems version. In the Conclusion, I briefly suggest how the strategy for quantum-classical reduction described here might be extended to reduction between other classical and quantum theories, including classical and quantum field theory and classical and quantum gravity.

abstract: Quantum error correction protects the quantum state against noise and decoherence in quantum communication and quantum computation, which enables one to perform fault-torrent quantum information processing. We experimentally demonstrate a quantum error correction scheme with a five-wave-packet code against a single stochastic error, the original theoretical model of which is firstly proposed by S. L. Braunstein and T. A. Walker. Five submodes of a continuous variable cluster entangled state of light are used for five encoding channels. Especially, in our encoding scheme the information of the input state is only distributed on three of the five channels and thus any error appearing in the remained two channels never affects the output state, i.e. the output quantum state is immune from the error in the two channels. The stochastic error on a single channel is corrected for both vacuum and squeezed input states and the achieved fidelities of the output states are beyond the corresponding classical limit.

It deals with the question how to generate a key to encrypt messages between two honest parties that an eavesdropper does not gain any information about. The purpose of this thesis is to give an overview over the current state of the prepare and measure quantum key distribution protocol and its security proof with a specific focus on the non-asymptotic case. Therefore, we present the different steps of the protocol and retrace them with the help of the BB84-protocol. Afterwards, the security proof of this protocol is introduced and in the end, we have a closer look at the quantum capacity and calculate it for the amplitude damping channel.

abstract: We provide general sufficient conditions for the efficient classical simulation of quantum-optics experiments that involve inputting states to a quantum process and making measurements at the output. The first condition is based on the negativity of phase-space quasiprobability distributions (PQDs) of the output state of the process and the output measurements; the second one is based on the negativity of PQDs of the input states, the output measurements, and the transition function associated with the process. We apply these conditions to implementations of boson sampling that use single-photon or spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion sources. We show that above some threshold for loss and noise, the boson-sampling experiments are classically simulatable.

abstract: We propose a scheme to prepare optical Schr\"odinger-cat states in a traveling wave setting. Two states are similarly prepared via the self-Kerr effect and after mixing them, one mode is measured by homodyne detection. In the other mode a superposition of coherent states is conditionally prepared. The advantage of the scheme is that assuming a small Kerr effect one can prepare with high probability one from a set of Schr\"odinger-cat states. The measured value of the quadrature provides the information, which state from the set is actually prepared.

abstract: While traditional thermodynamics concerns itself with the behavior of macroscopic observables of systems composed of many particles, the thermodynamics of nanoscale or quantum systems is the study of the manipulation of microscopic degrees of freedom of single or very small systems. In traditional thermodynamics, one does not have full control of devices and one can only manipulate macroscopic properties of the system or heat engine. On the other hand, for small systems, we imagine that we can manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom. Allowing such fine-grained control of microscopic degrees of freedom of the system and bath, one still obtains constraints on what state transformations are possible, akin to a set of second laws. These constraints are not only necessary, but one can also achieve them if one is allowed to manipulate system-bath microstates. Nonetheless, if one wants to experimentally manipulate a thermodynamical system, implementing an arbitrary operation which controls all microscopic degrees of freedom is infeasible in the foreseeable future, especially if the control over microstates of the heat bath is required. Here we show that arbitrary operations between the system and bath can be replaced by two very simple operations - changing the energy levels of the system and thermalising any two system energy levels. Using these two simple operations, one can distill the optimal amount of work from a system, as well as perform the reverse formation process. Even more surprisingly, using only these two operations and one ancilla qubit in a thermal state, one can transform any state into any other state allowable by the second laws. We thus have the remarkable result that the second laws hold for fine-grained control of system-bath, but can be achieved using very coarse control. This brings the full array of thermal operations into a regime accessible by experiment.

abstract: Recently, a series of articles by Combes et al. has shown that it was possible to greatly improve the measurement rate of a register of qubits for given detector resources by means of a clever feedback control scheme. However, this speed-up came at an exponential cost in terms of complexity and memory use. In this article, I propose a simple efficient algorithm --exponentially more frugal in memory and less complex to implement-- which is asymptotically as fast. I use extensively the implicit classicality of the situation to provide a slightly more straightforward interpretation of the results. I compute the speed-up rates exactly in the case of the proposed model and in the case of the open-loop scheme of Combes et al. and prove that they indeed provide the same asymptotic speed-up.

The case of constant SOI strength is considered first, then we investigate the physical consequences of time-dependent (oscillating) SOI strength. Floquet's method is applied to find time-dependent eigenspinors, and it is shown that the Floquet quasienergies and thus their differences (the generalized Rabi frequencies) are determined by the radial boundary conditions. Time evolution of various initial states is calculated.

abstract: In this work we address the problem of realizing a reliable quantum memory based on zero-energy Majorana modes in the presence of experimental constraints on the operations aimed at recovering the information. In particular, we characterize the best recovery operation acting only on the zero-energy Majorana modes and the memory fidelity that can be therewith achieved. In order to understand the effect of such restriction, we discuss two examples of noise models acting on the topological system and compare the amount of information that can be recovered by accessing either the whole system, or the zero-modes only, with particular attention to the scaling with the size of the system and the energy gap. We explicitly discuss the case of a thermal bosonic environment inducing a parity-preserving Markovian dynamics in which the introduced memory fidelity decays exponentially in time, independent from system size, thus showing the impossibility to retrieve the information by acting on the zero-modes only. We argue, however, that even in the presence of experimental limitations, the Hamiltonian gap is still beneficial to the storage of information.

abstract: Currently available separability criteria for continuous-variable states are generally focused on Gaussian bosonic states. The well-know separability criterion of Duan et al. and Simon, for example, gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a two-mode Gaussian state to be separable. Here, we introduce an improvement of this criterion that enables a stronger entanglement detection for non-Gaussian states. The improved condition is based on the knowledge of an additional parameter, namely the degree of Gaussianity of the state, and exploits a connection with Gaussianity-bounded uncertainty relations [Phys. Rev. A 86, 030102 (2012)]. We exhibit families of non-Gaussian entangled states whose entanglement remains undetected by the Duan-Simon criterion.

abstract: The problem of entanglement detection for arbitrary spin systems is analyzed. We demonstrate how a single measurement of the squared total spin can probabilistically discern separable from entangled many-particle states. For achieving this goal, we construct a tripartite analogy between the degeneracy of entanglement witness eigenstates, tensor products of SO(3) representations and classical lattice walks with special constraints. Within this framework, degeneracies are naturally given by generalized Catalan numbers and determine the fraction of states that are decidedly entangled. In addition, we introduce the concept of a "sterile entanglement witness", which detects entanglement without affecting much the system's dynamics. We show that our proposed witness is sterile when the system becomes large enough.

abstract: We present a proposal for a probing scheme utilizing Dicke superradiance to obtain information about ultracold atoms in optical lattices. A probe photon is absorbed collectively by an ensemble of lattice atoms generating a Dicke state. The lattice dynamics (e.g., tunneling) affects the coherence properties of that Dicke state and thus alters the superradiant emission characteristics -- which in turn provides insight into the lattice (dynamics). Comparing the Bose-Hubbard and the Fermi-Hubbard model, we find similar superradiance in the strongly interacting Mott insulator regime, but crucial differences in the weakly interacting (superfluid or metallic) phase. Furthermore, we study the possibility to detect whether a quantum phase transition between the two regimes can be considered adiabatic or a quantum quench.

abstract: For systems analogous to a linear harmonic oscillator, the simplest way to characterize the state is by a covariance matrix containing the symmetrically-ordered moments of position and momentum. We show that without direct access to either position or momentum, the estimation of the covariance matrix of non-classical states is still possible using interference with a classical noisy and low- intensity reference and linear detection of energy. Such a detection technique will allow to estimate macroscopic quantum states of electromagnetic radiation without a coherent high-intensity local oscillator. It can be directly applied to estimate the covariance matrix of macroscopically bright squeezed states of light.

abstract: Ultracold neutrons confined in the Earth's gravitational field display quantized energy levels that have been observed for over a decade. In recent resonance spectroscopy experiments [T. Jenke et al., Nature Phys. 7, 468 (2011)], the transition between two such gravitational quantum states was driven by the mechanical modulation of one of the plates that confines the neutrons. Here we show that, by applying a sinusoidal modulation with slowly varying frequency (chirp), the neutrons can be brought to any excited state, however large its energy, by climbing the energy levels one by one. This technique should make it possible to observe the quantum-classical transition that occurs at high energies. The proposed experiment is realizable using current technology and could significantly improve the sensitivity of future tests of gravitational physics.

abstract: The quantum-mechanical counterpart of a classical random walk offers a rich dynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound states (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a topological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of nonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that combines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes of opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear dynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and trap it there.

abstract: The optimal measurement configuration, i.e., the optimal input quantum state and measurement in the form of a POVM with two elements, is investigated in this paper for qubit and generalized Pauli channels. The channel directions are defined as the contracting directions of the channel with an arbitrary fixed basis of Pauli- matrices. In the qubit Pauli channel case with known channel directions it is shown that the optimal configuration that maximizes the Fisher information of the estimated parameters consists of three von Neumann measurements together with pure input states directed to the appropriate channel directions. Extensions of these results for generalized Pauli channels are also given. Furthermore, a computationally efficient estimation method is proposed for estimating the channel directions in the qubit Pauli channel case. The efficiency of this method is illustrated by simulations: it is shown that its variance is of order 1/N, where N is the number of used measurements.

In this paper we mainly focus on solving a 3-dimensional optimization problem, which gives us a non-trivial example for the so-called conditional SIC- POVMs, a straightforward generalization of the concept of SIC-POVMs. We also present other special cases to show further applications of the proposed numerical methods and to illustrate the complexity of this topic.

abstract: We investigate the continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit undergoing fluorescence. The fluorescence of the qubit is detected via a phase-preserving heterodyne measurement, giving the fluorescence quadrature signals as two continuous qubit readout results. By using the stochastic path integral approach to the measurement physics, we derive most likely paths between boundary conditions on the state, and compute approximate time correlation functions between all stochastic variables via diagrammatic perturbation theory. We focus on paths that increase in energy during the continuous measurement. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo numerical simulation of the trajectories, and we find close agreement between direct simulation and theory. We generalize this analysis to arbitrary diffusive quantum systems that are continuously monitored.

abstract: Real world quantum systems are open to perpetual influence from the wider environment. Vacuum gravitational fluctuations provide a most fundamental source of the environmental influence through their universal interactions with all forms of energy and matter causing decoherence. This may have subtle implications on precision laboratory experiments and astronomical observations and could limit the ultimate capacities for quantum technologies prone to decoherence. To establish the essential physical mechanism of decoherence under weak spacetime fluctuations, we carry out a sequence of analytical steps utilizing the Dirac constraint quantization and gauge invariant influence functional techniques, resulting in a general master equation of a compact form, that describes an open quantum gravitational system with arbitrary bosonic fields. An initial application of the theory is illustrated by the implied quantum gravitational dissipation of light as well as (non)relativistic massive or massless scalar particles. Related effects could eventually lead to important physical consequences including those on a cosmological scale and for a large number of correlated particles.

abstract: We evaluate the coupling of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold, paramagnetic atoms to the magnetic field of the current in a mechanically vibrating carbon nanotube within the frame of a full quantum theory. We find that the interaction is strong enough to sense quantum features of the nanowire current noise spectrum by means of hyperfine-state-selective atom counting. Such a non-destructive measurement of the electric current via its magnetic field corresponds to the classical galvanometer scheme, extended to the quantum regime of charge transport. The calculated high sensitivity of the interaction in the nanowire-BEC hybrid systems opens up the possibility of quantum control, which may be further extended to include other relevant degrees of freedom.

abstract: We provide a characterization of memory effects in non-Markovian system-bath interactions from a quantum information perspective. More specifically, we establish sufficient conditions for which generalized measures of multipartite quantum, classical, and total correlations can be used to quantify the degree of non-Markovianity of a local quantum decohering process. We illustrate our results by considering the dynamical behavior of the trace-distance correlations in multi-qubit systems under local dephasing and generalized amplitude damping.

abstract: The ability to initialize quantum registers in pure states lies at the core of many applications of quantum technologies, from sensing to quantum information processing and computation. In this paper we tackle the problem of increasing the polarization bias of an ensemble of two-level register spins by means of joint coherent manipulations, involving a second ensemble of ancillary spins, and energy dissipation into an external heat bath. We formulate this spin refrigeration protocol, akin to algorithmic cooling, in the general language of quantum feedback control, and identify the relevant thermodynamic variables involved. Our analysis is twofold: On the one hand, we assess the optimality of the protocol by means of suitable figures of merit, accounting for both its work cost and effectiveness. On the other hand, we characterise the nature of correlations built up between the register and the ancilla. In particular, we observe that neither the amount of classical correlations nor the quantum entanglement seem to be key ingredients fueling our spin refrigeration protocol. We report instead that a more general indicator of quantumness beyond entanglement, the so-called quantum discord, is closely related to the cooling performance.

abstract: We demonstrate that superpositions of coherent and displaced Fock states, also referred to as generalized Schr\"odinger cats cats, can be created by application of a nonlinear displacement operator which is a deformed version of the Glauber displacement operator. Consequently, such generalized cat states can be formally considered as nonlinear coherent states. We then show that Glauber-Fock photonic lattices endowed with alternating positive and negative coupling coefficients give rise to classical analogs of such cat states. In addition, it is pointed out that the analytic propagator of these deformed Glauber-Fock arrays explicitly contains the Wigner operator opening the possibility to observe Wigner functions of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the classical domain.

abstract: Perturbed Hamming weight problems serve as examples of optimization instances for which the adiabatic algorithm provably out performs classical simulated annealing. In this work we study the efficiency of the adiabatic algorithm for solving the "the Hamming weight with a spike" problem by using several methods to compute the scaling of the spectral gap at the critical point, which apply for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier. Our main result is a rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic evolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high barrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an improved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum of the system when no spike term is present. We also give a more detailed treatment of the spin coherent path-integral instanton method which was used by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann in arXiv:quant-ph/0201031, and consider its applicability for estimating the gap for different scalings of barrier height and width. We adapt the discrete WKB method for an abruptly changing potential, and apply it to the construction of approximate wave functions which can be used to estimate the gap. Finally, the improved ansatz for the ground state leads to a method for predicting the location of avoided crossings in the excited states of the energy spectrum of the thin spike Hamiltonian, and we use a recursion relation to determine the ordering of some of these avoided crossings, which may be a useful step towards understanding the diabatic cascade phenomenon which occurs in spike Hamiltonians.

abstract: Open quantum systems (OQS) cannot always be described with the Markov approximation, which requires a large separation of system and environment time scales. Here, we give an overview of some of the most important techniques available to tackle the dynamics of an OQS beyond the Markov approximation. Some of these techniques, such as master equations, Heisenberg equations and stochastic methods, are based on solving the reduced OQS dynamics, while others, such as path integral Monte Carlo or chain mapping approaches, are based on solving the dynamics of the full system. We emphasize the physical interpretation and derivation of the various approaches, explore how they are connected and examine how different methods may be suitable for solving different problems.

abstract: A generalized description of entanglement and quantum correlation properties constraining internal degrees of freedom of Dirac(-like) structures driven by arbitrary Poincar\'e classes of external field potentials is proposed. The role of (pseudo)scalar, (pseudo)vector and tensor interactions in producing/destroying intrinsic quantum correlations for $\mbox{SU}(2) \otimes \mbox{SU}(2)$ bi-spinor structures is discussed in terms of generic coupling constants. By using a suitable ansatz to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian eigenspinor structure of time-independent solutions of the associated Liouville equation, the quantum entanglement, via concurrence, and quantum correlations, via geometric discord, are computed for several combinations of well-defined Poincar\'e classes of Dirac potentials. Besides its inherent formal structure, our results setup a framework which can be enlarged as to include localization effects and to map quantum correlation effects into Dirac-like systems which describe low-energy excitations of graphene and trapped ions.

abstract: Quantum information processing holds great promise for communicating and computing data efficiently. However, scaling current photonic implementation approaches to larger system size remains an outstanding challenge for realizing disruptive quantum technology. Two main ingredients of quantum information processors are quantum interference and single-photon detectors. Here we develop a hybrid superconducting-photonic circuit system to show how these elements can be combined in a scalable fashion on a silicon chip. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach for integrated quantum optics by interfering and detecting photon pairs directly on the chip with waveguide-coupled single-photon detectors. Using a directional coupler implemented with silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides, we observe 97% interference visibility when measuring photon statistics with two monolithically integrated superconducting single photon detectors. The photonic circuit and detector fabrication processes are compatible with standard semiconductor thin-film technology, making it possible to implement more complex and larger scale quantum photonic circuits on silicon chips.

abstract: We present a general error-correcting scheme for quantum annealing that allows for the encoding of a logical qubit into an arbitrarily large number of physical qubits. Given any Ising model optimization problem, the encoding replaces each logical qubit by a complete graph of degree $C$, representing the distance of the error-correcting code. A subsequent minor-embedding step then implements the encoding on the underlying hardware graph of the quantum annealer. We demonstrate experimentally that the performance of a D-Wave Two quantum annealing device improves as $C$ grows. We show that the performance improvement can be interpreted as arising from an effective increase in the energy scale of the problem Hamiltonian, or equivalently, an effective reduction in the temperature at which the device operates. The number $C$ thus allows us to control the amount of protection against thermal and control errors, and in particular, to trade qubits for a lower effective temperature that scales as $C^{-\eta}$, with $\eta \leq 2$. This effective temperature reduction is an important step towards scalable quantum annealing.

abstract: Majorization uncertainty relations are derived for arbitrary quantum operations acting on a finite dimensional space. The basic idea is to consider submatrices of block matrices comprised of the corresponding Kraus operators. This is an extension of the previous formulation, which deals with submatrices of a unitary matrix relating orthogonal bases in which measurements are performed. Two classes of majorization relations are considered: one related to tensor product of probability vectors and another one related to their direct sum. We explicitly discuss an example of a pair of one-qubit operations, each of them represented by two Kraus operators. In the particular case of quantum maps describing orthogonal measurements the presented formulation reduces to earlier results derived for measurements in orthogonal bases. Presented approach allows us also to bound the entropy characterizing results of a single generalized measurement.

abstract: The best possible precision is one of the key figures in metrology, but this is established by the exact response of the detection apparatus, which is often unknown. There exist techniques for detector characterisation, that have been introduced in the context of quantum technologies, but apply as well for ordinary classical coherence; these techniques, though, rely on intense data processing. Here we show that one can make use of the simpler approach of data fitting patterns in order to obtain an estimate of the Cram\'er-Rao bound allowed by an unknown detector, and present applications in polarimetry. Further, we show how this formalism provide a useful calculation tool in an estimation problem involving a continuous-variable quantum state, i.e. a quantum harmonic oscillator.

This allows us to describe the combined effect of thermalisation and dephasing beyond the usual Markovian approximation. We investigate the complete positivity conditions and introduce a heuristic model that is always physical and provides the correct Markovian limit. We study the effects of temperature on the non-Markovian behaviour of the system and show that the noise additivity property discussed by Yu and Eberly in Ref. [1] holds beyond the Markovian limit.

abstract: The dynamics of spontaneous emission of an atomic system is studied in the framework of an open quantum system. The resulting quantum master equation for the atomic system is non hermitian. The generator $\mathcal{L}$ can possess non-hermitian degeneracies, i.e. exceptional points ($EP$), for specific values of the external laser driving amplitude and detuning from the atomic lines. We suggest to employ the special properties of these $EP$s for accurate parameter estimation. The method is demonstrated for the atomic spectrum of $S \rightarrow P$ transitions of $~^{85}$Rb and $~^{40}$Ca$~^+$.

abstract: Photons carry one unit of angular momentum associated with their spin~\cite{Beth1936}. Structured vortex beams carry additional orbital angular momentum which can also be transferred to matter~\cite{Allen1992}. This extra twist has been used for example to drive motion of microscopic particles in optical tweezers as well as to create vortices in degenerate quantum gases~\cite{He1995,Andersen2006}. Here we demonstrate the transfer of optical orbital angular momentum from the transverse spatial structure of the beam to the internal (electronic) degrees of freedom of an atom. Probing a quadrupole transition of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion localized at the center of the vortex, we observe strongly modified selection rules, accounting for both the photon spin and the vorticity of the field. In particular, we show that an atom can absorb two quanta of angular momentum from a single photon even when rotational symmetry is conserved. In contrast to previous findings~\cite{Araoka2005,Loeffler2011a,Mathevet2013}, our experiment allows for conditions where the vorticity of the laser beam determines the optical excitation, contributing to the long-standing discussion on whether the orbital angular momentum of photons can be transferred to atomic internal degrees of freedom~\cite{VanEnk1994,Babiker2002,Jauregui2004, Schmiegelow2012, Mondal2014, Scholz-Marggraf2014} and paves the way for its use to tailor light-matter interactions.

abstract: The progress achieved in micro-fabricating potential for cold atoms has defined a new field in quantum technology - Atomtronics - where a variety of 'atom circuits' of very different spatial shapes and depth have been devised for atom manipulation, with a precision that nowadays is approaching that of lithographic techniques. Atomtronic setups are characterized by enhanced flexibility and control of the fundamental mechanisms underlying their functionalities and by the reduced decoherence rate that is typical of cold-atom systems. Such an approach is expected to be instrumental for the realization of quantum devices of a radically new type and, at the same time, to enlarge the scope of cold atom quantum simulators. In this article we give a short overview of the field and draw a roadmap for potential future directions.

abstract: We present a semiclassical approach to many-body quantum propagation in terms of coherent sums over quantum amplitudes associated with the solutions of corresponding classical nonlinear wave equations. This approach adequately describes interference effects in the many-body space of interacting bosonic systems. The main quantity of interest, the transition amplitude between Fock states when the dynamics is driven by both single-particlecontributions and many-body interactions of similar magnitude, is non-perturbatively constructed in the spirit of Gutzwiller's derivation of the van Vleck propagator from the path integral representation of the time evolution operator, but lifted to the space of symmetrized many-body states. Effects beyond mean-field, here representing the classical limit of the theory, are semiclassically described by means of interfering amplitudes where the action and stability of the classical solutions enter. In this way, a genuinely many-body echo phenomenon, coherent backscattering in Fock space, is presented arising due to coherent quantum interference between classical solutions related by time reversal.

abstract: We present a method that uses dynamic decoupling of a multi-level quantum probe to distinguish small frequency shifts that depend on $m^2_{j}$, where $m^2_{j}$ is the angular momentum of level $\left|j\right\rangle$ along the quantization axis, from large noisy shifts that are linear in $m_{j}$, such as those due to magnetic field noise. Using this method we measured the electric quadrupole moment of the $4D_{\frac{5}{2}}$ level in $^{88}Sr^{+}$ to be $2.973^{+0.026}_{-0.033}\, ea_{0}^{2}$. Our measurement improves the uncertainty of this value by an order of magnitude and thus helps mitigate an important systematic uncertainty in $^{88}Sr^{+}$ based optical atomic clocks and verifies complicated many-body quantum calculations.

Having in mind recent experiments involving superconducting circuits, we consider their description in terms of a scalar field in a one dimensional cavity satisfying generalized boundary conditions that involve a time-dependent linear combination of the field and its spatial and time derivatives. We evaluate numerically the Bogoliubov transformation between {\it in} and {\it out}-states and find that the rate of particle production strongly depends on whether the spectrum of the unperturbed cavity is equidistant or not, and also on the amplitude of the temporal oscillations of the boundary conditions. We provide analytic justifications for the different regimes found numerically.

abstract: In the context of a physical theory, two devices, A and B, described by the theory are called incompatible if the theory does not allow the existence of a third device C that would have both A and B as its components. Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ``no-cloning'' and ``no information without disturbance''; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.

abstract: We propose to implement tunable interaction of superconducting flux qubits with cavity-assisted interaction and strong driving. The qubits have a three-level Lambda configuration, and the decay of the excited state will be greatly suppressed due to the effective large detuning. The implemented interaction is insensitive to the cavity field state and can be controlled by modulating the phase difference of the driving fields of the qubits. In particular, our scheme is based on the typical circuit QED setup and thus will provide a simple method towards the tunable interaction of superconducting qubits. Finally, we consider the generation of two and four qubits entangled states with the constructed interaction under the influence of typical decoherence effects.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize controllable quantum state transfer and entanglement generation among transmon qubits in the typical circuit QED setup based on adiabatic passage. Through designing the time-dependent driven pulses applied on the transmon qubits, we find that fast quantum sate transfer can be achieved between arbitrary two qubits and quantum entanglement among the qubits also can also be engineered. Furthermore, we numerically analyzed the influence of the decoherence on our scheme with the current experimental accessible systematical parameters. The result shows that our scheme is very robust against both the cavity decay and qubit relaxation, the fidelities of the state transfer and entanglement preparation process could be very high. In addition, our scheme is also shown to be insensitive to the inhomogeneous of qubit-resonator coupling strengths.

abstract: We study Gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. We present a Gaussian channel description of quantum state evolution under the influence of Hawking radiation. We find that thermal noise introduced by Hawking effect will destroy the steerability between an inertial observer Alice and an accelerated observer Bob who hovers outside an event horizon, while it generates steerability between Bob and a hypothetical observer Anti-Bob inside the event horizon. Besides, unlike entanglement behaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from Alice to Bob suffers from a "sudden death" and the steering from Anti-Bob to Bob appears a "sudden birth" with the increasing of Hawking temperature. We also find that the Gaussian steering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry can \emph{ exceed} $\ln 2$ in curved spacetime, which is in accordance with the flat spacetime case [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 060403 (2015)].

abstract: We consider a chain of trapped ions to interact with each other via long-range interactions. This system can be used to simulate the long-range Ising model. We study the dynamics of quantum coherence of a single spin in the chain, where the spins are initially prepared in their upper states. The relaxation dynamics exhibits due to the genuine long-range interaction. The degree of quantum coherence of a single spin rapidly decreases and vanishes in the steady state. However, our numerical result suggests that the conventional spin chain model, which truncates the interactions between the distant spins, cannot show the relaxation dynamics. This implies that the usual truncation in approximating the long-range interaction is not applicable to describing the non-equilibrium dynamics. The effect of the interaction range on the relaxation dynamics is studied. The higher relaxation rate will show if a system has a longer range of interaction. However, it takes a longer relaxation time in the vicinity of infinite interaction range. We also examine the dynamics of quantum coherence of a block of spins. Our result may shed light on the relationship between long-range interaction and the coherence dynamics of a quantum many-body system.

(2) For any pre-selected guess of the simple, non-covariant time-dependent observable $Q(t)$ one of the Kato's exceptional points (viz., $t=\tau_{(EP)}$) is postulated {\em real-valued}. This enables us to treat it as the time of Big Bang. (3) During our ``Eon'' (i.e., at all $t>\tau_{(EP)}$) the observability status of operator $Q(t)$ is mathematically guaranteed by its self-adjoint nature with respect to an {\em ad hoc} Hilbert-space metric $\Theta(t) \neq I$. (4) In adiabatic approximation (i.e., in Heisenberg picture) the passage of the Universe through its $t=\tau_{(EP)}$ singularity is interpreted as a quantum phase transition between the preceding and the present Eon. It is worth adding that in our model the widely accepted ``Big Bounce'' regularization of the classical Big Bang singularity after quantization gets replaced by the full-fledged quantum degeneracy. At the quantum-phase-transition singularity, operator $Q(\tau_{(EP)})$ becomes unobservable and acquires a non-diagonalizable Jordan-block structure.

abstract: We prepare single phonon Fock state of mechanical mode in optomechanical system based on photon subtraction process in the linear regime of optomechanical interaction. The correlation set between cavity and field modes is utilized to recast the state of a pre-cooled mechanical mode into a single phonon Fock state as the field mode is subjected to a photon subtraction type measurement at a dynamical instant of interaction time. The resultant conditional state of mechanical mode quantified by its Wigner function, exhibits an excellent compatibility with the standard single quantum Fock state. We confirm the nature of obtained state by calculating the phonon statistics, and conditional fidelity which approaches to unity for an instantaneous measurement time within an appropriate choice of parametric regime. Moreover, we also study the effects of temperature parameter for the preparation of target state. The present scheme can be realized to engineer the single quantum Fock state of macroscopic mechanical mode with currently available technology.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that our physical reality is influenced by events that can potentially happen but factually do not occur. Interaction-free measurements (IFMs) exploit this counterintuitive influence to detect the presence of an object without requiring any interaction with it. Here we propose and realize an IFM concept based on an unstable many-particle system. In our experiments, we employ an ultracold gas in an unstable spin configuration which can undergo a rapid decay. The object - realized by a laser beam - prevents this decay due to the indirect quantum Zeno effect and thus, its presence can be detected without interacting with a single atom. Contrary to existing proposals, our IFM does not require single-particle sources and is only weakly affected by losses and decoherence. We demonstrate confidence levels of 90%, well beyond previous optical experiments.

abstract: We measured the branching fractions for the decay of the 5p 2 P 1/2 state of 88 Sr + by applying a recently demonstrated photon-counting sequential method (M. Ramm et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 023004) to a single ion laser-cooled in a micro fabricated surface trap. The branching fraction for the decay into the 5s 2 S 1/2 ground level was found to be p = 0.9453 +0.0007 --0.0005. This result is in good agreement with recent theoretical calculations but disagrees with previous experimental measurements, however affected by a one order of magnitude larger uncertainty. This experiment also demonstrates the reliability and the performances of ion micro trap technology in the domain of precision measurements and spectroscopy.

abstract: We investigate Landau-Zener processes modeled by a two-level quantum system, with its finite bias energy varied in time and in the presence of a single broadened cavity mode at zero temperature. By applying the hierarchy equation method to the Landau-Zener problem, we computationally study the survival fidelity of adiabatic states without Born, Markov, rotating-wave or other perturbative approximations. With this treatment it also becomes possible to investigate cases with very strong system-bath coupling. Different from a previous study of infinite-time Landau-Zener processes, the fidelity of the time-evolving state as compared with instantaneous adiabatic states shows non-monotonic dependence on the system-bath coupling and on the sweep rate of the bias. We then consider the effect of applying a counter-diabatic driving field, which is found to be useful in improving the fidelity only for sufficiently short Landau-Zener processes. Numerically exact results show that different counter-diabatic driving fields can have much different robustness against environment effects. Lastly, using a case study we discuss the possibility of introducing a dynamical decoupling field in order to eliminate the decoherence effect of the environment and at the same time to retain the positive role of a counter-diabatic field. Our work indicates that finite-time Landau-Zener processes with counter-diabatic driving offer a fruitful test bed to understand controlled adiabatic processes in open systems.

abstract: Ultra strong electromagnetic fields can lead to a breakdown of the vacuum and the spontaneous creation of single or multiple electron-positron pairs. A quantum field theoretical treatment of the pair creation process combined with numerical methods provides a complete description of the quantum field state, from which all observables of the multiple electron-positron pairs can be inferred. This allows to study the complex multi-particle dynamics of electron-positron pair creation in-depth, including multi-pair statistics as well as momentum distributions and spin. To illustrate the potential benefit of this approach, it is applied to the intermediate regime of pair creation between nonperturbative Schwinger pair creation and perturbative multiphoton pair creation where the creation of multi-pair states becomes nonnegligible but cascades do not yet set in. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how spin and helicity of the created electrons and positrons are affected by the polarization of the counterpropagating laser fields, which induce the creation of electron-positron pairs.

abstract: The addressability of parallel spatially multimode quantum memory for light allows one to control independent collective spin waves within the same cold atomic ensemble. Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the pump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the mutual evolution and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of collective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that these modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on--demand transverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the directions, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this allows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a given set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can retrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable superpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output signal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a controllable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the delays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence. We elaborate the theory of such light--matter interface for the spatially multivariate cavity-based off--resonant Raman--type quantum memory. Since in order to speed up the manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories it might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time shape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond the bad cavity limit.

abstract: We consider the bound states of a system consisting of a light particle and two heavy bosonic ones, which are restricted in their quantum mechanical motion to two space dimensions. The interaction between the two heavy particles is established by a $p$-wave resonance in the heavy-light short-range potential. Due to large ratio of atomic masses this system is perfectly suited for applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this way we show that this planar three-body system has a Coulomb energy spectrum with a Gaussian cut-off.

We derive the transmission and reflection coefficients and show that in this case as well, the sum of the coefficients of spin up and down electrons yields the quantum mechanical results. Furthermore, we consider the symmetric potential well and show that the quantum mechanical expression for the quantized energy levels of a particle is obtained with periodic boundary conditions.

abstract: We present a versatile inequality of uncertainty relations which are useful when one approximates an observable and/or estimates a physical parameter based on the measurement of another observable. It is shown that the optimal choice for proxy functions used for the approximation is given by Aharonov's weak value, which also determines the classical Fisher information in parameter estimation, turning our inequality into the genuine Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality. Since the standard form of the uncertainty relation arises as a special case of our inequality, and since the parameter estimation is available as well, our inequality can treat both the position-momentum and the time-energy relations in one framework albeit handled differently.

abstract: Catalytic coherence transformations allow the otherwise impossible state transformations using only incoherent operations with the aid of an auxiliary system with finite coherence which is not being consumed in anyway. Here we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic and stochastic catalytic coherence transformations between pair of pure quantum states. In particular, we show that the simultaneous decrease of a family of R\'enyi entropies of the diagonal parts of the states under consideration are necessary and sufficient conditions for the deterministic catalytic coherence transformations. Similarly, for stochastic catalytic coherence transformations we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving higher optimal probability of conversion. We, thus, completely characterize the coherence transformations amongst pure quantum states under incoherent operations. We give numerous examples to elaborate our results. We also explore the possibility of the same system acting as a catalyst for itself and find that indeed {\it self catalysis} is possible. Further, for the cases where no catalytic coherence transformation is possible we provide entanglement assisted coherence transformations and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for such transformations.

abstract: It has been argued that it is incompatible to maintain unitary time-evolution for time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians when the metric operator is explicitly time-dependent. We demonstrate here that the time-dependent Dyson equation and the time-dependent quasi-Hermiticity relation can be solved consistently in such a scenario for a time-dependent Dyson map and time-dependent metric operator, respectively. These solutions are obtained at the cost of rendering the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to be a non-observable operator as it ceases to be quasi-Hermitian when the metric becomes time-dependent.

abstract: The work is organized in two main topics. At first we will outline the relation between spin squeezing, quantum metrology and entanglement detection, with a particular focus on the last. We will derive spin squeezing criteria for the detection of entanglement and its depth that outperform past approaches, especially for unpolarized states, recently produced in experiments and object of increasing interest in the community. Furthermore, we will extend the original definition of spin squeezed states by providing a new parameter that is thought to embrace different classes of states in a unified framework. Afterwards we consider a test of quantum principles in macroscopic objects originally designed by Leggett and Garg. In this case the scenario consists of a single party that is probed at different time instants and the quantum effect detected is the violation of Macrorealism (MR), due to strong correlations in time, rather than in space, between non-compatible observables. We will look at the problems of inconclusiveness of the LG tests arising from possible explanations of the results in terms of ``clumsy'' measurements, what has been termed ``clumsiness loophole''. We propose first a scheme to test and possibly falsify (MR) in macroscopic ensembles of cold atoms based on alternating Quantum Non-Demolition measurements and coherent, magnetically-driven collective spin rotations. Then we also propose a way to address the clumsiness loophole by introducing and computing an invasivity quantifier to add to the original LG expression. We provide numerical evidence that such a clumsiness-free test is feasible under state-of-the-art realistic experimental parameters and imperfections.

abstract: Developments in photonic chips have spurred photon based classical and quantum information processing, attributing to the high stability and scalability of integrated photonic devices [1, 2]. Optical nonlinearity [3] is indispensable in these complex photonic circuits, because it allows for classical and quantum light sources, all-optical switch, modulation, and non-reciprocity in ambient environments. It is commonly known that nonlinear interactions are often greatly enhanced in the microcavities [4]. However, the manifestations of coherent photon-photon interaction in a cavity, analogous to the electromagnetically induced transparency [5], have never been reported on an integrated platform. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the coherent photon-photon interaction induced by second order optical nonlinearity (\chi^{(2)} ) on an aluminum nitride photonic chip. The non-reciprocal nonlinear optic induced transparency is demonstrated as a result of the coherent interference between photons with different colors: ones in the visible wavelength band and ones in the telecom wavelength band. Furthermore, a wide-band frequency conversion with an almost unit internal (0.14 external) efficiency and a bandwidth up to 0.76\,\mathrm{GHz} is demonstrated.

abstract: A unifying principle explaining the numerical bounds of quantum correlations remains elusive despite the efforts devoted to identify it. Here we show that these bounds are indeed not exclusive to quantum theory: for any abstract correlation scenario with compatible measurements, a suited classical wave theory produces probability distributions indistinguishable from those of quantum theory, and therefore share the same bounds. We demonstrate this finding by implementing classical microwaves propagating along meter-size transmission-line circuits and reproduce the probabilities of three emblematic quantum experiments. Our results show that what distinguishes quantum theory is not the set of numerical bounds, but the fact that it is produced without the resources used by classical systems. The implications of this observation are discussed.

abstract: Boson Sampling represents a promising witness of the supremacy of quantum systems as a resource for the solution of computational problems. The classical hardness of Boson Sampling has been related to the so called Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture and has been extended to some generalizations such as scattershot Boson Sampling, approximate and lossy sampling under some reasonable constraints. However, it is still unclear how demanding these bounds are for a quantum experimental sampler. Starting from a state of the art analysis and focusing on the foreseeable practical conditions needed to reach quantum supremacy, we look at different techniques and present a more general and effective solution. We apply our approach to both the experimental suggestions presented to date and we eventually find in both cases a new threshold that is less error sensitive and experimentally more feasible.

We provide performance guarantees in terms of their worst-case accuracy and cost. We further illustrate their performance by providing tests comparing them to the respective floating point implementations found in widely used numerical software.

Many physical systems can naturally have more accessible states, both local and non-local. We show that the resulting non-local network of states connecting qubits can be efficiently addressed via continuous time quantum random walks, leading to substantial speed-up of multiqubit entanglement manipulations. We discuss a three-qubit Toffoli gate and a system of superconducting qubits as an illustration.

abstract: We consider the Lindblad equation for a collection of multilevel systems coupled to independent environments. The equation is symmetric under the exchange of the labels associated with each system and thus the open-system dynamics takes place in the permutation-symmetric subspace of the operator space. The dimension of this space grows polynomially with the number of systems. We construct a basis of this space and a set of superoperators whose action on this basis is easily specified. For a given number of levels, $M$, these superoperators are written in terms of a bosonic realization of the generators of the Lie algebra $\sln{M^2}$. In some cases, these results enable finding an analytic solution of the master equation using known Lie-algebraic methods. To demonstrate this, we obtain an analytic expression for the state operator of a collection of three-level atoms coupled to independent radiation baths. When analytic solutions are difficult to find, the basis and the superoperators can be used to considerably reduce the computational resources required for simulations.

abstract: The basis of any quantum resource theory are free states and free operations, these are states and operations which can be created or performed at no cost. In the resource theory of quantum coherence free states are states which are diagonal in a fixed reference basis. This choice is natural in many experimental scenarios where the reference basis is singled out by the unavoidable decoherence. The corresponding free operations are called incoherent, they can be implemented as a generalized measurement which does not create any coherence. However, a general quantum operation admits different experimental realizations, and a quantum operation which seems incoherent in one experimental realization might create coherence in another. Starting from this observation, we propose the framework of genuine quantum coherence. This approach is based on a simple principle: we demand that a genuinely incoherent operation preserves all incoherent states. This simple condition automatically guarantees that the operation is incoherent regardless of the particular experimental realization. Among other results we introduce and study the task of incoherent remote state preparation and compare our approach to the framework of quantum thermodynamics and the resource theory of asymmetry. Remarkably, we also show that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of incoherent states is a faithful measure of genuine coherence.

abstract: We analyze the optomechanics of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with the optical lattice inside a laser-pumped optical cavity and subject to a uniform bias force such as gravity. An atomic wave packet in a tilted lattice undergoes Bloch oscillations; in a cavity the backaction of the atoms on the light leads to a time-dependent modulation of the intracavity lattice at the Bloch frequency. When the Bloch frequency is on the order of the cavity damping rate we find transport of the atoms either up or down the lattice. The transport dynamics can be interpreted as a manifestation of dynamical backaction-induced sideband damping/amplification of the optomechanical Bloch oscillator. Depending on the sign of the pump-cavity detuning, atoms are transported either with or against the bias force accompanied by an up- or down-conversion of the frequency of the pump laser light. We also evaluate the prospects for using the optomechanical Bloch oscillator to make continuous measurements of forces by reading out the Bloch frequency. In this context we establish the significant result that the optical spring effect is absent and the Bloch frequency is not modified by the backaction.

abstract: The relation between entanglement and nonlocality is discussed in the case of multipartite quantum systems. We show that, for any number of parties, there exist genuinely multipartite entangled states which admit a fully local hidden variable model, i.e. where all parties are separated. Hence, although these states are entangled in the strongest possible sense, they cannot lead to Bell inequality violation considering general non-sequential local measurements. Then, we show that the nonlocality of these states can nevertheless be activated using sequences of local measurements, thus revealing genuine multipartite hidden nonlocality.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.08434
abstract: We study the generation of quantum correlations between two excitonic quantum dot qubits due to their interaction with the same phonon environment. Such generation results from the fact that during the pure dephasing process at finite temperatures, each exciton becomes entangled with the phonon environment. We find that for a wide range of temperatures quantum correlations are created due to the interaction. The temperature-dependence of the amount of correlations created displays a trade-off type behaviour; for small temperatures the phonon-induced distrubance of the qubit states is too small to lead to a distinct change of the two-qubit state, hence, the amount of created correlations is small, while for large temperatures the pure dephasing is not accompanied by the creation of entanglement between the qubits and the environment, so the environment cannot mediate qubit-qubit quantum correlations.

abstract: We derive two types of sets of higher-order conditions for bipartite entanglement in terms of continuous variables. One corresponds to an extension of the well-known Duan inequalities from second to higher moments describing a kind of higher-order Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. Only the second type, however, expressed by powers of the mode operators leads to tight conditions with a hierarchical structure. We start with a minimization problem for the single-partite case and, using the results obtained, establish relevant inequalities for higher-order moments satisfied by all bipartite separable states. A certain fourth-order condition cannot be violated by any Gaussian state and we present non-Gaussian states whose entanglement is detected by that condition. Violations of all our conditions are provided, so they can all be used as entanglement tests.

abstract: In a direct detection scheme we observed 7.8 dB of twin-beam squeezing for multi-mode two-color squeezed vacuum generated via parametric down conversion. Applying post-selection, we conditionally prepared a Sub-Poissonian state of light containing $6.3\cdot10^5$ photons per pulse on the average with the Fano factor $0.63\pm0.01$. The scheme can be considered as the heralded preparation of pulses with the mean energy varying between tens and hundreds of fJ and the uncertainty considerably below the shot-noise level. Such pulses can be used in metrology (for instance, for radiometers calibration) as well as for probing nonlinear optical effects.

abstract: Optomechanical systems explore and exploit the coupling between light and the mechanical motion of matter. A nonlinear coupling offers access to rich new physics, in both the quantum and classical regimes. We investigate a dynamic, as opposed to the usually studied static, nonlinear optomechanical system, comprising of a nanosphere levitated and cooled in a hybrid electro-optical trap. An optical cavity offers readout of both linear-in-position and quadratic-in-position (nonlinear) light-matter coupling, whilst simultaneously cooling the nanosphere to millikelvin temperatures for indefinite periods of time in high vacuum. We observe cooling of the linear and non-linear motion, leading to a $10^5$ fold reduction in phonon number $n_p$, attaining final occupancies of $n_p = 100-1000$. This work puts cavity cooling of a levitated object to the quantum ground-state firmly within reach.

More generally, we establish contextuality as a necessary resource for all schemes of quantum computation with magic states on qubits that satisfy three simple postulates. Furthermore, we identify stringent consistency conditions on such computational schemes, revealing the general structure by which negativity of Wigner functions, hardness of classical simulation of the computation, and contextuality are connected.

abstract: Diamond is a proven solid-state platform for spin-based quantum technology. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been used to realize small-scale quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum sensing under ambient conditions. A major barrier in the development of large-scale QIP in diamond is the connection of NV spin registers by a quantum bus at room temperature. Given that diamond is expected to be an ideal spin transport material, the coherent transport of spin directly between the spin registers offers a potential solution. Yet, there has been no demonstration of spin transport in diamond due to difficulties in achieving spin injection and detection via conventional methods. Here, we exploit detailed knowledge of the paramagnetic defects in diamond to identify novel mechanisms to achieve spin injection, transport and detection in diamond at room temperature. Having identified these mechanisms, we explore how they may be combined to realise an on-chip spin quantum bus.

abstract: We consider causality respecting (CR) quantum systems interacting with closed timelike curves (CTCs), within the Deutsch model. We introduce the concepts of popping up and elimination of quantum information and use them to show that no-cloning and no-deleting, which are true in CR quantum systems, are no more valid in the same that are interacting with CTCs. We also find limits on the possibility of creation of entanglement between CR systems and CTCs. We prove that teleportation of quantum information, even in its approximate version, from a CR region to a CTC is disallowed. We subsequently show that tweaking the Deutsch model, by allowing the input and output to be not the same, leads to a nontrivial approximate teleportation beyond the classical limit.

abstract: We prove feasibility of high-fidelity pulsed optomechanical interface based on all-optical pre-squeezing of non-Gaussian quantum states of light before they enter the optomechanical system. We demonstrate that feasible pre-squeezing of optical states effectively increases the low noise transfer of them to mechanical oscillator. It allows to surpass the limit necessary to transfer highly nonclassical states with negative Wigner function. In particular, we verify that with this help single photon states of light can be efficiently turned to single phonon states of mechanical oscillator, keeping the negativity of the Wigner function. It opens the possibility to merge quantum optomechanics with the recent methods of quantum optics.

abstract: The divergent series for a function defined through Lapalce integral and the ground state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator to large orders are studied to test the generalized binomial transform which is the renamed version of $\delta$-expansion proposed recently. We show that, by the use of the generalized binomial transform, the values of functions in the limit of zero of an argument is approximately computable from the series expansion around the infinity of the same argument. In the Laplace integral, we investigate the subject in detail with the aid of Mellin transform. In the anharmonic oscillator, we compute the strong coupling limit of the ground state energy and also the expansion coefficients at strong coupling from the weak coupling perturbation series. The obtained result is compared with that of the linear delta expansion.

We have previously demonstrated [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{115}, 060401 (2015)] that the measurement back action of stroboscopic imaging leads to selective squeezing and entanglement of quantized density oscillations. Here, we investigate how the squeezing and entanglement are affected by the finite spatial resolution and geometry of the probe laser beam and of the detector and how they can be optimized.

abstract: A fundamental connection between thermodynamics and information theory arises from the fact that correlations exhibit an inherent work value. For noninteracting systems this translates to a work cost for establishing correlations. Here we investigate the relationship between work and correlations in the presence of interactions that cannot be controlled or removed. For such naturally coupled systems, which are correlated even in thermal equilibrium, we determine general strategies that can reduce the work cost of correlations, and illustrate these for a selection of exemplary physical systems.

abstract: We show an equivalence between 1-query quantum algorithms and representations by degree-2 polynomials. Namely, a partial Boolean function $f$ is computable by a 1-query quantum algorithm with error bounded by $\epsilon<1/2$ iff $f$ can be approximated by a degree-2 polynomial with error bounded by $\epsilon'<1/2$. This result holds for two different notions of approximation by a polynomial: the standard definition of Nisan and Szegedy and the approximation by block-multilinear polynomials recently introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (STOC'2015, arxiv:1411.5729). We also show two results for polynomials of higher degree. First, there is a total Boolean function which requires $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ quantum queries but can be represented by a block-multilinear polynomial of degree $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Thus, in the general case (for an arbitrary number of queries), block-multilinear polynomials are not equivalent to quantum algorithms. Second, for any constant degree $k$, the two notions of approximation by a polynomial (the standard and the block-multilinear) are equivalent. As a consequence, we solve an open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis, showing that one can estimate the value of any bounded degree-$k$ polynomial $p:\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1, 1]$ with $O(n^{1-\frac{1}{2k}})$ queries.

abstract: We observe the interference in the light scattered from trapped 40Ca+ ion crystals. Varying the intensity of the excitation laser we study the influence of elastic and inelastic scattering on the visibility of the fringe pattern and discriminate its effect from that of the ion temperature and wave-packet localization. In this way we determine the complex degree of coherence and the mutual coherence of light fields produced by individual atoms. We obtain interference fringes from crystals consisting of two, three and four ions in a harmonic trap. Controlling of the trapping potential allows for adjusting the interatomic distances and thus to form linear arrays of atoms serving as a regular grating of microscopic scatterers.

abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics by devising a quantum state of two massive particles with maximally correlated space and momentum coordinates. The EPR criterion qualifies such continuous-variable entangled states, where a measurement of one subsystem seemingly allows for a prediction of the second subsystem beyond the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Up to now, continuous-variable EPR correlations have only been created with photons, while the demonstration of such strongly correlated states with massive particles is still outstanding. Here, we report on the creation of an EPR-correlated two-mode squeezed state in an ultracold atomic ensemble. The state shows an EPR entanglement parameter of 0.18(3), which is 2.4 standard deviations below the threshold 1/4 of the EPR criterion. We also present a full tomographic reconstruction of the underlying many-particle quantum state. The state presents a resource for tests of quantum nonlocality and a wide variety of applications in the field of continuous-variable quantum information and metrology.

abstract: Quantum state transfer between distant nodes is at the heart of quantum processing and quantum networking. Stimulated by this, we propose a scheme where one can highly achieve quantum state transfer between sites in a cavity quantum optomechanical network. There, each individual cell site is composed of a localized mechanical mode which interacts with a laser-driven cavity mode via radiation pressure, and photons exchange between neighboring sites is allowed. After the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of each cell, we show that the system can be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian of two decoupled bosonic chains, and therefore we can apply the well-known results regarding quantum state transfer in conjuction with an additional condition on the transfer times. In fact, we show that our transfer protocol works for any arbitrary quantum state, a result that we will illustrate within the red sideband regime. Finally, in order to give a more realistic scenario we take into account the effects of independent thermal reservoirs for each site. Thus, solving the standard master equation within the Born-Markov approximation, we reassure both the effective model as well as the feasibility of our protocol.

abstract: One of the most sought-after goals in experimental quantum communication is the implementation of a quantum repeater. The performance of quantum repeaters can be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private capacity of a direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way communication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the search for upper bounds. Less than two years ago, Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these capacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels allow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding capacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark the implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels. These channels include the thermal channel, which is a model for lossy channels with added noise in the form of thermal photons, and the additive noise channel, which is a model for quantum noise without losses. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is convex in the set of channels, and we find a connection between the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical capacity. Building on these connections, we obtain bounds for the fading channel, which is a model for quantum communication over the atmosphere, and bounds for general qubit Pauli channels. In particular for the depolarizing channel, our bound is tighter everywhere than the previous bound.

abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanostructures in which a three dimensional potential trap produces an electronic quantum confinement, thus mimicking the behaviour of single atomic dipole-like transitions. However unlike atoms, QDs can be incorporated into solid state photonic devices such as cavities or waveguides that enhance the light-matter interaction. A near unit efficiency light-matter interaction is essential for deterministic, scalable quantum information (QI) devices. In this limit, a single photon input into the device will undergo a large rotation of the polarization of the light field due to the strong interaction with the QD. In this paper we measure a macroscopic ($\sim6^o$) phase shift of light as a result of the interaction with a negatively charged QD coupled to a low quality-factor (Q$\sim290$) pillar microcavity. This unexpectedly large rotation angle demonstrates this simple low Q-factor design would enable near deterministic light-matter interactions.

abstract: We investigate the exact effect on ion trap quantum computation after field quantization. First an exact expression of failure probability from field quantization after many CNOT operations in Cirac-Zoller scheme is given. It is proportional to operation number and the amplitude of $|1\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|1\rangle_x |1\rangle_y$ in initial state, and inverse proportional to mean number of photons and amplitude of $|0\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|0\rangle_x |1\rangle_y$ in initial state. Then we calculate the failure probability when the limitation to mean number of photons in sideband transition is considered. When the initial state is $|1\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|1\rangle_x |1\rangle_y$, after about $10^2$ times of CNOT operations, failure probability is no less than $10^{-2}$, while $10^{-2}$ is the known maximum threshold in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Then when the initial state is $|1\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|1\rangle_x |1\rangle_y$, the number of CNOT gates on the same pair of physical qubits should be no more than $10^2$ in one error-correction period, or else the computation cannot be implemented reliably. This conclusion can help to determine the number of CNOT operations between coding and decoding in one error-correction period in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

One method is using quantum algorithm in the high probability differential finding period for every S-Box. The second method is taking the encryption as a whole, using quantum algorithm in this process.

abstract: How far can we take the resource theoretic approach to explore physics? Resource theories like LOCC, reference frames and quantum thermodynamics have proven a powerful tool to study how agents who are subject to certain constraints can act on physical systems. This approach has advanced our understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and provided operational measures to quantify resources such as entanglement or information content. In this work, we significantly extend the approach and range of applicability of resource theories. Firstly we generalize the notion of resource theories to include any description or knowledge that agents may have of a physical state, beyond the density operator formalism. We show how to relate theories that differ in the language used to describe resources, like micro and macroscopic thermodynamics. Finally, we take a top-down approach to locality, in which a subsystem structure is derived from a global theory rather than assumed. The extended framework introduced here enables us to formalize new tasks in the language of resource theories, ranging from tomography, cryptography, thermodynamics and foundational questions, both within and beyond quantum theory.

abstract: We demonstrate that Ramsey spectroscopy can be used to observe Rydberg-dressed interactions. In contrast to many prior proposals, our scheme operates comfortably within experimentally measured lifetimes, and accesses a regime where quantum superpositions are crucial. The key idea is to build a spin-1/2 from one level that is Rydberg-dressed and another that is not. These levels may be hyperfine or long-lived electronic states. An Ising spin model governs the Ramsey dynamics, for which we derive an exact solution. Due to the structure of Rydberg interactions, the dynamics differs significantly from that in other spin systems. As one example, spin echo can increase the rate at which coherence decays. The results also apply to bare (undressed) Rydberg states as a special case, for which we quantitatively reproduce recent ultrafast experiments without fitting.

abstract: Three-qubit quantum gates are crucial for quantum error correction and quantum information processing. We generate policies for quantum control procedures to design three types of three-qubit gates, namely Toffoli, Controlled-Not-Not and Fredkin gates. The design procedures are applicable to an architecture of nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting artificial atoms. The resultant fidelity for each gate is above 99.9%, which is an accepted threshold fidelity for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We test our policy in the presence of decoherence-induced noise as well as show its robustness against random external noise generated by the control electronics. The three-qubit gates are designed via our machine learning algorithm called Subspace-Selective Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SuSSADE).

Everett defined maverick branches of the state vector as those on which the usual Born probability rule fails to hold -- these branches exhibit highly improbable behaviors, including possibly the breakdown of decoherence or even the absence of an emergent semi-classical reality. An ab initio probability measure is necessary to explain why we do not occupy a maverick branch. Derivations of the Born rule which originate in decision theory or subjective probability do not resolve this problem, because they are circular: they assume, a priori, that we reside on a non-maverick branch.

In our example, there exists a critical boundary of this domain of stability where a further increase of repulsion causes an explosive escape of particles in infinity.

The plot of entanglement measure as a function of the expectation value of Bell operator shows that entanglement measure first decreases and then increases smoothly with increasing quantum violation.

The quantum Weiss-Weinstein bounds (QWWB) include the popular quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) as a special case, and do not require the differentiability of prior distributions and conditional quantum states as the QCRB does; thus, the QWWB is a superior alternative for the QCRB. We show that the QWWB well captures the insurmountable error caused by the ambiguity of the phase in quantum states, which cannot be revealed by the QCRB. Furthermore, we use the QWWB to expose the possible shortcomings of the QCRB when the number of independent and identically distributed systems is not sufficiently large.

abstract: The Clifford algebra over the three-dimensional real linear space includes its linear structure and its exterior algebra, the subspaces spanned by multivectors of the same degree determine a gradation of the Clifford algebra. Through these geometric notions, natural one-to-one and two-to-one homomorphisms from $\mbox{SO}(3)$ into $\mbox{SU}(2)$ are built conventionally, and the set of qubits, is identified with a subgroup of $\mbox{SU}(2)$. These constructions are suitable to be extended to corresponding tensor powers. The notions of qubits, quregisters and qugates are translated into the language of symmetry groups. The corresponding elements to entangled states in the tensor product of Hilber spaces. realise a notion of entanglement in the tensor product of symmetry groups.

abstract: Evolutional entanglement production is defined as the amount of entanglement produced by the evolution operator. This quantity is analyzed for systems whose Hamiltonians are characterized by spin operators. The evolutional entanglement production at the initial stage grows quadratically in time. For longer times, it oscillates, being quasiperiodic or periodic depending on the system parameters.

abstract: We study the coalescence of two bound energy eigenstates embedded in the continuous spectrum of a real pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian of von Neumann-Wigner type and the exceptional point produced by this coalescence. At the exceptional point, the two unnormalized Jost eigenfunctions are no longer linearly independent but coalesce to give rise to a Jordan cycle of generalized bound state eigenfunctions embedded in the continuum and a Jordan block representation of the Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the regular scattering function is unitary, while the time evolution of the generalized eigenfunctions is pseudounitary. We disturb the potential $V[4]$ by means of a truncation, this pertubation breaks the exceptional point in two resonances. The phase shift shows a jump of magnitude 2$\pi$ and the shape of the cross section shows two inverted peaks, this behaviour is due to the interference between the two resonances and the background.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is analyzed thoroughly in the case of the ground and lowest states of two-electron axially symmetric quantum dots under a perpendicular magnetic field. The individual-particle and the center-of-mass representations are used to study the entanglement variation at the transition from interacting to noninteracting particle regimes. The mechanism of symmetry breaking due to the interaction, that results in the states with symmetries related to the later representation only, being entangled even at the vanishing interaction, is discussed. The analytical expression for the entanglement measure based on the linear entropy is derived in the limit of noninteracting electrons. It reproduces remarkably well the numerical results for the lowest states with the magnetic quantum number M>2 in the interacting regime. It is found that the entanglement of the ground state is a discontinuous function of the field strength. A method to estimate the entanglement of the ground state, characterized by the quantum number M, with the aid of the magnetic field dependence of the addition energy is proposed.

abstract: We examine the adiabatic preparation of crystalline phases of Rydberg excitations in a one-dimensional lattice gas by frequency sweep of the excitation laser, as proposed by Pohl et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 193603 (2010)] and recently realized experimentally by Schau{\ss} et al. [Science 347, 1455 (2015)]. We find that the preparation of crystals of a few Rydberg excitations in a unitary system of several tens of atoms requires exceedingly long times for the adiabatic following of the ground state of the system Hamiltonian. Using quantum stochastic (Monte-Carlo) wavefunction simulations, we show that realistic decay and dephasing processes affecting the atoms during the preparation lead to a final state of the system that has only a small overlap with the target crystalline state. Yet, the final number and highly sub-Poissonian statistics of Rydberg excitations and their spatial order are little affected by the relaxations.

abstract: Self testing is a device-independent technique based on non-local correlations whose aim is to certify the effective uniqueness of the quantum state and measurements needed to produce these correlations. It is known that the maximal violation of some Bell inequalities suffices for this purpose. However, most of the existing self-testing protocols for two devices exploit the well-known Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality or modifications of it, and always with two measurements per party. Here, we generalize the previous results by demonstrating that one can construct self-testing protocols based on the chained Bell inequalities, defined for two devices implementing an arbitrary number of two-output measurements. On the one hand, this proves that the quantum state and measurements leading to the maximal violation of the chained Bell inequality are unique. On the other hand, in the limit of a large number of measurements, our approach allows one to self-test the entire plane of measurements spanned by the Pauli matrices X and Z. Our results also imply that the chained Bell inequalities can be used to certify two bits of perfect randomness.

abstract: We extend the definition of quantum discord as a quantifier of nonClassical correlations in a quantum state to the case where weak measurements are performed on subsystem $A$ of a bipartite system $AB$. The properties of weak discord are explored for several families of quantum states. We find that in many cases weak quantum discord is identical to normal discord and in general the values of the two are very close to each other. Weak quantum discord reduces to discord in the appropriate limits as well. We also discuss the implications of these observations on the interpretations of quantum discord.

abstract: We analyze a scheme for storage of entanglement quantified by the quantum Fisher information in the two-axis countertwisting model. A characteristic feature of the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian is the existence of the four stable center and two unstable saddle fixed points in the mean-field phase portrait. The entangled state is generated dynamically from an initial spin coherent state located around an unstable saddle fixed point. At an optimal moment of time the state is shifted to a position around stable center fixed points by a single rotation, where its dynamics and properties are approximately frozen. We also discuss evolution with noise. In some cases the effect of noise turns out to be relatively weak, which is explained by parity conservation.

abstract: The exchange of "information" between a system and its environment based on the reduced dynamics is investigated. The association of trace distance with information cannot be stated, because of lack of symmetry between leakage from the system and absorbability by the environment. A measure of loss for the reduced dynamics is established, which may be seen as a deviation from exact unitary dynamics.

abstract: We study the relationship between source correlations and generated entanglement in the physical context of parametric down-conversion (PDC), a process in which a pump photon is annihilated to produce two entangled photons. In particular, we investigate how the polarization correlations of the pump photon set an upper limit on the two-qubit polarization entanglement of the down-converted photons. We show that for any generation process, that is both non-postselective and entropy-nondecreasing, the concurrence $C(\rho)$ of the generated two-qubit state $\rho$ follows an intrinsic upper bound with $C(\rho)\leq (1+P)/2$, where $P$ is the degree of polarization of the pump photon. We further show that for a special class of two-qubit states $\rho^{\rm (2D)}$ that have only two nonzero diagonal elements, the upper bound on concurrence is the degree of polarization itself, that is, $C(\rho^{\rm (2D)})\leq P$. Our work can have important implications towards deducing upper bounds on multipartite entanglement, for which no universally accepted measure exists.

abstract: We introduce a new class of generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models with su$(m+1)$ spin and long-range non-constant interactions, whose non-degenerate ground state is a Dicke state of su$(m+1)$ type. We evaluate in closed form the reduced density matrix of a block of $L$ spins when the whole system is in its ground state, and study the corresponding von Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. We show that both of these entropies scale as $a\log L$ when $L$ tends to infinity, and that the coefficient $a$ is equal to $(m-k)/2$ in the ground state phase with $k$ vanishing su$(m+1)$ magnon densities. Our results suggest that the class of generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models contains a critical model in each of the $m+1$ ground-state phases, effectively described by a conformal field theory with $m-k$ bosons and $m-k$ fermions. We have also computed the Tsallis entanglement entropy of the ground state of these generalized su$(m+1)$ Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, finding that it can be made extensive by an appropriate choice of its parameter only when $m-k\ge3$. Finally, in the su$(3)$ case we construct in detail the phase diagram of the ground state in parameter space, showing that it is determined in a simple way by the fundamental su$(3)$ weights. This is also true in the su$(m+1)$ case; for instance, we prove that the region for which all the magnon densities are non-vanishing is an $(m+1)$-simplex in $\mathbf R^m$ whose vertices are the fundamental su$(m+1)$ weights.

Furthermore, we address the modelling of system-environment interactions of biomolecules involving bosonic degrees of freedom with a digital-analog approach. Finally, we consider gate-truncated quantum algorithms to allow the study of environmental effects.

abstract: We propose a configuration of a single three-level quantum emitter embedded in a non-equilibrium steady electromagnetic environment, able to stabilize and control the local temperatures of a target system it interacts with, consisting of a collection of coupled two-level systems. The temperatures are induced by dissipative processes only, without the need of further external couplings for each qubit. Moreover, by acting on a set of easily tunable geometric parameters, we demonstrate the possibility to manipulate and tune each qubit temperature independently over a remarkably broad range of values. These findings address one standard problem in quantum-scale thermodynamics, providing a way to induce a desired distribution of temperature among interacting qubits and to protect it from external noise sources.

abstract: We investigate the use of Stark-tuned F\"orster resonances to improve the efficiency of Rydberg-mediated single-photon transistors and the non-destructive detection of single Rydberg atoms. We show that our all-optical detection scheme enables high-resolution spectroscopy of two-state F\"orster resonances, revealing the fine structure splitting of high-n Rydberg states and the non-degeneracy of Rydberg Zeeman substates in finite fields. We show that the 50S_{1/2},48S_{1/2} <-> 49P_{1/2},48P_{1/2} resonance in 87Rb enables a transistor gain G > 100 and all-optical detection fidelity of single Rydberg atoms F > 0.8. Finally, we investigate the Rydberg transistor in coherent operation by reading out the gate photon after scattering source photons. We compare the observed reduction of readout efficiency to a model for the projection of the stored spin wave and phase imprinting by scattered and transmitted source photons and find very good agreement.

abstract: We show that the quantum angle measurement for x-polarized photon number states results in an angle which will never correspond to the y-axis for an odd number of photons; yet for an even number of photons it always can. The analogy of this surprising effect for other particles or ions (qubits in their spin up state) is presented and we show why such an effect cannot be observed in a standard SU(2) interferometer. The quantum phase representation of such an interferometer provides clues as to how its apparatus might be modified in order to demonstrate these phenomena. The same representation is then used to provide insight on the range and sensitivity that one can expect from quantum phase statistical inference algorithms which can surpass the Heisenberg limit.

abstract: The ability to transfer quantum information from one location to another with high fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science. Unfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or a particle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time grows exponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we show that the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniform chain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelity state transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can be tuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\propto N^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with large amplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues. The state transfer time scales as $t\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$ approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$; the error scales as $1-F\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptotically perfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence of external control.

abstract: Free-electron lasers (FELs) produce short and very intense light pulses in the XUV and x-ray regimes. We investigate the possibility to drive Rabi oscillations in xenon with an intense FEL pulse by using the unusually large dipole strength of the giant-dipole resonance (GDR). The GDR decays within less than 30 as due to its position, which is above the $4d$ ionization threshold. We find that intensities around 10$^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ are required to induce Rabi oscillations with a period comparable to the lifetime. The pulse duration should not exceed 100 as because xenon will be fully ionized within a few lifetimes. Rabi oscillations reveal themselves also in the photoelectron spectrum in form of Autler-Townes splittings extending over several tens of electronvolt.

We show that in the supercritical case the spectrum covers the whole real axis. In contrast, for $\lambda$ below the critical value the spectrum is purely discrete and we establish a Lieb-Thirring-type bound on its moments. In the critical case the essential spectrum covers the positive halfline while the negative spectrum can be only discrete, we demonstrate numerically the existence of a ground state eigenvalue.

abstract: We measure photon-occupancy in a thin-film superconducting lumped element resonator coupled to a transmon qubit at 20$\,$mK and find a nonlinear dependence on the applied microwave power. The transmon-resonator system was operated in the strong dispersive regime, where the ac Stark shift ($2\chi$) due to a single microwave photon present in the resonator was larger than the linewidth ($\Gamma$) of the qubit transition. When the resonator was coherently driven at $5.474325\,$GHz, the transition spectrum of the transmon at $4.982\,$GHz revealed well-resolved peaks, each corresponding to an individual photon number-state of the resonator. From the relative peak-heights we obtain the occupancy of the photon-states and the average photon-occupancy $\bar{n}$ of the resonator. We observed a nonlinear variation of $\bar{n}$ with the applied drive power $P_{rf}$ for $\bar{n} < 5$ and compare our results to numerical simulations of the system-bath master equation in the steady state, as well as to a semi-classical model for the resonator that includes the Jaynes-Cummings interaction between the transmon and the resonator. We find good quantitative agreement using both models and analysis reveals that the nonlinear behavior is principally due to shifts in the resonant frequency caused by a qubit-induced Jaynes-Cummings nonlinearity.

abstract: We study corner contributions to holographic mutual information for entangling regions composed of a set of disjoint sectors of a single infinite circle in three-dimensional conformal field theories. In spite of the UV divergence of holographic mutual information, it exhibits a first order phase transition. We show that tripartite information is also divergent for disjoint sectors, which is in contrast with the well-known feature of tripartite information being finite even when entangling regions share boundaries. We also verify the locality of corner effects by studying mutual information between regions separated by a sharp annular region. Possible extensions to higher dimensions and hyperscaling violating geometries is also considered for disjoint sectors.

abstract: The strong interaction of individual quantum emitters with resonant cavities is of fundamental interest for understanding light matter interactions, as well as for quantum information processing and quantum communication applications. Plasmonic cavities hold the promise of attaining the strong coupling regime even under ambient conditions and within subdiffraction volumes. Recent experiments revealed strong coupling between individual plasmonic structures and multiple organic molecules, but so far strong coupling at the limit of a single quantum emitter has not been reported. Here we demonstrate vacuum Rabi splitting, a manifestation of strong coupling, using silver bowtie plasmonic cavities loaded with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). A transparency dip is observed in the scattering spectra of individual bowties with one to a few QDs in their gaps. Rabi splitting values as high as 180 meV are registered with a single QD. These observations are verified by polarization-dependent experiments and validated by electromagnetic calculations.

An influence of a background magnetic field on the vacuum of charged spinor matter confined between two parallel material plates is studied. Employing the most general set of boundary conditions at the plates in the case of the uniform magnetic field directed orthogonally to the plates, we find the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates. In physically plausible situations, the Casimir effect is shown to be repulsive, independently of a choice of boundary conditions and of a distance between the plates.

abstract: A ballistic atom pump is a system containing two reservoirs of neutral atoms or molecules and a junction connecting them containing a localized time-varying potential. Atoms move through the pump as independent particles. Under certain conditions, these pumps can create net transport of atoms from one reservoir to the other. While such systems are sometimes called "quantum pumps," they are also models of classical chaotic transport, and their quantum behavior cannot be understood without study of the corresponding classical behavior. Here we examine classically such a pump's effect on energy and temperature in the reservoirs, in addition to net particle transport. We show that the changes in particle number, of energy in each reservoir, and of temperature in each reservoir vary in unexpected ways as the incident particle energy is varied.

abstract: Suppression of wave scattering and the realization of transparency effects in engineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the past recent years. In this work the problem of transparency is considered for optical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second-order $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility. Because of nonlinear interaction, a reference signal wave at carrier frequency $\omega_1$ can exchange power, thus being amplified or attenuated,when phase matching conditions are satisfied and frequency conversion takes place. Therefore, rather generally the medium is not transparent to the signal wave because of 'scattering' in the frequency domain. Here we show that broadband transparency, corresponding to the full absence of frequency conversion in spite of phase matching, can be observed for the signal wave in the process of sum frequency generation whenever the effective susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a suitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is properly tuned. While broadband transparency is observed under such conditions, the nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective dispersion for the signal wave introduced by the nonlinear interaction.

abstract: In this letter we analyze an optical Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a time-periodic driving of the (2D) optical field repeatedly traversing the resonator, uncovering that resonator twist produces a synthetic magnetic field applied to the light within the resonator, while mirror aberrations produce relativistic dynamics, anharmonic trapping, and spacetime curvature. We develop a Floquet formalism to compute the effective Hamiltonian for the 2D field, generalizing the idea that the intra-cavity optical field corresponds to an ensemble of non-interacting, massive, harmonically trapped particles. This work illuminates the extraordinary potential of optical resonators for exploring the physics of quantum fluids in gauge fields and exotic space-times.

abstract: The electric-field noise above a layered structure composed of a planar metal electrode covered by a thin dielectric is evaluated and it is found that the dielectric film considerably increases the noise level, in proportion to its thickness. Importantly, even a thin (mono) layer of a low-loss dielectric can enhance the noise level by several orders of magnitude compared to the noise above a bare metal. Close to this layered surface, the power spectral density of the electric field varies with the inverse fourth power of the distance to the surface, rather than with the inverse square, as it would above a bare metal surface. Furthermore, compared to a clean metal, where the noise spectrum does not vary with frequency (in the radio-wave and microwave bands), the dielectric layer can generate electric-field noise which scales in inverse proportion to the frequency. For various realistic scenarios, the noise levels predicted from this model are comparable to those observed in trapped-ion experiments. Thus, these findings are of particular importance for the understanding and mitigation of unwanted heating and decoherence in miniaturized ion traps.

abstract: Photoelectron spectra and photoelectron angular distributions obtained in photoionization reveal important information on e.g. charge transfer or hole coherence in the parent ion. Here we show that optimal control of the underlying quantum dynamics can be used to enhance desired features in the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. To this end, we combine Krotov's method for optimal control theory with the time-dependent configuration interaction singles formalism and a splitting approach to calculate photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. The optimization target can account for specific desired properties in the photoelectron angular distribution alone, in the photoelectron spectrum, or in both. We demonstrate the method for hydrogen and then apply it to argon under strong XUV radiation, maximizing the difference of emission into the upper and lower hemispheres, in order to realize directed electron emission in the XUV regime.

abstract: The Schwinger model, or 1+1 dimensional QED, offers an interesting object of study, both at zero and non-zero temperature, because of its similarities to QCD. In this proceeding, we present the a full calculation of the temperature dependent chiral condensate of this model in the continuum limit using Matrix Product States (MPS). MPS methods, in general tensor networks, constitute a very promising technique for the non-perturbative study of Hamiltonian quantum systems. In the last few years, they have shown their suitability as ansatzes for ground states and low-lying excita- tions of lattice gauge theories. We show the feasibility of the approach also for finite temperature, both in the massless and in the massive case.

abstract: We study the transport efficiency of excitations on complex quantum networks with loops. For this we consider sequentially growing networks with different topologies of the sequential subgraphs. This can lead either to a universal complete breakdown of transport for complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs or to optimal transport for ring-like sequential subgraphs. The transition to optimal transport can be triggered by systematically reducing the number of loops of complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs in a small-world procedure. These effects are explained on the basis of the spectral properties of the network's Hamiltonian. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical Monte-Carlo simulations for complex quantum networks with a scale-free size distribution of sequential subgraphs and a small-world-type transition to optimal transport.

abstract: We investigate an atomic ensemble of interacting bosons trapped in a symmetric double well potential in contact with a single tightly trapped ion which has been recently proposed [R. Gerritsma et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 080402 (2012)] as a source of entanglement between a Bose-Einstein condensate and an ion. Compared to the previous study, the present work aims at performing a detailed and accurate many-body analysis of such combined atomic quantum system by means of the ab-initio multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons, which allows to take into account all correlations in the system. The analysis elucidates the importance of quantum correlations in the bosonic ensemble and reveals that entanglement generation between an ion and a condensate is indeed possible, as previously predicted. Moreover, we provide an intuitive picture of the impact of the correlations on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by employing a natural orbital analysis which we show to be indeed experimentally verifiable.

abstract: The micro-world is governed by the laws of Quantum Theory. Although we cannot directly experience Quantum Mechanics in action, it imperceptibly enters our everyday life. It explains the structure of matter on the one hand and stands behind all modern technologies on the other. It also gives a completely different meaning to the classical concept of identical objects. Quantum identical particles are identical not only because they share the same mass, spin, charge, etc., but also because they cannot be identified by tracing their history. Indistinguishability results in a division of the world of elementary particles into fundamentally different families: fermions (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons) and bosons (e.g. photons, gluons, Higgs boson). Identical fermions subjected to the Fermi-Dirac statistics cannot occupy the same quantum state. Here we show yet another, so far undiscovered, consequence of quantum indistinguishability. We show that identical fermions confined by an external trapping potential arrange themselves in spectacular geometric structures although no mutual interaction is present. This is because the indistinguishability of fermions, formulated in the language of the Pauli exclusion principle, prevents any two fermions from being at the same location. These unexplored geometric structures, Pauli crystals, emerge repeatedly in single-shot pictures of the many-body system. Pauli crystals form a previously unknown form of particles' organization. Our results shed some light on the role of quantum statistics -- one of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics of many-body systems.

abstract: The definition of classical transition state theory (TST) as the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that simultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical process. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime impossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as any kind of quantum rate theory that can reproduce the TST in the proper classical limit, which is not guaranteed to be unique. Indeed, there have been various versions of QTST based on different formulations and approximations. Recently, contrary to this commonly accepted view, Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 138}, 084108 (2013)] made an argument that a true and unique QTST can be defined as the exact $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a certain quantum flux-side time correlation function and that it is equivalent to the rate expression from the ring polymer molecular dynamics TST. However, the starting expression for HA's QTST does not appear to have a clear physical basis. In addition, a careful analysis of the formulation underlying HA's arguments clarifies that a key step implicit in their conclusion amounts to an incorrect application of a quantum mechanical identity. As an alternative, we provide a new quantum rate expression by applying a recently developed formalism of real time dynamics of imaginary time path integrals [S. Jang, A. V. Sinitskiy, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 140}, 154103 (2014)] to a well-established rate expression based on quantum linear response theory. In turn, the new rate expression satisfies the property that the $t\rightarrow 0_+ $ limit of QTST should vanish due to quantum delocalization as well as noncommutativity of population and flux operators.

abstract: Light beams can carry a discrete, in principle unbounded amount of angular momentum. Examples of such beams, the Laguerre-Gauss modes, are frequently expressed as solutions of the paraxial wave equation. There, they are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator. The paraxial solutions predict that beams with large OAM could be used to resolve arbitrarily small distances - a dubious situation. Here we show how to solve that situation by calculating the properties of beams free from the paraxial approximation. We find the surprising result that indeed one can resolve smaller distances with larger OAM, although with decreased visibility. If the visibility is kept constant (for instance at the Rayleigh criterion, the limit where two points are reasonably distinguishable), larger OAM does not provide an advantage. The drop in visibility is due to a field in the direction of propagation, which is neglected within the paraxial limit.

abstract: Burning something, (e.g. the proverbial lump of coal, or an encyclopaedia for that matter), in a blackbody furnace leads to an approximately Planck emission spectrum with an average entropy/information transfer of approximately $3.9 \pm 2.5$ bits per emitted photon. This quantitative and qualitative result depends only on the underlying unitarity of the quantum physics of burning, combined with the statistical mechanics of blackbody radiation. The fact that the utterly standard and unitarity preserving process of burning something (in fact, burning anything) nevertheless *has* an associated entropy/information budget, and the quantitative *size* of that entropy/information budget, is a severely under-appreciated feature of standard quantum statistical physics.

abstract: We develop a new lower bound method for analysing the complexity of the Equality function (EQ) in the Simultaneous Message Passing (SMP) model of communication complexity. The new technique gives tight lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ for both EQ and its negation NE in the non-deterministic version of quantum-classical SMP, where Merlin is also quantum $-$ this is the strongest known version of SMP where the complexity of both EQ and NE remain high (previously known techniques seem to be insufficient for this). Besides, our analysis provides to a unified view of the communication complexity of EQ and NE, allowing to obtain tight characterisation in all previously studied and a few newly introduced versions of SMP, including all possible combination of either quantum or randomised Alice, Bob and Merlin in the non-deterministic case. Some of our results highlight that NE is easier than EQ in the presence of classical proofs, whereas the problems have (roughly) the same complexity when a quantum proof is present.

abstract: We review some features of BEC models of black holes obtained by means of the HWF formalism. We consider the KG equation for a toy graviton field coupled to a static matter current in spherical symmetry. The classical field reproduces the Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding quantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with continuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for bound states to form, so that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the system of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the Schwarzschild radius. The HWF is then used to show that the radius of such a system corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the horizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with the increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), in agreement with semiclassical calculations and different from a single very massive particle. The spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$ (the bosons forming the black hole), and a continuous spectrum with energy $\omega > m$ (representing the Hawking radiation and modelled with a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature). The $N$-particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian distribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition function is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a logarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of modes with $\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass.

abstract: We present a proposal for controlling the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules by fixing the phase difference between two oscillating magnetic fields. The scheme is based on the use of a magnetic Feshbach resonance with a field modulation that incorporates terms oscillating with frequencies corresponding to the main resonance and one of the subharmonics. The interference between the two association processes activated by the oscillating terms is controlled via the phase difference. As a result, significant increase or decrease of the effective interaction strength can be achieved. The realization of the proposal is feasible under standard technical conditions. In particular, the method is found to be robust against the effect of the sources of decoherence present in the practical setup. The applicability of the approach to deal with quadratic terms in the field modulation is discussed.

We present a new model of light-induced loss spectra, employing continuum-dressed basis states, that agrees in shape and magnitude with measurements for both broad and narrow resonances.

abstract: We provide a self-contained review of master equation approaches to modelling phonon effects in optically driven self-assembled quantum dots. Coupling of the (quasi) two-level excitonic system to phonons leads to dissipation and dephasing, the rates of which depend on the excitation conditions, intrinsic properties of the QD sample, and its temperature. We describe several techniques, which include weak-coupling master equations that are perturbative in the exciton-phonon coupling, as well as those based on the polaron transformation that can remain valid for strong phonon interactions. We additionally consider the role of phonons in altering the optical emission characteristics of quantum dot devices, outlining how we must modify standard quantum optics treatments to account for the presence of the solid-state environment.

abstract: We examine the performance of our recently developed LFAs-PBE exchange-correlation (XC) potential [C.-R. Pan, P.-T. Fang, and J.-D. Chai, Phys. Rev. A, 2013, 87, 052510] for the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra and related properties of H2+ molecules aligned parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of an intense linearly polarized laser pulse, employing the real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT). The results are compared with the exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation as well as those obtained with other XC potentials in RT-TDDFT. Owing to its correct $(-1/r)$ asymptote, the LFAs-PBE potential significantly outperforms conventional XC potentials for the HHG spectra and the properties that are sensitive to the XC potential asymptote. Accordingly, the LFAs-PBE potential, which has a computational cost similar to that of the popular Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential, can be very promising for the study of the ground-state, excited-state, and time-dependent properties of large electronic systems, extending the applicability of density functional methods for a diverse range of applications.

abstract: The structure of Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex has long been recognized as containing seven bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. Recently, an additional BChl molecule was discovered in the crystal structure of the FMO complex, which may serve as a link between baseplate and the remaining seven molecules. Here, we investigate excitation energy transfer (EET) process by simulating single-molecule pump-dump experiment in the eight-molecules complex. We adopt the coherent modified Redfield theory and non-Markovian quantum jump method to simulate EET dynamics. This scheme provides a practical approach of detecting the realistic EET pathway in BChl complexes with currently available experimental technology. And it may assist optimizing design of artificial light-harvesting devices.

The supercurrent reversals are associated with proximity induced vortices, nucleated along the junction width, where the number of vortices and their locations can be manipulated by means of the superconducting phase difference and the parameters mentioned above.

abstract: In low-rank matrix recovery, one aims to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a minimal number of linear measurements. Within the paradigm of compressed sensing, this is made computationally efficient by minimizing the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate for rank. In this work, we identify an improved regularizer based on the so-called diamond norm, a concept imported from quantum information theory. We show that - for a class of matrices saturating a certain norm inequality - the descent cone of the diamond norm is contained in that of the nuclear norm. This suggests superior reconstruction properties for these matrices and we explicitly characterize this set. We demonstrate numerically that the diamond norm indeed outperforms the nuclear norm in a number of relevant applications: These include signal analysis tasks such as blind matrix deconvolution or the retrieval of certain unitary basis changes, as well as the quantum information problem of process tomography with random measurements. The diamond norm is defined for matrices that can be interpreted as order-4 tensors and it turns out that the above condition depends crucially on that tensorial structure. In this sense, this work touches on an aspect of the notoriously difficult tensor completion problem.

abstract: Maxwell's Demon, 'a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course', has been the centre of much debate about its abilities to violate the second law of thermodynamics. Landauer's hypothesis, that the Demon must erase its memory and incur a thermodynamic cost, has become the standard response to Maxwell's dilemma, and its implications for the thermodynamics of computation reach into many areas of quantum and classical computing. It remains, however, still a hypothesis. Debate has often centred around simple toy models of a single particle in a box. Despite their simplicity, the ability of these systems to accurately represent thermodynamics (specifically to satisfy the second law) and whether or not they display Landauer Erasure, has been a matter of ongoing argument. The recent Norton-Ladyman controversy is one such example. In this paper we introduce a programming language to describe these simple thermodynamic processes, and give a formal operational semantics and program logic as a basis for formal reasoning about thermodynamic systems. We formalise the basic single-particle operations as statements in the language, and then show that the second law must be satisfied by any composition of these basic operations. This is done by finding a computational invariant of the system. We show, furthermore, that this invariant requires an erasure cost to exist within the system, equal to kTln2 for a bit of information: Landauer Erasure becomes a theorem of the formal system. The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be resolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a set of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are provably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

abstract: We propose a notion of quantum control in a quantum programming language which permits the superposition of finitely many quantum operations without performing a measurement. This notion takes the form of a conditional construct similar to the IF statement in classical programming languages. We show that adding such a quantum IF statement to the QPL programming language simplifies the presentation of several quantum algorithms. This motivates the possibility of extending the denotational semantics of QPL to include this form of quantum alternation. We give a denotational semantics for this extension of QPL based on Kraus decompositions rather than on superoperators. Finally, we clarify the relation between quantum alternation and recursion, and discuss the possibility of lifting the semantics defined by Kraus operators to the superoperator semantics defined by Selinger.

abstract: This paper uncovers the fundamental relationship between total and partial computation in the form of an equivalence of certain categories. This equivalence involves on the one hand effectuses, which are categories for total computation, introduced by Jacobs for the study of quantum/effect logic. On the other hand, it involves what we call FinPACs with effects; they are finitely partially additive categories equipped with effect algebra structures, serving as categories for partial computation. It turns out that the Kleisli category of the lift monad (-)+1 on an effectus is always a FinPAC with effects, and this construction gives rise to the equivalence. Additionally, state-and-effect triangles over FinPACs with effects are presented.

At low temperature, such a gas shows both magnetic and superfluid order, and undergoes both density and spin dynamics. These lecture notes present a general overview of the properties of spinor Bose-Einstein gases. The notes are divided in five sections. In the first, we summarize basic properties of multi-component quantum fluids, focusing on the specific case of spinor Bose-Einstein gases and the role of rotational symmetry in defining their properties. Second, we consider the magnetic state of a spinor Bose-Einstein gas, highlighting effects of thermodynamics and Bose-Einstein statistics and also of spin-dependent interactions between atoms. In the third section, we discuss methods for measuring the properties of magnetically ordered quantum gases and present newly developed schemes for spin-dependent imaging. We then discuss the dynamics of spin mixing in which the spin composition of the gas evolves through the spin-dependent interactions within the gas. We discuss spin mixing first from a microscopic perspective, and then advance to discussing collective and beyond-mean-field dynamics. The fifth section reviews recent studies of the magnetic excitations of quantum-degenerate spinor Bose gases. We conclude with some perspectives on future directions for research.

abstract: Motivated by recent results in multiphoton interferometry, we expand a result of Kostant on immanants of an arbitrary $m\times m$ unitary matrix $T\in$ su$(m)$ to the submatrices of $T$. Specifically, we show that immanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum $\sum_{t} D^{(\lambda)}_{tt}(\Omega)$ of the diagonal $D$-functions of group element $\Omega$, with $t$ determined {by} the choice of submatrix, and the irrep $(\lambda)$ determined by the immanant under consideration. We also provide evidence that this result extends to some submatrices that are not principal diagonal, and we discuss how this result can be extended to cases where $T$ carries an su$(m)$ representation that is different from the defining representation.

abstract: We demonstrate hybridization of optical cavity photons with atomic Rydberg excitations using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The resulting dark state Rydberg polaritons exhibit a compressed frequency spectrum and enhanced lifetime indicating strong light-matter mixing. We study the coherence properties of cavity Rydberg polaritons and identify the generalized EIT linewidth for optical cavities. Strong collective coupling suppresses polariton losses due to inhomogeneous broadening, which we demonstrate by using different Rydberg levels with a range of polarizabilities. Our results point the way towards using cavity Rydberg polaritons as a platform for creating photonic quantum materials.

abstract: In the past 50 years, quantum physicists have discovered, and experimentally demonstrated, a phenomenon which they termed superoscillations. Aharonov and his collaborators showed that superoscillations naturally arise when dealing with weak values, a notion that provides a fundamentally different way to regard measurements in quantum physics. From a mathematical point of view, superoscillating functions are a superposition of small Fourier components with a bounded Fourier spectrum, which result, when appropriately summed, in a shift that can be arbitrarily large, and well outside the spectrum. Purpose of this work is twofold: on one hand we provide a self-contained survey of the existing literature, in order to offer a systematic mathematical approach to superoscillations; on the other hand, we obtain some new and unexpected results, by showing that superoscillating sequences can be seen of as solutions to a large class of convolution equations and can therefore be treated within the theory of Analytically Uniform spaces. In particular, we will also discuss the persistence of the superoscillatory behavior when superoscillating sequences are taken as initial values of the Schr\"odinger equation and other equations.

In this work, scalar bosons are described by the Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP) formalism. Considering the DKP oscillator in this background the combined effects of a rotating frames and cosmic string on the equation of motion, energy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed in details. Additionally, the effect of rotating frames on the scalar bosons localization is studied.

It is proposed by Emms, Hancock, Severini and Wilson in 2006, that the spectrum of $S^+(U^3)$, a matrix based on the amplitudes of walks in the quantum walk, distinguishes strongly regular graphs. We probabilistically compute the spectrum of the line intersection graphs of two non-isomorphic generalized quadrangles of order $(5^2,5)$ under this matrix and thus provide strongly regular counter-examples to the conjecture.

abstract: We propose to use optical tweezers to probe the Casimir interaction between microspheres inside a liquid medium for geometric aspect ratios far beyond the validity of the widely employed proximity force approximation. This setup has the potential for revealing unprecedented features associated to the non-trivial role of the spherical curvatures. For a proof of concept, we measure femtonewton double layer forces between polystyrene microspheres at distances above $400$ nm by employing very soft optical tweezers, with stiffness of the order of fractions of a fN/nm. As a future application, we propose to tune the Casimir interaction between a metallic and a polystyrene microsphere in saline solution from attraction to repulsion by varying the salt concentration. With those materials, the screened Casimir interaction may have a larger magnitude than the unscreened one. This line of investigation has the potential for bringing together different fields including classical and quantum optics, statistical physics and colloid science, while paving the way for novel quantitative applications of optical tweezers in cell and molecular biology.

abstract: In this Letter we analyze theoretically how the emergence of collective strong coupling between vibrational excitations and confined cavity modes affects Raman scattering processes. This work is motivated by recent experiments [Shalabney et al., Angew. Chemie 54, 7971 (2015)], which reported enhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the Raman signal. By using different models within linear response theory, we show that the total Raman cross section is maintained constant when the system evolves from the weak-coupling limit to the strong-coupling regime. A redistribution of the Raman signal among the two polaritons is the main fingerprint of vibrational strong coupling in the Raman spectrum.

abstract: Entanglement states are important for both basic research and applied research. However, these entanglement states usually relate to one or several of the particles' physical quantities. Here we theoretically show that a particle-antiparticle pair can form packaged entanglement states which encapsulate all the necessary physical quantities for completely identifying the particles. The particles in the packaged entanglement states are hermaphroditic and indeterminate. Thereafter, we gave a possible experimental scheme for testing the packaged entanglement states. Finally, we proposed a protocol for teleporting a particle to an arbitrarily large distance using the packaged entanglement states. These packaged entanglement states could be important for particle physics and useful in matter teleportation, medicine, remote control, and energy transfer.

abstract: Ultracold polar molecules provide an excellent platform to study quantum many-body spin dynamics, which has become accessible in the recently realized low entropy quantum gas of polar molecules in an optical lattice. To obtain a detailed understanding for the molecular formation process in the lattice, we prepare a density distribution where lattice sites are either empty or occupied by a doublon composed of a bosonic atom interacting with a fermionic atom. By letting this disordered, out-of-equilibrium system evolve from a well-defined initial condition, we observe clear effects on pairing that arise from inter-species interactions, a higher partial wave Feshbach resonance, and excited Bloch-band population. When only the lighter fermions are allowed to tunnel in the three-dimensional (3D) lattice, the system dynamics can be well described by theory. However, in a regime where both fermions and bosons can tunnel, we encounter correlated dynamics that is beyond the current capability of numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that we can probe the microscopic distribution of the atomic gases in the lattice by measuring the inelastic loss of doublons. These techniques realize tools that are generically applicable to heteronuclear diatomic systems in optical lattices and can shed light on molecule production as well as dynamics of a Bose-Fermi mixture.

abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its higher dimensional generalizations by Oshikawa and Hastings require that translationally invariant 2D spin systems with a half-integer spin per unit cell must either have a continuum of low energy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit topological order with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these constraints and a remarkably similar set of constraints at the surface of a 3D interacting topological insulator. This enables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of symmetry-enriched topological phases with translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective theory of symmetry defects. This framework places stringent constraints on the possible types of symmetry fractionalization that can occur in 2D systems whose unit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective representation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine when a topological phase must possess a "spinon" excitation, even in cases when spin rotational invariance is broken down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal structure.

abstract: An Ising-inspired numerical model is developed to study spontaneous quantum teleportation in a quenched spin lattice. Quantum teleportation is an operation that can, using entangled pairs of particles, transport a quantum state across arbitrary distances with high fidelity. In doing so, it destroys the state in one location and relocates it to another. In this context, teleportation serves as a long range interaction that randomly introduces correlations and disorder into a lattice. In addition, different Bell state projection and entangled pair swapping models are also explored, as are the effects of decoherence. The results are compared to the standard Ising model in one- and two-dimensions across several thermodynamic parameters versus temperature.

This fact is explicitly noticed for the case of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians with finite range couplings. After recollecting this fact, we make a comprehensive analysis of the action of the M\"obius transformations on the Riemann surface. We are then able to uncover the origin of some symmetries and dualities of the entanglement entropy already noticed recently in the literature. These results give further support for the use of entanglement entropy to analyse phase transition.

The goal of this paper is to present a tutorial on a different approach: negative probabilities. We do so by presenting the overall theory of negative probabilities in a way that is consistent with contextuality-by-default and by examining with this theory some simple examples where contextuality appears, both in physics and psychology.

abstract: Recently, we have demonstrated that there exists a possible relationship between q-deformed algebras in two different contexts of Statistical Mechanics, namely, the Tsallis' framework and the Kaniadakis' scenario, with a local form of fractional-derivative operators for fractal media, the so-called Hausdorff derivatives, mapped into a continuous medium with a fractal measure. Here, in this paper, we present an extension of the traditional calculus of variations for systems containing deformed-derivatives embedded into the Lagrangian and the Lagrangian densities for classical and field systems. The results extend the classical Euler-Lagrange equations and the Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting dynamical equations seem to be compatible with those found in the literature, specially with mass-dependent and with nonlinear equations for systems in classical and quantum mechanics. Examples are presented to illustrate applications of the formulation. Also, the conserved Nether current, are worked out.

abstract: We describe rapid, random-access loading of a two-dimensional (2D) surface-electrode ion-trap array based on two crossed photo-ionization laser beams. With the use of a continuous flux of pre-cooled neutral atoms from a remotely-located source, we achieve loading of a single ion per site while maintaining long trap lifetimes and without disturbing the coherence of an ion quantum bit in an adjacent site. This demonstration satisfies all major criteria necessary for loading and reloading extensive 2D arrays, as will be required for large-scale quantum information processing. Moreover, the already high loading rate can be increased by loading ions in parallel with only a concomitant increase in photo-ionization laser power and no need for additional atomic flux.

abstract: The coherent quantum dynamics of a single bosonic spin variable, subject to a constraint derived from the quantum spherical model of a ferromagnet, and coupled to an external heat bath, is studied through the Lindblad equation for the reduced density matrix. Closed systems of equations of motion for several quantum observables are derived and solved exactly. The relationship to the single-mode Dicke model from quantum optics is discussed. The analysis of the interplay of the quantum fluctuation and the dissipation and their influence on the relaxation of the time-dependent magnetisation leads to the distinction of qualitatively different regimes of weak and strong quantum couplings. Considering the model's behaviour in an external field as a simple mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a quantum spherical ferromagnet, the magnetic phase diagramme appears to be re-entrant and presents a quantum analogue of well-established classical examples of fluctuation-induced order.

abstract: Despite the importance of the variational principles of physics, there have been relatively few attempts to consider them for a realistic framework. In addition to the old teleological question, this paper continues the recent discussion regarding the modal involvement of the principle of least action and its relations with the Humean view of the laws of nature. The reality of the possible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the perspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept of the possibles striving from essence to existence. This paper introduces a model of a two-level modality based on an intuition that deep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle of least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. The proposed modal interpretation of the principle of least action replaces the classical representation of the system's motion along a single history in the actual modality by the simultaneous motions along an infinite set of all possible histories in the possible modality. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that the principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between the laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and those with a metaphysical necessity.

In the subsequent chemical vapor deposition process, the patterned areas evolve into regular arrays of (001) oriented diamond nano-islands with diameters of <500nm and a height of approx. 60 nm. In the islands, we identify single SiV color centers with narrow zero phonon lines down to 1 nm at room temperature.

abstract: The behaviour of massive fermions is analyzed with scalar and vector potentials. A continuous chiral-conjugation transformation decouples the equation for the upper component of the Dirac spinor provided the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling. It is shown that a Sturm-Liouville perspective is convenient for studying scattering as well as bound states. One possible isolated solution (excluded from the Sturm-Liouville problem) corresponding to a bound state might also come into sight. For potentials with kink-like profiles, beyond the intrinsically relativistic isolated bound-state solution corresponding to the zero-mode solution of the massive Jackiw-Rebbi model in the case of no vector coupling, a finite set of bound-state solutions might appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. It is also shown that the possible isolated bound solution disappears asymptotically as the magnitude of the scalar and vector coupling becomes the same. Furthermore, we show that due to the sizeable mass gain from the scalar background the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime is conformable to comply with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

abstract: This is an attempt of a systematic yet accessible presentation of the Contextuality-by-Default theory. The consideration is confined to finite systems of categorical random variables, which allows us to focus on the basics of the theory without using full-scale measure-theoretic language. Contextuality-by-Default is a theory of random variables identified by their contents and their contexts, so that two variables have a joint distributions if and only if they share a context. Intuitively, the content of a random variable is the entity the random variable measures or responds to, while the context is formed by the conditions under which these measurements or responses obtain. A system of random variables consists of stochastically unrelated to each other "bunches" of jointly distributed random variables sharing a context, while the variables that have the same content in different contexts form "connections" between the bunches. The theory makes use of the notion of a probabilistic coupling, with emphasis on maximal couplings for the connections between the bunches. A maximally connected coupling of the entire system of random variables is defined as one in which all connections have maximal subcouplings. A system is considered noncontextual or contextual according as its maximally connected coupling exists or does not exist. We present a criterion of contextuality for a special class of systems of random variables, called cyclic systems. We also introduce a general measure of contextuality that makes use of (quasi-)couplings whose distributions may involve negative and greater than 1 numbers in place of probabilities.

It turns out that this new model has a quantum nature in that its spectrum of energy eigenstates consists of entangled states. We determine the complete energy spectrum, i.e. the ground states and all the excited states with their degeneracy structure. We calculate the partition function by two different algebraic and combinatorial methods. We also determine the entanglement properties of its ground states.

This is the first non-trivial result on the computational complexity of this problem, which naively amounts to a quadratically-constrained program. Our result applies in particular to the Kronecker polytopes, and therefore to the problem of deciding positivity of the stretched Kronecker coefficients. In contrast, it has recently been shown that deciding positivity of a single Kronecker coefficient is NP-hard in general [Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter, arXiv:1507.02955]. We discuss the consequences of our work in the context of complexity theory and the quantum marginal problem.

In particular, in any compact subset below the positive real axis there are no resonances if the non-zero field is small enough. In contrast to the lack of convergence of the lifetimes computed from the widths of the resonances we show that the "experimental lifetimes" are continuous at zero field. The shape resonances are replaced by an infinite set of other resonances whose location and number we analyze.

In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time [IQS15] (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the "word problem" for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential-time algorithms prior to this work. The main (and simple) technical contribution of this paper is an analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits which solved the same problem in some special cases. We also extend the algorithm to compute the (non-commutative) rank of a symbolic matrix, yielding a factor 2 approximation on the commutative rank. Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections. In particular we explain how some of these sources played an important role in the development of Gurvits' algorithm and in our analysis of it here.

abstract: We present the Redfield quantum master equation (RQME) description for an open system of non-interacting particles (bosons or fermions) on an arbitrary lattice of $N$ sites in any dimension and connected to multiple reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials. For the $N=2$ case, we show that RQME is robust against pathologies one sees in the conventional Lindblad equation approaches. It gives results which agree with exact analytical results for steady state properties and with exact numerics for time-dependent properties. These results can be experimentally relevant for cold atoms, cavity QED and far-from-equilibrium quantum dot experiments.

abstract: Understanding the thermalization process in a pure quantum system is a challenge in theoretical physics. In this work, we explore possible thermalization mechanism in Yang-Mills(YM) theory by using a positive semi-definite quantum distribution function called a Husimi function which is given by a coarse graining of the Wigner function within the minimum uncertainty. Then entropy is defined in terms of the Husimi function, which is called the Husimi-Wehrl(HW) entropy. We propose two numerical methods to calculate the HW entropy. We find that it is feasible to apply the semi-classical approximation with the use of classical YM equation. It should be noted that the semi-classical approximation is valid in the systems of physical interest including the early stage of heavy-ion collisions. Using a product ansatz for the Husimi function, which is confirmed to reproduce the HW entropy within 20% error (overestimate) for a few-body quantum system, we succeed in a numerical evaluation of HW entropy of YM fields and show that it surely has a finite value and increases in time.

abstract: The stochastic mean-field (SMF) approach allows to treat correlations beyond mean-field using a set of independent mean-field trajectories with appropriate choice of fluctuating initial conditions. We show here, that this approach is equivalent to a simplified version of the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy between one-, two-, ..., N-body degrees of freedom. In this simplified version, one-body degrees of freedom are coupled to fluctuations to all orders while retaining only specific terms of the general BBGKY hierarchy. The use of the simplified BBGKY is illustrated with the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. We show that a truncated version of this hierarchy can be useful, as an alternative to the SMF, especially in the weak coupling regime to get physical insight in the effect beyond mean-field. In particular, it leads to approximate analytical expressions for the quantum fluctuations both in the weak and strong coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, it can only be used for short time evolution. In that case, it gives information on the evolution time-scale close to a saddle point associated to a quantum phase-transition. For long time evolution and strong coupling, we observed that the simplified BBGKY hierarchy cannot be truncated and only the full SMF with initial sampling leads to reasonable results.

abstract: We prove that a quantum harmonic oscillator governed by a Lindblad master equation where the typical drive and loss channels are multi-photon processes instead of single-photon ones, converges to a protected subspace spanned by a finite set of coherent states with the same amplitude and uniformly distributed phases. We also show that this convergence features a finite set of bounded invariant observables (Hermitian operators), such that the final state in the protected subspace can be directly predicted from the initial state. The proof includes the full arguments towards the well-posedness of the corresponding dynamics in proper Banach spaces of Hermitian trace-class operators equipped with adapted nuclear norms. It relies on Hille-Yosida theorem and Lyapunov convergence analysis.

abstract: Non-trivial self-adjoint extensions in quantum mechanics have been used in the past to model contact interactions when those interactions are expected a priori. However, real physical systems can only ever be understood to a finite resolution, so there exists a generic ignorance of possible short-range interactions. To address this issue, a real-space approach is described here wherein an artificial boundary is inserted at an intermediate scale to explicitly hide possible short-distance effects. Boundary conditions may then encode physical effects that are hidden behind the boundary, thereby effectively capturing the set of possible UV completions. Using this approach, a non-relativistic analysis is performed of the free particle, harmonic oscillator, and Coulomb potential in three dimensions. Requiring measurable quantities, such as spectra and cross sections, to be independent of the position of the boundary, renormalization group-type equations are derived that determine how the boundary conditions run. Generically, observables differ from their canonical values and symmetries are anomalously broken. Connections are made to well-studied physical systems, such as the deuteron and condensed matter systems that employ Feshbach resonances.

abstract: We study chaos and scrambling in unitary channels by considering their entanglement properties as states. Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.

abstract: The entanglement entropy in many gapless quantum systems receives a contribution from corners in the entangling surface in 2+1d. It is characterized by a universal function $a(\theta)$ depending on the opening angle $\theta$, and contains pertinent low energy information. For conformal field theories (CFTs), the leading expansion coefficient in the smooth limit $\theta \to \pi$ yields the stress tensor 2-point function coefficient $C_T$ . Little is known about $a(\theta)$ beyond that limit. Here, we show that the next term in the smooth limit expansion contains information beyond the 2- and 3-point correlators of the stress tensor. We conjecture that it encodes 4-point data, making it much richer. Further, we establish strong constraints on this and higher order smooth-limit coefficients. We also show that $a(\theta)$ is lower-bounded by a non-trivial function multiplied by the central charge $C_T$ , e.g. $a(\pi/2) \geq (\pi^2 \ln 2)C_T /6$. This bound is nearly saturated by all known results, including recent numerics for the interacting Wilson-Fisher quantum critical points (QCPs). A bound is also given for the R\'enyi entropies. We illustrate our findings using O(N) QCPs, free boson and Dirac fermion CFTs, strongly coupled holographic ones, and other models. Exact results are also given for Lifshitz quantum critical points, and for conical singularities in 3+1d.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a qubit-resonator system, when the resonator is driven by two signals. The interaction of the qubit with the high-amplitude driving we consider in terms of the qubit dressed states. Interaction of the dressed qubit with the second probing signal can essentially change the amplitude of this signal. We calculate the transmission amplitude of the probe signal through the resonator as a function of the qubit's energy and the driving frequency detuning. The regions of increase and attenuation of the transmitted signal are calculated and demonstrated graphically. We present the influence of the signal parameters on the value of the amplification, and discuss the values of the qubit-resonator system parameters for an optimal amplification and attenuation of the weak probe signal.

abstract: We present comprehensive measurement data on the pump and collection beam parameters necessary to achieve high collection efficiency ($89.0 \pm 1.7 \%$) together with high brightness when a single $\beta$-Barium Borate crystal is operated in the thick-crystal regime and pumped with a narrow linewidth laser source. Spectral analysis of the collinear, non-degenerate photons suggest that the effective interaction length within the crystal is dominated by the collection beam mode and the use of longer crystals with increased spatial walk-off does not necessarily lead to a reduced collection efficiency. This result is an important consideration for optical designers who seek to develop practical photon pair sources.

abstract: We study a position-dependent discrete-time quantum walk (QW) in one dimension, whose time-evolution operator is built up from two coin operators which are distinguished by phase factors from $x\geq0$ and $x\leq-1$. We call the QW the ${\it complete\;two}$-${\it phase\;QW}$ to discern from the two-phase QW with one defect[13,14]. Because of its localization properties, the two-phase QWs can be considered as an ideal mathematical model of topological insulators which are novel quantum states of matter characterized by topological invariants. Employing the complete two-phase QW, we present the stationary measure, and two kinds of limit theorems concerning ${\it localization}$ and the ${\it ballistic\;spreading}$, which are the characteristic behaviors in the long-time limit of discrete-time QWs in one dimension. As a consequence, we obtain the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the asymptotic behavior of the walker in the long-time limit. We also clarify relevant symmetries, which are essential for topological insulators, of the complete two-phase QW, and then derive the topological invariant. Having established both mathematical rigorous results and the topological invariant of the complete two-phase QW, we provide solid arguments to understand localization of QWs in term of topological invariant. Furthermore, by applying a concept of ${\it\;topological\;protections}$, we clarify that localization of the two-phase QW with one defect, studied in the previous work[13], can be related to localization of the complete two-phase QW under symmetry preserving perturbations.

abstract: Over the last decade tensor network states (TNS) have emerged as a powerful tool for the study of quantum many body systems. The matrix product states (MPS) are one particular class of TNS and are used for the simulation of (1+1)-dimensional systems. In this proceeding we use MPS to determine the elementary excitations of the Schwinger model in the presence of an electric background field. We obtain an estimate for the value of the background field where the one-particle excitation with the largest energy becomes unstable and decays into two other elementary particles with smaller energy.

abstract: We present a route towards the quantum simulation of exotic quantum magnetism in ion traps by exploiting dual relations between different spin models. Our strategy allows one to start from Hamiltonians that can be realized with current technology, while properties of an exotic dual model are inferred from measurements of non-local, string-order-like, operators. The latter can be achieved from fluorescence, or from certain spectroscopic measurements, both of which can be combined with finite-size scaling by controlling the number of ions in the dual quantum simulator. We apply this concept to propose quantum simulators of frustrated quantum magnets, and Ising models with multi-spin interactions. We test the validity of the idea by showing numerically that the predictions of an ideal dual quantum simulator are not qualitatively modified by relevant perturbations that occur naturally in the trapped-ion scenario.

abstract: Motivated by recent progress in electron quantum optics, we revisit the question of single-electron entanglement, specifically whether the state of a single electron in a superposition of two separate spatial modes should be considered entangled. We first discuss a gedanken experiment with single-electron sources and detectors, and demonstrate deterministic (i. e. without post-selection) Bell inequality violation. This implies that the single-electron state is indeed entangled and, furthermore, nonlocal. We then present an experimental scheme where single-electron entanglement can be observed via measurements of the average currents and zero-frequency current cross-correlators in an electronic Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometer driven by Lorentzian voltage pulses. We show that single-electron entanglement is detectable under realistic operating conditions. Our work settles the question of single-electron entanglement and opens promising perspectives for future experiments.

abstract: Topological phases of matter possess intricate correlation patterns typically probed by entanglement entropies or entanglement spectra. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to assessing topologically induced edge states in free and interacting fermionic systems. We do so by focussing on the fermionic covariance matrix. This matrix is often tractable either analytically or numerically and it precisely captures the relevant correlations of the system. By invoking the concept of monogamy of entanglement we show that highly entangled states supported across a system bi-partition are largely disentangled from the rest of the system, thus appearing usually as gapless edge states. We then define an entanglement qualifier that identifies the presence of topological edge states based purely on correlations present in the ground states. We demonstrate the versatility of this qualifier by applying it to various free and interacting fermionic topological systems.

We investigate the behavior of local compressibility and ground-state fidelity of the Kitaev chain. We show that the topological phase transition is signaled by the maximum of local compressibility at the quantum critical point tuned by the chemical potential. Moreover, a sudden drop of the ground-state fidelity and the divergence of fidelity susceptibility at the topological quantum critical point have been used as a proper indicators for the topological quantum phase transition, which signals the appearance of Majorana fermions. We also present the scaling analysis of ground-state fidelity near the critical point that manifests the universal information about the topological phase transition.

abstract: The quantum Goos-H\"anchen shifts of the transmitted electron beam through an AA-stacked bilayer graphene superlattices is investigated. We found that the band structures of graphene superlattices can have more than one Dirac point, their locations do not depend on the number of barriers. It was revealed that any $n$-barrier structure is perfectly transparent at normal incidence around the Dirac points created in the superlattices. We showed that the Goos-H\"anchen shifts display sharp peaks inside the transmission gap around two Dirac points ($E= V_B + \tau$, $E= V_W + \tau$), which are equal to those of transmission resonances. The obtained Goos-H\"anchen shifts are exhibiting negative as well as positive behaviors and strongly depending on the location of Dirac points. It is observed that the maximum absolute values of the shifts increase as long as the number of barriers is increased. Our analysis is done by considering four cases: single, double barriers, superlattices without and with defect.

abstract: The retrieval of black hole information was recently presented in two interesting proposals in the 'Hawking Radiation' conference: a revised version by G. 't Hooft of a proposal he initially suggested 20 years ago and, a new proposal by S. Hawking. Both proposals address the problem of black hole information loss at the classical level and derive an expression for the scattering matrix. The former uses gravitation back reaction of incoming particles that imprints its information on the outgoing modes. The latter uses supertranslation symmetry of horizons to relate a phase delay of the outgoing wave packet compared to their incoming wave partners. The difficulty in both proposals is that the entropy obtained from them appears to be infinite. By including quantum effects into the Hawking and 't Hooft's proposals, I show that a subtlety arising from the inescapable measurement process, the Quantum Zeno Effect, not only tames divergences but it actually recovers the correct $1/4$ of the area Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law of black holes.

abstract: Electric noise from metallic surfaces is a major obstacle towards quantum applications with trapped ions. Here, we discuss how the same noise source may also lead to pure dephasing of motional quantum states. The mechanism is expected to become relevant at small ion-surface distances. By means of a free induction decay experiment, we measure the dephasing time of the motion of a single ion trapped 50~$\mu$m above a Cu-Al surface. Our measurements may also provide new insights into which specific mechanisms are relevant for the electric noise emitted by metallic surfaces.

abstract: Following recent developments in quantum PageRanking, we present a comparative analysis of discrete-time and continuous-time quantum-walk-based PageRank algorithms. For the discrete-time case, we introduce an alternative PageRank measure based on the maximum probabilities achieved by the walker on the nodes. We demonstrate that the required time of evolution does not scale significantly with increasing network size. We affirm that all three quantum PageRank measures considered here distinguish clearly between outerplanar hierarchical, scale-free, and Erd\"os-R\'enyi network types. Relative to classical PageRank and to different extents, the quantum measures better highlight secondary hubs and resolve ranking degeneracy among peripheral nodes for the networks we studied in this paper.

abstract: We revisit the problem of asymmetric binary hypothesis testing against a composite alternative hypothesis. We introduce a general framework to treat such problems when the alternative hypothesis adheres to certain axioms. In this case we find the threshold rate, the optimal error and strong converse exponents (at large deviations from the threshold) and the second order asymptotics (at small deviations from the threshold). We apply our results to find operational interpretations of various Renyi information measures. In case the alternative hypothesis is comprised of bipartite product distributions, we find that the optimal error and strong converse exponents are determined by variations of Renyi mutual information. In case the alternative hypothesis consists of tripartite distributions satisfying the Markov property, we find that the optimal exponents are determined by variations of Renyi conditional mutual information. In either case the relevant notion of Renyi mutual information depends on the precise choice of the alternative hypothesis. As such, our work also strengthens the view that different definitions of Renyi mutual information, conditional entropy and conditional mutual information are adequate depending on the context in which the measures are used.

abstract: Building a quantum repeater network for long distance quantum communication requires photons and quantum registers that comprise qubits for interaction with light, good memory capabilities and processing qubits for storage and manipulation of photons. Here we demonstrate a key step, the coherent transfer of a photon in a single solid-state nuclear spin qubit with an average fidelity of 98% and storage over 10 seconds. The storage process is achieved by coherently transferring a photon to an entangled electron-nuclear spin state of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond, confirmed by heralding through high fidelity single-shot readout of the electronic spin states. Stored photon states are robust against repetitive optical writing operations, required for repeater nodes. The photon-electron spin interface and the nuclear spin memory demonstrated here constitutes a major step towards practical quantum networks, and surprisingly also paves the way towards a novel entangled photon source for photonic quantum computing.

abstract: We discover novel topological effects in the one-dimensional Kitaev chain modified by long-range Hamiltonian deformations in the hopping and pairing terms. This class of models display symmetry-protected topological order measured by the Berry phase of the ground state and the winding number of the Hamiltonians. For exponentially-decaying hopping amplitudes, the topological sector can be significantly augmented as the penetration length increases, something experimentally achievable. For power-law decaying superconducting pairings, the massless Majorana modes at the edges get paired together into a massive non-local Dirac fermion localised at both edges of the chain: a new topological quasiparticle that we call topological massive Dirac fermion. This topological phase has fractional topological numbers as a consequence of the long-range couplings. Possible applications to current experimental setups and topological quantum computation are also discussed.

abstract: The effect of the minimal length on the thermal properties of a Dirac oscillator is considered. The canonical partition function is well determined by using the method based on Zeta Epstein function. Through this function, all thermodynamics properties, such as the free energy, the total energy, the entropy, and the specific heat, have been determined. Moreover, this study allows us to calculate the values of minimal length \triangle x=\hbar\sqrt{\beta} for some fermionic particles.

abstract: We consider asymptotic behavior of $e^{-itH}f$ for $N$-body Schr\"odinger operator $H=H_0+\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}V_{ij}(x)$ with long- and short-range pair potentials $V_{ij}(x)=V_{ij}^L(x)+V_{ij}^S(x)$ $(x\in {\mathbb R}^\nu)$ such that $\partial_x^\alpha V_{ij}^L(x)=O(|x|^{-\delta-|\alpha|})$ and $V_{ij}^S(x)=O(|x|^{-1-\delta})$ $(|x|\to\infty)$ with $\delta>0$. Introducing the concept of scattering spaces which classify the initial states $f$ according to the asymptotic behavior of the evolution $e^{-itH}f$, we give a generalized decomposition theorem of the continuous spectral subspace ${\mathcal{H}}_c(H)$ of $H$. The asymptotic completeness of wave operators is proved for some long-range pair potentials with $\delta>1/2$ by using this decomposition theorem under some assumption on subsystem eigenfunctions.

abstract: We introduce a scheme for preparation, manipulation, and readout of Majorana zero modes in semiconducting wires with mesoscopic superconducting islands. Our approach synthesizes recent advances in materials growth with tools commonly used in quantum-dot experiments, including gate-control of tunnel barriers and Coulomb effects, charge sensing, and charge pumping. We outline a sequence of milestones interpolating between zero-mode detection and quantum computing that includes (1) detection of fusion rules for non-Abelian anyons using either proximal charge sensors or pumped current; (2) validation of a prototype topological qubit; and (3) demonstration of non-Abelian statistics by braiding in a branched geometry. The first two milestones require only a single wire with two islands, and additionally enable sensitive measurements of the system's excitation gap, quasiparticle poisoning rates, residual Majorana zero-mode splittings, and topological-qubit coherence times. These pre-braiding experiments can be adapted to other manipulation and readout schemes as well.

abstract: A universal quantum computer requires a full set of basic quantum gates. With Majorana bound states one can form all necessary quantum gates in a topologically protected way, bar one. In this manuscript we present a protocol that achieves the missing, so called, $\pi/8$ 'magic' phase gate. The protocol is based on the manipulation of geometric phases in a universal manner, and does not require fine tuning for distinct physical realizations. The protocol converges exponentially with the number of steps in the geometric path. Furthermore, the magic gate protocol relies on the most basic hardware previously suggested for topologically protected gates, and can be extended to any-phase-gate, where $\pi/8$ is substituted by any $\alpha$.

abstract: We explore excitonic energy transfer dynamics in a molecular dimer system coupled to both structured and unstructured oscillator environments. By extending the reaction coordinate master equation technique developed in [J. Iles-Smith, N. Lambert, and A. Nazir, Phys. Rev. A 90, 032114 (2014)], we go beyond the commonly used Born-Markov approximations to incorporate system-environment correlations and the resultant non-Markovian dynamical effects. We obtain energy transfer dynamics for both underdamped and overdamped oscillator environments that are in perfect agreement with the numerical hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, we show that the Zusman equations, which may be obtained in a semiclassical limit of the reaction coordinate model, are often incapable of describing the correct dynamical behaviour. This demonstrates the necessity of properly accounting for quantum correlations generated between the system and its environment when the Born-Markov approximations no longer hold. Finally, we apply the reaction coordinate formalism to the case of a structured environment comprising of both underdamped (i.e. sharply peaked) and overdamped (broad) components simultaneously. We find that though an enhancement of the dimer energy transfer rate can be obtained when compared to an unstructured environment, its magnitude is rather sensitive to both the dimer-peak resonance conditions and the relative strengths of the underdamped and overdamped contributions.

abstract: Excitons in semiconductors are quasiparticle bound states that are formed by the Coulomb interaction between an electron and a hole. Thus, their spectrum is similar to that of hydrogen. However, high-resolution absorption spectroscopy on excited excitons in cuprous oxide have revealed significant deviations from the ideal hydrogen-like series. In atomic physics, the influence of the ionic core and the resulting modifications of the Coulomb interaction are accounted for by the introduction of a quantum defect. Here we translate this concept to the realm of semiconductor physics and show how the complex band dispersion of a crystal, determining the kinetic energies of electrons and holes, is mirrored in a set of empirical parameters similar to the quantum defect in atoms. Experimental data collected from high-resolution absorption spectroscopy in electric fields validate the assignment of the quantum defect to the nonparabolicity of the band dispersion.

abstract: In this paper, the Cherenkov radiation process is investigated in the frame of the Quantum Field Theory, both for the spinless and spin-1/2 charged particles. In the latter case, the polarization density matrix technique was used to account for the spin flip. If compared with the Classical Electrodynamics results, in both cases several quantum corrections arise, coinciding up to the photon's energy linear term. It is shown that, while the absolute value of these corrections significantly relies on the refractive index, the relative quantum correction stays independent of the medium in the case of the ultrarelativistic particles. It the case of the spin-1/2 particles it turns out that the spin flip practically never occurs in this process. For both cases, spinless and spin-1/2, the outgoing photon polarization vector lies always in the plane formed by the initial particle's momentum vector and the final photon's wave vector.

abstract: We deal with the problem of studying the effective theories and the symmetries of long-range models around their critical points. A prominent issue is to determine whether they possess (or not) conformal symmetry (CS) at criticality and how the presence of CS depends on the range of the interactions. To have a model, both simple to treat and interesting, where to investigate these questions, we focus on the Kitaev chain with long-range pairings decaying with distance as power-law with exponent $\alpha$. This is a quadratic solvable model, yet displaying non-trivial quantum phase transitions. By means of a renormalization group approach, we derive its effective theory close to criticality. The effective action is the sum of two terms: a Dirac action $S_D$, found in the short-range Ising universality class, and a CS breaking term $S_{AN}$. While the Dirac action originates from low-energy excitations in the spectrum, the CS breaking term $S_{AN}$ originates from high-energy modes. At criticality, $S_{AN}$ flows to zero for $\alpha > 2$, while for $\alpha < 2$ it dominates and determines the breakdown of the CS. From the effective theory one can also see that new phases emerge for $\alpha<1$. Out of criticality $S_{AN}$ breaks, in the considered approximation, the effective Lorentz invariance (ELI) for every finite $\alpha$. In the short-range limit the ELI is restored. In order to test the validity of the determined effective theory, we compared the two-fermion static correlation functions and the von Neumann entropy obtained from it with the ones calculated on the lattice, finding agreement. The proposed scenario is expected to hold in other long-range models displaying quasiparticle excitations in ballistic regime.

abstract: Following our previous paper, Bergeron et al, Smooth quantum dynamics of the mixmaster universe Phys. Rev. D 92, 061302(R) (2015), concerning the quantization of the vacuum Bianchi IX model and the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer framework, we present a further analysis of the dynamical properties of the model. We apply the harmonic approximation of the anisotropy potential in order to obtain manageable dynamical equations. We study the quantum anisotropic oscillations during the bouncing phase of the universe. Neglecting the backreaction from transitions between quantum anisotropy states we obtain analytical results. In particular, we identify a parameter which is associated with dynamical properties of the quantum model and describes a sort of phase transition. Once the parameter exceeds its critical value, the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down. The application of the present result to a realistic model of the Universe indicates that the parameter indeed exceeds its critical value and that there should have taken place a huge production of anisotropy at the bounce. This in turn must have led to a sustained phase of accelerated expansion, an inflationary-like phase. However, the quantitative inclusion of backreaction is postponed until a follow-up paper based on the vibronic approach.

abstract: Shape dynamics is a theory first proposed by Julian Barbour which states that physics happen uniquely in the reduced configuration space of a theory. So far, studies in the area have focused on gravitational systems. Here we first contemplate on the implications of this idea on quantum mechanics. We summarize the idea of shape dynamics and then give physical configurations of multi qubit systems. It is observed that inclusion of the spacetime curvature introduces a new qubit degree of freedom. This is a novel effect of general relativity on a quantum system. Our aim in the grand picture, is to initiate a research program translating classical shape dynamics to quantum realm.

abstract: This work establishes connection between channel simulation and coded source compression. First, we consider classical source coding with quantum side-information where the quantum side-information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory by Winter, a quantum to classical channel simulation. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal rate region. We then study coded source compression in the fully quantum regime. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. Our work hence resolves coded source compression in the quantum regime.

abstract: Stochastic chains represent a wide and key variety of phenomena in many branches of science within the context of Information Theory and Thermodynamics. They are typically approached by a sequence of independent events or by a memoryless Markov process. Here, we demonstrate that when memory is introduced, the statistics of the system depends on the mechanism by which objects or symbols are assembled, even in the slow dynamics limit wherein friction can be neglected. To analyse these systems, we introduce a sequence-dependent partition function, investigate its properties and compare it to the standard normalization defined by the statistical physics of ensembles. Then, we study the behaviour of the entropy and the internal energy in this intrinsic, directional chains finding that they vary around their thermally-induced equilibrium analogues due to memory effects. We anticipate that our results are necessary to interpret configurational order and information transfer in many molecular systems within Materials Science, Biophysics, Communication and Engineering.

abstract: All quantum optomechanics experiments to date operate at cryogenic temperatures, imposing severe technical challenges and fundamental constraints. Here we present a novel design of on-chip mechanical resonators which exhibit fundamental modes with frequencies $f$ and mechanical quality factors $Q_\mathrm{m}$ sufficient to enter the optomechanical quantum regime at room temperature. We overcome previous limitations by designing ultra-thin, high-stress silicon nitride membranes, with tensile stress in the resonators' clamps close to the ultimate yield strength of the material. By patterning a photonic crystal on the SiN membranes, we observe reflectivities greater than 99%. These on-chip resonators have remarkably low mechanical dissipation, with $Q_\mathrm{m}$$\sim$$10^8$, which makes them a unique platform for experiments towards the observation of massive quantum behavior at room temperature.

subjects: Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) phases of matter are the product-state analogue of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. This means, SPt phases can be adiabatically connected to a product state by some path that preserves the protecting symmetry. Moreover, SPt and SPT phases can be adiabatically connected to each other when interaction terms that break the symmetries protecting the SPT order are added in the Hamiltonian. It is also known that spin-1 SPT phases in quantum spin chains can emerge as effective intermediate phases of spin-2 Hamiltonians. In this paper we show that a similar scenario is also valid for SPt phases. More precisely, we show that for a given spin-2 quantum chain, effective intermediate spin-1 SPt phases emerge in some regions of the phase diagram, these also being adiabatically connected to non-trivial intermediate SPT phases. We characterize the phase diagram of our model by studying quantities such as the entanglement entropy, symmetry-related order parameters, and 1-site fidelities. Our numerical analysis uses Matrix Product States (MPS) and the infinite Time-Evolving Block Decimation (iTEBD) method to approximate ground states of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we provide a field theory description of the quantum phase transitions between the SPt phases. Together with the numerical results, such a description shows that the transitions can be described by Conformal Field Theories (CFT) with central charge $c=1$. Our results are in agreement, and further generalize, those in [Y. Fuji, F. Pollmann, M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 177204 (2015)].

Finally, we present several numerical examples of rejection filtering that show its ability to track time dependent parameters in online settings and also benchmark its performance on MNIST classification problems.

abstract: The electron spin in semiconductor quantum dot can be coherently controlled by an external electric field, an effect called electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR). There are several mechanisms underlie the EDSR effect, among which there is a hyperfine mechanism, where the spin-electric coupling is mediated by the electron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. Here, we investigate the influence of the frequency modulation (FM) on the spin-flip efficiency. Our results reveal that FM plays an important role in the hyperfine mechanism. Without FM, the electric field almost cannot flip the electron spin, the spin-flip probability is only about 20%. While under the FM, the spin- flip probability can be improved approximately to 70%. Especially, we find that the modulation amplitude has a lower bound, which is related to the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field.

abstract: Electron transport through mesoscopic, one-dimensional rings with asymmetric injection into the arms of the ring is studied, in the presence of a Aharonov-Bohm flux, by means of an appropriate $\boldsymbol{S}$ matrix. This matrix is expressed in terms of two parameters one of which ($\lambda$) accounts phenomenologically for this asymmetric injection into the arms of the ring. In addition, the effect of a scatterer placed in one arm of the ring is considered. Explicit expressions are obtained for the transmission as a function of the incident electron energy, the magnetic field, the asymmetry parameter $\lambda$, and the strength of the scatterer. Results of the literature for symmetric rings are described by $\lambda=1$ and readily recovered. We relate our results to rings of finite width.

abstract: The standard uncertainty relations (UR) in quantum mechanics are typically used for unbounded operators (like the canonical pair). This implies the need for the control of the domain problems. On the other hand, the use of (possibly bounded) functions of basic observables usually leads to more complex and less readily interpretable relations. Also, UR may turn trivial for certain states if the commutator of observables is not proportional to a positive operator. In this letter we consider a generalization of standard UR resulting from the use of two, instead of one, vector states. The possibility to link these states to each other in various ways adds additional flexibility to UR, which may compensate some of the above mentioned drawbacks. We discuss applications of the general scheme, leading not only to technical improvements, but also to interesting new insight.

abstract: Superfluidity is a remarkable manifestation of quantum many-body effects at the macroscopic scale. Various features of superfluidity in liquid He and Bose-Einstein condensates remain challenging to study, limited by the complexity of the experiments or difficulty in measuring in situ all parameters of the wave function. There is therefore a continuous search for alternative superfluids to address these challenges. We demonstrate superfluid behaviour in a room-temperature system that relies on photons rather than atoms for the supporting fluid medium. The repulsive photon- photon interaction is mediated by a thermal optical nonlinearity and is inherently nonlocal. We experimentally observe the nucleation of quantised vortices from an extended physical obstacle and the nonlocal nature of the fluid is shown to deform the vortex geometry. Our results show that photon fluids provide a valid alternative to other superfluids with applications from the study of nonlinear wave turbulence and analogue gravity to artificial gauge fields.

These two approaches has different but overlapping areas of validity, phenomenology and set of physical outcomes. In this paper we discuss the relation between CT and ETH and propose a formulation of ETH in terms of the reduced density matrix. We provide strong numerical evidences for the proposal.

abstract: A periodically driven quantum system, when coupled to a thermal bath, relaxes to a non-equilibrium asymptotic state. To describe these states in the case of infinitesimal coupling, the notion of Floquet-Gibbs state was recently introduced. A Floquet-Gibbs state is characterized by a density matrix diagonal in the Floquet basis of the decoupled coherent system. The diagonal elements obey the Boltzmann distribution parametrized by the quasienergies of the Floquet states. It was pointed out that the Floquet-Gibbs states are realized under strict conditions that might be experimentally infeasible. Here, by using the Magnus expansion and the concept of effective Floquet Hamiltonian, we go beyond the conventionally used rotating-wave approximation and demonstrate that the condition of infinitesimal coupling can be lifted and the idea of Floquet-Gibbs states can be extended to a broader class of open quantum systems possessing finite dissipation.

abstract: We analyze a family of singular Schr\"odinger operators with local singular interactions supported by a hypersurface $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 2$, being the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, bounded or unbounded, not necessarily connected. At each point of $\Sigma$ the interaction is characterized by four real parameters, the earlier studied case of $\delta$- and $\delta'$-interactions being particular cases. We discuss spectral properties of these operators and derive operator inequalities between those referring to the same hypersurface but different couplings and describe their implications for spectral properties.

title: Firewalls, black-hole thermodynamics, and singular solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation
authors: Wojciech H. Zurek, Don N. Page
comments: We study self-gravitating spherically symmetric fluid with a mass of a black hole surrounded by Hawking radiation. Solutions cross r=2M without encountering coordinate singularity to reach a firewall-like "Planck cocoon" with entropy close to black hole entropy. We reproduce our paper with an updated title and abstract. For a later study with similar results see G. 't Hooft, gr-qc/9706058

abstract: We investigate thermodynamic equilibrium of a self-gravitating perfect fluid in a spherically symmetric system containing a black hole of mass M by means of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. At r >> 2M its solutions describe a black-body radiation atmosphere with the Hawking temperature T_BH~1/(8 \pi M) that is increasingly blueshifted as r approaches 2M. However, there is no horizon at the Schwarzschild radius. Instead, the fluid becomes increasingly hot and dense there, piling up into a "firewall" with the peak temperatures and densities reaching Planck values somewhat below r = 2M. This firewall surrounds a negative point mass residing at r=0, the only singularity of the solution. The entropy of the firewall is comparable to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

abstract: We estimate the critical thresholds of bond and site percolation on nonplanar, effectively two-dimensional graphs with Chimera-like topology. The building blocks of these graphs are complete and symmetric bichromatic subgraphs of size $2n$, referred to as $K_{n,n}$ graphs. For the numerical simulations we use an efficient union-find based algorithm and employ a finite-size scaling analysis to obtain the critical properties for both bond and site percolation. We report the respective percolation thresholds for different sizes of the bichromatic subgraph and verify that the associated universality class is that of standard two-dimensional percolation. For the canonical Chimera graph used in the D-Wave Inc. quantum annealer ($n = 4$), we discuss device failure in terms of network vulnerability, i.e., we determine the critical fraction of qubits and couplers that can be absent due to random failures prior to losing large-scale connectivity throughout the device.

abstract: We propose a simple approach to measure the energy of the few-eV isomeric state in Th-229. To this end, U-229 nuclei are doped into VUV-transparent crystals, where they undergo alpha decay into Th-229, and, with a probability of 2%, populate the isomeric state. These Th-229m nuclei may decay into the nuclear ground state under emission of the sought-after VUV gamma, whose wavelength can be determined with a spectrometer. Based on measurements of the optical transmission of U:CaF2 crystals in the VUV range, we expect a signal at least 2 orders of magnitude larger compared to current schemes using surface-implantation of recoil nuclei. The signal background is dominated by Cherenkov radiation induced by beta decays of the thorium decay chain. We estimate that, even if the isomer undergoes radiative de-excitation with a probability of only 0.1%, the VUV gamma can be detected within a reasonable measurement time.

abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of the difference of two random density matrices, each sampled independently from the so-called Fixed Trace Wishart-Laguerre (FTWL) Ensemble, the ensemble that results from tracing out a Haar-sampled bipartite random pure state. We first show how a closed-form expression for the exact joint eigenvalue distribution for arbitrary dimensions can be obtained from the joint distribution of the diagonal elements of the difference matrix, which is easy to compute. Subsequently, we use standard results from free probability theory to derive a relatively simple analytic expression for the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution (AED) of the difference matrix ensemble. The obtained upper support point of these distributions provides the asymptotic operator norm distance between two independent random samples from the FTWL. Finally, we use Carlson's theorem to derive an expression for the absolute moments of the resulting AED, from which the asymptotic trace distance between the two states is obtained.

abstract: Harvesting of sunlight underpins Life on Earth as well as driving novel energy device design. Though several experiments suggest that excitation energy transport and charge separation within a photosynthetic membrane may benefit from the quantum nature of their dynamics, the effects of spatial coherences in the incident light have been largely ignored. Here we show that spatial correlations in the incident light likely play an important role in trapping light and adding robustness, as well as providing a driving mechanism for an organism's adaptation toward more ordered structures. Our theory is grounded by empirical inputs, while its output is validated against testable predictions. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal correlations between photons, a fundamental property of the quantum world, should play a key role in our understanding of early Life and in improving the design of artificial photosynthetic systems.

abstract: Controlling the internal degrees of freedom is a key challenge for applications of cold and ultracold molecules. Here, we demonstrate rotational-state cooling of trapped methyl fluoride molecules (CH3F) by optically pumping the population of 16 M-sublevels in the rotational states J=3,4,5, and 6 into a single level. By combining rotational-state cooling with motional cooling, we increase the relative number of molecules in the state J=4, K=3, M=4 from a few percent to over 70%, thereby generating a translationally cold (~30mK) and nearly pure state ensemble of about 10^6 molecules. Our scheme is extendable to larger sets of initial states, other final states and a variety of molecule species, thus paving the way for internal-state control of ever larger molecules.

abstract: The filter function formalism quantitatively describes the dephasing of a qubit by a bath that causes Gaussian fluctuations in the qubit energies with an arbitrary noise power spectrum. Here, we extend this formalism to account for more general types of noise that couple to the qubit through terms that do not commute with the qubit's bare Hamiltonian. Our approach applies to any power spectrum that generates slow noise fluctuations in the qubit's evolution. We demonstrate our formalism in the case of singlet-triplet qubits subject to both quasistatic nuclear noise and $1/\omega^\alpha$ charge noise and find good agreement with recent experimental findings. This comparison shows the efficacy of our approach in describing real systems and additionally highlights the challenges with distinguishing different types of noise in free induction decay experiments.

abstract: We show that the generating functional for scalar theories admits a representation which is dual with respect to the one by Schwinger, interchanging the role of the free and interacting terms. It maps $\int V(\delta_J)$ and $J\Delta J$ to $\delta_{\phi_c}\Delta\delta_{\phi_c}$ and $\int V(\phi_c)$, respectively, with $\phi_c=\int J\Delta$ and $\Delta$ the Feynman propagator. Comparing the Schwinger representation with its dual version leads to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff relation $$ \exp(Z_0[J]) \exp(-\smallint V(\delta_J))\exp(-Z_0[J]) = \exp(-Z_0[\delta_{\phi_c}])\exp(-\smallint V(\phi_c)) $$

abstract: In this paper, we attempt the theoretical modeling of the magnetic tunnel junctions with embedded magnetic and nonmagnetic nanoparticles (NPs). A few abnormal tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effects, observed in related experiments, can be easily simulated within our model: we found, that the suppressed TMR magnitudes and the TMR sign-reversing effect at small voltages are related to the electron momentum states of the NP located inside the insulating layer. All these TMR behaviors can be explained within the tunneling model, where NP is simulated as a quantum well (QW). The coherent (direct) double barrier tunneling is dominating over the single barrier one. The origin of the TMR suppression is the quantized angle transparency for spin polarized electrons being in one of the lowest QW states. The phenomenon was classified as the quantized conductance regime due to restricted geometry.

abstract: Recently I proposed the linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This turn from physics to language does not only extend quantum theory to classical theory but also yield the quantum mechanical world view. Although the wave function collapse is prohibited in the linguistic interpretation, in this paper I show that the phenomenon like wave function collapse can be realized in the linguistic interpretation. And furthermore, I propose the justification of the von Neumann-L\"uders projection postulate. After all, I conclude that the wave function collapse should not be adopted in the Copenhagen interpretation.

abstract: We challenge the hypothesis that the ground states of a physical system whose degeneracy depends on topology must necessarily realize topological quantum order and display non-local entanglement. To this end, we introduce and study a classical rendition of the Toric Code model embedded on Riemann surfaces of different genus numbers. We find that the minimal ground state degeneracy (and those of all levels) depends on the topology of the embedding surface alone. As the ground states of this classical system may be distinguished by local measurements, a characteristic of Landau orders, this example illustrates that topological degeneracy is not a sufficient condition for topological quantum order. This conclusion is generic and, as shown, it applies to many other models. We also demonstrate that in certain lattice realizations of these models, and other theories, one can find a ground state entropy that is ``holographic", i.e., extensive in the system's boundary. We find that clock and $U(1)$ gauge theories display topological or holographic (in addition to gauge) degeneracies.

abstract: Ultrafast laser pulses have been used to manipulate complex quantum materials and to induce dynamical phase transitions. One of the most striking examples is the transient enhancement of superconductivity in several classes of materials upon irradiating them with high intensity pulses of terahertz light. Motivated by these experiments we analyze the Cooper pairing instabilities in non-equilibrium electron-phonon systems. We demonstrate that the light induced non-equilibrium state of phonons results in the following phenomena: an increase in the time averaged superconducting coupling constant, its periodic modulation, and an increase in the electron scattering. While the first two enhance Cooper pairing, the third one suppresses it. We analyze the competition between these effects and show that in a broad range of parameters the dynamic enhancement of pair formation dominates over the increase in the scattering rate. This opens the possibility of transient light induced superconductivity at temperatures that are considerably higher than the equilibrium transition temperatures. Our results pave new pathways for engineering high-temperature light-induced superconducting states.

abstract: A pure quantum state is called $k$-uniform if all its reductions to $k$-qudit are maximally mixed. We investigate the general constructions of $k$-uniform pure quantum states of $n$ subsystems with $d$ levels. We provide one construction via symmetric matrices and the second one through classical error-correcting codes. There are three main results arising from our constructions. Firstly, we show that for any given even $n\ge 2$, there always exists an $n/2$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state of level $p$ for sufficiently large prime $p$. Secondly, both constructions show that their exist $k$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum states such that $k$ is proportional to $n$, i.e., $k=\Omega(n)$ although the construction from symmetric matrices outperforms the one by error-correcting codes. Thirdly, our symmetric matrix construction provides a positive answer to the open question in \cite{DA} on whether there exists $3$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum state for all $n\ge 8$. In fact, we can further prove that, for every $k$, there exists a constant $M_k$ such that there exists a $k$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state for all $n\ge M_k$. In addition, by using concatenation of algebraic geometry codes, we give an explicit construction of $k$-uniform quantum state when $k$ tends to infinity.

abstract: Quantum tensor network states and more particularly projected entangled-pair states provide a natural framework for representing ground states of gapped, topologically ordered systems. The defining feature of these representations is that topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying tensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a systematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates entanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of fusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a C*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central idempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected entangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such as topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be extracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are acting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson loops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the possibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group fixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of discrete gauge theories and string-net models.

abstract: Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide intriguing new platforms to explore novel quantum physics beyond natural conditions of solids. Recent experiments demonstrated the one-dimensional (1D) SO coupling for boson and fermion gases. However, realization of 2D SO interaction, a much more important task, remains very challenging. Here we propose and experimentally realize, for the first time, 2D SO coupling and topological band with $^{87}$Rb degenerate gas through a minimal optical Raman lattice scheme, without relying on phase locking or fine tuning of optical potentials. A controllable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO effects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the atomic cloud distribution and spin texture in the momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including the highly-sought-after topological superfluid phases.

abstract: We address the development of geometric phases in classical and quantum magnetic moments (spin-1/2) precessing in an external magnetic field. We show that nonadiabatic dynamics lead to a topological phase transition determined by a change in the driving field topology. The transition is associated with an effective geometric phase which is identified from the paths of the magnetic moments in a spherical geometry. The topological transition presents close similarities between SO(3) and SU(2) cases but features differences in e.g. the limiting values of the geometric phases. We discuss possible experiments where the effective geometric phase would be observable.

abstract: We reconsider the moments of the reduced density matrix of two disjoint intervals and of its partial transpose with respect to one interval for critical free fermionic lattice models. It is known that these matrices are sums of either two or four Gaussian matrices and hence their moments can be reconstructed as computable sums of products of Gaussian operators. We find that, in the scaling limit, each term in these sums is in one-to-one correspondence with the partition function of the corresponding conformal field theory on the underlying Riemann surface with a given spin structure. The analytical findings have been checked against numerical results for the Ising chain and for the XX spin chain at the critical point.

abstract: We demonstrate that irreversibility arises from the principle of microscopic reversibility and the presence of memory in the time evolution of a single copy of a system driven by a protocol. We introduce microscopic reversibility by using the concept of protocol- and pathway-dependent thermodynamic function, as defined in J.R. Arias-Gonzalez, arXiv:1511.08017 [cond-mat.stat-mech], and memory by using the concept of non-Markovianity, as in J.R. Arias-Gonzalez, arXiv:1511.06139 [cond-mat.stat-mech]. We define work as the change in free energy and heat as the change in entropy for micoscopic, individual pathways of a system subject to a protocol. We find that all non-equilibrium statistics emerge naturally. In particular, we derive most known fluctuation theorems and formulate two others. While the conservation of energy is invoked both at the level of the individual pathway and in ensemble-average processes, the second law of thermodynamics and the time arrow, which are only fulfilled in ensemble-average processes, are shown to be consequences of microscopic reversibility and non-Markovianity.

abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) dissemination of frequency standards is ubiquitous at present, providing the most widespread time and frequency reference for the majority of industrial and research applications worldwide. On the other hand, the ultimate limits of the GPS presently curb further advances in high-precision, scientific and industrial applications relying on this dissemination scheme. Here, we demonstrate that these limits can be reliably overcome even in laboratories without a local atomic clock by replacing the GPS with a 642-km-long optical fiber link to a remote primary caesium frequency standard. Through this configuration we stably address the $^1$S$_0$---$^3$P$_0$ clock transition in an ultracold gas of $^{173}$Yb, with a precision that exceeds the possibilities of a GPS-based measurement, dismissing the need for a local clock infrastructure to perform high-precision tasks beyond GPS limit. We also report an improvement of two orders of magnitude in the accuracy on the transition frequency reported in literature.

abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that a cloud of cold atoms with a size comparable to the wavelength of light can induce large group delays on a laser pulse when the laser is tightly focused on it and is close to an atomic resonance. Delays as large as -10 ns are observed, corresponding to "superluminal" propagation with negative group velocities as low as -300 m/s. Strikingly, this large delay is associated with a moderate extinction owing to the very small size of the cloud and to the light-induced interactions between atoms. It implies that a large phase shift is imprinted on the continuous laser beam, and opens interesting perspectives for applications to quantum technologies.

To be specific, we prove one-shot achievability and converse bounds on the coding rates for distributed source coding, source coding with coded side information available at the decoder and source coding under maximum distortion criterion. The one-shot bounds obtained are in terms of smooth max Renyi entropy and smooth max Renyi divergence. Our results are powerful enough to yield the results that are known for these problems in the asymptotic regime both in the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) and non-i.i.d. settings

abstract: We numerically study the unitary time evolution of a nonintegrable model of hard-core bosons with an extensive number of local Z2 symmetries. We find that the expectation values of local observables in the stationary state are described better by the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) than by the canonical ensemble. We also find that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fails for the entire spectrum, but holds true within each symmetry sector, which justifies the GGE. In contrast, if the model has only one global Z2 symmetry or a size-independent number of local Z2 symmetries, we find that the stationary state is described by the canonical ensemble. Thus, the GGE is necessary to describe the stationary state even in a nonintegrable system if it has an extensive number of local symmetries.

abstract: In this paper we study an su($m$) invariant open version of the Haldane-Shastry spin chain whose ground state can be obtained from the chiral correlator of the $c=1$ free boson boundary conformal field theory (CFT). We show that this model is integrable for a suitable choice of the chain sites depending on the roots of the Jacobi polynomial $P_N^{\beta-1,\beta'-1}$, where $N$ is the number of sites and $\beta$, $\beta'$ are two positive parameters. We also compute in closed form the first few non-trivial conserved charges arising from the twisted Yangian invariance of the model. We evaluate the chain's partition function in closed form, and deduce a complete description of the spectrum in terms of Haldane's motifs and a related classical vertex model. Using this description, we are able to show that the chain's level density is normally distributed in the thermodynamic limit. We also prove that in this limit the number of distinct levels is at most ${\rm O}(N^7)$, which implies that the degeneracy of the spectrum is much higher than for a typical Yangian-invariant model.

abstract: In the study of open quantum systems modeled by a unitary evolution of a bipartite Hilbert space, we address the question of which parts of the environment can be said to have a "classical action" on the system, in the sense of acting as a classical stochastic process. Our method relies on the definition of the Environment Algebra, a relevant von Neumann algebra of the environment. With this algebra we define the classical parts of the environment and prove a decomposition between a maximal classical part and a quantum part. Then we investigate what other information can be obtained via this algebra, which leads us to define a more pertinent algebra: the Environment Action Algebra. This second algebra is linked to the minimal Stinespring representations induced by the unitary evolution on the system. Finally in finite dimension we give a characterization of both algebras in terms of the spectrum of a certain completely positive map acting on the states of the environment.

abstract: We resolve the real-time dynamics of a purely dissipative $s = 1/2$ quantum spin or, equivalently, hard-core boson model on a hypercubic $d$-dimensional lattice. The considered quantum dissipative process drives the system to a totally symmetric macroscopic superposition in each of the $S^3$-sectors. Different characteristic time scales are identified for the dynamics and we determine their finite-size scaling. We introduce the concept of cumulative entanglement distribution to quantify multi-particle entanglement and show that the considered protocol serves as an efficient method to prepare a macroscopically entangled Bose-Einstein condensate.

abstract: We study the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement between finite subsystems of infinite two-dimensional free lattice models, as measured by the logarithmic negativity. For adjacent regions with a common boundary, we observe that the negativity follows a strict area law for a lattice of harmonic oscillators, whereas for fermionic hopping models the numerical results indicate a multiplicative logarithmic correction. In this latter case, we conjecture a formula for the prefactor of the area-law violating term, which is entirely determined by the geometries of the Fermi surface and the boundary between the subsystems. The conjecture is tested against numerical results and a good agreement is found.

abstract: In the present paper we have considered the quantum theory of a charge moving in a torus knot in the presence of a uniform magnetic field along the axis of the torus in a semiclassical quantization framework. We show that the energy levels and fractional spin depend on the torus knot parameters that specifies its' non-planar features.

abstract: We model the decoherence and dephasing of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond due to a noisy paramagnetic bath, with and without the presence of a rf field that couples levels of the ground electronic state manifold, using a simple quantum mechanical model that allows for analytical solutions. The model treats the NV three-level ground state system in the presence of fluctuating magnetic fields that arise from the environment, and that result in decoherence, dephasing and dissipation. We show that all 9 eigenmodes of the three-level system are coupled to each other due to interaction with the environment, and we discuss consequences for fitting experiments in which decoherence plays a role.

abstract: The phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL) in disordered quantum many-body systems occurs when all transport is suppressed despite the excitations of the system being interacting. In this letter we report on the numerical simulation of autonomous quantum dynamics for disordered Heisenberg chains when the system is prepared with a strong inhomogeneity in either spin or energy density. Using exact diagonalisation and a dynamical code based on Krylov subspaces we are able to simulate dynamics for up to $L=26$ spins. We find, as expected, the breakdown of equilibration of the spatial profiles as the system enters the MBL phase. However, in the ergodic phase we also find a large region in parameter space where the energy dynamics remains diffusive but where spins transport has been evidenced to occur only sub-diffusively. This suggestive finding points towards a peculiar ergodic phase where particles do not diffuse but energy does, reminiscent of the situation in amorphous solids.

abstract: Incremental information, as measured by the quantum entropy, is increasing when two ensembles are united. This result was proved by Lieb and Ruskai, and it is the foundation for the proof of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy. We present a truly elementary proof of this fact in the context of the broader family of matrix entropies introduced by Chen and Tropp.

abstract: We study kinematics of atoms and molecules in quantum shape dynamics. We analyzed a model universe where there is only electrical force between protons and electrons. In ref. \cite{sd-prl} a similar model where there is only gravitational attraction between masses is investigated. Our results is an expansion of the ideas there. We found that hydrogen atoms can form when they are entangled in singlet pairs. On the other hand if there is single hydrogen atom in the universe, it occupies the entire universe. What is more, in the investigation of hydrogen molecule, we found that absolute spacetime emerges by coarse graining the quantum degrees of freedom. It may be that spacetime only exists because of the presence of quantum degrees of freedom. This is especially important from the quantum gravity perspective.

abstract: In this paper, we attempt to establish a systematic treatment of measurement correlations in quantum theory. We define the concept of system of measurement correlations, which is the exact counterpart of instrument in the (generalized) Heisenberg picture. We then redefine the concept of measuring process in order that it becomes consistent with the definition of system of measurement correlations. In quantum mechanical systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between systems of measurement correlations and measuring processes up to complete equivalence. This is nothing but a unitary dilation theorem of systems of measurement correlations. Next, from the viewpoint of the statistical approach to quantum measurement theory, we focus on the extendability of CP instruments to systems of measurement correlations. It will be shown that all CP instruments are extended into systems of measurement correlations. Moreover, in the case of injective von Neumann algebras, we show that any CP instruments are approximated by faithful measuring processes within arbitrarily given error limits. Similarly, in the case of von Neumann algebras with separable dual, we show that any CP instruments are pointwisely realized by measuring processes. These new unitary dilation theorems of CP instruments substantially rewrite the results of past investigations.

abstract: We study Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) interferometry in multilevel systems coupled to an Ohmic quantum bath. We consider the case of superconducting flux qubits driven by a dc+ac magnetic fields, but our results can apply to other similar systems. We find a dynamic transition manifested by a symmetry change in the structure of the LZS interference pattern, plotted as a function of ac amplitude and dc detuning. The dynamic transition is from a LZS pattern with nearly symmetric multiphoton resonances to antisymmetric multiphoton resonances at long times (above the relaxation time). We also show that the presence of a resonant mode in the quantum bath can impede the dynamic transition when the resonant frequency is of the order of the qubit gap. Our results are obtained by a numerical calculation of the finite time and the asymptotic stationary population of the qubit states, using the Floquet-Markov approach to solve a realistic model of the flux qubit considering up to 10 energy levels.

abstract: Motivated by the recent discoveries of materials with quasi-relativistic dispersion relations, we determine densities of states in materials with low dimensional substructures and relativistic dispersion relations. We find that these dimensionally hybrid systems yield quasi-relativistic densities of states that are a superposition of the corresponding two- and three-dimensional densities of states.

abstract: We demonstrate direct cooling of gaseous formaldehyde (H2CO) to the microkelvin regime. Our approach, optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling, provides a simple dissipative cooling method applicable to electrically trapped dipolar molecules. By reducing the temperature by three orders of magnitude and increasing the phase-space density by a factor of ~$10^4$ we generate an ensemble of $3\cdot10^5$ molecules with a temperature of about 420\mu K, populating a single rotational state with more than 80% purity.

abstract: In this paper we present a model that elucidates in a simple way the electronic excited states of $\pi$ conjugated -acene molecules such as tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene. We use a tight-binding and truncated Hubbard model written in the electron-hole basis to describe the low lying excitations with reasonable quantitative accuracy. We are able to produce semi-analytic wavefunctions for the electronic states of the system, which allows us to compute the density correlation functions for various states such as the ground state, the first two singly excited states, and the lowest lying doubly excited state. We show that in this lowest lying doubly excited state, a state which has been speculated as to being involved in the singlet fission process, the electrons and holes behave in a triplet like manner.
