abstract: We analyze the issue of the interpretation of the wavefunction, namely whether it should be interpreted as describing individual systems or ensembles of identically prepared systems. We propose an experiment which can decide the issue, based on the simultaneous measurement of the same observable with different detectors, and we discuss the theoretical implications of the possible experimental outcomes.

Moreover, we construct an entanglement measure for pure multi-qubit states, which are entanglement monotone. Furthermore, we generalize our result on a general pure multipartite state.

abstract: In Phys. Rev. {\bf E 70}, 047102 (2004), J.R. Torgerson and S.K. Lamoreaux investigated for the first time the real-frequency spectrum of finite temperature correction to the Casimir force, for metallic plates of finite conductivity. The very interesting result of this study is that the correction from the TE mode is dominated by low frequencies, for which the dielectric description of the metal is invalid. However, their analysis of the problem, based on more appropriate low-frequency metallic boundary conditions, uses an incorrect form of boundary conditions for TE modes. We repeat their analysis, using the correct boundary conditions. Our computations confirm their most important result: contrary to the result of the dielectric model, the thermal TE mode correction leads to an increase in the TE mode force of attraction between the plates. The magnitude of the correction has a value about twenty times larger than that quoted by them.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A model for the localized quantum vacuum is proposed in which the zero-point energy of the quantum electromagnetic field originates in energy- and momentum-conserving transitions of material systems from their ground state to an unstable state with negative energy. These transitions are accompanied by emissions and re-absorptions of real photons, which generate a localized quantum vacuum in the neighborhood of material systems. The model could help resolve the cosmological paradox associated to the zero-point energy of electromagnetic fields, while reclaiming quantum effects associated with quantum vacuum such as the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift; it also offers a new insight into the Zitterbewegung of material particles.

abstract: The quantum characteristics of sum-frequency process in an optical cavity with an input signal optical beam, which is a half of entangled optical beams, are analyzed. The calculated results show that the quantum properties of the signal beam can be maintained after its frequency is conversed during the intracavity nonlinear optical interaction. The frequency-conversed output signal beam is still in an entangled state with the retained other half of initial entangled beams. The resultant quantum correlation spectra and the parametric dependences of the correlations on the initial squeezing factor, the optical losses and the pump power of the sum-frequency cavity are calculated. The proposed system for the frequency conversion of entangled state can be used in quantum communication network and the calculated results can provide direct references for the design of experimental systems.

abstract: We say that collection of $n$-qudit gates is universal if there exists $N_0\geq n$ such that for every $N\geq N_0$ every $N$-qudit unitary operation can be approximated with arbitrary precision by a circuit built from gates of the collection. Our main result is an upper bound on the smallest $N_0$ with the above property. The bound is roughly $d^8 n$, where $d$ is the number of levels of the base system (the '$d$' in the term qu$d$it.) The proof is based on a recent result on invariants of (finite) linear groups.

title: How to Derive the Hilbert-Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics From Purely Operational Axioms
authors: Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano
comments: Work presented at the conference "On the Present Status of Quantum Mechanics" held on 7-9 September 2005, Mali Losinj, Croatia, in celebration of the 70th birthday of Gian Carlo Ghirardi. The dimensionality theorems along with all results already published in quant-ph/0506034 have been presented at the conference, whereas the operational definition of the real adjoint and the Hilbert spaces derivations have been presented as work in progress, and were completed two months later

abstract: In the present paper I show how it is possible to derive the Hilbert space formulation of Quantum Mechanics from a comprehensive definition of "physical experiment" and assuming "experimental accessibility and simplicity" as specified by five simple Postulates. This accomplishes the program presented in form of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are played by the "local observability principle", which reconciles the holism of nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated existence of "informationally complete observables" and of a "symmetric faithful state". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational definition for the real version of the "adjoint"--i. e. the transposition--from which one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the Mackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in detail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real Hilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded) selfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general dimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability principle, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as operators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open problem at the end of the paper). The route for the present operational axiomatization was suggested by novel ideas originated from Quantum Tomography.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Suppose we have an n-qubit system, and we are given a collection of local density matrices rho_1,...,rho_m, where each rho_i describes some subset of the qubits. We say that rho_1,...,rho_m are "consistent" if there exists a global state sigma (on all n qubits) whose reduced density matrices match rho_1,...,rho_m. We prove the following result: if rho_1,...,rho_m are consistent with some state sigma > 0, then they are also consistent with a state sigma' of the form sigma' = (1/Z) exp(M_1+...+M_m), where each M_i is a Hermitian matrix acting on the same qubits as rho_i, and Z is a normalizing factor. (This is known as a Gibbs state.) Actually, we show a more general result, on the consistency of a set of expectation values <T_1>,...,<T_r>, where the observables T_1,...,T_r need not commute. This result was previously proved by Jaynes (1957) in the context of the maximum-entropy principle; here we provide a somewhat different proof, using properties of the partition function.

abstract: We introduce new sophisticated attacks with a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer against quantum key distribution (QKD) and propose a new QKD protocol grafted with random basis shuffling to block up those attacks. When the polarization basis is randomly and independently shuffled by sender and receiver, the new protocol can overcome the attacks even for not-so-weak coherent pulses. We estimate the number of photons to guarantee the security of the protocol.

We found that, with certain parameters, the Josephson junction qubit array behaves as an antiferromagnetic Ising model in transverse field and the coupled transmission line resonator serves as a bosonic quantum probe. Our investigation shows that, at the critical point, the drastic broadening of the spectrum of the probe indicates the quantum phase transition.

We show how to apply the method to detect entanglement of unknown state without its prior reconstruction. In particular, we prove there always exists noiseless network detecting entanglement with the help of positive, but not completely positive maps. Then the generalization of the method to the case of entanglement detection with arbitrary, not necessarily hermiticity-preserving, linear contractions on product states is presented.

abstract: We show that three-level atoms excited by two cavity modes in a $\Lambda$ configuration close to electromagnetically induced transparency can produce strongly squeezed bright beams or correlated beams which can be used for quantum non demolition measurements. The input intensity is the experimental "knob" for tuning the system into a squeezer or a quantum non demolition device. The quantum correlations become ideal at a critical point characterized by the appearance of a switching behavior in the mean fields intensities. Our predictions, based on a realistic fully quantum 3-level model including cavity losses and spontaneous emission, allow direct comparison with future experiments.

abstract: One of the most intriguing features of quantum physics is the non-locality of correlations that can be obtained by measuring entangled particles. Recently, it has been noticed that non-locality can be studied without reference to the Hilbert space formalism. I review here the properties of the basic mathematical tool used for such studies, the so called Popescu-Rohrlich-box, in short PR-box. Among its feats, are the simulation of the correlations of the singlet and of other non-local probability distributions. Among its features, the "anomaly of non-locality" and a great power for information-theoretical tasks. Among its failures, the impossibility of reproducing all multi-partite distributions and the triviality of the allowed dynamics.

abstract: We compare different strategies aimed to prepare an ensemble with a given density matrix $\rho$. Preparing the ensemble of eigenstates of $\rho$ with appropriate probabilities can be treated as `generous' strategy: it provides maximal accessible information about the state. Another extremity is the so-called `Scrooge' ensemble, which is mostly stingy to share the information. We introduce `lazy' ensembles which require minimal efforts to prepare the density matrix by selecting pure states with respect to completely random choice. We consider two parties, Alice and Bob, playing a kind of game. Bob wishes to guess which pure state is prepared by Alice. His null hypothesis, based on the lack of any information about Alice's intention, is that Alice prepares any pure state with equal probability. Then, the average quantum state measured by Bob turns out to be $\rho$, and he has to make a new hypothesis about Alice's intention solely based on the information that the observed density matrix is $\rho$. The arising `lazy' ensemble is shown to be the alternative hypothesis which minimizes the Type I error.

abstract: We consider a model Hamiltonian describing the interaction of a single-mode radiation field with the atoms of a nonlinear medium, and study the dynamics of entanglement for specific non-entangled initial states of interest: namely, those in which the field mode is initially in a Fock state, a coherent state, or a photon-added coherent state. The counterparts of near-revivals and fractional revivals are shown to be clearly identifiable in the entropy of entanglement. The ``overlap fidelity'' of the system is another such indicator, and its behaviour corroborates that of the entropy of entanglement in the vicinity of near-revivals. The expectation values and higher moments of suitable quadrature variables are also examined, with reference to possible squeezing and higher-order squeezing.

abstract: Enviroment - caused dissipation disrupts the hamiltonian evolution of all quantum systems not fully isolated from any bath. We propose and examine a feedback-control scheme to eliminate such dissipation, by tracking the free hamiltonian evolution. We determine a driving-field that maximizes the projection of the actual molecular system onto the freely propagated one. The evolution of a model two level system in a dephasing bath is followed, and the driving field that overcomes the decoherence is calculated. An implementation of the scheme in the laboratory using feedback control is suggested.

abstract: For a given pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the standard form: H=p^2/2m+v(x), we reduce the problem of finding the most general (pseudo-)metric operator \eta satisfying H^\dagger=\eta H \eta^{-1} to the solution of a differential equation. If the configuration space is the real line, this is a Klein-Gordon equation with a nonconstant mass term. We obtain a general series solution of this equation that involves a pair of arbitrary functions. These characterize the arbitrariness in the choice of \eta. We apply our general results to calculate \eta for the PT-symmetric square well, an imaginary scattering potential, and a class of imaginary delta-function potentials. For the first two systems, our method reproduces the known results in a straightforward and extremely efficient manner. For all these systems we obtain the most general \eta up to second order terms in the coupling constants.

A 72, 065801 (2005)], we develop a theoretical model in which the field intensity fluctuations resulted from resonant interaction of a dense atomic medium with laser field having finite bandwidth. The intensity-intensity cross correlation between two circular polarized beams can be controlled by the applied external magnetic field. A smooth transition from perfect correlations to anti-correlations (at zero delay time) of the outgoing beams as a function of the magnetic field strength is observed. It provides us with the desired information about decoherence rate in, for example, $^{87}$Rb atomic vapor.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics and the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber theory provide opposite resolutions of the quantum measurement problem: the former postulates additional variables (the particle positions) besides the wave function, whereas the latter implements spontaneous collapses of the wave function by a nonlinear and stochastic modification of Schr\"odinger's equation. Still, both theories, when understood appropriately, share the following structure: They are ultimately not about wave functions but about ``matter'' moving in space, represented by either particle trajectories, fields on space-time, or a discrete set of space-time points. The role of the wave function then is to govern the motion of the matter.

We present systematic characterization of the magneto-optical trap (MOT). We obtain up to 5 10^5 atoms in the steady state MOT. The atoms radiatively decay from the excited P state into metastable D states, and, due to the large dipolar magnetic moment of chromium atoms in these states, they can remain magnetically trapped in the quadrupole field gradient of the MOT. We study the accumulation of metastable 53Cr atoms into this magnetic trap. We also report on the first simultaneous magneto-optical trapping of bosonic 52Cr and fermionic 53Cr atoms. Finally, we characterize the light assisted collision losses in this Bose-Fermi cold mixture.

abstract: We focus on classical and quantum list decoding. The capacity of list decoding was obtained by Nishimura in the case when the number of list does not increase exponentially. However, the capacity of the exponential-list case is open even in the classical case while its converse part was obtained by Nishimura. We derive the channel capacities in the classical and quantum case with an exponentially increasing list. The converse part of the quantum case is obtained by modifying Nagaoka's simple proof for strong converse theorem for channel capacity. The direct part is derived by a quite simple argument.

abstract: We propose a communication-assisted local-hidden-variable model that yields the correct outcome for the measurement of any product of Pauli operators on an arbitrary graph state, i.e., that yields the correct global correlation among the individual measurements in the Pauli product. Within this model, communication is restricted to a single round of message passing between adjacent nodes of the graph. We show that any model sharing some general properties with our own is incapable, for at least some graph states, of reproducing the expected correlations among all subsets of the individual measurements. The ability to reproduce all such correlations is found to depend on both the communication distance and the symmetries of the communication protocol.

The application of this quantum phenomenon to the scheme of quantum information transfer in solid-state system is discussed.

abstract: Local Search problem, which finds a local minimum of a black-box function on a given graph, is of both practical and theoretical importance to combinatorial optimization, complexity theory and many other areas in theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study the problem in the randomized and quantum query models and give new lower and upper bound techniques in both models. The lower bound technique works for any graph that contains a product graph as a subgraph. Applying it to the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n and the constant dimensional grids [n]^d, two particular product graphs that recently drew much attention, we get the following tight results: RLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/2}n^{1/2}), QLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/3}n^{1/6}), RLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/2}) for d \geq 4, QLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/3}) for d \geq 6. Here RLS(G) and QLS(G) are the randomized and quantum query complexities of Local Search on G, respectively. These improve the previous results by Aaronson [STOC'04], Ambainis (unpublished) and Santha and Szegedy [STOC'04]. Our new algorithms work well when the underlying graph expands slowly. As an application to [n]^2, a new quantum algorithm using O(\sqrt{n}(\log\log n)^{1.5}) queries is given. This improves the previous best known upper bound of O(n^{2/3}) (Aaronson, [STOC'04]), and implies that Local Search on grids exhibits different properties in low dimensions.

abstract: In this paper, an intuitive mathematical formulation is provided to generalize the residual entanglement for tripartite systems of qubits (Phys. Rev. A \textbf{61}, 052306 (2000)) to the tripartite systems in higher dimension. The spirit lies in the tensor treatment of tripartite pure states (Phys. Rev. A \textbf{72}, 022333 (2005)). A distinct characteristic of the present generalization is that the formulation for higher dimensional systems is invariant under permutation of the subsystems, hence is employed as a criterion to test the existence of genuine tripartite entanglement. Furthermore, the formulation for pure states can be conveniently extended to the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate technique. As applications, we give the analytic approximation of the criterion for weakly mixed tripartite quantum states and consider the existence of genuine tripartite entanglement of some weakly mixed states.

abstract: Known quantum pure states of a qudit can be remotely prepared onto a group of particles of qubits exactly or probabilistically with the aid of two-level Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states. We present a protocol for such kind of remote state preparation. We are mainly focused on the remote preparation of the ensembles of equatorial states and those of states in real Hilbert space. In particular, a kind of states of qudits in real Hilbert space have been shown to be remotely prepared in faith without the limitation of the input space dimension.

abstract: Based on the residual entanglement [9] (Phys. Rev. A \textbf{71}, 044301 (2005)), we present the global entanglement for a multipartite quantum state. The measure is shown to be also obtained by the bipartite partitions of the multipartite state. The distinct characteristic of the global entanglement is that it consists of the sum of different entanglement contributions. The measure can provide sufficient and necessary condition of fully separability for pure states and be conveniently extended to mixed states by minimizing the convex hull. To test the sufficiency of the measure for mixed states, we evaluate the global entanglement of bound entangled states. The properties of the measure discussed finally show the global entanglement is an entanglement monotone.

abstract: We study the entanglement properties of a pair of two-level atoms going through a cavity one after another. The initial joint state of two successive atoms that enter the cavity is unentangled. Interactions mediated by the cavity photon field result in the final two-atom state being of a mixed entangled type. We consider the field statistics of the Fock state field, and the thermal field, respectively, inside the cavity. The entanglement of formation of the joint two-atom state is calculated for both these cases as a function of the Rabi-angle $gt$. We present a comparitive study of two-atom entanglement for low and high mean photon number cases corresponding to the different fields statistics.

abstract: Feedback control is expected to considerably protect quantum states against decoherence caused by interaction between the system and environment. Especially, Markovian feedback scheme developed by Wiseman can modify the properties of decoherence and eventually recover the purity of the steadystate of the corresponding master equation. This paper provides a condition for which the modified master equation has a pure steady state. By applying this condition to a two-qubit system, we obtain a complete parametrization of the feedback Hamiltonian such that the steady state becomes a maximally entangled state.

abstract: We developed a one-way quantum key distribution (QKD) system based upon a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) interferometer. This interferometer is expected to be free from the backscattering inherent in commercially available two-way QKD systems and phase drift without active compensation. A key distribution experiment with spools of standard telecom fiber showed that the bit error rate was as low as 6% for a 100-km key distribution using an attenuated laser pulse with a mean photon number of 0.1 and was determined solely by the detector noise. This clearly demonstrates the advantages of our PLC-based one-way QKD system over two-way QKD systems for long distance key distribution.

abstract: A phenomenological approach is developed that allows one to completely describe the effects of unwanted noise, such as the noise associated with absorption and scattering, in high-Q cavities. This noise is modeled by a block of beam splitters and an additional input-output port. The replacement schemes enable us to formulate appropriate quantum Langevin equations and input-output relations. It is demonstrated that unwanted noise renders it possible to combine a cavity input mode and the intracavity mode in a nonmonochromatic output mode. Possible applications to unbalanced and cascaded homodyning of the intracavity mode are discussed and the advantages of the latter method are shown.

abstract: In electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT), the absorption of a probe beam is greatly reduced due to destructive interference between two dressed atomic states produced by a strong laser beam. Here we show that a similar reduction in the single-photon absorption rate can be achieved by tuning a probe beam to be halfway between the resonant frequencies of two modes of a cavity. This technique is expected to be useful in enhancing two-photon absorption while reducing losses due to single-photon scattering.

abstract: In relativity, two simultaneous events at two different places are not simultaneous for observers in different Lorentz frames. In the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment, two simultaneous measurements are taken at two different places. Would they still be simultaneous to observers in moving frames? It is a difficult question, but it is still possible to study this problem in the microscopic world. In the hydrogen atom, the uncertainty can be considered to be entirely associated with the ground-state. However, is there an uncertainty associated with the time-separation variable between the proton and electron? This time-separation variable is a forgotten, if not hidden, variable in the present form of quantum mechanics. The first step toward the simultaneity problem is to study the role of this time-separation variable in the Lorentz-covariant world. It is shown possible to study this problem using harmonic oscillators applicable to hadrons which are bound states of quarks. It is also possible to derive consequences that can be tested experimentally.

abstract: Macroscopic quantum tunneling is described using the master equation for the reduced Wigner function of an open quantum system at zero temperature. Our model consists of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an environment characterized by dissipative and normal and anomalous diffusion coefficients. A representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system, i.e. the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write the reduced Wigner function, and the master equation becomes simpler in that representation. The energy eigenfunctions computed in a WKB approximation incorporate the tunneling effect of the isolated system and the effect of the environment is described by an equation that it is in many ways similar to a Fokker-Planck equation. Decoherence is easily identified from the master equation and we find that when the decoherence time is much shorter than the tunneling time the master equation can be approximated by a Kramers like equation describing thermal activation due to the zero point fluctuations of the quantum environment. The effect of anomalous diffusion can be dealt with perturbatively and its overall effect is to inhibit tunneling.

abstract: Stimulated wave of polarization, triggered by a flip of a single spin, presents a simple model of quantum amplification. Previously, it has been found that such wave can be excited in a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, irradiated by a weak resonant transverse field. Here we explore models with more realistic Hamiltonians, in particular, with natural dipole-dipole interactions. Results of simulations for 1D spin chains and rings with up to nine spins are presented.

abstract: The best upper bound for the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality was first derived by Tsirelson. For increasing number of $\pm 1$ valued observables on both sites of the correlation experiment, Tsirelson obtained the Grothendieck's constant ($\mathcal{K}_{G}\approx 1.73\pm0.06$) as a limit for the maximal violation. In this paper, we construct a generalization of the CHSH inequality with four $\pm 1$ valued observables on both sites of a correlation experiment and show that the quantum violation approaching 1.58. Moreover, we estimate the maximal quantum violation of a correlation experiment for large and equal number of $\pm 1$ valued observables on both sites. In this case, the maximal quantum violation converges to $\sqrt{3}\approx1.73$ for very large $n$, which coincides with the approximate value of Grothendieck's constant.

abstract: The paper deals with the projective line over the finite factor ring $R\_{\clubsuit} \equiv$ GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The line is endowed with 18 points, spanning the neighbourhoods of three pairwise distant points. As $R\_{\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is not an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant points overlap. There are nine neighbour points to any point of the line, forming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two maximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and they swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of the one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the points of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the associated ordinary projective line of order two. The single point of the remaining family is sent to the reference point under both the mappings and its existence stems from a non-trivial character of the Jacobson radical, ${\cal J}\_{\clubsuit}$, of the ring. The factor ring $\widetilde{R}\_{\clubsuit} \equiv R\_{\clubsuit}/ {\cal J}\_{\clubsuit}$ is isomorphic to GF(2) $\otimes$ GF(2). The projective line over $\widetilde{R}\_{\clubsuit}$ features nine points, each of them being surrounded by four neighbour and the same number of distant points, and any two distant points share two neighbours. These remarkable ring geometries are surmised to be of relevance for modelling entangled qubit states, to be discussed in detail in Part II of the paper.

Four different combinations on the basis of entanglement of initial quantum state and the measurement basis are analyzed. It is shown that the advantage that a quantum player can get by exploiting quantum strategies is only valid when both the initial quantum state and the measurement basis are in entangled form. Furthermore, it is shown that for maximum correlation the effects of decoherence diminish and it behaves as a noiseless game.

This is true for each value of $B$ below a certain critical value $B_c$. The pertinent mapping depends on the particular $B-$value one selects within such a range.

Special types of entangled states that do not violate classical entropic inequalities are seen to exist in the space of two qubits. Special meaning can be assigned to the Munro {\it et al.} special participation ratio of 1.8.

Following this work, we discuss some entanglement properties of two-rebits systems, making a comparison with the basic properties of two-qubits systems, i.e., the ones described by standard complex quantum mechanics. We also discuss the use of quaternionic quantum mechanics as applied to the phenomenon of entanglement.

abstract: This paper reconsiders the claimed rapidity of a scheme for the purification of the quantum state of a qubit, proposed recently in Jacobs 2003 Phys. Rev. A67 030301(R). The qubit starts in a completely mixed state, and information is obtained by a continuous measurement. Jacobs' rapid purification protocol uses Hamiltonian feedback control to maximise the average purity of the qubit for a given time, with a factor of two increase in the purification rate over the no-feedback protocol. However, by re-examining the latter approach, we show that it mininises the average time taken for a qubit to reach a given purity. In fact, the average time taken for the no-feedback protocol beats that for Jacobs' protocol by a factor of two. We discuss how this is compatible with Jacobs' result, and the usefulness of the different approaches.

abstract: We present one- and two-photon diffraction and interference experiments involving parametric down-converted photon pairs. By controlling the divergence of the pump beam in parametric down-conversion, the diffraction-interference pattern produced by an object changes from a quantum (perfectly correlated) case to a classical (uncorrelated) one. The observed diffraction and interference patterns are accurately reproduced by Fourier-optical analysis taking into account the quantum spatial correlation. We show that the relation between the spatial correlation and the object size plays a crucial role in the formation of both one- and two-photon diffraction-interference patterns.

abstract: We introduce a novel notion of probability within quantum history theories and give a Gleasonesque proof for these assignments. This involves introducing a tentative novel axiom of probability. We also discuss how we are to interpret these generalised probabilities as partially ordered notions of preference and we introduce a tentative generalised notion of Shannon entropy. A Bayesian approach to probability theory is adopted throughout, thus the axioms we use will be minimal criteria of rationality rather than ad hoc mathematical axioms.

This protocol comprises of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, especially in aspects of controlling classical sifting procedures of two protocols. The protocol is more secure than both of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, and the ultimate limit of robustness in the proposed protocol expands as well than both of them.

abstract: Within a well-known decay model describing a particle confined initially within a spherical $\delta$ potential shell, we consider the situation when the undecayed state has an unusual energy distribution decaying slowly as $k\to\infty$; the simplest example corresponds to a wave function constant within the shell. We show that the non-decay probability as a function of time behaves then in a highly irregular, most likely fractal way.

abstract: The continuous variable quantum key distribution is expected to provide high secret key rate without single photon source and detector, but the lack of the secure and effective key distillation method makes it unpractical. Here, we present a secure single-bit-reverse-reconciliation protocol combined with secret information concentration and post-selection, which can distill the secret key with high efficiency and low computational complexity. The simulation results show that this protocol can provide high secret key rate even when the transmission fiber is longer than 150km, which may make the continuous variable scheme to outvie the single photon one.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Geometric Topology (math.GT)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603069
abstract: We analyze relationships between quantum computation and a family of generalizations of the Jones polynomial. Extending recent work by Aharonov et al., we give efficient quantum circuits for implementing the unitary Jones-Wenzl representations of the braid group. We use these to provide new quantum algorithms for approximately evaluating a family of specializations of the HOMFLYPT two-variable polynomial of trace closures of braids. We also give algorithms for approximating the Jones polynomial of a general class of closures of braids at roots of unity. Next we provide a self-contained proof of a result of Freedman et al. that any quantum computation can be replaced by an additive approximation of the Jones polynomial, evaluated at almost any primitive root of unity. Our proof encodes two-qubit unitaries into the rectangular representation of the eight-strand braid group. We then give QCMA-complete and PSPACE-complete problems which are based on braids. We conclude with direct proofs that evaluating the Jones polynomial of the plat closure at most primitive roots of unity is a #P-hard problem, while learning its most significant bit is PP-hard, circumventing the usual route through the Tutte polynomial and graph coloring.

title: Wave-Particle Duality and the Coherent Quantum Domain Picture
authors: Alan M. Kadin
comments: 13 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603070
abstract: It is proposed that the paradox of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics may be resolved using a physical picture analogous to magnetic domains. Within this picture, a quantum particle represents a coherent region of a quantum wave with characteristic total energy, momentum, and spin. The dynamics of such a state are described by the usual linear quantum wave equations. But the coherence is maintained by a nonlinear self-interaction term that is evident only during transitions from one quantum state to another. This is analogous to the self-organizing property of domains in a ferromagnetic material, in which a single domain may appear as a stable macro-particle, but with rapid transitions between different domain configurations also possible. For the quantum case, this implies that the "collapse of the wave function" is a real dynamical physical process that occurs continuously in spacetime. This picture may also permit the resolution of apparent paradoxes associated with quantum measurement and entangled states.

abstract: We demonstrate that generalized entanglement [Barnum {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 68}, 032308 (2003)] provides a natural and reliable indicator of quantum chaotic behavior. Since generalized entanglement depends directly on a choice of preferred observables, exploring how generalized entanglement increases under dynamical evolution is possible without invoking an auxiliary coupled system or decomposing the system into arbitrary subsystems. We find that, in the chaotic regime, the long-time saturation value of generalized entanglement agrees with random matrix theory predictions. For our system, we provide physical intuition into generalized entanglement within a single system by invoking the notion of extent of a state. The latter, in turn, is related to other signatures of quantum chaos.

abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for the exact treatment of a hybrid system that is composed of a quantum subsystem and a classical subsystem. When the quantum subsystem is dynamically fast and the classical subsystem is slow, a vector potential is generated with a simple canonical transformation. This vector potential, on one hand, gives rise to the familiar Berry phase in the fast quantum dynamics; on the other hand, it yields a Lorentz-like force in the slow classical dynamics. In this way, the pure phase (Berry phase) of a wavefunction is linked to a physical force.

abstract: Two generalizations of Kempf's quadratic canonical commutation relation in one dimension are considered. The first one is the most general quadratic commutation relation. The corresponding nonzero minimal uncertainties in position and momentum are determined and the effect on the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in an electric field is studied. The second extension is a function-dependent generalization of the simplest quadratic commutation relation with only a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position. Such an uncertainty now becomes dependent on the average position. With each function-dependent commutation relation we associate a family of potentials whose spectrum can be exactly determined through supersymmetric quantum mechanical and shape invariance techniques. Some representations of the generalized Heisenberg algebras are proposed in terms of conventional position and momentum operators $x$, $p$. The resulting Hamiltonians contain a contribution proportional to $p^4$ and their $p$-dependent terms may also be functions of $x$. The theory is illustrated by considering P\"oschl-Teller and Morse potentials.

abstract: The impossibility of perfect cloning and state estimation are two fundamental results in Quantum Mechanics.

We prove this conjecture using two known results of Quantum Information Theory: the monogamy of quantum correlations and the properties of entanglement breaking channels.

abstract: We show that non-classical intensity correlations and quadrature entanglement can be generated by frequency doubling in a resonator with two output ports. We predict twin-beam intensity correlations 6 dB below the coherent state limit, and that the product of the inference variances of the quadrature fluctuations gives an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlation coefficient of V_EPR = 0.6 < 1. Comparison with an entanglement source based on combining two frequency doublers with a beam splitter shows that the dual ported resonator provides stronger entanglement at lower levels of individual beam squeezing. Calculations are performed using a self-consistent propagation method that does not invoke a mean field approximation. Results are given for physically realistic parameters that account for the Gaussian shape of the intracavity beams, as well as intracavity losses.

abstract: The fluorescence light emitted by a 4-level system in $J=1/2$ to $J=1/2$ configuration driven by a monochromatic laser field and in an external magnetic field is studied. We show that the spectrum of resonance fluorescence emitted on the $\pi$ transitions shows a signature of spontaneously generated interference effects. The degree of interference in the fluorescence spectrum can be controlled by means of the external magnetic field, provided that the Land\'e g-factors of the excited and the ground state doublet are different. For a suitably chosen magnetic field strength, the relative weight of the Rayleigh line can be completely suppressed, even for low intensities of the coherent driving field. The incoherent fluorescence spectrum emitted on the $\pi$ transitions exhibits a very narrow peak whose width and weight depends on the magnetic field strength. We demonstrate that the spectrum of resonance fluorescence emitted on the $\sigma$ transitions show an indirect signature of interference. A measurement of the relative peak heights in the spectrum from the $\sigma$ transitions allows to determine the branching ratio of the spontaneous decay of each excited state into the $\sigma$ channel.

abstract: Robust quantum computation with d-level quantum systems (qudits) poses two requirements: fast, parallel quantum gates and high fidelity two-qudit gates. We first describe how to implement parallel single qudit operations. It is by now well known that any single-qudit unitary can be decomposed into a sequence of Givens rotations on two-dimensional subspaces of the qudit state space. Using a coupling graph to represent physically allowed couplings between pairs of qudit states, we then show that the logical depth of the parallel gate sequence is equal to the height of an associated tree. The implementation of a given unitary can then optimize the tradeoff between gate time and resources used. These ideas are illustrated for qudits encoded in the ground hyperfine states of the atomic alkalies $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. Second, we provide a protocol for implementing parallelized non-local two-qudit gates using the assistance of entangled qubit pairs. Because the entangled qubits can be prepared non-deterministically, this offers the possibility of high fidelity two-qudit gates.

Here, we present a novel scheme to produce such photons from a single atom in an optical cavity, by means of vacuum-stimulated Raman transitions between the Zeeman substates of a single hyperfine state. Upon each transition, a photon is emitted into the cavity, with a polarisation that depends on the direction of the Raman process.

abstract: We introduce the general catalysts for pure entanglement transformations under local operations and classical communications in such a way that we disregard the profit and loss of entanglement of the catalysts per se. As such, the possibilities of pure entanglement transformations are greatly expanded. Remarkably, we find an interesting phenomenon that, in some situations, incomparable pairs ${| \psi> ,| \phi> \} $ and ${| \chi> ,| \chi^{\prime}> \} $ can assist each other mutually so as to realize the transformation $| \psi> | \chi> \to| \phi> | \chi^{\prime}>$. We also design an efficient algorithm to detect whether a $k\times k$ general catalyst exists for a given entanglement transformation. This algorithm can as well be exploited to witness the existence of standard catalysts.

The atoms in all of these operations are syncronized, which is not the case in previous studies [1,2] in PCs. Our method has the potential for extension to N-atom entanglement, universal quantum logic operations, and the implementation of other useful, cavity QED based quantum information processing tasks.

We also present the exact solution of a two-photon vector soliton, in order to demonstrate the ease of use and intuitiveness of the proposed formulation.

The system is excited by an external coherent field that is resonant to the frequency of one of the oscillators. We show that the coupler evolution can be closed within a finite set of $n$-photon states, analogously as in the \textit{nonlinear quantum scissors} model. Moreover, for this type of evolution our system can be treated as a \textit{Bell-like states} generator. Thanks to the nonlinear nature of both: oscillators and their internal coupling, these states can be generated even if the system exhibits its energy dissipating nature, contrary to systems with linear couplings.

abstract: Analytic continuation of the classical dynamics generated by a standard Hamiltonian, H = p^2/2m + v(x), into the complex plane yields a particular complex classical dynamical system. For an analytic potential v, we show that the resulting complex system admits a description in terms of the phase space R^4 equipped with an unconventional symplectic structure. This in turn allows for the construction of an equivalent real description that is based on the conventional symplectic structure on R^4, and establishes the equivalence of the complex extension of classical mechanics that is based on the above-mentioned analytic continuation with the conventional classical mechanics. The equivalent real Hamiltonian turns out to be twice the real part of H, while the imaginary part of H plays the role of an independent integral of motion ensuring the integrability of the system. The equivalent real description proposed here is the classical analog of the equivalent Hermitian description of unitary quantum systems defined by complex, typically PT-symmetric, potentials.

abstract: It is well known that a particle in a periodic potential with an additional constant force performs Bloch oscillations. Modulating every second period of the potential, the original Bloch band splits into two subbands. The dynamics of quantum particles shows a coherent superposition of Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling between the subbands, a Bloch-Zener oscillation. Such a system is modelled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, a system of two minibands with an easily controllable gap. The dynamics of the system is investigated by using an algebraic ansatz leading to a differential equation of Whittaker-Hill type. It is shown that the parameters of the system can be tuned to generate a periodic reconstruction of the wave packet and thus of the occupation probability. As an application, the construction of a matter wave beam splitter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is briefly discussed.

We prove analytically that, at the fundamental quantum resonances of the atom-optics kicked rotor, the fidelity saturates at a constant, time-independent value after a small number of kicks. The latter saturation arises from the bulk of the atomic ensemble, whilst for the resonantly accelerated atoms the fidelity is predicted to decay slowly according to a power law.

Phys. 43, 3944 (2002) [math-ph/0203005] is based on an assumption which was never made in the latter paper, namely that the diagonalizability of an operator implies that it is normal. Therefore, Tanaka's objections regarding this paper are not valid.

abstract: The dynamical Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in 1+1-dimensions is studied numerically by solving a system of coupled first-order differential equations. The number of scalar particles created from vacuum is given by the solutions to this system which can be found by means of standard numerics. The formalism already used in a former work is derived in detail and is applied to resonant as well as off-resonant cavity oscillations.

abstract: We consider quantum channels with one sender and two receivers, used in several different ways for the simultaneous transmission of independent messages. We begin by extending the technique of superposition coding to quantum channels with a classical input to give a general achievable region. We also give outer bounds to the capacity regions for various special cases from the classical literature and prove that superposition coding is optimal for a class of channels. We then consider extensions of superposition coding for channels with a quantum input, where some of the messages transmitted are quantum instead of classical, in the sense that the parties establish bipartite or tripartite GHZ entanglement. We conclude by using state merging to give achievable rates for establishing bipartite entanglement between different pairs of parties with the assistance of free classical communication.

abstract: Based on the ideal of order rearrangement and block transmission of photons, we present a quantum secure direct communication scheme using single photons. The security of the present scheme is ensured by quantum no-cloning theory and the secret transmitting order of photons. The present scheme is efficient in that all of the polarized photons are used to transmit the sender's secret message except those chosen for eavesdropping check. We also generalize this scheme to a multiparty controlled quantum secret direct communication scheme which the sender's secret message can only be recovered by the receiver under the permission of all the controllers.

abstract: Several simple yet secure protocols to authenticate the quantum channel of various QKD schemes, by coupling the photon sender's knowledge of a shared secret and the QBER Bob observes, are presented. It is shown that Alice can encrypt certain portions of the information needed for the QKD protocols, using a sequence whose security is based on computational-complexity, without compromising all of the sequence's entropy. It is then shown that after a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the quantum and classical channels, there is still enough entropy left in the sequence for Bob to detect the presence of Eve by monitoring the QBER. Finally, it is shown that the principles presented can be implemented to authenticate the quantum channel associated with any type of QKD scheme, and they can also be used for Alice to authenticate Bob.

abstract: Within the framework of constructions for quantifying entanglement, we build a natural scenario for the assembly of multipartite entanglement measures based on Hopf bundle-like mappings obtained through Clifford algebra representations. Then, given the non-factorizability of an arbitrary two-qubit density matrix, we give an alternate quantity that allows the construction of two types of entanglement measures based on their arithmetical and geometrical averages over all pairs of qubits in a register of size N, and thus fully characterize its degree and type of entanglement. We find that such an arithmetical average is both additive and strongly super additive.

abstract: We analyze different aspects of multiparty communication over quantum memoryless channels and generalize some of key results known from bipartite channels to that of multiparty scenario. In particular, we introduce multiparty versions of minimal subspace transmission fidelity and entanglement transmission fidelity. We also provide alternative, local, versions of fidelities and show their equivalence to the global ones in context of capacity regions defined. The equivalence of two different capacity notions with respect to two types of the fidelities is proven. In analogy to bipartite case it is shown, via sufficiency of isometric encoding theorem, that additional classical forward side channel does not increase capacity region of any quantum channel with $k$ senders and $m$ receivers which represents a compact unit of general quantum networks theory. The result proves that recently provided capacity region of multiple access channel ([M. Horodecki et al, Nature {\bf 436} 673 (2005)], [J.Yard et al, quant-ph/0501045]) is optimal also in the scenario of additional support of forward classical communication.

The spontaneously generated coherence considered in a lambda-type atomic system causes an indirect coupling between the lower two levels which acts equivalently as a DC-field and therefore makes possible the existence of second-order susceptibility.

abstract: A phase damping reservoir composed by $N$-bosons coupled to a system of interest through a cross-Kerr interaction is proposed and its effects on quantum superpo sitions are investigated. By means of analytical calculations we show that: i-) the reservoir induces a Gaussian decay of quantum coherences, and ii-) the inher ent incommensurate character of the spectral distribution yields irreversibility . A state-independent decoherence time and a master equation are both derived an alytically. These results, which have been extended for the thermodynamic limit, show that nondissipative decoherence can be suitably contemplated within the EI D approach. Finally, it is shown that the same mechanism yielding decoherence ar e also responsible for inducing dynamical disentanglement.

abstract: The experimental investigation of the Casimir force between a large metallized sphere and semiconductor plate is performed using an atomic force microscope. Improved calibration and measurement procedures permitted reduction in the role of different uncertainties. Rigorous statistical procedures are applied for the analysis of random, systematic and total experimental errors at 95% confidence. The theoretical Casimir force is computed for semiconductor plates with different conductivity properties taking into account all theoretical uncertainties discussed in literature. The comparison between experiment and theory is done at both 95 and 70% confidence. It is demonstrated that the theoretical results computed for the semiconductor plate used in experiment are consistent with data. At the same time, theory describing a dielectric plate is excluded by experiment at 70% confidence. Thus, the Casimir force is proved to be sensitive to the conductivity properties of semiconductors.

abstract: We formulate a new Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type theory at finite temperature, by deriving a set of variational equations of the free energy after the particle-number projection. With its broad applicability, this theory can be a useful tool for investigating the pairing phase transition in finite systems with the particle-number conservation. This theory provides effects of the symmetry-restoring fluctuation (SRF) for the pairing phenomena in finite fermionic systems, distinctively from those of additional quantum fluctuations. It is shown by numerical calculations that the phase transition is compatible with the conservation in this theory, and that the SRF shifts up the critical temperature ($T^\mathrm{cr}$). This shift of $T^\mathrm{cr}$ occurs due to reduction of degrees-of-freedom in canonical ensembles, and decreases only slowly as the particle-number increases (or as the level spacing narrows), in contrast to the conventional BCS theory.

abstract: We establish a general scaling law for the entanglement of a large class of ground states and dynamically evolving states of quantum spin chains: we show that the geometric entropy of a distinguished block saturates, and hence follows an entanglement-boundary law. These results apply to any ground state of a gapped model resulting from dynamics generated by a local hamiltonian, as well as, dually, to states that are generated via a sudden quench of an interaction as recently studied in the case of dynamics of quantum phase transitions. We achieve these results by exploiting ideas from quantum information theory and making use of the powerful tools provided by Lieb-Robinson bounds. We also show that there exist noncritical fermionic systems and equivalent spin chains with rapidly decaying interactions whose geometric entropy scales logarithmically with block length. Implications for the classical simulatability are outlined.

A skeptical observer should subject the estimate to a test that guarantees that a self-interested experimentalist will report the true state as accurately as possible. We also find a non-asymptotic, operational interpretation of the quantum relative entropy function.

We give an algorithm to check whether a given quasi-qubit POVM satisfies to this condition. We describe explicitely all the POVMs that are clean for the qubit. On the way we give a sufficient condition for a general POVM to be clean.

Consequently, a proof is given for the scalability of this modified linked-state model, and an exact expression for the efficiency of the method is obtained. Moreover, a considerable improvement in the efficiency, relative to the original linked-state method, is achieved. The proposed method is applicable to Nielsen's optical ``cluster-state'' approach as well.

The metallic plates are described by the plasma model, with arbitrary values for the plasma wavelength, the plate separation and the corrugation period, the corrugation amplitude remaining the smallest length scale. Our analysis shows that in realistic experimental situations the Proximity Force Approximation overestimates the force by up to 30%.

We discuss several consequences of this result in the context of quantum information theory. First, we show that the information that leaks out to space-like separated regions is negligable, and that there is a finite speed at which correlations and entanglement can be distributed. Second, we discuss how these ideas can be used to prove lower bounds on the time it takes to convert states without topological quantum order to states with that property. Finally, we show that the rate at which entropy can be created in a block of spins scales like the boundary of that block.

The dependence of the EIT linewidth on the power of the pump field was investigated, at various temperatures, for the ground states of the lambda-system associated with different hyperfine levels of the atomic 5S_1/2 state as well as magnetic sublevels of the same hyperfine level. Strictly linear behavior was observed in all cases. A theoretical analysis of our results shows that dephasing in the ground state is the main source of decoherence, with population exchange playing a minor role.

We demonstrate that this conclusion is not reliable because, when applied to the Casimir effect, the approximate description of spatial dispersion used is unjustified.

We show that by designing such schemes specifically to tolerate these error types we cause an exponential blow-out in depolarizing noise. We discuss several examples and propose techniques for minimizing this problem. In general this introduces a tradeoff with other undesirable effects. In some cases this is physical resource requirements, while in others it is noise rates.

abstract: The standard quantum search algorithm lacks a feature, enjoyed by many classical algorithms, of having a fixed-point, i.e. a monotonic convergence towards the solution. Here we present two variations of the quantum search algorithm, which get around this limitation. The first replaces selective inversions in the algorithm by selective phase shifts of $\frac{\pi}{3}$. The second controls the selective inversion operations using two ancilla qubits, and irreversible measurement operations on the ancilla qubits drive the starting state towards the target state. Using $q$ oracle queries, these variations reduce the probability of finding a non-target state from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{2q+1}$, which is asymptotically optimal. Similar ideas can lead to robust quantum algorithms, and provide conceptually new schemes for error correction.

abstract: In this work we describe, compile and generalize a set of tools that can be used to analyse the electronic properties (distribution of states, nature of states, ...) of one-dimensional disordered compositions of potentials. In particular, we derive an ensemble of universal functional equations which characterize the thermodynamic limit of all one-dimensional models and which only depend formally on the distributions that define the disorder. The equations are useful to obtain relevant quantities of the system such as density of states or localization length in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: In some scenarios there are ways of conveying information with many fewer, even exponentially fewer, qubits than possible classically. Moreover, some of these methods have a very simple structure--they involve only few message exchanges between the communicating parties. It is therefore natural to ask whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum protocol--one that has similar efficiency, but uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a problem such that its k+1 message classical communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity. This, in particular, proves a round hierarchy theorem for quantum communication complexity, and implies, via a simple reduction, an Omega(N^{1/k}) lower bound for k message quantum protocols for Set Disjointness for constant k. Enroute, we prove information-theoretic lemmas, and define a related measure of correlation, the informational distance, that we believe may be of significance in other contexts as well.

abstract: Partial search has been proposed recently for finding the target block containing a target element with fewer queries than the full Grover search algorithm which can locate the target precisely. Since such partial searches will likely be used as subroutines for larger algorithms their success rate is important. We propose a partial search algorithm which achieves success with unit probability.

abstract: We study families H_n of 1D quantum spin systems, where n is the number of spins, which have a spectral gap \Delta E between the ground-state and first-excited state energy that scales, asymptotically, as a constant in n. We show that if the ground state |\Omega_m> of the hamiltonian H_m on m spins, where m is an O(1) constant, is locally the same as the ground state |\Omega_n>, for arbitrarily large n, then an arbitrarily good approximation to the ground state of H_n can be stored efficiently for all n. We formulate a conjecture that, if true, would imply our result applies to all noncritical 1D spin systems. We also include an appendix on quasi-adiabatic evolutions.

abstract: We present a detailed, realistic analysis of the implementation of a proposal for a quantum phase gate based on atomic vibrational states, specializing it to neutral rubidium atoms on atom chips. We show how to create a double--well potential with static currents on the atom chips, using for all relevant parameters values that are achieved with present technology. The potential barrier between the two wells can be modified by varying the currents in order to realize a quantum phase gate for qubit states encoded in the atomic external degree of freedom. The gate performance is analyzed through numerical simulations; the operation time is ~10 ms with a performance fidelity above 99.9%. For storage of the state between the operations the qubit state can be transferred efficiently via Raman transitions to two hyperfine states, where its decoherence is strongly inhibited. In addition we discuss the limits imposed by the proximity of the surface to the gate fidelity.

abstract: The continuous-time quantum walk on the underlying graphs of association schemes have been studied, via the algebraic combinatorics structures of association schemes, namely semi-simple modules of their Bose-Mesner and (reference state dependent) Terwilliger algebras. By choosing the (walk) starting site as a reference state, the Terwilliger algebra connected with this choice turns the graph into the metric space, hence stratifies the graph into a (d+1) disjoint union of strata, where the amplitudes of observing the continuous-time quantum walk on all sites belonging to a given stratum are the same. In graphs of association schemes with known spectrum, the transition amplitudes and average probabilities are given in terms of dual eigenvalues of association schemes. As most of association schemes arise from finite groups, hence the continuous-time walk on generic group association schemes have been studied in great details, where the transition amplitudes are given in terms of characters of groups. Further investigated examples are the walk on graphs of association schemes of symmetric $S_n$, Dihedral $D_{2m}$ and cyclic groups. Also, following Ref.\cite{js}, the spectral distributions connected to the highest irreducible representations of Terwilliger algebras of some rather important graphs, namely distance regular graphs, have been presented. Then using spectral distribution, the amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on graphs such as cycle graph $C_n$, Johnson and normal subgroup graphs have been evaluated. {\bf Keywords: Continuous-time quantum walk, Association scheme, Bose-Mesner algebra, Terwilliger algebra, Spectral distribution, Distance regular graph.} {\bf PACs Index: 03.65.Ud}

abstract: The arguments given in this paper suggest that Grover's and Shor's algorithms are more closely related than one might at first expect. Specifically, we show that Grover's algorithm can be viewed as a quantum algorithm which solves a non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP). But we then go on to show that the standard non-abelian quantum hidden subgroup (QHS) algorithm can not find a solution to this particular HSP. This leaves open the question as to whether or not there is some modification of the standard non-abelian QHS algorithm which is equivalent to Grover's algorithm.

A source of this kind is expected to have a number of practical advantages that make it well suited for large scale quantum information processing applications.

abstract: We demonstrate a method for loading surface electrode ion traps by electron impact ionization. The method relies on the property of surface electrode geometries that the trap depth can be increased at the cost of more micromotion. By introducing a buffer gas, we can counteract the rf heating assocated with the micromotion and benefit from the larger trap depth. After an initial loading of the trap, standard compensation techniques can be used to cancel the stray fields resulting from charged dielectric and allow for the loading of the trap at ultra-high vacuum.

abstract: Recently, Cao et al. proposed a new quantum secure direct communication scheme using W state. In their scheme, the error rate introduced by an eavesdropper who takes intercept-resend attack, is only 8.3%. Actually, their scheme is just a quantum key distribution scheme because the communication parties first create a shared key and then encrypt the secret message using one-time pad. We then present a quantum secure communication scheme using three-qubit W state. In our scheme, the error rate is raised to 25% and it is not necessary for the present scheme to use alternative measurement or Bell basis measurement. We also show our scheme is unconditionally secure.

abstract: We propose a new quantum secret sharing scheme using a single non-entangled qubit. In the scheme, by transmitting a qubit to the next party sequentially, a sender can securely transmit a secret message to $N$ receivers who could only decode the message cooperatively after randomly shuffling the polarization of the qubit. We explain this quantum secret sharing scheme into the one between a sender and two receivers, and generalize the scheme between a sender and $N$ receivers. Since our scheme is capable of using a faint coherent pulse as a qubit, it is experimentally feasible within current technology.

Application of continuous feedback control of the center of mass of the atomic cloud is shown to generate oscillations of the spatial extension of the cloud, whose amplitude can be directly used as a characterization of atom-atom correlations. Feedback parameters can be chosen such that the violation of a Schwarz inequality for atom-atom correlations can be tested at noise levels much higher than the standard quantum limit.

We show that such systems often perform better than their Heisenberg nearest-neighbour coupled counterparts, and that fidelities closely approaching unity can be attained between the ends of finite chains without any special engineering of the system, although state transfer becomes slow in long chains. We discuss possible optimization methods, and find that, for any length, the best compromise between the quality and the speed of the communication is obtained in a nearly uniform chain of 4 spins.

abstract: Schemes for optical-state truncation of two cavity modes are analysed. The systems, referred to as the nonlinear quantum scissors devices, comprise two coupled nonlinear oscillators (Kerr nonlinear coupler) with one or two of them pumped by external classical fields. It is shown that the quantum evolution of the pumped couplers can be closed in a two-qubit Hilbert space spanned by vacuum and single-photon states only. Thus, the pumped couplers can behave as a two-qubit system. Analysis of time evolution of the quantum entanglement shows that Bell states can be generated. A possible implementation of the couplers is suggested in a pumped double-ring cavity with resonantly enhanced Kerr nonlinearities in an electromagnetically-induced transparency scheme. The fragility of the generated states and their entanglement due to the standard dissipation and phase damping are discussed by numerically solving two types of master equations.

abstract: We discuss the feasibility of a quantum nondemolition measurement (QND) of photon number based on cross phase modulation due to the Kerr effect in Photonic Crystal Waveguides (PCWs). In particular, we derive the equations for two modes propagating in PCWs and their coupling by a third order nonlinearity. The reduced group velocity and small cross-sectional area of the PCW lead to an enhancement of the interaction relative to bulk materials. We show that in principle, such experiments may be feasible with current photonic technologies, although they are limited by material properties. Our analysis of the propagation equations is sufficiently general to be applicable to the study of soliton formation, all-optical switching and can be extended to processes involving other orders of the nonlinearity.

We also argue that the method is not a new process tomography scheme, but rather represents an interesting modification of ancilla assisted process tomography method. In our opinion these modifications require deeper understanding and further investigation.

We derive analytical expressions for the corresponding coherence time.

Neutrinos carry away quantum information, but their interaction with matter is so weak that it would take an astronomically-sized machine just to catch them, not to mention performing controlled unitary operations on them. As a result quantum information is lost, and cheating is not possible even if the participants had access to the most powerful quantum computers that could ever be built. Therefore, for all practical purposes, our new protocol is as good as unconditionally secure.

abstract: We propose a scheme to implement the simplest and best-studied version of quantum random walk, the discrete Hadamard walk, in one dimension using coherent macroscopic sample of ultracold atoms, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Implementation of quantum walk using BEC gives access to the familiar quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale. This paper uses rf pulse to implement Hadamard operation (rotation) and stimulated Raman transition technique as unitary shift operator. The scheme suggests implementation of Hadamard operation and unitary shift operator while the BEC is trapped in long Rayleigh range optical dipole trap. The Hadamard rotation and a unitary shift operator on BEC prepared in one of the internal state followed by a bit flip operation, implements one step of the Hadamard walk. To realize a sizable number of steps, the process is iterated without resorting to intermediate measurement. With current dipole trap technology it should be possible to implement enough steps to experimentally highlight the discrete quantum random walk using a BEC leading to further exploration of quantum random walks and its applications.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603157
abstract: By utilizing single particle interferometry, the fidelity or coherence of a pair of quantum states is identified with their capacity for interference. We consider processes acting on the internal degree of freedom (e.g., spin or polarization) of the interfering particle, preparing it in states \rho_{A} or \rho_{B} in the respective path of the interferometer. The maximal visibility depends on the choice of interferometer, as well as the locality or non-locality of the preparations, but otherwise depends only on the states \rho_{A} and \rho_{B} and not the individual preparation processes themselves. This allows us to define interferometric measures which probe locality and correlation properties of spatially or temporally separated processes, and can be used to differentiate between processes that cannot be distinguished by direct process tomography using only the internal state of the particle.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603158
abstract: In this paper we continue our development of a dimensional perturbation theory (DPT) treatment of N identical particles under quantum confinement. DPT is a beyond-mean-field method which is applicable to both weakly and strongly-interacting systems and can be used to connect both limits. In a previous paper we developed the formalism for low-order energies and excitation frequencies. This formalism has been applied to atoms, Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum dots. One major advantage of the method is that N appears as a parameter in the analytical expressions for the energy and so results for N up to a few thousand are easy to obtain. Other properties however, are also of interest, for example the density profile in the case of a BEC,and larger N results are desirable as well. The latter case requires us to go to higher orders in DPT. These calculations require as input zeroth-order wave functions and this paper, along with a subsequent paper, addresses this issue.

abstract: We propose a method to construct quantum storage wherein the phase error due to decoherence is naturally suppressed without constant error detection and correction. As an example, we describe a quantum memory made of two physical qubits encoded in the ground state of a two-qubit phase-error detecting code. Such a system can be simulated by introducing a coupling between the two physical qubits. This method is effective for physical systems in which the $T_1$ decay process is negligible but coherence is limited by the $T_2$ decay process. We take trapped ions as a possible example to apply the natural suppression method and show that the $T_2$ decay time due to slow ambient fluctuating fields at the physical qubits can be lengthened as much as $10^4$.

By recasting the problem of finding quantum circuits as a geometric problem, we open up the possibility of using the mathematical techniques of Riemannian geometry to suggest new quantum algorithms, or to prove limitations on the power of quantum computers.

abstract: A strong entanglement monotone, which never increases under local operations and classical communications (LOCC), restricts quantum entanglement manipulation more strongly than the usual monotone since the usual one does not increase on average under LOCC. We propose new strong monotones in mixed-state entanglement manipulation under LOCC. These are related to the decomposability and 1-positivity of an operator constructed from a quantum state, and reveal geometrical characteristics of entangled states. These are lower bounded by the negativity or generalized robustness of entanglement.

abstract: We consider recent works on the simulation of quantum circuits using the formalism of matrix product states and the formalism of contracting tensor networks. We provide simplified direct proofs of many of these results, extending an explicit class of efficiently simulable circuits (log depth circuits with 2-qubit gates of limited range) to the following: let C be any poly sized quantum circuit (generally of poly depth too) on n qubits comprising 1- and 2- qubit gates and 1-qubit measurements (with 2-qubit gates acting on arbitrary pairs of qubit lines). For each qubit line j let D_j be the number of 2-qubit gates that touch or cross the line j i.e. the number of 2-qubit gates that are applied to qubits i,k with i \leq j \leq k. Let D=max_j D_j. Then the quantum process can be classically simulated in time n poly(2^D). Thus if D=O(log n) then C may be efficiently classically simulated.

abstract: Time-continuous wavefunction collapse mechanisms n o t restricted to markovian approximation have been found only a few years ago, and have left many issues open. The results apply formally to the standard relativistic quantum-electrodynamics. I present a generalized Schrodinger equation driven by a certain complex stochastic field. The equation reproduces the e x a c t dynamics of the interacting fermions in QED. The state of the fermions appears to collapse continuously, due to their interaction with the photonic degrees of freedom. Even the formal study is instructive for the foundations of quantum mechanics and of field theory as well.

abstract: We address the problem of quantum process tomography with the preparators producing states correlated with the environmental degrees of freedom that play role in the system-environment interactions. We discuss the physical situations, in which the dynamics is described by nonlinear, or noncompletely positive transformations. In particular, we show that arbitrary mapping $\varrho_{\rm in}\to\varrho_{\rm out}$ can be realized by using appropriate set of preparators and applying the unitary operation SWAP. The experimental ``realization'' of perfect NOT operation is presented. We address the problem of the verification of the compatibility of the preparator devices with the estimating process. The evolution map describing the dynamics in arbitrary time interval is known not to be completely positive, but still linear. The tomography and general properties of these maps are discussed.

abstract: We characterize the extremal points of the convex set of quantum measurements that are covariant under a finite-dimensional projective representation of a compact group, with action of the group on the measurement probability space which is generally non-transitive. In this case the POVM density is made of multiple orbits of positive operators, and, in the case of extremal measurements, we provide a bound for the number of orbits and for the rank of POVM elements. Two relevant applications are considered, concerning state discrimination with mutually unbiased bases and the maximization of the mutual information.

For these periodic solutions, the dual functions are associated polynomials that obey inhomogeneous equations. We construct in detail some explicit examples for the supersymmetric pairs of potentials V_{+/-}(z) = -U(z)^2 +/- z(d/(dz))U(z) where U(z) = \sum_{k>0}u_{k}z^{k}. In particular, we consider the cases generated by U(z) = z and z/(1-z). We also briefly consider the effects of magnetic vector potentials on the partition functions of these systems.

abstract: We generalize Hardy's proof of nonlocality to the case of bipartite mixed statistical operators, and we exhibit a necessary condition which has to be satisfied by any given mixed state $\sigma$ in order that a local and realistic hidden variable model exists which accounts for the quantum mechanical predictions implied by $\sigma$. Failure of this condition will imply both the impossibility of any local explanation of certain joint probability distributions in terms of hidden variables and the nonseparability of the considered mixed statistical operator. Our result can be also used to determine the maximum amount of noise, arising from imperfect experimental implementations of the original Hardy's proof of nonlocality, in presence of which it is still possible to put into evidence the nonlocal features of certain mixed states.

abstract: The term proposition usually denotes in quantum mechanics (QM) an element of (standard) quantum logic (QL). Within the orthodox interpretation of QM the propositions of QL cannot be associated with sentences of a language stating properties of individual samples of a physical system, since properties are nonobjective in QM. This makes the interpretation of propositions problematical. The difficulty can be removed by adopting the objective interpretation of QM proposed by one of the authors (semantic realism, or SR, interpretation). In this case, a unified perspective can be adopted for QM and classical mechanics (CM), and a simple first order predicate calculus L(x) with Tarskian semantics can be constructed such that one can associate a physical proposition (i.e., a set of physical states) with every sentence of L(x). The set $P^{f}$ of all physical propositions is partially ordered and contains a subset $P^{f}_{T}$ of testable physical propositions whose order structure depends on the criteria of testability established by the physical theory. In particular, $P^{f}_{T}$ turns out to be a Boolean lattice in CM, while it can be identified with QL in QM. Hence the propositions of QL can be associated with sentences of L(x), or also with the sentences of a suitable quantum language $L_{TQ}(x)$, and the structure of QL characterizes the notion of testability in QM. One can then show that the notion of quantum truth does not conflict with the classical notion of truth within this perspective. Furthermore, the interpretation of QL propounded here proves to be equivalent to a previous pragmatic interpretation worked out by one of the authors, and can be embodied within a more general perspective which considers states as first order predicates of a broader language with a Kripkean semantics.

abstract: We study the power of quantum fingerprints in the simultaneous message passing (SMP) setting of communication complexity. Yao recently showed how to simulate, with exponential overhead, classical shared-randomness SMP protocols by means of quantum SMP protocols without shared randomness ($Q^\parallel$-protocols). Our first result is to extend Yao's simulation to the strongest possible model: every many-round quantum protocol with unlimited shared entanglement can be simulated, with exponential overhead, by $Q^\parallel$-protocols. We apply our technique to obtain an efficient $Q^\parallel$-protocol for a function which cannot be efficiently solved through more restricted simulations. Second, we tightly characterize the power of the quantum fingerprinting technique by making a connection to arrangements of homogeneous halfspaces with maximal margin. These arrangements have been well studied in computational learning theory, and we use some strong results obtained in this area to exhibit weaknesses of quantum fingerprinting. In particular, this implies that for almost all functions, quantum fingerprinting protocols are exponentially worse than classical deterministic SMP protocols.

abstract: We have devised an optical scheme for the recently proposed protocol for encoding two qubits into one qutrit. In this protocol, Alice encodes an arbitrary pure product state of two qubits into a state of one qutrit. Bob can then restore error-free any of the two encoded qubit states but not both of them simultaneously. We have successfully realized this scheme experimentally using spatial-mode encoding. Each qubit (qutrit) was represented by a single photon that could propagate through two (three) separate fibers. We theoretically propose two generalizations of the original protocol. We have found a probabilistic operation that enables to retrieve both qubits simultaneously with the average fidelity above 90% and we have proposed extension of the original encoding transformation to encode N qubits into one (N+1)-dimensional system.

abstract: The analytic continuation of the Lippmann-Schwinger bras and kets is obtained and characterized. It is shown that the natural mathematical setting for the analytic continuation of the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is the rigged Hilbert space rather than just the Hilbert space. It is also argued that this analytic continuation entails the imposition of a time asymmetric boundary condition upon the group time evolution, resulting into a semigroup time evolution. Physically, the semigroup time evolution is simply a (retarded or advanced) propagator.

abstract: The basic idea of spin chain engineering for perfect quantum state transfer (QST) is to find a set of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian, such that a particular state initially encoded on one site will evolve freely to the opposite site without any dynamical controls. The minimal possible evolution time represents a speed limit for QST. We prove that the optimal solution is the one simulating the precession of a spin in a static magnetic field. We also argue that, at least for solid-state systems where interactions are local, it is more realistic to characterize the computation power by the couplings than the initial energy.

With this procedure, the time of factorization considerably decreases. The algorithm is based on a graphic representation and, when the corresponding graph is drawn, coordinate pairs will originate two straight lines that intercept one another. These coordinate pairs are formed by prime numbers in the x-axis, and factors in the y-axis, including the factor in common.

abstract: Starting from a phenomenological Hamiltonian originally written in terms of angular momentum operators we derive a new quantum angle-based Hamiltonian that allows for a discussion on the quantum spin tunneling. The study of the applicability of the present approach, carried out in calculations with a soluble quasi-spin model, shows that we are allowed to use our method in the description of physical systems such as the Mn12-acetate molecule, as well as the octanuclear iron cluster, Fe8, in a reliable way. With the present description the interpretation of the spin tunneling is seen to be direct, the spectra and energy barriers of those systems are obtained, and it is shown that they agree with the experimental ones.

Special cases thereof are quantum NOT operations which transform entangled pure two-qubit input states of a given degree of entanglement into orthogonal states in an optimal way. Based on our general analysis all covariant optimal two-qubit quantum NOT operations are determined. In particular, it is demonstrated that only in the case of maximally entangled input states these quantum NOT operations can be performed perfectly.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603185
abstract: We present a microscopic laser model for many atoms coupled to a single cavity mode, including the light forces resulting from atom-field momentum exchange. Within a semiclassical description, we solve the equations for atomic motion and internal dynamics to obtain analytic expressions for the optical potential and friction force seen by each atom. When optical gain is maximum at frequencies where the light field extracts kinetic energy from the atomic motion, the dynamics combines optical lasing and motional cooling. From the corresponding momentum diffusion coefficient we predict sub-Doppler temperatures in the stationary state. This generalizes the theory of cavity enhanced laser cooling to active cavity systems. We identify the gain induced reduction of the effective resonator linewidth as key origin for the faster cooling and lower temperatures, which implys that a bad cavity with a gain medium can replace a high-Q cavity. In addition, this shows the importance of light forces for gas lasers in the low-temperature limit, where atoms can arrange in a periodic pattern maximizing gain and counteracting spatial hole burning. Ultimately, in the low temperature limit, such a setup should allow to combine optical lasing and atom lasing in single device.

abstract: Considerable attention has been recently focused on quantum-mechanical systems with boundaries and/or singular potentials for which the construction of physical observables as self-adjoint (s.a.) operators is a nontrivial problem. We present a comparative review of various methods of specifying ordinary s.a. differential operators generated by formally s.a. differential expressions based on the general theory of s.a. extensions of symmetric operators. The exposition is untraditional and is based on the concept of asymmetry forms generated by adjoint operators. The main attention is given to a specification of s.a. extensions by s.a. boundary conditions. All the methods are illustrated by examples of quantum-mechanical observables like momentum and Hamiltonian. In addition to the conventional methods, we propose a possible alternative way of specifying s.a. differential operators by explicit s.a. boundary conditions that generally have an asymptotic form for singular boundaries. A comparative advantage of the method is that it allows avoiding an evaluation of deficient subspaces and deficiency indices. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by a number of examples of quantum-mechanical observables.

For our general study we divide the potentials in two kinds, namely tightly binding and loosely binding potentials. In the presence of an external periodically modulating force, these potentials may exhibit classical and quantum chaos. The dynamics of a quantum wave packet in the modulated potentials displays recurrences at various time scales. We develop general analytical relations for these times and discuss their parametric dependence.

abstract: We have previously [Phys. Rev. A 65, 043803 (2002)] analyzed adaptive measurements for estimating the continuously varying phase of a coherent beam, and a broadband squeezed beam. A real squeezed beam must have finite photon flux N and hence can be significantly squeezed only over a limited frequency range. In this paper we analyze adaptive phase measurements of this type for a realistic model of a squeezed beam. We show that, provided it is possible to suitably choose the parameters of the beam, a mean-square phase uncertainty scaling as (N/kappa)^{-5/8} is possible, where kappa is the linewidth of the beam resulting from the fluctuating phase. This is an improvement over the (N/kappa)^{-1/2} scaling found previously for coherent beams. In the experimentally realistic case where there is a limit on the maximum squeezing possible, the variance will be reduced below that for coherent beams, though the scaling is unchanged.

journal:

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603190
abstract: A scheme to perform the Cartan decomposition for the Lie algebra su(N) of arbitrary finite dimensions is introduced. The schme is based on two algebraic structures, the conjugate partition and the quotient algebra, that are easily generated by a Cartan subalgebra and generally exist in su(N). In particular, the Lie algebras su(2^p) and every su(2^{p-1} < N < 2^p) share the isomorphic structure of the quotient algebra. This structure enables an efficient algorithm for the recursive and exhaustive construction of Cartan decompositions. Further with the scheme, a unitary transformation in SU(N) can be recursively decomposed into a product of certain designated operators, e.g., local and nonlocal gates. Such a recursive decomposition of a transformation implies an evolution path on the manifold of the group.

abstract: We investigate the behavior of N atoms resonantly coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode sustained by a high quality cavity, containing a mesoscopic coherent field. We show with a simple effective hamiltonian model that the strong coupling between the cavity and the atoms produces an atom-field entangled state, involving N+1 nearly-coherent components slowly rotating at different paces in the phase plane. The periodic overlap of these components results in a complex collapse and revival pattern for the Rabi oscillation. We study the influence of decoherence due to the finite cavity quality factor. We propose a simple analytical model, based on the Monte Carlo approach to relaxation. We compare its predictions with exact calculations and show that these interesting effects could realistically be observed on a two or three atoms sample in a 15 photons field with circular Rydberg atoms and superconducting cavities.

abstract: We studied optical coherence properties of the 1.53 $\mu$m telecommunication transition in an Er$^{3+}$-doped silicate optical fiber through spectral holeburning and photon echoes. We find decoherence times of up to 3.8 $\mu$s at a magnetic field of 2.2 Tesla and a temperature of 150 mK. A strong magnetic-field dependent optical dephasing was observed and is believed to arise from an interaction between the electronic Er$^{3+}$ spin and the magnetic moment of tunneling modes in the glass. Furthermore, we observed fine-structure in the Erbium holeburning spectrum originating from superhyperfine interaction with $^{27}$Al host nuclei. Our results show that Er$^{3+}$-doped silicate fibers are promising material candidates for quantum state storage.

First, based on QED in causal media, leading-order perturbation theory is used to express both the single-atom Casimir-Polder and the two-atom van der Waals potentials in terms of the atomic polarizabilities and the Green tensor for the body-assisted electromagnetic field. Endowed with this geometry-independent framework, we then employ the Born expansion of the Green tensor together with the Clausius-Mosotti relation to prove that the macroscopic Casimir-Polder potential of an atom in the presence of dielectric bodies is due to an infinite sum of its microscopic many-atom van der Waals interactions with the atoms comprising the bodies. This theorem holds for inhomogeneous, dispersing, and absorbing bodies of arbitrary shapes and arbitrary atomic composition on an arbitrary background of additional magnetodielectric bodies.

abstract: We present measurements of the linear Stark effect on the $^{4}$I$_{15/2} \to$ $^{4}$I$_{13/2}$ transition in an Er$^{3+}$-doped proton-exchanged LiNbO$_{3}$ crystalline waveguide and an Er$^{3+}$-doped silicate fiber. The measurements were made using spectral hole burning techniques at temperatures below 4 K. We measured an effective Stark coefficient $(\Delta\mu_{e}\chi)/(h)=25\pm1$kHz/Vcm$^{-1}$ in the crystalline waveguide and $(\bar{\Delta\mu_{e}}\chi)/(h)=15\pm1$kHz/Vcm$^{-1}$ in the silicate fiber. These results confirm the potential of Erbium doped waveguides for quantum state storage based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening.

abstract: We present a number of alternative designs for Penning ion traps suitable for quantum information processing (QIP) applications with atomic ions. The first trap design is a simple array of long straight wires which allows easy optical access. A prototype of this trap has been built to trap Ca+ and a simple electronic detection scheme has been employed to demonstrate the operation of the trap. Another trap design consists of a conducting plate with a hole in it situated above a continuous conducting plane. The final trap design is based on an array of pad electrodes. Although this trap design lacks the open geometry of the traps described above, the pad design may prove useful in a hybrid scheme in which information processing and qubit storage take place in different types of trap. The behaviour of the pad traps is simulated numerically and techniques for moving ions rapidly between traps are discussed. Future experiments with these various designs are discussed. All of the designs lend themselves to the construction of multiple trap arrays, as required for scalable ion trap QIP.

abstract: We generalize the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger nonlocality without inequalities argument to cover the case of arbitrary mixed statistical operators associated to three-qubits quantum systems. More precisely, we determine the radius of a ball (in the trace distance topology) surrounding the pure GHZ state and containing arbitrary mixed statistical operators which cannot be described by any local and realistic hidden variable model and which are, as a consequence, noncompletely separable. As a practical application, we focus on certain one-parameter classes of mixed states which are commonly considered in the experimental realization of the original GHZ argument and which result from imperfect preparations of the pure GHZ state. In these cases we determine for which values of the parameter controlling the noise a nonlocality argument can still be exhibited, despite the mixedness of the considered states. Moreover, the effect of the imperfect nature of measurement processes is discussed.

Moreover, the cavity provides a feedback mechanism allowing to reduce the quantum fluctuations of the ground state spin, resulting in strong steady state spin-squeezing.

abstract: We study evolution of entanglement of two two-level atoms placed inside a multilayered microsphere. We show that due to inhomogeneity of the field modes this entanglement essentially depends on the atomic positions (asymmetrical entanglement) and also on the detuning between the atomic transitions and field frequencies. The robust and complete entanglement can be achieved even in the resonant case when the atoms have different effective coupling constants, and it can be extended in time if the detuning is large enough. We study analytically the lossless case and estimate numerically the effect of dissipative processes.

abstract: Ever since entanglement was identified as a computational and cryptographic resource, researchers have sought efficient ways to tell whether a given density matrix represents an unentangled, or separable, state. This paper gives the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of this (bipartite) quantum separability problem, focusing on its deterministic (as opposed to randomized) computational complexity. First, I review the one-sided tests for separability, paying particular attention to the semidefinite programming methods. Then, I discuss various ways of formulating the quantum separability problem, from exact to approximate formulations, the latter of which are the paper's main focus. I then give a thorough treatment of the problem's relationship with the complexity classes NP, NP-complete, and co-NP. I also discuss extensions of Gurvits' NP-hardness result to strong NP-hardness of certain related problems. A major open question is whether the NP-contained formulation (QSEP) of the quantum separability problem is Karp-NP-complete; QSEP may be the first natural example of a problem that is Turing-NP-complete but not Karp-NP-complete. Finally, I survey all the proposed (deterministic) algorithms for the quantum separability problem, including the bounded search for symmetric extensions (via semidefinite programming), based on the recent quantum de Finetti theorem; and the entanglement-witness search (via interior-point algorithms and global optimization). These two algorithms have the lowest complexity, with the latter being the best under advice of asymptotically optimal point-coverings of the sphere.

abstract: The standard quantum theory has not taken into account the size of quantum particles, the latter being implicitly treated as material points. The recent interference experiments of Zeilinger [3] with large molecules like fullerenes and the thought experiments of Bozic et al [7] with asymmetrical Young slits make it possible today to take into account the particle size. We present here a complete study of this phenomenon where our simulations show differences between the particles density after the slits and the modulus square of the wave function. Then we propose a crucial experiment that allows us to reconsider the wave-particle duality and to test the existence of the Broglie-Bohm trajectories for indistinguishable particles.

abstract: The transition from the quantum to the classical is governed by randomizing devices (RD), i.e., dynamical systems that are very sensitive to the environment. We show that, in the presence of RDs, the usual arguments based on the linearity of quantum mechanics that lead to the measurement problem do not apply. RDs are the source of probabilities in quantum mechanics. Hence, the reason for probabilities in quantum mechanics is the same as the reason for probabilities in other parts of physics, namely our ignorance of the state of the environment. This should not be confused with decoherence. The environment here plays several, equally important roles: it is the dump for energy and entropy of the RD, it puts the RD close to its transition point and it is the reason for probabilities in quantum mechanics. We show that, even though the state of the environment is unknown, the probabilities can be calculated and are given by the Born rule. We then discuss what this view of quantum mechanics means for the search of a quantum theory of gravity.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A theory of gravitational quantum states of ultracold neutrons in waveguides with absorbing/scattering walls is presented. The theory covers recent experiments in which the ultracold neutrons were beamed between a mirror and a rough scatterer/absorber. The analysis is based on a recently developed theory of quantum transport along random rough walls which is modified in order to include leaky (absorbing) interfaces and, more importantly, the low-amplitude high-aperture roughness. The calculations are focused on a regime when the direct transitions into the continuous spectrum above the absorption threshold dominate the depletion of neutrons from the gravitational states and are more efficient than the processes involving the intermediate states. The theoretical results for the neutron count are sensitive to the correlation radius (lateral size) of surface inhomogeneities and to the ratio of the particle energy to the absorption threshold in a weak roughness limit. The main impediment for observation of the higher gravitational states is the "overhang" of the particle wave functions which can be overcome only by use scatterers with strong roughness. In general, the strong roughness with high amplitude is preferable if one wants just to detect the individual gravitational states, while the strong roughness experiments with small amplitude and high aperture are preferable for the quantitative analysis of the data. We also discuss the ways to further improve the accuracy of calculations and to optimize the experimental regime.

abstract: Grover presented the phase-shift search by replacing the selective inversions by selective phase shifts of $\pi /3$. In this paper, we investigate the phase-shift search with general equal phase shifts. We show that for small uncertainties, the failure probability of the Phase-$\pi /3$ search is smaller than the general phase-shift search and for large uncertainties, the success probability of the large phase-shift search is larger than the Phase-$\pi /3$ search. Therefore, the large phase-shift search is suitable for large-size of databases.

abstract: A new approximation formalism is applied to study the bound states of the Hellmann potential, which represents the superposition of the attractive Coulomb potential $-a/r$ and the Yukawa potential $b\exp (-\delta r)/r$ of arbitrary strength $b$ and screening parameter $\delta $. Although the analytic expressions for the energy eigenvalues $E_{n,l\text{}}$ yield quite accurate results for a wide range of $n,\ell $ in the limit of very weak screening, the results become gradually worse as the strength $b$ and the screening coefficient $\delta $ increase. This is because that the expansion parameter is not sufficiently small enough to guarantee the convergence of the expansion series for the energy levels.

abstract: In 1993, Mermin (Rev. Mod. Phys. 65, 803--815) gave lucid and strikingly simple proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem in Hilbert spaces of dimensions four and eight by making use of what has since been referred to as the Mermin(-Peres) "magic square" and the Mermin pentagram, respectively. The former is a $3 \times 3$ array of nine observables commuting pairwise in each row and column and arranged so that their product properties contradict those of the assigned eigenvalues. The latter is a set of ten observables arranged in five groups of four lying along five edges of the pentagram and characterized by similar contradiction. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between the operators of the Mermin-Peres square and the points of the projective line over the product ring ${\rm GF}(2) \otimes \rm{GF}(2)$ is established. Under this mapping, the concept "mutually commuting" translates into "mutually distant" and the distinguishing character of the third column's observables has its counterpart in the distinguished properties of the coordinates of the corresponding points, whose entries are both either zero-divisors, or units. The ten operators of the Mermin pentagram answer to a specific subset of points of the line over GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The situation here is, however, more intricate as there are two different configurations that seem to serve equally well our purpose. The first one comprises the three distinguished points of the (sub)line over GF(2), their three "Jacobson" counterparts and the four points whose both coordinates are zero-divisors; the other features the neighbourhood of the point ($1, 0$) (or, equivalently, that of ($0, 1$)). Some other ring lines that might be relevant for BKS proofs in higher dimensions are also mentioned.

abstract: The many-fingered time (MFT) formulation of many-particle quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is a natural framework that overcomes the problem of "instantaneous collapse" in entangled systems that exhibit nonlocalities. The corresponding Bohmian interpretation can also be formulated in terms of MFT beables, which alleviates the problem of instantaneous action at a distance by using an ontology that differs from that in the standard Bohmian interpretation. The appearance of usual single-time particle-positions and fields is recovered by quantum measurements.

abstract: What can we learn about entanglement between individual particles in macroscopic samples by observing only the collective properties of the ensembles? Using only a few experimentally feasible collective properties, we establish an entanglement measure between two samples of spin-1/2 particles (as representatives of two-dimensional quantum systems). This is a tight lower bound for the average entanglement between all pairs of spins in general and is equal to the average entanglement for a certain class of systems. We compute the entanglement measures for explicit examples and show how to generalize the method to more than two samples and multi-partite entanglement.

abstract: In this summary we discuss two new algorithms for Grover's unsorted database search problem that claimed to have reached exponential speedup over Grover's original algorithm. One is in the quantum setting with "power queries" that allow for exponential reduction in the number of queries over Grover's original algorithm with "bit queries". The other is to use "dubit queries" on a duality computer - a new computing model uses a quantum system's wave-particle duality, which is able to achieve even greater computing power and better capability than existent quantum computers we have been discussing. We discuss the shortages and difficulties of both schemes as well.

Our results agree with the reported ones by Burkard, Loss and DiVincenzo in their model of quantum gates based on quantum dots, as well as with some recent experimental reports.

abstract: The characteristic stretching and squeezing of chaotic motion is linearized within the finite number of phase space domains which subdivide a classical baker map. Tensor products of such maps are also chaotic, but a more interesting generalized baker map arises if the stacking orders for the factor maps are allowed to interact. These maps are readily quantized, in such a way that the stacking interaction is entirely attributed to primary qubits in each map, if each subsystem has power-of-two Hilbert space dimension. We here study the particular example of two baker maps that interact via a controlled-not interaction. Numerical evidence indicates that the control subspace becomes an ideal Markovian environment for the target map in the limit of large Hilbert space dimension.

We then compare the efficiency of both protocols and sketch the generalization of the protocols to N parties.

Contrarily to GE the main feature of this measure lies in the fact that we study the mean linear entropy of all possible partitions of a multipartite system. This allows the construction of an operational multipartite entanglement measure which is able to distinguish among different multipartite entangled states that GE failed to discriminate. Furthermore, it is also maximum at the critical point of the Ising chain in a transverse magnetic field, being thus able to detect a quantum phase transition.

abstract: Among the various kinds of entangled states, the 'W state' plays an important role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even under particle loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum information processing and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report the scalable and deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-particle entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain the maximum possible information on these states by performing full characterization via state tomography, using individual control and detection of the ions. A detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine. The availability of such multiparticle entangled states, together with full information in the form of their density matrices, creates a test-bed for theoretical studies of multiparticle entanglement. Independently, -Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger- entangled states with up to six ions have been created and analysed in Boulder.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency allows for light transmission through dense atomic media by means of quantum interference. Media exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency have very interesting properties, such as extremely slow group velocities. Associated with the slow light propagation are quasiparticles, the so-called dark polaritons, which are mixtures of a photonic and an atomic contribution. We here demonstrate that these excitations behave as particles with a nonzero magnetic moment, which is in clear contrast to the properties of a free photon. It is found that light passing through a rubidium gas cell under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency is deflected by a small magnetic field gradient. The deflection angle is proportional to the optical propagation time through the cell. The observed beam deflection can be understood by assuming that dark state polaritons have an effective magnetic moment. Our experiment can be described in terms of a Stern-Gerlach experiment for the polaritons.

abstract: We propose a method that enables strong, coherent coupling between individual optical emitters and electromagnetic excitations in conducting nano-structures. The excitations are optical plasmons that can be localized to sub-wavelength dimensions. Under realistic conditions, the tight confinement causes optical emission to be almost entirely directed into the propagating plasmon modes via a mechanism analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics. We first illustrate this result for the case of a nanowire, before considering the optimized geometry of a nanotip. We describe an application of this technique involving efficient single-photon generation on demand, in which the plasmons are efficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide. Finally we analyze the effects of increased scattering due to surface roughness on these nano-structures.

We show that for a subclass of channels with some extra conditions, including the examples which we consider, the states which minimize the output entropy are the ones which maximize the mutual information.

abstract: We show the decrease of spin-spin entanglement between two s=1/2 fermions or two photons due to local transfer of correlations from the spin to the momentum degree of freedom of one of the two particles. We explicitly show how this phenomenon operates in the case where one of the two fermions (photons) passes through a local homogeneous magnetic field (optically-active medium), losing its spin correlations with the other particle.

abstract: In this book chapter, we provide a tutorial introduction to one-way quantum computation and many of the techniques one can use to understand it. The techniques which are described include the stabilizer formalism and the logical Heisenberg picture. We highlight ways in which it is useful to understand one-way computation beyond simple equivalence with the quantum circuit model. We briefly review current proposals of implementations and experimental progress and summarize some recent related theoretical developments. Although the chapter is primarily didactic in focus, we include a number of new methods and observations. These include: a simpler and more compact formulation of one-way quantum computation in the stabilizer formalism; A new way of implementing unitaries diagonal in the computational basis; New results on the family of operations which may be implemented in a single round of measurements; A method for constructing compact one-way patterns by decomposing unitaries in terms of diagonal unitaries and Clifford group transformations.

abstract: Creation of entanglement is considered theoretically and numerically in an ensemble of spin chains with dipole-dipole interaction between the spins. The unwanted effect of the long-range dipole interaction is compensated by the optimal choice of the parameters of radio-frequency pulses implementing the protocol. The errors caused by (i) the influence of the environment,(ii) non-selective excitations, (iii) influence of different spin chains on each other, (iv) displacements of qubits from their perfect locations, and (v) fluctuations of the external magnetic field are estimated analytically and calculated numerically. For the perfectly entangled state the z component, M, of the magnetization of the whole system is equal to zero. The errors lead to a finite value of M. If the number of qubits in the system is large, M can be detected experimentally. Using the fact that M depends differently on the parameters of the system for each kind of error, varying these parameters would allow one to experimentally determine the most significant source of errors and to optimize correspondingly the quantum computer design in order to decrease the errors and M. Using our approach one can benchmark the quantum computer, decrease the errors, and prepare the quantum computer for implementation of more complex quantum algorithms.

abstract: An open ended spin chain can serves as a quantum data bus for the coherent transfer of quantum state information. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of such quantum spin channels which work in a decoherence environment. Our results show that, the decoherence will significantly reduce the fidelity of quantum communication through the spin channels. Generally speaking, as the distance increases, the decoherence effects become more serious, which will put some constraints on the spin chains for long distance quantum state transfer.

abstract: Using a consistent quantum-mechanical treatment for the electromagnetic radiation, we theoretically investigate the magnetic spin-flip scatterings of a neutral two-level atom trapped in the vicinity of a superconducting body. We derive a simple scaling law for the corresponding spin-flip lifetime for such an atom trapped near a superconducting thick slab. For temperatures below the superconducting transition temperature T_c, the lifetime is found to be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the case of a normal conducting slab. At zero temperature the spin-flip lifetime is given by the unbounded free-space value.

This potential is of possible interest to quark physics in so far as it captures the essentials of the QCD quark-gluon dynamics and (i) interpolates between a Coulomb-like potential (associated with one-gluon exchange) and the infinite wall potential (associated with asymptotic freedom), (ii) reproduces in the intermediary region the linear confinement potential (associated with multi-gluon self-interactions) as established by lattice QCD calculations of hadron properties. Moreover, its exact real solutions given here display a new class of real orthogonal polynomials and thereby interesting mathematical entities in their own.

abstract: The wave mechanics of two impenetrable hard core particles in 1-D box is analyzed. Each particle in the box behaves like an independent entity represented by a {\it macro-orbital} (a kind of pair waveform). While the expectation value of their interaction, $<V_{HC}(x)>$, vanishes for every state of two particles, the expectation value of their relative separation, $<x>$, satisfies $<x> \ge \lambda/2$ (or $q \ge \pi/d$, with $2d = L$ being the size of the box). The particles in their ground state define a close-packed arrangement of their wave packets (with $<x> = \lambda/2$, phase position separation $\Delta\phi = 2\pi$ and momentum $|q_o| = \pi/d$) and experience a mutual repulsive force ({\it zero point repulsion}) $f_o = h^2/2md^3$ which also tries to expand the box. While the relative dynamics of two particles in their excited states represents usual collisional motion, the same in their ground state becomes collisionless. These results have great significance in determining the correct microscopic understanding of widely different many body systems.

abstract: An attack on the ``Bennett-Brassard 84''(BB84) quantum key-exchange protocol in which Eve exploits the action of gravitation to infer information about the quantum-mechanical state of the qubit exchanged between Alice and Bob, is described. It is demonstrated that the known laws of physics do not allow to describe the attack. Without making assumptions that are not based on broad consensus, the laws of quantum gravity, unknown up to now, would be needed even for an approximate treatment. Therefore, it is currently not possible to predict with any confidence if information gained in this attack will allow to break BB84. Contrary to previous belief, a proof of the perfect security of BB84 cannot be based on the assumption that the known laws of physics are strictly correct, yet.

The present quantum secure direct communication protocol makes use of the ideal of block transmission. We also point out that the sender can encode his or her secret message without ensuring the security of the quantum channel firstly. In the multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol, the communication parties adopt checking mode or encoding mode with a certain probability. It is not necessary for the protocol to perform local unitary operation. In both the protocols, one party transmits only one photon for each Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair to another party and the security for the transmitting photons is ensured by selecting Z-basis or X-basis randomly to measure the sampling photons.

abstract: Excited bound states are often understood within scattering based theories as resulting from the collision of a particle on a target via a short-range potential. We show that the resulting formalism is non-Hermitian and describe the Hilbert spaces and metric operator relevant to a correct formulation of such theories. The structure and tools employed are the same that have been introduced in current works dealing with PT-symmetric and quasi-Hermitian problems. The relevance of the non-Hermitian formulation to practical computations is assessed by introducing a non-Hermiticity index. We give a numerical example involving scattering by a short-range potential in a Coulomb field for which it is seen that even for a small but non-negligible non-Hermiticity index the non-Hermitian character of the problem must be taken into account. The computation of physical quantities in the relevant Hilbert spaces is also discussed.

It is shown that earlier results follow simply and directly from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The limits on the long-time dependence of anomalous diffusion are shown to be a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. The special case of an electron interacting with the radiation field is discussed in detail. We apply our results to wave-packet spreading.

While the Lipkin Hamiltonian is hermitian and has a second order phase transition in finite dimensions (finite particle number), both properties seem to be destroyed in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: We propose an inductive procedure to classify N-partite entanglement under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) provided such a classification is known for N-1 qubits. The method is based upon the analysis of the coefficient matrix of the state in an arbitrary product basis. We illustrate this approach in detail with the well-known bi- and tripartite systems, obtaining as a by-product a systematic criterion to establish the entanglement class of a given pure state without resourcing to any entanglement measure. The general case is proved by induction, allowing us to find an upper bound for the number of N-partite entanglement classes in terms of the number of entanglement classes for N-1 qubits.

We present the protocol which enables encoding of n qudits to one qudit of dimension smaller than the Hilbert space of the original system and then probabilistically but error-free decode any subset of k qudits. We give a formula for the probability of successful decoding.

abstract: The recent remarkable developments in quantum optics, mesoscopic and cold atom physics have given reality to wave functions. It is then interesting to explore the consequences of assuming ensembles over the wave functions simply related to the canonical density matrix. In this note we analyze a previously introduced distribution over wave functions which naturally arises considering the Schroedinger equation as an infinite dimensional dynamical system. In particular, we discuss the low temperature fluctuations of the quantum expectations of coordinates and momenta for a particle in a double well potential. Our results may be of interest in the study of chiral molecules.

abstract: With the reliance in the processing of quantum information on a cold trapped ion, we analyze the entanglement entropy in the ion-field interaction with pair cat states. We investigate a long-living entanglement allowing the instantaneous position of the center-of-mass motion of the ion to be explicitly time dependent. An analytic solution for the system operators is obtained. We show that different nonclassical effects arise in the dynamics of the population inversion, depending on the initial states of the vibrational motion. We study in detail the entanglement degree and demonstrate how the input pair cat state is required for initiating the long living entanglement. This long living entanglement is damp out with an increase in the number difference $q$. Owing to the properties of entanglement measures, the results are checked using another entanglement measure (high order linear entropy).

abstract: We study the mechanical effects of light on an atom trapped in a harmonic potential when an atomic dipole transition is driven by a laser and it is strongly coupled to a mode of an optical resonator. We investigate the cooling dynamics in the bad cavity limit, focussing on the case in which the effective transition linewidth is smaller than the trap frequency, hence when sideband cooling could be implemented. We show that quantum correlations between the mechanical actions of laser and cavity field can lead to an enhancement of the cooling efficiency with respect to sideband cooling. Such interference effects are found when the resonator losses prevail over spontaneous decay and over the rates of the coherent processes characterizing the dynamics.

abstract: Daniel Simon's 1994 discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over Z_2^n provided one of the first algebraic problems for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. In this paper, we study the generalization of Simon's problem to arbitrary groups. Fixing a finite group G, this is the problem of recovering an involution m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n from an oracle f with the property that f(x) = f(xy) iff y equals m or the identity. In the current parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the form G^n, where G is a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden subgroup is either trivial or has order two. Although groups of the form G^n have a simple product structure, they share important representation-theoretic properties with the symmetric groups S_n, where a solution to the HSP would yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. In particular, solving their HSP with the so-called ``standard method'' requires highly entangled measurements on the tensor product of many coset states. Here we give quantum algorithms with time complexity 2^O(sqrt(n log n)) that recover hidden involutions m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n where, as in Simon's problem, each m_i is either the identity or the conjugate of a known element k, and there is a character X of G for which X(k) = -X(1)$. Our approach combines the general idea behind Kuperberg's sieve for dihedral groups with the ``missing harmonic'' approach of Moore and Russell. These are the first nontrivial hidden subgroup algorithms for group families that require highly entangled multiregister Fourier sampling.

authors: E. Knill
comments: 17 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603252
abstract: There are two complementary approaches to realizing quantum information so that it is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding information by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information. We give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the "subsystems principle" for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult. Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.

abstract: There is a widespread belief in the quantum physical community, and in textbooks used to teach Quantum Mechanics, that it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator Exp{-itH/h} on an initial wave function. That is to say, because the hamiltonian operator generally is the sum of two operators, then it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator on an initial wave function f(x,0), for it implies to apply terms operators like (a+b)^n. A possible solution of this problem is to factorize the time evolution operator and then apply successively the individual exponential operator on the initial wave function. However, the exponential operator does not directly factorize, i. e. Exp{a+b} is not equal to Exp{a}Exp{b}. In this work we present a useful procedure for factorizing the time evolution operator when the argument of the exponential is a sum of two operators, which obey specific commutation relations. Then, we apply the exponential operator as an evolution operator for the case of elementary unidimensional potentials, like the particle subject to a constant force and the harmonic oscillator. Also, we argue about an apparent paradox concerning the time evolution operator and non-spreading wave packets addressed previously in the literature.

abstract: Generation and characterization of entanglement are crucial tasks in quantum information processing. A hypothesis testing scheme for entanglement has been formulated. Three designs were proposed to test the entangled photon states created by the spontaneous parametric down conversion. The time allocations between the measurement vectors were designed to consider the anisotropic deviation of the generated photon states from the maximally entangled states. The designs were evaluated in terms of the p-value based on the observed data. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the optimal time allocation between the coincidence and anti-coincidence measurement vectors improves the entanglement test. A further improvement is also experimentally demonstrated by optimizing the time allocation between the anti-coincidence vectors. Analysis on the data obtained in the experiment verified the advantage of the entanglement test designed by the optimal time allocation.

abstract: We demonstrate in straightforward calculations that even under ideally weak noise the relaxation of bipartite open quantum systems contains elements not previously encountered in quantum noise physics. While additivity of decay rates is known to be generic for decoherence of a single system, we demonstrate that it breaks down for bipartite coherence of even the simplest composite systems.

abstract: The notion of weak-degradability of quantum channels is introduced by generalizing the degradability definition given by Devetak and Shor. Exploiting the unitary equivalence with beam-splitter/amplifier channels we then prove that a large class of one-mode Bosonic Gaussian channels are either weakly degradable or anti-degradable. In the latter case this implies that their quantum capacity Q is null. In the former case instead, this allows us to establish the additivity of the coherent information for those maps which admit unitary representation with single-mode pure environment.

Torres del Castillo consider various symplectic structures on the classical phase space of the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. Using Dirac's quantization condition, the authors investigate how these alternative symplectic forms affect this system's quantization. They claim that these symplectic structures result in mutually inequivalent quantum theories. In fact, we show here that there exists a unitary map between the two representation spaces so that the various quantizations are equivalent.

abstract: We prove a no-go theorem for storing quantum information in equilibrium systems. Namely, quantum information cannot be stored in a system with time-independent Hamiltonian interacting with heat bath of temperature $T>0$ during time that grows with the number of used qubits. We prove it by showing, that storing quantum information for macroscopic time would imply existence of perpetuum mobile of the second kind. The general results are illustrated by the Kitaev model of quantum memory. In contrast, classical information can be stored in equilibrium states for arbitrary long times. We show how it is possible via phase-transition type phenomena. Our result shows that there is a fundamental difference between quantum and classical information in {\it physical} terms.

abstract: The quantum baker map possesses two symmetries: a canonical "spatial" symmetry, and a time-reversal symmetry. We show that, even when these features are taken into account, the asymptotic entangling power of the baker's map does not always agree with the predictions of random matrix theory. We have verified that the dimension of the Hilbert space is the crucial parameter which determines whether the entangling properties of the baker are universal or not. For power-of-two dimensions, i.e., qubit systems, an anomalous entangling power is observed; otherwise the behavior of the baker is consistent with random matrix theories. We also derive a general formula that relates the asymptotic entangling power of an arbitrary unitary with properties of its reduced eigenvectors.

abstract: We provide a simple security proof for prepare & measure quantum key distribution protocols employing noisy processing and one-way postprocessing of the key. This is achieved by showing that the security of such a protocol is equivalent to that of an associated key distribution protocol in which, instead of the usual maximally-entangled states, a more general {\em private state} is distilled. Besides a more general target state, the usual entanglement distillation tools are employed (in particular, Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-like codes), with the crucial difference that noisy processing allows some phase errors to be left uncorrected without compromising the privacy of the key.

abstract: We review the notion of a classical random cipher and its advantages. We sharpen the usual description of random ciphers to a particular mathematical characterization suggested by the salient feature responsible for their increased security. We describe a concrete system known as AlphaEta and show that it is equivalent to a random cipher in which the required randomization is effected by coherent-state quantum noise. We describe the currently known security features of AlphaEta and similar systems, including lower bounds on the unicity distances against ciphertext-only and known-plaintext attacks. We show how AlphaEta used in conjunction with any standard stream cipher such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) provides an additional, qualitatively different layer of security from physical encryption against known-plaintext attacks on the key. We refute some claims in the literature that AlphaEta is equivalent to a non-random stream cipher.

abstract: For single-photon quantum key generation between two users, it is shown that the use of a shared secret key extended via a pseudo-random number generator may simultaneously enhance the security and efficiency of the cryptosystem. This effect arises from the intrinsic performance difference between quantum detectors with versus without knowledge of the key, a purely quantum effect and a new principle for key generation. No intrusion level estimation is needed and the method is directly applicable to realistic systems with imperfections. Quantum direct encryption is also made possible by such use of a secret key.

abstract: We study the effects of losses on the entanglement created between two separate atomic gases by optical probing and homodyne detection of the transmitted light. The system is well-described in the Gaussian state formulation. Analytical results quantifying the degree of entanglement between the two gases are derived and compared with the entanglement in a pair of light pulses generated by an EPR source. For low (high) transmission losses the highest degree of entanglement is obtained by probing with squeezed (antisqueezed) light. In an asymmetric setup where light is only sent one way through the atomic samples, we find that the logarithmic negativity of entanglement attains a constant value $-\log_2(N)$ with $N=1/3$ irrespectively of the loss along the transmission line.

abstract: We propose a universal decomposition of unitary maps over a tensorial power of C^2, introducing the key concept of "phase maps", and investigate how this decomposition can be used to implement unitary maps directly in the measurement-based model for quantum computing. Specifically, we show how to extract from such a decomposition a matching entangled graph state (with inputs), and a set of measurements angles, when there is one. Next, we check whether the obtained graph state verifies a "flow" condition, which guarantees an execution order such that the dependent measurements and corrections of the pattern yield deterministic results. Using a graph theoretic characterization of flows, we can determine whether a flow can be constructed for a graph state in polynomial time. This approach yields an algorithmic procedure which, when it succeeds, may produce an efficient pattern for a given unitary.

abstract: We analyse the off-resonant Raman interaction of a single broadband photon, copropagating with a classical `control' pulse, with an atomic ensemble. It is shown that the classical electrodynamical structure of the interaction guarantees canonical evolution of the quantum mechanical field operators. This allows the interaction to be decomposed as a beamsplitter transformation between optical and material excitations on a mode-by-mode basis. A single, dominant modefunction describes the dynamics for arbitrary control pulse shapes. Complete transfer of the quantum state of the incident photon to a collective dark state within the ensemble can be achieved by shaping the control pulse so as to match the dominant mode to the temporal mode of the photon. Readout of the material excitation, back to the optical field, is considered in the context of the symmetry connecting the input and output modes. Finally, we show that the transverse spatial structure of the interaction is characterised by the same mode decomposition.

abstract: We analyze the entanglement between two modes of a free Dirac field as seen by two relatively accelerated parties. The entanglement is degraded by the Unruh effect and asymptotically reaches a non-vanishing minimum value in the infinite acceleration limit. This means that the state always remains entangled to a degree and can be used in quantum information tasks, such as teleportation, between parties in relative uniform acceleration. We analyze our results from the point of view afforded by the phenomenon of entanglement sharing and in terms of recent results in the area of multi-qubit complementarity.

abstract: We present a simple method to obtain an upper bound on the achievable secret key rate in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that use only unidirectional classical communication during the public-discussion phase. This method is based on a necessary precondition for one-way secret key distillation; the legitimate users need to prove that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric extension that is compatible with the available measurements results. The main advantage of the obtained upper bound is that it can be formulated as a semidefinite program, which can be efficiently solved. We illustrate our results by analysing two well-known qubit-based QKD protocols: the four-state protocol and the six-state protocol. Recent results by Renner et al., Phys. Rev. A 72, 012332 (2005), also show that the given precondition is only necessary but not sufficient for unidirectional secret key distillation.

authors: Marie Lalire
comments: 23 pages, accepted for publication in MSCS
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603274
abstract: Full formal descriptions of algorithms making use of quantum principles must take into account both quantum and classical computing components, as well as communications between these components. Moreover, to model concurrent and distributed quantum computations and quantum communication protocols, communications over quantum channels which move qubits physically from one place to another must also be taken into account. Inspired by classical process algebras, which provide a framework for modeling cooperating computations, a process algebraic notation is defined. This notation provides a homogeneous style to formal descriptions of concurrent and distributed computations comprising both quantum and classical parts. Based upon an operational semantics which makes sure that quantum objects, operations and communications operate according to the postulates of quantum mechanics, an equivalence is defined among process states considered as having the same behavior. This equivalence is a probabilistic branching bisimulation. From this relation, an equivalence on processes is defined. However, it is not a congruence because it is not preserved by parallel composition.

The measurement of the ground state of both atoms is finally required when they exit the cavities. We also give a brief evaluation of the experimental feasibility of the scheme.

abstract: The accessible information acc(E) of an ensemble E is the maximum mutual information between a random variable encoded into quantum states, and the probabilistic outcome of a quantum measurement of the encoding. Accessible information is extremely difficult to characterize analytically; even bounds on it are hard to place. The celebrated Holevo bound states that accessible information cannot exceed chi(E), the quantum mutual information between the random variable and its encoding. However, for general ensembles, the gap between the acc(E) and chi(E) may be arbitrarily large. We consider the special case of a binary random variable, which often serves as a stepping stone towards other results in information theory and communication complexity. We give explicit lower bounds on the the accessible information acc(E) of an ensemble E = {(p, rho_0), (1-p, rho_1)}, with 0 <= p <= 1, as functions of p and chi(E). The bounds are incomparable in the sense that they surpass each other in different parameter regimes. Our bounds arise by measuring the ensemble according to a complete orthogonal measurement that preserves the fidelity of the states rho_0,rho_1. As an intermediate step, therefore, we give new relations between the two quantities acc(E), chi(E) and the fidelity B(rho_0,rho_1).

An atomic level scheme is devised such that in the presence of strong linearly polarized drive field a coherent weak probe field acquires a phase proportional to the number of photons in the signal mode immaterial of its polarization state. It is also shown that the unavoidable phase-kicks resulting due to the measurement process are insensitive to the polarization state of the incoming signal photon. It is envisioned that such a device would have tremendous applicability in photonic quantum information proposals where quantum information in the polarization qubit is to be protected.

abstract: Entangled states with a positive partial transpose (PPTES) have interest both in quantum information and in the theory of positive maps. In $3\otimes 3$ there is a conjecture by Sanpera, Bru{\ss} and Lewenstein [PRA, 63, 050301] that all PPTES have Schmidt number two (or equivalently that every 2-positive map between $3\times 3$ matrices is decomposable). In order to prove or disprove the conjecture it is sufficient to look at edge PPTES. Here the rank m of the PPTES and the rank n of its partial transpose seem to play an important role. Until recently all known examples of edge PPTES had ranks (4,4) or (6,7). In a recent paper Ha and Kye [quant-ph/0509079] managed to find edge PPTES for all ranks except (5,5) and (6,6). Here we complement their work and present edge PPTES with those ranks.

Counting two photons in one beam projects the other beam in the desired two-photon Fock state, which is analyzed by using a pulsed homodyne detection. The Wigner function of the measured state is clearly negative. We developed a detailed analytic model which allows a fast and efficient analysis of the experimental results.

Moreover, a strong dependence of this effect on the nature of the noise correlations as well as on the parity of the space dimension is found. We conjecture that when entanglement gives an advantage in terms of mutual information, maximally entangled states saturate the channel capacity.

We show that in general, the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of certain symmetry observables gives a lower bound to the entropy. In some cases this bound is saturated and directly gives the entropy. We also show other cases in which the probability distribution contains enough information to extract the entropy: we show how this is done in several examples including BEC wave functions, the Dicke model, XY spin chain and chains with strong randomness.

abstract: We propose an optical means to realize a spin hall effect (SHE) in neutral atomic system by coupling the internal spin states of atoms to radiation. The interaction between the external optical fields and the atoms creates effective magnetic fields that act in opposite directions on "electrically" neutral atoms with opposite spin polarizations. This effect leads to a Landau level structure for each spin orientation in direct analogy with the familiar SHE in semiconductors. The conservation and topological properties of the spin current, and the creation of a pure spin current are discussed.

Based on a density-matrix formalism, we calculate the absorption coefficient numerically. The appearance of the EIT dip in the spectra profile gives clear evidence for the creation of the dark state in the atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate.

abstract: We describe a method for implementing deterministic quantum gates between two spin qubits separated by centimeters. Qubits defined by the singlet and triplet states of two exchange coupled quantum dots have recently been shown to possess long coherence times. When the effective nuclear fields in the two asymmetric quantum dots are different, total spin will no longer be a good quantum number and there will be a large electric dipole coupling between the two qubit states. We show that when such a double-quantum-dot qubit is embedded in a superconducting microstrip cavity, the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics lies within reach. Virtual photons in a common cavity mode could mediate coherent interactions between two distant qubits embedded in the same structure; the range of this two-qubit interaction is determined by the wavelength of the microwave transition.

Possible applications are single-photon generation and the controllable creation of qubit-oscillator entanglement.

abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of creating spin quantum entanglement in a system of two electrons confined respectively in two vertically coupled quantum dots in the presence of Rashba type spin-orbit coupling. We find that the system can be described by a generalized Jaynes - Cummings model of two modes bosons interacting with two spins. The lower excitation states of this model are calculated to reveal the underlying physics of the far infrared absorption spectra. The analytic perturbation approach shows that an effective transverse coupling of spins can be obtained by eliminating the orbital degrees of freedom in the large detuning limit. Here, the orbital degrees of freedom of the two electrons, which are described by two modes of bosons, serve as a quantized data bus to exchange the quantum information between two electrons. Then a nontrivial two-qubit logic gate is realized and spin entanglement between the two electrons is created by virtue of spin-orbit coupling.

abstract: We consider a system consisting of single electrons moving along a 1D wire in the presence of two magnetic impurities. Such system shows strong analogies with a Fabry - Perot interferometer in which the impurities play the role of two mirrors with a quantum degree of freedom: the spin. We have analysed the electron transmittivity of the wire in the presence of entanglement between the impurity spins. The main result of our analysis is that, for suitable values of the electron momentum, there are two maximally entangled state of the impurity spins the first of which makes the wire transparent whatever the electron spin state while the other strongly inhibits the electron transmittivity. Such predicted striking effect is experimentally observable with present day technology.

abstract: We present a proposal for deterministic quantum teleportation of electrons in a semiconductor nanostructure consisting of a single and a double quantum dot. The central issue addressed in this paper is how to design and implement the most efficient - in terms of the required number of single and two-qubit operations - deterministic teleportation protocol for this system. Using a group-theoretical analysis we show that deterministic teleportation requires a minimum of three single-qubit rotations and two entangling (sqrt(swap)) operations. These can be implemented for spin qubits in quantum dots using electron spin resonance (for single-spin rotations) and exchange interaction (for sqrt(swap) operations).

abstract: We propose to use the spin-orbit interaction as a means to control electron spins in quantum dots, enabling both single qubit and two qubit operations. Very fast single qubit operations may be achieved by temporarily displacing the electrons. For two qubit operations the coupling mechanism is based on a combination of the spin-orbit coupling and the mutual long-ranged Coulomb interaction. Compared to existing schemes using the exchange coupling, the spin-orbit induced coupling is less sensitive to random electrical fluctuations in the electrodes defining the quantum dots.

abstract: The effects of entanglement and spin-spin collision on the gauge field in ultracold atoms are presented in this paper. Two gauge fields are calculated and discussed. One of the fields comes from space dependent spin-spin collisions in ultra-cold atoms, while another results from the usual Born-Oppenheimer method, which separates the center-of-mass motion from the relative motion in the two-body problem. Adiabatic conditions that lead to the key results of this paper are also presented and discussed. Entanglement shared between the two atoms is shown to affect the atomic motion. In the presence of entanglement, the additional scalar potential disappears, this is different from the case of atoms in separable states.

abstract: A system of traps is considered, each containing a large number of Bose-condensed atoms. This ensemble of traps is subject to the action of an external modulating field generating nonequilibrium nonground-state condensates. When the frequency of the modulating field is in resonance with the transition frequency between two different topological coherent modes, each trap becomes an analog of a finite-level resonant atom. Similarly to the case of atoms in an electromagnetic resonant field, one can create entanglement between atomic traps subject to a common resonant modulating field generating higher coherent modes in each of the traps. A method is suggested for regulating entanglement production in such a system of multitrap and multimode Bose-Einstein condensates coupled through a common resonant modulating field. Several regimes of evolutional entanglement production, regulated by manipulating the external field, are illustrated by numerical calculations.

The full spin density matrix is obtained, so that along with relaxation and thermoactivation, coherent dynamics is included (precession, tunnel, etc.). The method is applied to study isotropic spins and spins in a bistable anisotropy potential (superparamagnets). We present examples of static response, the dynamical susceptibility including the contribution of the different relaxation modes, and of spin resonance in transverse fields.

abstract: The two-level systems (TLSs) naturally occurring in Josephson junctions constitute a major obstacle for the operation of superconducting phase qubits. Since these TLSs can possess remarkably long decoherence times, we show that such TLSs can themselves be used as qubits, allowing for a well controlled initialization, universal sets of quantum gates, and readout. Thus, a single current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be considered as a multiqubit register. It can be coupled to other CBJJs to allow the application of quantum gates to an arbitrary pair of qubits in the system. Our results indicate an alternative way to realize superconducting quantum information processing.

abstract: We propose a practically accessible non-mean-field ground state of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which occurs in an interspecies two-particle entangled state, and is thus described by an entangled order parameter. A suitably defined entanglement entropy is used as the characterization of the non-mean-field nature, and is found to persist in a wide parameter regime. The interspecies entanglement leads to novel interference terms in the dynamical equations governing the single particle orbital wavefunctions. Experimental feasibility and several methods of probe are discussed. We urge the study of multi-channel scattering between different species of atoms.

abstract: A quantum phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase is driven by a time-dependent external magnetic field. For any rate of the transition the evolution is non-adiabatic and finite density of defects is excited in the ferromagnetic state. The density of excitations has only logarithmic dependence on the transition rate. This is much weaker than any usual power law scaling predicted for pure systems by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

This induces a decoherence effect that is independent of any interaction with the environment and appears in addition to any usual environmental decoherence. The discussion is framed self consistently and aimed to general physicists. We derive the modified Schroedinger equation that arises in quantum mechanics with real clocks and discuss the theoretical and potential experimental implications of this process of decoherence.

abstract: One of the biggest unsolved problems in physics is the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. The lack of experimental guidance has made the issue extremely evasive, though various attempts have been made to relate the loss of matter wave coherence to quantum spacetime fluctuations. We present a new approach to the gravitational decoherence near the Planck scale, made possible by recently discovered conformal structure of canonical gravity. This leads to a gravitational analogue of the Brownian motion whose correlation length is given by the Planck length up to a scaling factor. With input from recent matter wave experiments, we show that the minimum value of this factor to be well within the expected range for quantum gravity theories. This suggests that the sensitivities of advanced matter wave interferometers may be approaching the fundamental level due to quantum spacetime fluctuations and that investigating Planck scale physics using matter wave interferometry may become a reality in the near future.

abstract: In this paper we use an exact method to impose unitarity on moduli of the neutrino PMNS matrix recently determined, and show how one could obtain information on CP non-conservation from a limited experimental information. One suggests a novel type of global fit by expressing all the theoretical quantities in terms of convention independent parameters: the Jarlskog invariant $J$ and the moduli $|U_{\alpha i}|$, able to resolve the positivity problem of $|U_{e 3}|$. In this way the fit will directly provide a value for $J$, and if it is different from zero it will prove the existence of CP violation in the available experimental data. If the best fit result, $|U_{e3}|^2<0$, from M. Maltoni {\em et al}, New J.Phys. {\bf 6} (2004) 122 is confirmed, it will imply a new physics in the leptonic sector.

We show that our proposal perfectly reproduces the correct entanglement entropy in 2D CFT when applied to AdS_3. We also compare the entropy computed in AdS_5 \times S^5 with that of the free N=4 super Yang-Mills.

After separation of variables, the one-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian is analyzed from the point of view of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Attention is paid to the discrete symmetries of the Hamiltonian and also to the Hamiltonian hierarchies generated by intertwining operators. The spectrum is studied by means of the associated matrix shape-invariance. The relation between the intertwining operators and the second order symmetries is established and the full set of ladder operators that complete the dynamical algebra is constructed.

abstract: Two known 2-dim SUSY quantum mechanical constructions - the direct generalization of SUSY with first-order supercharges and Higher order SUSY with second order supercharges - are combined for a class of 2-dim quantum models, which {\it are not amenable} to separation of variables. The appropriate classical limit of quantum systems allows us to construct SUSY-extensions of original classical scalar Hamiltonians. Special emphasis is placed on the symmetry properties of the models thus obtained - the explicit expressions of quantum symmetry operators and of classical integrals of motion are given for all (scalar and matrix) components of SUSY-extensions. Using Grassmanian variables, the symmetry operators and classical integrals of motion are written in a unique form for the whole Superhamiltonian. The links of the approach to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi method for related "flipped" potentials are established.

We then argue that such a difference may be used to investigate the asymmetry for particle/anti-particle as well as to propose bounds on the associated Lorentz-symmetry violating parameters.

abstract: We provide a mathematical framework for PT-symmetric quantum theory, which is applicable irrespective of whether a system is defined on R or a complex contour, whether PT symmetry is unbroken, and so on. The linear space in which PT-symmetric quantum theory is naturally defined is a Krein space constructed by introducing an indefinite metric into a Hilbert space composed of square integrable complex functions in a complex contour. We show that in this Krein space every PT-symmetric operator is P-Hermitian if and only if it has transposition symmetry as well, from which the characteristic properties of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonians found in the literature follow. Some possible ways to construct physical theories are discussed within the restriction to the class K(H).

abstract: Recently striking multiple relations have been found between pure state 2 and 3-qubit entanglement and extremal black holes in string theory. Here we add further mathematical similarities which can be both useful in string and quantum information theory. In particular we show that finding the frozen values of the moduli in the calculation of the macroscopic entropy in the STU model, is related to finding the canonical form for a pure three-qubit entangled state defined by the dyonic charges. In this picture the extremization of the BPS mass with respect to moduli is connected to the problem of finding the optimal local distillation protocol of a GHZ state from an arbitrary pure three-qubit state. These results and a geometric classification of STU black holes BPS and non-BPS can be described in the elegant language of twistors. Finally an interesting connection between the black hole entropy and the average real entanglement of formation is established.

abstract: Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor are investigated for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in the region between two coaxial cylindrical boundaries. It is assumed that the field obeys general Robin boundary conditions on bounding surfaces. The application of a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula allows to extract from the expectation values the contribution from single shells and to present the interference part in terms of exponentially convergent integrals. The vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. The first one contains well-known surface divergences and needs a further renormalization. The interaction forces between the cylindrical boundaries are finite and are attractive for special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann scalars. For the general Robin case the interaction forces can be both attractive or repulsive depending on the coefficients in the boundary conditions. The total Casimir energy is evaluated by using the zeta function regularization technique. It is shown that it contains a part which is located on bounding surfaces. The formula for the interference part of the surface energy is derived and the energy balance is discussed.

The perturbation series is rederived by the duality principle in perturbation theory.

abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum polarization effects associated with a massive fermionic field due to the non-trivial topology of the global monopole spacetime and boundary conditions imposed on this field. Specifically we investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and fermionic condensate admitting that the field obeys the MIT bag boundary condition on two concentric spherical shells. In order to develop this analysis, we use the generalized Abel-Plana summation, which allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values the contribution coming from a single sphere geometry and to present the second sphere induced part in terms of exponentially convergent integrals. In the limit of strong gravitational field corresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle deficit in global monopole geometry, the interference part in the expectation values are exponentially suppressed. The vacuum forces acting on spheres are presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. Due to the surface divergences, the first one is divergent and needs additional renormalization, while the second one is finite for all non-zero distances between the spheres. By making use of zeta function renormalization technique, the total Casimir energy is evaluated in the region between two spheres. It is shown that the interaction part of the vacuum energy is negative and the interaction forces between the spheres are attractive. Asymptotic expressions are derived in various limiting cases. As a special case we discuss the fermionic vacuum densities for two spherical shells on background of the Minkowski spacetime.

abstract: A hypergeometric type equation satisfying certain conditions defines either a finite or an infinite system of orthogonal polynomials. The associated special functions are eigenfunctions of some shape invariant operators. These operators can be analysed together and the mathematical formalism we use can be extended in order to define other shape invariant operators. All the considered shape invariant operators are directly related to Schrodinger type equations.

abstract: We provide a simple proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound and use it to prove the existence of the dynamics for interactions with polynomial decay. We then use our results to demonstrate that there is an upper bound on the rate at which correlations between observables with separated support can accumulate as a consequence of the dynamics.

abstract: The aim of the paper is to provide a constructive method for recovering a unitary matrix from experimental data. Since there is a natural immersion of unitary matrices within the set of double stochastic ones, the problem to solve is to find necessary and sufficient criteria that separate the two sets. A complete solution is provided for the 3-dimensional case, accompanied by a $\chi^2$ test necessary for the reconstruction of a unitary matrix from error affected data.

abstract: A grid polygon is a polygon whose vertices are points of a grid. We define an injective map between permutations of length n and a subset of grid polygons on n vertices, which we call consecutive-minima polygons. By the kernel method, we enumerate sets of permutations whose consecutive-minima polygons satisfy specific geometric conditions. We deal with 2-variate and 3-variate generating functions involving derivatives, cases which are not routinely solved by the kernel method.

abstract: It is known that the Standard Model describing all of the currently known elementary particles is based on the $U(1)\times SU(2)\times SU(3)$ symmetry. In order to implement this symmetry on the ground of a non-flat space-time manifold one should introduce three special bundles. Some aspects of the mathematical theory of these bundles are studied in this paper.

abstract: We rationalize the somewhat surprising efficacy of the Hadamard transform in simplifying the eigenstates of the quantum baker's map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. This allows us to construct closely related, but new, transforms that do significantly better, thus nearly solving for many states of the quantum baker's map. These new transforms, which combine the standard Fourier and Hadamard transforms in an interesting manner, are constructed from eigenvectors of the shift permutation operator that are also simultaneous eigenvectors of bit-flip (parity) and possess bit-reversal (time-reversal) symmetry.

abstract: The classical Liouville density on the constant energy surface reveals a number of interesting features when the initial density has no directional preference. It has been shown (Physical Review Letters, 93 (2004) 204102) that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the momentum-projected density evolution operator have a correspondence with the quantum Neumann energy eigenstates in billiard systems. While the classical eigenfunctions are well approximated by the quantum Neumann eigenfunctions, the classical eigenvalues are of the form f(\sqrt{E_n} vt) where {E_n} are close to the quantum Neumann eigenvalues and v is the speed of the classical particle. Despite the approximate nature of the correspondence, we demonstrate here that the exact quantum Neumann eigenstates can be used to expand and evolve an arbitrary classical density on the energy surface projected on to the configuration space. For the rectangular and stadium billiards, results are compared with the actual evolution of the density using classical trajectories.
