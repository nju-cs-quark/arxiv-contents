abstract: Aberg has claimed in a recent Letter," Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 150402 (2014)", that the coherence of a reservoir can be used repeatedly to perform coherent operations without ever diminishing in power to do so. The claim has particular relevance for quantum thermodynamics because, as shown in "Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 150402 (2014)", latent energy that is locked by coherence may be extractable without incurring any additional cost. We show here, however, that repeated use of the reservoir gives an overall coherent operation of diminished accuracy and is necessarily accompanied by an increased thermodynamic cost.

abstract: It was recently realised that quantum theory allows for so-called causally nonseparable processes, which are incompatible with any definite causal order. This was first suggested on a rather abstract level by the formalism of process matrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in some observers' laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was then shown, on a more practical level, that the quantum switch---a new resource for quantum computation that goes beyond causally ordered circuits---provided precisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable process. To demonstrate that a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Ara\'ujo et al., New J. Phys. 17, 102001 (2015)] the concept of witnesses of causal nonseparability. Here we present a shorter introduction to this concept, and concentrate on some explicit examples to show how to construct and use such witnesses in practice.

abstract: A BosonSampling device is a quantum machine expected to perform tasks intractable for a classical computer, yet requiring minimal non-classical resources as compared to full-scale quantum computers. Photonic implementations to date employed sources based on inefficient processes that only simulate heralded single-photon statistics when strongly reducing emission probabilities. BosonSampling with only single-photon input has thus never been realised. Here, we report on a BosonSampling device operated with a bright solid-state source of highly-pure single-photon Fock states: the emission from an efficient and deterministic quantum dot-micropillar system is demultiplexed into three partially-indistinguishable single-photons, with purity $1{-}g^{(2)}(0)$ of $0.990\pm0.001$, interfering in a $6{\times}6$ linear optics network. Our demultiplexed source is orders-of-magnitude brighter than current heralded multi-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion, allowing us to complete the BosonSampling experiment 100 times faster than previous equivalent implementations. This intrinsic source superiority places BosonSampling with larger photon numbers within near reach.

abstract: We consider the quantum processor based on a chain of trapped ions to propose an architecture wherein the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions (position and momentum) could be exploited as the computational Hilbert space. We adopt a continuous-variables approach to develop a toolbox of quantum operations to manipulate one or two vibrational modes at a time. Together with the intrinsic non-linearity of the qubit degree of freedom, employed to mediate the interaction between modes, arbitrary manipulation and readout of the ionic wave function could be achieved.

abstract: A non-commuting measurement transfers, via the apparatus, information encoded in a system's state to the external "observer". Classical measurements determine properties of physical objects. In the quantum realm, the very same notion restricts the recording process to orthogonal states as only those are distinguishable by measurements. Therefore, even a possibility to describe physical reality by means of non-hermitian operators should \emph{volens nolens} be excluded as their eigenstates are not orthogonal. Here, we show that non-hermitian operators with real spectrum can be treated within the standard framework of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we propose a quantum canonical transformation that maps hermitian systems onto non-hermitian ones. Similar to classical inertial forces this transformation is accompanied by an energetic cost pinning the system on the unitary path.

abstract: The transfer of data is a fundamental task in information systems. Microprocessors contain dedicated data buses that transmit bits across different locations and implement sophisticated routing protocols. Transferring quantum information with high fidelity is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic fragility of quantum states. We report on the implementation of the perfect state transfer protocol applied to a photonic qubit entangled with another qubit at a different location. On a single device we perform three routing procedures on entangled states with an average fidelity of 97.1%. Our protocol extends the regular perfect state transfer by maintaining quantum information encoded in the polarisation state of the photonic qubit. Our results demonstrate the key principle of perfect state transfer, opening a route toward data transfer for quantum computing systems.

abstract: Spin echo is a fundamental tool for quantum registers and biomedical imaging. It is believed that a strong magnetic field is needed for the spin echo to provide long memory and high resolution since a degenerate spin cannot be well controlled or addressed under a zero magnetic field. While a degenerate spin is never subject to dynamic control, it is still subject to geometric control. We here show the spin echo of a degenerate spin subsystem, which is geometrically controlled via a mediating state split by the crystal field, in a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The demonstration revealed that the degenerate spin is protected from both the amplitude and phase noises by inherent symmetry breaking called axial and transverse zero-field splittings. The geometric spin echo under zero field provides a way to ideally maintain the coherence without any dynamics, thus opening the way to pseudo-static quantum RAM and non-invasive biosensors.

In particular, we provide a one-to-one correspondence between patterns and density operators, represented by mixed states when the uncertainty comes into play. The classification process in the quantum framework is performed by the introduction of a normalized trace distance between density operators in place of the Euclidean distance between patterns. We provide a comparison of the introduced method in the case of 2D data classification.

abstract: The effect of noise on various protocols of secure quantum communication has been studied. Specifically, we have investigated the effect of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping, Pauli type as well as various collective noise models on the protocols of quantum key distribution, quantum key agreement,quantum secure direct quantum communication and quantum dialogue. From each type of protocol of secure quantum communication, we have chosen two protocols for our comparative study; one based on single qubit states and the other one on entangled states. The comparative study reported here has revealed that single-qubit-based schemes are generally found to perform better in the presence of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping noises, while entanglement-based protocols turn out to be preferable in the presence of collective noises. It is also observed that the effect of noise entirely depends upon the number of rounds of quantum communication involved in a scheme of quantum communication. Further, it is observed that squeezing, a completely quantum mechanical resource present in the squeezed generalized amplitude channel, can be used in a beneficial way as it may yield higher fidelity compared to the corresponding zero squeezing case.

abstract: Considering the intrinsic nonlinearity in a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a charge qubit, vacuum Rabi splitting effect is studied in a nanomechanical QED (qubit-resonator) system. A driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model describes the dynamics of this qubit-resonator system. Using quantum regression theorem and master equation approach, we have calculated the two-time correlation spectrum analytically. In the weak driving limit, these analytical results clarify the influence of the driving strength and nonlinearity parameter on the correlation spectrum. Also, numerical calculations confirm these analytical results.

The electromagnetic zero-point energy for some frequencies is suppressed by the block below the free-space value, while for other frequencies it is increased. We also calculate the regularized (Casimir) zero-point energy at each frequency and find that it too is less than the free-space value (zero) for some frequencies. The total Casimir energy is positive.

abstract: A well-known situation in which a non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system $S$ arises is when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system $M$ in contact with a Markovian bath. In such cases, while the joint dynamics of $S$-$M$ is Markovian and obeys a standard (bipartite) Lindblad-type master equation (ME), this is in general not true for the reduced dynamics of $S$. Furthermore, there are several instances (\eg the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model) in which a {\it closed} ME for the $S$'s state {\it cannot} even be worked out. Here, we find a class of bipartite Lindblad-type MEs such that the reduced ME of $S$ can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any initial product state of $S$-$M$. We provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our result in terms of a mapping between two collision models

abstract: Three experimental groups succeeded recently to close, at the same time, locality and fair sampling loopholes and confirmed that realism or counterfactual definiteness may not be used to explain quantum phenomena. Since there is now a general consensus that Bell inequalities are violated it is important to understand what does it mean and how can we explain the existence of strong correlations between outcomes of distant measurements, predicted by quantum mechanics. Do we have to announce that: Einstein was wrong, Nature is not local and the correlations are produced due to the quantum magic and emerge, somehow, from outside space-time? We reject such conclusions and we show that violations of various inequalities can neither prove completeness of quantum mechanics nor that Nature is not local. We propose simpler contextual explanation of long range correlations predicted by quantum mechanics which reconciles in some sense Bohr with Einstein and we conclude that there is no evidence that Nature plays dice. We argue that to prove predictable completeness of quantum mechanics one has to search for fine structures in experimental data which might have been averaged out in standard statistical analysis and which were not predicted by the theory.

abstract: We analyze plane waves in a model of quantum mechanics in a three dimensional noncommutative (NC) space $R^3_{\lambda}$. Signature features of NC models are impossibility of probing distances smaller than a certain length scale {\lambda} and a presence of natural energetic cut-off at energy scale of order $1/{\lambda}^2$ (in convenient units). We analyze consequences of such restrictions on a 1 dimensional Casimir effect. The result shows resemblance to flux tube potential for quark-antiquark pairs and to effective bosonic string theories with L\"uscher terms. Such behavior might effect the radius of possible compact (fuzzy) dimensions.

abstract: We predict a repulsive Casimir-Polder-type dispersion interaction between a single neutron and a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a single neutron subject to an external magnetic field. Due to its intrinsic magnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-level system which can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric one (surface) is found to be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller than than the standard atom-surface Casimir-Polder force due to the magnetic nature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-neutron mass ratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational potential of the same surface.

abstract: Performing experiments on small-scale quantum computers is certainly a challenging endeavor. Many parameters need to be optimized to achieve high-fidelity operations. This can be done efficiently for operations acting on single qubits as errors can be fully characterized. For multi-qubit operations, though, this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for which resources scale exponentially with the system size. Furthermore, in recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two-level system encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum information processors, which additionally increases the number of parameters that need to be controlled. For the optimization of the experimental system for a given task (e.g.~a quantum algorithm), one has to find a satisfactory error model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model. In this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but constant phase shifts. The method, which we implement here on a small-scale linear ion-trap quantum computer, is readily applicable to other AMO platforms for quantum information processing.

abstract: We study the applicability of collisional models for non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. By allowing interactions between the separate environmental degrees of freedom in between collisions we are able to construct a collision model that allows to study quantum memory effects in open system dynamics. We also discuss the possibility to embed non-Markovian collision model dynamics into Markovian collision model dynamics in an extended state space. As a concrete example we show how using the proposed class of collision models we can discretely model non- Markovian amplitude damping of a qubit. In the time-continuous limit, we obtain the well-known results for spontaneous decay of a two level system in to a structured zero-temperature reservoir

abstract: We point out a contrasting role the entanglement plays in communication and estimation scenarios. In the first case it brings noticeable benefits at the measurement stage (output super-additvity), whereas in the latter it is the entanglement of the input probes that enables significant performance enhancement (input super-additvity). We identify a weak estimation regime where a strong connection between concepts crucial to the two fields is demonstrated; the accessible information and the Holevo quantity on one side and the quantum Fisher information related quantities on the other. This allows us to shed new light on the problem of super-additivity in communication using the concepts of quantum estimation theory.

abstract: Fock states are a fundamental resource for many quantum technologies such as quantum metrology. While much progress has been made in single-photon source technologies, preparing Fock states with large photon number remains challenging. We present and analyze a bootstrapped approach for non-deterministically preparing large photon-number Fock states by iteratively fusing smaller Fock states on a beamsplitter. We show that by employing state recycling we are able to exponentially improve the preparation rate over conventional schemes, allowing the efficient preparation of large Fock states. The scheme requires single-photon sources, beamsplitters, number-resolved photo-detectors, fast-feedforward, and an optical quantum memory.

abstract: From the Hamiltonian connecting the inside and outside of an Fabry-Perot cavity, which is derived from the Maxwell boundary conditions at a mirror of the cavity, a master equation of a non-Lindblad form is derived when the cavity embeds matters, although we can transform it to the Lindblad form by performing the rotating-wave approximation to the connecting Hamiltonian. We calculate absorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also by the Maxwell boundary conditions in the framework of the classical electrodynamics, which we consider the most reliable approach. We found that, compared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra by the non-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions. Although the discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultra-strong light-matter interaction regime with a relatively large broadening, the master equation of the non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the Lindblad one for pursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.

abstract: Photon modes have an important role in characterizing the quantum sources of light. Proper coupling of various photon modes obtained in spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in optical fibers is essential to generate an effective source of entangled photons. The two main pre-detection factors affecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing parameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental results on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon modes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton coupling efficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We attribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of down-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the ellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam. We also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry with the pump focusing parameter. These results may be useful in selecting optimum conditions in the down-conversion process for generating efficient sources of entangled photons for quantum information applications.

A suitable spatial dependence in the external bias of a dc-SQUID array mimics the propagation of light in a 1D wormhole background. The impedance of the array places severe limitations on the type of spacetime that we are able to implement. However, we find that wormhole throat radius in the sub-mm range are achievable. We show how to modify this spacetime in order to allow the existence of closed timelike curves. The quantum fluctuations of the phase associated to the finite array impedance might be seen as an analogue of Hawking's chronology protection mechanism.

abstract: Quantum metrology promises high-precision measurements beyond the capability of any classical techniques. This has the potential to be integral to investigative techniques. However, all sensors must tolerate imperfections if their operation is to be practical. Here we show that photons without perfectly overlapped modes, which are therefore partially-distinguishable, are not required for quantum-enhancement of measurement and partially-distinguishable photons do not have to be engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of distinguishability. We quantify the effect of distinguishability on quantum metrology experiments and conduct an experiment to verify the utility of two- and four-photon states containing partially-distinguishable photons by observing quantum-enhanced sensitivity with low-visibility quantum interference. This demonstrates that sources producing photons with mixed spectral states can be readily utilised in quantum-metrology systems.

abstract: With a recent rising interest of single photon superradiance due to its potential usefulness for efficient collection of single photon from an atomic ensemble, bright and narrow photon pair source is a key component in realization of quantum communication and quantum computer based on coherent interaction between light and atomic ensemble. We report the superradiant emission of ultra-bright photon pairs with a coincidence counting rate per input power of 64,600 cps/mW via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a thermal vapour cell. The photon-pair generation rate is enhanced by the contribution of two-photon coherence of almost atomic velocity groups in the Doppler-broadened ladder-type atomic system. The quadratic proportionality of the probability of detecting a heralded single photon as a function of the optical depth clarifies that the ultra-brightness results from the superradiance. In addition, a single photon superradiant beating at a high optical depth of the atomic ensemble is observed for the first time.

abstract: On this work, we consider a particle moving in front of a dielectric plate, and study two of the most relevant effects of the vacuum field fluctuations: the dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle's internal degrees of freedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed trajectory. To study the dissipative effects, we calculate the in-out effective action by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of both the plate and the particle. This in-out effective action develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability for the decay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the dissipation is affected by the relative velocity between the particle and the plate and the properties of the microscopic degrees of freedom. In order to study the effects of decoherence over the internal degrees of freedom of the particle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh influence action, by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the plate. We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by two different quantum configurations (of the internal degree of freedom of the particle) to be possible to differentiate from one another. We analyze the way in which the presence of the mirror affects the decoherence, and the possible ways to maximize or reduce its effects.

abstract: Recently, the negatively charged silicon vacancy centre (SiV) in diamond has emerged as a novel promising system for quantum information processing (QIP) due to its superior spectral properties and advantageous electronic structure: The SiV offers an optically accessible {\Lambda}-type level structure with a large orbital level splitting even without the need of an external magnetic field and previous studies determined the ground state coherence time of the centre to be on the order of 35-45ns. While these studies already indicate the feasibility of an ultrafast all-optical coherent control of the SiV, no experimental realization has been presented so far. Here, we report on optical Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference between the ground and the excited state of the SiV using 12 ps long, resonant rotation pulses. Moreover, utilizing a {\Lambda}-scheme, we demonstrate Raman-based coherent Rabi rotations and Ramsey interference within the ground state manifold using a single, 1ps long off-resonant pulse. These measurements prove the accessibility of the complete set of single-qubit operations relying solely on optical fields and pave the way for high-speed QIP applications using SiV centres.

abstract: The concept of quantum correlation matrix for observables leads to the application of the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) also for quantum system in Hilbert space. It is shown that, in the case of a 2x2 spin system where the observables are the Pauli matrices and a polarization vector is acting on the density matrix, meaningful results can be obtained by the PCA in terms of qubit properties. In particular, it is shown that by choosing, for example, the (x,z) spinors, the axes of the principal components (PC) coincide with the circular polarization basis on the Block Sphere.

abstract: The quantum PCP (QPCP) conjecture states that all problems in QMA, the quantum analogue of NP, admit quantum verifiers that only act on a constant number of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open. The above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in the language of multi-prover games is known. In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer QPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a pointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define the Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum verifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical part of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from the quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian problem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP games. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer QPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap is QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of CRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the first equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of quantum multi-prover games.

abstract: Multi-photon entangled states such as `N00N states' have attracted a lot of attention because of their possible application in high-precision phase measurements. So far, N00N states have been generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and by mixing quantum and classical light on a beam splitter. However, single-photon on demand sources promise to be more efficient and scalable than down-conversion sources which are probabilistic in nature. Here, we demonstrate super-resolving phase measurements based on two-photon N00N states generated by a quantum dot single-photon source utilizing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect on a beam splitter. The quantum dot was excited through a two-photon resonant excitation scheme. Using a $\pi$-pulse, this results in the deterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons from both, the biexciton and exciton radiative recombination processes. Launching either type of the photons into both inputs of an interferometer, phase super-resolution, i.e. an interference fringe spacing with doubled rate relative to the single photon rate has been observed for both transitions. Interference visibilities of $V_{N=2,\mathit{XX}}=0.54\pm0.01$ for the biexciton and $V_{N=2,\mathit{X}}=0.46\pm0.02$ for the exciton transition have been obtained, respectively.

Finally, we give the explicit form of the relativistic coherent states for this problem.

We prove that the tomographic condition imposed on the self-dual (Wigner) map is incompatible with the requirement of the invariance under particle permutations, which makes it impossible to project the Wootters-like Wigner function into the space of symmetric measurements. We also provide several \textit{explicit} forms of the self-dual mappings: a) tomographic and b) permutation invariant \ and analyze the symmetric projection in the latter case.

abstract: We propose a set of subradiant states which can be prepared and detected in a one-dimensional optical lattice. We find that the decay rates are highly dependent on the spatial phases we manipulate to imprint on the atomic system, which gives systematic investigations of the subradiance in the fluorescence experiments. The time evolution of these states can have long decay time where hundred milliseconds of lifetime is predicted up to one hundred atoms. They can also show decayed Rabi-like oscillations with a beating frequency determined by the difference of cooperative Lamb shift in the subspace. Experimental requirements are also discussed for practical implementation of the subradiant states. Our proposal provides a novel scheme for quantum storage of photons in arrays of two-level atoms through the preparation and detection of subradiant states, which offer opportunities for quantum information processing in optical lattices.

We derive a family of weighted uncertainty relations to provide an optimal lower bound for all situations and remove the restriction on the quantum state. Generalization to multi-observable cases is also given and an optimal lower bound for the weighted sum of the variances is obtained in general quantum situation.

Under non-negative Schur-concave functions, the vector-type uncertainty relation generates a family of infinitely many detectors to check genuine multipartite entanglement. We also introduce the concept of $k$-separable circles via geometric distance for probability vectors, which include at most $(k-1)$-separable states. The entanglement witness is also generalized to a universal entanglement witness which is able to detect the $k$-separable states more accurately.

abstract: Photonic lattices provide an excellent platform for simulating conventional topological systems, and they can also be explored for the study of novel topological phases. However, a direct measurement of bulk topological invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study topological features of generalized commensurate Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) photonic lattices and construct a topological phase diagram by calculating all bulk Chern numbers, and then explore the bulk-edge correspondence by analyzing the topological edge states and their winding numbers. In contrast to incommensurate AAH models, we find that diagonal and off-diagonal commensurate AAH models are not topologically equivalent. In particular, nontrivial topological phases with large Chern numbers and topological phase transitions are possible. By implementing Thouless pumping of light in photonic lattices, we propose a simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers.

abstract: Based on the formula of shortcuts to adiabaticity, we solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in various nonlinear quantum systems. For a given time-dependent adiabatic Hamiltonian, the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is obtained by solving the equation for the dynamical invariant. We show that the equation is equivalent to the Lax equation in nonlinear integrable systems. This identification allows us to obtain the counterdiabatic term exactly. Multi-soliton potentials obtained from the Korteweg-de Vries equation and a XY spin chain with the use of the Toda equations are studied in detail. The present method also offers a way to obtain isospectral Hamiltonians.

abstract: The design, fabrication, and detailed calibration of essential building blocks towards fully integrated linear-optics quantum computation are discussed. Photonic devices are made from silicon nitride rib waveguides, where measurements on ring resonators show small propagation losses. Directional couplers are designed to be insensitive to fabrication variations. Their offset and coupling lengths are measured, as well as the phase difference between the transmitted and reflected light. With careful calibrations, the insertion loss of the directional couplers is found to be small. Finally, an integrated controlled-NOT circuit is characterized by measuring the transmission through different combinations of inputs and outputs. The gate fidelity for the CNOT operation with this circuit is estimated to be 99.81% after post selection. This high fidelity is due to our robust design, good fabrication reproducibility, and extensive characterizations.

Various methods and ideas to deal with contractions of associative algebras are discussed that account for a large family of examples. As an instance of them, the commutative algebra of functions in phase space, corresponding to classical physical observables, is obtained as a contraction of the Moyal star-product which characterizes the quantum case. Contractions of associative algebras associated to Lie algebras are discussed, in particular the Weyl-Heisenberg and $SU(2)$ groups are considered.

abstract: We show how the use of entanglement can enhance the precision of the detection of the Unruh effect with an accelerated probe. We use the Unruh-DeWitt model of a two-level atom interacting relativistically with a quantum field and treat the atom as an open quantum system to derive the master equation governing its evolution. By means of quantum state discrimination, we detect the accelerated motion of the atom by examining its time evolving state. It turns out that the optimal strategy for the detection of the Unruh effect, to which the accelerated atom is sensitive, involves letting the atom-thermometer equilibrate with the thermal bath. However, introducing initial entanglement between the detector and an external degree of freedom leads to an enhancement of the sensitivity of the detector. Also, the maximum precision is attained within finite time, before equilibration takes place.

abstract: We study the motion of a particle in a particular magnetic field configuration both classically and quantum mechanically. For flux-free radially symmetric magnetic fields defined on circular regions, we establish that particle escape speeds depend, classically, on a gauge-fixed magnetic vector potential, and demonstrate some trajectories associated with this special type of magnetic field. Then we show that some of the geometric features of the classical trajectory (perpendicular exit from the field region, trapped and escape behavior) are reproduced quantum mechanically using a numerical method that extends the norm-preserving Crank-Nicolson method to problems involving magnetic fields. While there are similarities between the classical trajectory and the position expectation value of the quantum mechanical solution, there are also differences, and we demonstrate some of these.

abstract: We demonstrate the suppression of photon shot noise dephasing in a superconducting qubit by eliminating its dispersive coupling to the readout cavity. This is achieved in a tunable coupling qubit, where the qubit frequency and coupling rate can be controlled independently. We observe that the coherence time approaches twice the relaxation time and becomes less sensitive to thermal photon noise when the dispersive coupling rate is tuned from several MHz to 22 kHz. This work provides a promising building block in circuit quantum electrodynamics that can hold high coherence and be integrated into larger systems.

Complex quantum states of propagating optical photons would be an enabling resource for diverse protocols in quantum information science, including for interconnecting quantum nodes in quantum networks. Here, we propose several methods to generate heralded mutipartite entangled atomic and photonic states by using the strong and long-range dissipative couplings between atoms emerging in waveguide QED setups. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates high success probabilities and fidelities are possible exploiting waveguide QED properties.

abstract: We consider two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution, studying its security against general eavesdropping strategies. Assuming the asymptotic limit of many signals exchanged, we prove that two-way Gaussian protocols are immune to coherent attacks. More precisely we show the general superadditivity of the two-way security thresholds, which are proven to be higher than the corresponding one-way counterparts in all cases. We perform the security analysis first reducing the general eavesdropping to a two-mode coherent Gaussian attack, and then showing that the superadditivity is achieved by exploiting the random on/off switching of the two-way quantum communication. This allows the parties to choose the appropriate communication instances to prepare the key, accordingly to the tomography of the quantum channel. The random opening and closing of the circuit represents, in fact, an additional degree of freedom allowing the parties to convert, a posteriori, the two-mode correlations of the eavesdropping into noise. The eavesdropper is assumed to have no access to the on/off switching and, indeed, cannot adapt her attack. We explicitly prove that this mechanism enhances the security performance, no matter if the eavesdropper performs collective or coherent attacks.

abstract: We develop an instantonic calculus to derive an analytical expression for the thermally-assisted tunneling decay rate of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum spin model. The tunneling decay problem can be mapped onto the Kramers escape problem of a classical random dynamical field. This dynamical field is simulated efficiently by Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). We show analytically that the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally-assisted quantum tunneling rate and the escape rate of the QMC process are identical. We relate this effect to the existence of a dominant instantonic tunneling path.cThe instanton trajectory is described by nonlinear dynamical mean-field theory equations for a single site magnetization vector, which we solve exactly. Finally, we derive scaling relations for the "spiky" barrier shape when the spin tunnelling and QMC rates scale polynomially with the number of spins N while a purely classical over-the-barrier activation rate scales exponentially with N.

abstract: We present a resource-performance tradeoff calculation of an all-optical repeater architecture that uses photon sources, linear optics, photon detectors and classical feedforward at each repeater node, but no quantum memories. The secret-key generation rate attainable by any repeaterless quantum key distribution protocol over an optical channel of transmissivity $\eta$ is at most $R_{\rm direct}(\eta) = -\log_2(1-\eta) \approx (1/\ln 2)\eta$ bits per mode, for $\eta \ll 1$. With the device resources (number of photon sources and detectors) held fixed at each repeater node, we show that the key rate achieved by our protocol has the form $R(\eta) = D\eta^s$ bits per mode, where $D$ and $s$ are functions of the aforesaid resource constraint and various losses in the system. Even with lossy sources, inefficient detectors, and coupling and propagation losses in optical fibers and waveguides, we show that it is possible to achieve $s < 1$, and hence outperform the repeaterless rate-loss upper bound $R_{\rm direct}(\eta)$ beyond a certain total range $L$, where $\eta \sim e^{-\alpha L}$ in optical fiber. We also propose a suite of modifications to a recently-proposed all-optical repeater protocol that our protocol builds upon, which lowers the number of photon sources required to create photonic clusters at the repeater nodes so as to outperform the repeaterless bound, by $5$ orders of magnitude, from $\sim 10^{11}$ to $\sim 10^{6}$ photon sources per repeater node. We show that the optimum separation between repeater stations is independent of the total range $L$, and is around $1.5$ km for assumptions we make on various device losses.

abstract: We study the possibility of chaos for the Bohmian dynamics when the wave function is stationary. Examples of stationary wave functions are given for which there is chaos, as demonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial dimensions and for two and three entangled particles in 2 dimensions. Among other things, this illustrates that moving nodes of a wave function are not necessary to have chaos. What is important for the amount of chaos is the overall complexity of the wave function. Some simple measures that partly capture the complexity of the wave function are considered: the participation ratio and different measures of entanglement. We find that these measures often tend to correlate to the amount of chaos. However, the correlation is not perfect, because the measures do not depend on the intrinsic complexity of the states of a given basis.

abstract: We study, in theory and experiment, the quantum properties of correlated light fields measured with click-counting detectors providing incomplete information on the photon statistics. We establish a correlation parameter for the conditional statistics, and we derive the corresponding nonclassicality criteria for detecting conditional quantum correlations. Classical bounds for Pearson's correlation parameter are formulated that allow us, once they are violated, to determine nonclassical correlations via the joint statistics. On the one hand, we demonstrate nonclassical correlations in terms of the joint click statistics of light produced by a parametric down conversion source. On the other hand, we verify quantum correlations of a heralded, split single-photon state via the conditional click statistics together with a generalization to higher-order moments. We discuss the performance of the presented nonclassicality criteria to successfully discern joint and conditional quantum correlations. Remarkably, our results are obtained without making any assumptions on the response function, quantum efficiency, and dark-count rate of the considered photodiodes.

Strong driving close to these resonances leads to nonclassical steady-state Wigner distributions. Experimental realizations of these genuine quantum signatures can be implemented with current technology.

abstract: The possibility of immunized and improving the entanglement of accelerated systems via local filtering is discussed. The maximum bounds of entanglement depend on the dimensions of the accelerated and the filtered subsystems. If the small dimensional subsystem is accelerated and the large dimensional subsystem is filtered, one can get a long-lived entanglement. Moreover, if the larger subsystem is accelerated, then by filtering any subsystem, the upper bounds of entanglement of the filtered state are larger then that for the initial states.For any accelerated subsystem, the entanglement always increases as the filter strength of the large dimensional subsystem increases.

abstract: Quantum information theory determines the maximum rates at which information can be transmitted through physical systems described by quantum mechanics. Here we consider the communication protocol known as quantum reading. Quantum reading is a protocol for retrieving the information stored in a digital memory by using a quantum probe, e.g., shining quantum states of light to read an optical memory. In a variety of situations using a quantum probe enhances the performances of the reading protocol in terms of fidelity, data density and energy dissipation. Here we review and characterize the quantum reading capacity of a memory model, defined as the maximum rate of reliable reading. We show that, like other quantities in quantum information theory, the quantum reading capacity is super-additive. Moreover, we determine conditions under which the use of an entangled ancilla improves the performance of quantum reading.

abstract: We find optimality conditions for testers in discrimination of quantum channels. These conditions are obtained using semidefinite programming and are similar to optimality conditions for POVMs obtained by Holevo for ensembles of quantum states. We get a simple condition for existence of an optimal tester with any given input state with maximal Schmidt rank, in particular with a maximally entangled input state and we show the pitfalls of using input states with not maximal Schmidt rank. In case when maximally entangled state is not the optimal input state an error estimate is obtained. The results for maximally entangled input state are applied to covariant channels, qubit channels, unitary channels and simple projective measurements.

abstract: We discuss a new phase space method for the computation of quantum expectation values in the high frequency regime. Instead of representing a wavefunction by its Wigner function, which typically attains negative values, we define a new phase space density by adding a first-order Hermite spectrogram term as a correction to the Husimi function. The new phase space density yields accurate approximations of the quantum expectation values as well as allows numerical sampling from non-negative densities. We illustrate the new method by numerical experiments in up to $128$ dimensions.

It is shown that rotating effects can modify the cyclotron frequency and breaks the degeneracy of the analogue of the Landau levels.

abstract: Thermal stability of the topological color code in presence of a thermal bath is studied. We study the Lindblad evolution of the observables in the weak coupling limit of the Born-Markov approximation. The auto-correlation functions of the observables are used as a figure of merit for the thermal stability. We show that all of the observables auto-correlation functions decay exponentially in time. By finding a lower bound of the decay rate, which is a constant independent of the system size, we show that the Topological Color Code is unstable against thermal fluctuations from the bath at finite temperature, even though it is stable at T=0 against local quantum perturbations.

abstract: We propose and analyze an all-magnetic scheme to perform a Young's double slit experiment with a micron-sized superconducting sphere of mass $ \gtrsim 10^{13}$ amu. We show that its center of mass could be prepared in a spatial quantum superposition state with an extent of the order of half a micrometer. The scheme is based on magnetically levitating the sphere above a superconducting chip and letting it skate through a static magnetic potential landscape where it interacts for short intervals with quantum circuits. In this way a protocol for fast quantum interferometry is passively implemented. Such a table-top earth-based quantum experiment would operate in a parameter regime where gravitational energy scales become relevant. In particular we show that the faint parameter-free gravitationally-induced decoherence collapse model, proposed by Di\'osi and Penrose, could be unambiguously falsified.

abstract: After a brief introduction to issues that plague the realization of a theory of quantum gravity, I suggest that the main one concerns defining superpositions of causal structures. This leads me to a distinction between time and space, to a further degree than that present in the canonical approach to general relativity. With this distinction, one can make sense of superpositions as interference between alternative paths in the relational configuration space of the entire Universe. But the full use of relationalism brings us to a timeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical approach (which culminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). After a discussion of Parmenides and the Eleatics' rejection of time, I show that there is middle ground between their view of absolute timelessness and a view of physics taking place in timeless configuration space. In this middle ground, even though change does not fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered in a way not permitted by Parmenides. It is recovered through a particular density distribution over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'. Incidentally, this distribution seems to have the potential to dissolve further aspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued to haunt the application of decoherence to Many-Worlds quantum mechanics. I end with a discussion indicating that the conflict between the conclusions of this paper and our view of the continuity of the self may still intuitively bother us. Nonetheless, those conclusions should be no more challenging to our intuition than Derek Parfit's thought experiments on the subject.

abstract: The realization of a network of quantum registers is an outstanding challenge in quantum science and technology. We experimentally investigate a network node that consists of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electronic spin hyperfine-coupled to nearby nuclear spins. We demonstrate individual control and readout of five nuclear spin qubits within one node. We then characterize the storage of quantum superpositions in individual nuclear spins under repeated application of a probabilistic optical inter-node entangling protocol. We find that the storage fidelity is limited by dephasing during the electronic spin reset after failed attempts. By encoding quantum states into a decoherence-protected subspace of two nuclear spins we show that quantum coherence can be maintained for over 1000 repetitions of the remote entangling protocol. These results and insights pave the way towards remote entanglement purification and the realisation of a quantum repeater using NV center quantum network nodes.

We compare our analytical findings with numerical simulations of various many-body quantum systems. Our calculations elucidate various heuristic relations proposed recently in the literature.

abstract: Everetts Relative State Interpretation (aka Many Worlds Interpretation) has gained increasing interest due the progress understanding the role of decoherence. In order to fullfil its promise as an intellectually economic realistic description of the physical world, two postulates are formulated. In short they are 1) the system is described by $\psi(x)$ and its density $\rho(x)=\psi^*(x)\psi(x)$ gives the distribution of the localization of the system with the respect to the variable $x$; 2) an equation of motion for the state $i\hbar \partial_t \psi = H\psi$. The quantum probabilities (Born's rule) is easily derived from the new postulates, as well as other parts of the traditional postulates.

abstract: The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is in important problem in several application domains, including low-power electronics and quantum computing. Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for various metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space required to implement a given function reversibly. However, little effort has been spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular importance in quantum computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to hardware, but also the estimation of resources required to implement a given quantum algorithm. This resource determination is crucial for identifying which algorithms will outperform their classical counterparts. We present a reversible circuit compiler called ReVer, which has been formally verified in F* and compiles circuits that operate correctly with respect to the input program. Our compiler compiles the Revs language to combinational reversible circuits with as few ancillary bits as possible, and provably cleans temporary values.

A 93, 012314(2016)] to give another more concise set of $2n-1$ orthogonal product states in $\mathbb{C}^m\otimes\mathbb{C}^n(4\leq m\leq n)$ which can not be distinguished by local operations and classical communication(LOCC). Then we use the 3 dimension cubes to present some product states which give us an intuitive view how to construct locally indistinguishable product states in tripartite quantum system. At last, we give an explicit construction of locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states for general multipartite system.

abstract: We propose and develop a new quantum algorithm, whereby a quantum system can learn to anneal to a desired ground state. We demonstrate successful learning to produce an entangled state for a two-qubit system, then bootstrap to three-, four-, five- and six-qubits; the amount of additional learning necessary decreases. Because of this decrease we expect the method to be easily generalizeable to many-qubit systems. Because quantum neural networks are robust to noise and decoherence we expect our method to be readily implemented experimentally.

abstract: The practically useful criteria of separable states $\rho=\sum_{k}w_{k}\rho_{k}$ in $d=2\times2$ are discussed. The equality $G({\bf a},{\bf b})= 4[\langle \psi|P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})|\psi\rangle-\langle \psi|P({\bf a})\otimes{\bf 1}|\psi\rangle\langle \psi|{\bf 1}\otimes P({\bf b})|\psi\rangle]=0$ for any two projection operators $P({\bf a})$ and $P({\bf b})$ provides a necessary and sufficient separability criterion in the case of a separable pure state $\rho=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. We propose the separability criteria of mixed states, which are given by ${\rm Tr}\rho\{{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes {\bf b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\}=(1/3)C\cos\varphi$ for two spin $1/2$ systems and $4{\rm Tr}\rho \{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/2)C\cos2\varphi$ for two photon systems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ with fixed $\cos\varphi={\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$. Here $-1\leq C\leq 1$, and the difference in the numerical coefficients $1/2$ and $1/3$ arises from the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse photon. If one instead takes an average over the states in the $d=2$ Hilbert space, the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by $4{\rm Tr}\rho \{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/3)C\cos2\varphi$. Those separability criteria are shown to be very efficient using the existing experimental data of Aspect et al. in 1981 and Sakai et al. in 2006. When the Werner state is applied to two photon systems, it is shown that the Hilbert space average can judge its inseparability but not the geometrical angular average.

Our results show that, in the quasi-classical situation, the original uncertainty relation does not hold when the number of particles in the environment is small. Nonetheless, increasing the environmental degrees of freedom resolves the violation in the region of our investigation.

abstract: Anderson localisation is an important phenomenon arising in many areas of physics, and here we explore it in the context of quantum information devices. Finite dimensional spin chains have been demonstrated to be important devices for quantum information transport, and in particular can be engineered to allow for "perfect state transfer" (PST). Here we present extensive investigations of disordered PST spin chains, demonstrating spatial localisation and transport retardation effects, and relate these effects to conventional Anderson localisation. We provide thresholds for Anderson localisation in these finite quantum information systems for both the spatial and the transport domains. Finally, we consider the effect of disorder on the eigenstate spectrum of our Hamiltonian, where results support our conclusions on the presence of Anderson localisation.

abstract: A stochastic filter uses a series of measurements over time to produce estimates of unknown variables based on a dynamic model. For a quantum system, such an algorithm is provided by a quantum filter, which is also known as a stochastic master equation (SME). For a linear quantum system subject to linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the quantum filter reduces to a quantum Kalman filter. In this article, we introduce a quantum extended Kalman filter (quantum EKF), which applies a commutative approximation and a time-varying linearization to non-commutative quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). We will show that there are conditions under which a filter similar to the classical EKF can be implemented for quantum systems. The boundedness of estimation errors and the filtering problems with `state-dependent' covariances for process and measurement noises are also discussed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the quantum EKF by applying it to systems which involve multiple modes, nonlinear Hamiltonians and simultaneous jump-diffusive measurements.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Quantum Darwinism recognizes the role of the environment as a communication channel: Decoherence can selectively amplify information about the pointer states of a system of interest (preventing access to complementary information about their superpositions) and can make records of this information accessible to many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective, classical reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the amplification of information in realistic spin environments can be quantified by the quantum Chernoff information, which characterizes the distinguishability of partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except for a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires redundant information. Moreover, the Chernoff information captures the rich behavior of amplification in both finite and infinite spin environments, from quadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These results will considerably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using nitrogen vacancies in diamond.

abstract: We study the problem of estimating the Schwarzschild radius of a massive body using Gaussian quantum probe states. Previous calculations assumed that the probe state remained pure after propagating a large distance. In a realistic scenario, there would be inevitable losses. Here we introduce a practical approach to calculate the Quantum Fisher Informations (QFIs) for a quantum probe that has passed through a lossy channel. Whilst for many situations loss means coherent states are optimal, we identify certain situations for which squeezed states have an advantage. We also study the effect of the frequency profile of the wavepacket propagating from Alice to Bob. There exists an optimal operating point for a chosen mode profile. In particular, employing a smooth rectangular frequency profile significantly improves the error bound on the Schwarzschild radius compared to a Gaussian frequency profile.

We show that a subset of joint initial states guarantees completely positive reduced dynamics, if and only if the system privately owns all quantum degrees of freedom and can locally access the classical degrees of freedom, without disturbing all joint initial states in the given subset. Furthermore, we show that the quantum mutual information for such kinds of states must be independent of the quantum degrees of freedom.

abstract: In this paper, we argue that quantum coherence in a bipartite system can be contained either locally or in the correlations between the subsystems. The portion of quantum coherence contained within correlations can be viewed as a kind quantum correlation which we call correlated coherence. We demonstrate that the framework provided by correlated coherence allows us retrieve the same concepts of quantum correlations as defined by the asymmetric and symmetrized versions of quantum discord as well as quantum entanglement, thus providing a unified view of these correlations. We also prove that correlated coherence can be formulated as an entanglement monotone, thus demonstrating that entanglement may be viewed as a specialized form of coherence.

abstract: In Nature Phys. 11, 668 (2015) (Ref. [1]), a composite particle prepared in a pure initial quantum state and propagated in a uniform gravitational field is shown to undergo a decoherence process at a rate determined by the gravitational acceleration. By assuming Einstein's Equivalence Principle to be valid, we demonstrate, first in a Lorentz frame with accelerating detectors, and then directly in the Lab frame with uniform gravity, that the dephasing between the different internal states arise not from gravity but rather from differences in their rest mass, and the mass dependence of the de Broglie wave's dispersion relation. We provide an alternative view to the situation considered by Ref. [1], where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role in the loss of fringe visibility by giving the detector a transverse velocity relative to the particle beam; visibility can be easily recovered by giving the screen an appropriate uniform velocity. We finally propose that dephasing due to gravity may in fact take place for certain modifications to the gravitational potential where the Equivalence Principle is violated.

We also analyze a simple model, computing the transition probabilities in the broken and in the unbroken regime.

abstract: We present a scheme to encode M extra classical bits to a dense-coded pair of photons. By tuning the delay of an entangled pair of photons to one of 2^M time-bins and then applying one of the quantum dense coding protocols, a receiver equipped with a synchronized clock of reference is able to decode M bits (via classical time-bin encoding) + 2 bits (via quantum dense coding). This protocol, yet simple, does not dispense several special features of the used programmable delay apparatus to maintain the coherence of the two-photon state. While this type of time-domain encoding may be thought to be ideally of boundless photonic capacity (by increasing the number of available time-bins), errors due to the environmental noise and the imperfect devices and channel evolve with the number of time-bins.

abstract: High flux of hyperentangled photons entails collecting the two-photon emission over relatively wide extent in frequency and transverse space within which the photon pairs are simultaneously entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a numerical approach to determining the spatial-spectral relative-phase and time-delay maps of hyperentangled photons all over the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) emission cone. We consider the hyperentangled-photons produced by superimposing noncollinear SPDC emissions of two crossed and coherently-pumped nonlinear crystals. We adopt a vectorial representation for all parameters of concern. This enables us to study special settings such as the self-compensation via oblique pump incidence. While rigorous quantum treatment of SPDC emission requires Gaussian state representation, in low-gain regime (like the case of the study), it is well approximated to the first order to superposition of vacuum and two-photon states. The relative phase and time-delay maps are then calculated between the two-photon wavepackets created along symmetrical locations of the crystals. Assuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations like energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one of the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of longitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon emission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the perfect phase-matching direction. While prior works often adopt first-order approximation, it is shown that the relative-phase map is a very well approximated to a quadratic function in the polar angle of the two-photon emission while negligibly varying with the azimuthal angle.

abstract: In this paper, we numerically demonstrate a new extraction scheme for generating ultra-fast physically random sequence of bits. For this purpose, we utilize a dual-channel optical chaos source with suppressed time delayed (TD) signature in both the intensity and the phase of its two channels. The proposed technique uses M 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to compare the level of the chaotic intensity signal at time t with its levels after incommensurable delay-interval Tm, where m = {1,2,...,M}. The binary output of each 1-bit ADC is then sampled by a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop. The clock sequence applied to the flip-flops is relatively delayed such that the rising edge of the clock triggering the m flip-flop precedes the rising edge of the clock of a subsequent m+1 flip-flop by a fixed period. The outputs of all flip-flops are then combined by means of a parity-check logic. Numerical simulations are carried out using values of parameters at which TD signature is suppressed for chosen values of setup parameters. The 15 statistical tests in Special Publication 800-22 from NIST are applied to the generated random bits in order to examine the randomness quality of these bits for different values of M. The results show that all tests are passed from M = 1 to M = 39 at sampling rate up to 34.5 GHz which indicates that the maximum generation rate of random bits is 2.691 Tb/sec using a chaotic source of single VCSEL and without employing any pre-processing techniques.

abstract: An autonomous quantum thermal machine comprising a trapped atom or ion placed inside an optical cavity is proposed and analysed. Such a machine can operate as a heat engine whose working medium is the quantised atomic motion, or as an absorption refrigerator which cools without any work input. Focusing on the refrigerator mode, we predict that it is possible with state-of-the-art technology to cool a trapped ion almost to its motional ground state using a thermal light source such as sunlight. We nonetheless find that a laser or similar reference system is necessary to stabilise the cavity frequencies. Furthermore, we establish a direct and heretofore unacknowledged connection between the abstract theory of quantum absorption refrigerators and practical sideband cooling techniques. We also highlight and clarify some assumptions underlying several recent theoretical studies on self-contained quantum engines and refrigerators. Our work indicates that cavity quantum electrodynamics is a promising and versatile experimental platform for the study of autonomous thermal machines in the quantum domain.

abstract: Quantum communication has historically been at the forefront of advancements, from fundamental tests of quantum physics to utilizing the quantum-mechanical properties of physical systems for practical applications. In the field of communication complexity, quantum communication allows the advantage of an exponential reduction in the information transmitted over classical communication to accomplish distributed computational tasks. However, to date, demonstrating this advantage in a practical setting continues to be a central challenge. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting protocol that for the first time surpasses the ultimate classical limit to transmitted information. Ultra-low noise superconducting single-photon detectors and a stable fibre-based Sagnac interferometer are used to implement a quantum fingerprinting system that is capable of transmitting less information than the classical proven lower bound over 20 km standard telecom fibre for input sizes of up to two Gbits. The results pave the way for experimentally exploring the advanced features of quantum communication and open a new window of opportunity for research in communication complexity and testing the foundations of physics.

abstract: We understand emergent quantum mechanics in the sense that quantum mechanics describes processes of physical emergence relating an assumed sub-quantum physics to macroscopic boundary conditions. The latter can be shown to entail top-down causation, in addition to usual bottom-up scenarios. With this example it is demonstrated that definitions of "realism" in the literature are simply too restrictive. A prevailing manner to define realism in quantum mechanics is in terms of pre-determination independent of the measurement. With our counter-example, which actually is ubiquitous in emergent, or self-organizing, systems, we argue for realism without pre-determination. We refer to earlier results of our group showing how the guiding equation of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation can be derived from a theory with classical ingredients only. Essentially, this corresponds to a "quantum mechanics without wave functions" in ordinary 3-space, albeit with nonlocal correlations. This, then, leads to the central question of how to deal with the nonlocality problem in a relativistic setting. We here show that a basic argument discussing the allegedly paradox time ordering of events in EPR-type two-particle experiments falls short of taking into account the contextuality of the experimental setup. Consequently, we then discuss under which circumstances (i.e. physical premises) superluminal information transfer (but not signaling) may be compatible with a Lorentz-invariant theory. Finally, we argue that the impossibility of superluminal signaling - despite the presence of superluminal information transfer - is not the result of some sort of conspiracy (a la "Nature likes to hide"), but the consequence of the impossibility to exactly reproduce in repeated experimental runs a state's preparation, or of the no-cloning theorem, respectively.

abstract: Measuring the power spectral density of a stochastic process, such as a stochastic force or magnetic field, is a fundamental task in many sensing applications. Quantum noise is becoming a major limiting factor to such a task in future technology, especially in optomechanics for temperature, stochastic gravitational wave, and decoherence measurements. Motivated by this concern, here we prove a measurement-independent quantum limit to the accuracy of estimating the spectrum parameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to a quantum dynamical system. We demonstrate our results by analyzing the data from a continuous optical phase estimation experiment and showing that the experimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit. We further propose a spectral photon counting method that can attain quantum-optimal performance for weak modulation and a coherent-state input, with an error scaling superior to that of homodyne detection at low signal-to-noise ratios.

abstract: We introduce a 3-parameter class of maps acting on a bipartite system that are a natural generalisation of the depolarizing channel (and include it as a special case). Then, we find the exact regions of the parameter space that alternatively determine a positive, completely positive, entanglement-breaking or entanglement-annihilating map. This model displays a much richer behaviour than the one shown by a simple depolarizing channel, yet it stays exactly solvable. As an example of this richness, PPT but not entanglement-breaking maps are found. A simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is provided. Then, the study of the entanglement-annihilating property is fully addressed. Finally, we apply our results to solve the problem of the entanglement annihilation caused in a bipartite system by a tensor product of local depolarizing channels. In this context, a conjecture recently posed in the literature is proven, and many related open questions are answered. To arrive at this result we furthermore show how the Hadamard product between quantum states can be implemented via local operations.

abstract: We introduce a new verification protocol for measurement-only blind quantum computation where the client can only perform single-qubit measurements and the server has sufficient ability to prepare a multi-qubit entangled states. Previous such protocols were limited by strong assumptions about the client's quantum devices. We remove these assumptions by performing self-testing procedure to certify the initial entangled state prepared by the server as well as the operation of the client's quantum devices. In the case of an honest server and client's devices, the protocol produces the correct outcome of the quantum computation. Given a cheating server or malicious quantum devices, our protocol bounds the probability of the client accepting an incorrect outcome while introducing only modest overhead in terms of the number of copies of the initial state needed that scales as $O(n^4\log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the initial universal resource.

These sets have proved useful in different areas of computer science, and here their properties give an optimal construction for succinct quantum presentation of elements of any finite abelian group, which can be used in various computational and cryptographic scenarios. The known quantum fingerprinting schemas turn out to be the special cases of the proposed quantum hashing for the corresponding abelian group.

abstract: The staggered quantum walk model allows to establish an unprecedented connection between discrete-time quantum walks and graph theory. We call attention to the fact that a large subclass of the coined model is included in Szegedy's model, which in its turn is entirely included in the staggered model. In order to compare those three quantum walk models, we put them in the staggered formalism and we show that the Szegedy and coined models are defined on a special subclass of graphs. This inclusion scheme is also true when the searching framework is added. We use graph theory to characterize which staggered quantum walks can be reduced to the Szegedy or coined quantum walk model. We analyze a staggered-based search that cannot be included in Szegedy's model and we show numerically that this search is more efficient than a random-walk-based search.

abstract: Ii is proved that in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (without spin) the transition probability may be described in terms of particle paths, every path having a (positive) probability. This leads to a stochastic hidden variables theory providing an intuitive picture of particle motion. The change of velocity at every time has a probability that depends on the potential over a large region, at a difference with the local action of classical dynamics. Thus the hidden variables theory is non-local. The theory solves some of the difficulties of Bohm's.

abstract: We show that one can determine both parameters of a displacement acting on an oscillator with an accuracy which scales inversely with the square root of the number of photons in the oscillator. Our results are obtained by using a grid state as a sensor state for detecting small changes in position and momentum (displacements). Grid states were first proposed in [1] for encoding a qubit into an oscillator: an efficient preparation protocol of such states, using a coupling to a qubit, was developed in [2]. We compare the performance of the grid state with the quantum compass or cat code state and place our results in the context of the two-parameter quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the variances of the displacement parameters. We show that the accessible information about the displacement for a grid state increases with the number of photons in the state when we measure and prepare the state using the phase estimation protocol in [2]. This is in contrast with the accessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is always upper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of photons.

abstract: We extend the representation of quantum algorithms to the preparation of the problem setting. An initial measurement serves to set the problem, the final one as usual to read the solution. This extension highlights the possibility of ascribing the selection of a variable fraction R of the information that specifies the random outcome of the initial measurement to the final measurement. The input state of the quantum algorithm to the problem solver (Alice), of maximal ignorance of the problem setting that to her should be hidden, would consequently be projected on a state of lower entropy where she knows in advance an R-th part of the setting (i. e. of the information that specifies it). Given the appropriate value of R, the quantum algorithm turns out to be a sum over classical histories in each of which Alice knows in advance one of the possible R-th parts of the problem setting and performs the Q(R) computations (oracle queries) still needed to find the solution. Grover's search problem can be solved with any value of R from 0 to about 1/2, when the solution algorithm becomes the optimal Grover algorithm. In all the optimal quantum algorithms examined, R is close to 1/2 and Q(1/2) yields the order of magnitude of the number of queries. If this held in general, as it seems to be plausible, given any oracle problem we would know the order of magnitude of the number of queries needed for its optimal quantum solution.

We investigate different variations of the problem: uninformed users, informed receiver, informed sender, and feedback assistance. We derive single-letter formulas for all corresponding channel capacities. Our proofs are based on one-shot decoupling bounds and properties of smooth entropies.

abstract: Surface and color codes are two forms of topological quantum error correction in two spatial dimensions with complementary properties. Surface codes have lower-depth error detection circuits and well-developed decoders to interpret and correct errors, while color codes have transversal Clifford gates and better code efficiency in the number of physical qubits needed to achieve a given code distance. A formal equivalence exists between color codes and folded surface codes, but it does not guarantee the transferability of any of these favorable properties. However, the equivalence does imply the existence of constant-depth circuit implementations of logical Clifford gates on folded surface codes. We achieve and improve this result by constructing two families of folded surface codes with transversal Clifford gates. This construction is presented generally for qudits of any dimension.

abstract: Given a shared EPR pair, two cooperative parties can obtain one bit of shared secret key by separately measuring the pair along the same basis. Apparently, the Holevo bound suggests that they cannot obtain more than one secret bit per shared EPR pair. Here we show that they can do so by independently putting each of their EPR pairs in a Hilbert subspace which is unknown to the eavesdropper. We also prove the unconditional security of a practical prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution scheme based on this principle and derive its key rate in the one-way communication setting.

abstract: We study the role of quantum entanglement (particle entanglement and mode entanglement) in optical phase estimation by employing the first and second quantization formalisms of quantum mechanics. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) is expressed as a function of the first and second order optical coherence functions. The resulting form of the QFI elucidates the deriving metrological resources for quantum phase estimation: field intensity and photon detection correlations. In addition, our analysis confirms that mode entanglement is not required for quantum-enhanced interferometry, whereas particle entanglement is a necessary requirement.

abstract: We review recent work that employs the framework of logical inference to establish a bridge between data gathered through experiments and their objective description in terms of human-made concepts. It is shown that logical inference applied to experiments for which the observed events are independent and for which the frequency distribution of these events is robust with respect to small changes of the conditions under which experiments are carried out yields, without introducing any concept of quantum theory, the quantum theoretical description in terms of the Schr\"odinger or the Pauli equation, the Stern-Gerlach or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. The extraordinary descriptive power of quantum theory then follows from the fact that it is plausible reasoning, that is common sense, applied to reproducible and robust experimental data.

abstract: We prove an equivalence transformation between the correlation measure functions of the causally-unbiased quantum gravity space and the causally-biased standard space. The theory of quantum gravity fuses the dynamic (nonfixed) causal structure of general relativity and the quantum uncertainty of quantum mechanics. In a quantum gravity space, the events are causally nonseparable and all time bias vanishes, which makes it no possible to use the standard causally-biased entropy and the correlation measure functions. Since a corrected causally-unbiased entropy function leads to an undefined, obscure mathematical structure, in our approach the correction is made in the data representation of the causally-unbiased space. We prove that the standard causally-biased entropy function with a data correction can be used to identify correlations in dynamic causal structures. As a corollary, all mathematical properties of the causally-biased correlation measure functions are preserved in the causally-unbiased space. The equivalence transformation allows us to measure correlations in a quantum gravity space with the stable, well-defined mathematical background and apparatus of the causally-biased functions of quantum Shannon theory.

abstract: In the standard framework of thermodynamics the work produced or consumed in a process is a random variable whose average value is bounded by the change in the free energy of the system. This work is calculated without regard for the size of its fluctuations. We find that in some processes, such as reversible cooling, the fluctuations of the work can diverge. Small or fragile thermal machines may be unable to cope with large fluctuations. Hence, with the present focus on nano- scale thermodynamics, we analyse how thermodynamic efficiency rates are modified when the size of the fluctuations around the average is restricted. We quantify the work content and work of formation of any state when the work fluctuations are bounded by a given amount c. By varying c we interpolate between the standard free energy c = infinity and the min-free energy c = 0, defined in the context of single-shot thermodynamics. We derive fundamental relations between average work and its fluctuations, and explore the emergence of irreversibility and partial order on state transformations when bounding fluctuations. We also study the efficiency a single qubit thermal engine model with constrained fluctuations, and derive the corrections to the Carnot efficiency.

The first Hamiltonian pertains to a fully-engineered chain and the second to a chain with modified boundary couplings. The task is to find which Hamiltonian is the most robust to given levels of disorder and irrespective of the input state. In this respect, it is shown that the performance of the two protocols are approximately equivalent.

abstract: We show that the stationary decoherence rate of an open quantum system can be decomposed as a sum of local and nonlocal contributions, respectively related to the strength of the coupling between system and environment, and to the quality of the information about the system leaking into the environment. Both terms arise naturally in the framework of the influence functional, with the nonlocal term arising from the coupling between the backward and forward histories describing the open quantum system time evolution. While the local contribution always yields a positive decoherence rate, the nonlocal one may lead to recoherence when only partial information about the system is obtained from the disturbed environment. We illustrate these concepts in the framework of interferometry with trapped atoms, by analyzing the effect of spontaneous emission on the coherence of the center-of-mass.

We show that in such a case the conditional wave function of the system follows a dynamics which, under reasonable assumptions, corresponds to that of the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) collapse model. As a consequence, Bohmian trajectories evolve classically. Our analysis also shows how the GRW (istantaneous) collapse process can be derived by an underlying continuous interaction of a quantum system with an external agent, thus throwing a light on how collapses can emerge from a deeper level theory.

abstract: Causal structures play an important role in the foundations of quantum mechanics because of Bell's theorem, which states that particular observed correlations could not have been generated by classical means within a particular causal structure. Later it was realised that certifying that correlations are non-classical is also of practical importance for device-independent tasks such as key distribution and randomness expansion. While in the simplest causal structures, the problem of certifying non-classicality is well-understood, in more complicated cases it is not. Here we consider the question of whether the joint entropies of the observed random variables can lead to useful certificates of non-classicality. We show that for a family of causal structures that include the usual bipartite Bell structure they do not. For these, no function of the entropies of the observed variables gives such a certificate, in spite of the existence of non-classical correlations.

abstract: We provide an analytical investigation of the pairwise entanglement dynamics for a system, consisting an arbitrary number of qubits dissipating into a common and non-Markovian environment for both weak and strong coupling regimes. In the latter case, a revival of pairwise entanglement due to the memory depth of the environment is observed. The leakage of photons into a continuum state is assumed to be the source of dissipation. We show that for an initially Werner state, the environment washes out the pairwise entanglement, but a series of non-selective measurements can protect the relevant entanglement. On the other hand, by limiting the number of qubits initially in the superposition of single excitation, a stationary entanglement can be created between qubits initially in the excited and ground states. Finally, we determine the stationary distribution of the entanglement versus the total number of qubits in the system.

abstract: The time evolution of quantum many-body systems is one of the least understood frontiers of physics. The most curious feature of such dynamics is, generically, the growth of quantum entanglement with time to an amount proportional to the system size (volume law) even when the interactions are local. This phenomenon, unobserved to date, has great ramifications for fundamental issues such as thermalisation and black-hole formation, while its optimisation clearly has an impact on technology (e.g., for on-chip quantum networking). Here we use an integrated photonic chip to simulate the dynamics of a spin chain, a canonical many-body system. A digital approach is used to engineer the evolution so as to maximise the generation of entanglement. The resulting volume law growth of entanglement is certified by constructing a second chip, which simultaneously measures the entanglement between multiple distant pairs of simulated spins. This is the first experimental verification of the volume law and opens up the use of photonic circuits as a unique tool for the optimisation of quantum devices.

abstract: Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance make it possible to perform quantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of realistic devices. An important question is to find the noise rate at which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed. By concatenating the 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of fault-tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal. Importantly, the CNOT gate remains transversal in both codes, and as such has increased error protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates. We show that while the level-1 pseudo-threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by the logical Hadamard, the error suppression of the logical CNOT gates allows for the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher levels. We establish a lower bound of $1.28~\times~10^{-3}$ for the asymptotic threshold of this code which is competitive with known concatenated models and does not rely on ancillary magic state preparation for universal computation.

abstract: We introduce and experimentally characterize a general purpose device for signal processing in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. The device is a broadband two-port microwave circuit element with three modes of operation: it can transmit, reflect, or invert incident signals between 4 and 8 GHz. This property makes it a versatile tool for lossless signal processing at cryogenic temperatures. In particular, rapid switching (less than or equal to 15 ns) between these operation modes enables several multiplexing readout protocols for superconducting qubits. We report the device's performance in a two-channel code domain multiplexing demonstration. The multiplexed data are recovered with fast readout times (up to 400 ns) and infidelities less than 0.01 for probe powers greater than 7 fW, in agreement with the expectation for binary signaling with Gaussian noise.

Two mechanical resonators are efficiently driven in a stationary entangled EPR state, also beyond the resolved sideband regime, when the spectral bandwidth of the reservoir and the fields frequencies are appropriately selected. The protocol can be extended to the preparation of many entangled pairs of resonators which interact with the same light field, in a situation in which the optomechanical system realizes a star-like harmonic network.

abstract: We provide an evidence for the validity of strong monogamy inequality of multi-party quantum entanglement using square of convex-roof extended negativity(SCREN). We first consider a large class of multi-qudit mixed state that are in a partially coherent superposition of a generalized W-class state and the vacuum, and provide some useful properties about this class of states. We show that monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement in terms of SCREN holds for this class of states. We further show that SCREN strong monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement also holds for this class of states. Thus SCREN is a good alternative to characterize the monogamous and strongly monogamous properties of multi-qudit entanglement.

abstract: We provide generalized entanglement constraints in multi-qubit systems in terms of Tsallis entropy. Using quantum Tsallis entropy of order $q$, we first provide a generalized monogamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement for $q=2$ or $3$. This generalization encapsulates multi-qubit CKW-type inequality as a special case. We further provide a generalized polygamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement in terms of Tsallis-$q$ entropy for $1 \leq q \leq2$ or $3 \leq q \leq 4$, which also contains the multi-qubit polygamy inequality as a special case.

abstract: Tailoring the interactions between quantum emitters and single photons constitutes one of the cornerstones of quantum optics. Coupling a quantum emitter to the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) provides a unique platform for tuning these interactions. In particular, the crossover from propagating fields $E(x) \propto e^{\pm ik_x x}$ outside the bandgap to localized fields $E(x) \propto e^{-\kappa_x |x|}$ within the bandgap should be accompanied by a transition from largely dissipative atom-atom interactions to a regime where dispersive atom-atom interactions are dominant. Here, we experimentally observe this transition for the first time by shifting the band edge frequency of the PCW relative to the $\rm D_1$ line of atomic cesium for $\bar{N}=3.0\pm 0.5$ atoms trapped along the PCW. Our results are the initial demonstration of this new paradigm for coherent atom-atom interactions with low dissipation into the guided mode.

abstract: We address the fundamental interplay between indistinguishability and interactions when discreteness effects are neglected in systems with strictly fixed number of particles. For this end we supplement cluster expansions (many-body canonical techniques where quantum statistics is treated exactly) with short-time/large volume dynamical information where interparticle forces are described non-perturbatively. This approach, specially suitable for the few-body case where it overcomes the inappropriate use of virial expansions, can be consistently combined with scaling considerations, minimal ground-state information and strong coupling expansions in such a way that a single interaction event provides most of the thermodynamic and spectral properties of 1D systems with short range interactions. Our analytical results, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, show a form of universal integrability of interaction effects for arbitrary confinements.

abstract: We investigate the action of local and global noise on monogamy of quantum correlations, when monogamy scores are considered as observables, and three-qubit systems are subjected to global noise and various local noisy channels, namely, amplitude-damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels. We show that the dynamics of monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and quantum discord, in the case of generalized W states, as inputs to the noisy channels, can exhibit non-monotonic dynamics with respect to increasing noise parameter, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay of monogamy scores when generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are exposed to noise. We quantify the persistence of monogamy against noise via a characteristic value of the noise parameter, and show that depolarizing noise destroys monogamy of quantum correlation faster compared to other noisy channels. We demonstrate that the negativity monogamy score is more robust than the quantum discord monogamy score, when the noise is of the phase-damping type. We also investigate the variation of monogamy with increasing noise for arbitrary three-qubit pure states as inputs. Finally, depending on these results, we propose a two-step protocol, which can conclusively identify the type of noise applied to the quantum system, by using generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and generalized W states as resource states.

abstract: We propose a novel approach for solving the scattering of light onto a two-level atom coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We first express the physical quantity of interest in terms of Feynman diagrams and treat the atom as a non-saturable linear beamsplitter. By using the atomic response to our advantage, a relevant substitution is then made that captures the nonlinearity of the atom, and the final result is obtained in terms of simple integrals over the initial incoming wavepackets. The procedure is not limited to post-scattering quantities and allows for instance to derive the atomic excitation during the scattering event.

abstract: We provide a rigorous treatment of the entanglement properties of two-mode Gaussian states in atmospheric channels by deriving and analysing the input-output relations for the corresponding entanglement test. A key feature of such turbulent channels is a non-trivial dependence of the transmitted continuous-variable entanglement on coherent displacements of the quantum state of the input field. Remarkably, this allows one to optimize the entanglement certification by modifying local coherent amplitudes using a finite, but optimal amount of squeezing. In addition, we propose a protocol which, in principle, renders it possible to transfer the Gaussian entanglement through any turbulent channel over arbitrary distances. Therefore, our approach provides the theoretical foundation for advanced applications of Gaussian entanglement in free-space quantum communication.

abstract: Since the first suggestion of the Jarzynski equality many derivations of this equality have been presented in both, the classical and the quantum context. While the approaches and settings greatly differ from one to another, they all appear to rely on the initial state being a thermal Gibbs state. Here, we present an investigation of work distributions in driven isolated quantum systems, starting off from pure states that are close to energy eigenstates of the initial Hamiltonian. We find that, for the nonintegrable system in quest, the Jarzynski equality is fulfilled to good accuracy.

abstract: What defines an emergent quantum mechanics (EmQM)? Can new insight be advanced into the nature of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between quantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity, or emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified, relational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics: quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a common foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successful inter-theory unification.

abstract: We demonstrate a simple and robust geometry for optical trapping in vacuum of a single nanoparticle based on a parabolic mirror and the optical gradient force, and we demonstrate rapid parametric feedback cooling of all three motional degrees of freedom from room temperature to a few mK. A single laser at 1550nm, and a single photodiode, are used for trapping, position detection, and cooling for all three dimensions. Particles with diameters from 26nm to 160nm are trapped without feedback to 10$^{-5}$mbar and with feedback engaged the pressure is reduced to 10$^{-6}$mbar. Modifications to the harmonic motion in the presence of noise and feedback are studied, and an experimental mechanical quality factor $>4\times 10^7$ is estimated.

abstract: We extend the Krylov subspace based time dependent numerical simulation technique for a qubit interacting with photons in a waveguide to the multiple qubit case. We analyze photon scattering from two qubits analytically and derive expressions for the bound states in the continuum (BIC). We show how the BIC can be excited. We use the BIC in a recent Pauli Z gate proposal involving decoherence free subspaces and obtain the gate fidelity as a function of the gate parameters. The techniques presented in the paper are useful for investigating the time evolution of quantum gates and other many-body systems with multiple quenches in the Hamiltonian.

abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) generates a secret key among two parties in a provably secure way without making assumptions about the internal working of the devices used in the protocol. The main challenge for a DIQKD physical implementation is that the data observed among the two parties must violate a Bell inequality without fair-sampling, since otherwise the observed correlations can be faked with classical resources and security can no longer be guaranteed. In spite of the advances recently made to achieve higher detection efficiencies in Bell experiments, DIQKD remains experimentally diffi?cult at long distances due to the exponential increase of loss in the channel separating the two parties. Here we describe and analyze plausible solutions to overcome the crucial problem of channel loss in the frame of DIQKD physical implementations.

comments: 13 pages

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.02940
abstract: We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in $\sqrt{N \beta/{\cal Z}}$ and polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, ${\cal Z}$ is the partition function, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and quadratically improves the dependence on $\beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For a sparse stochastic matrix $P$, it runs in time almost linear in $1/(\epsilon \Delta^{3/2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation and $\Delta$ is a parameter determined by $P$, and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\Delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: In multiparty quantum systems, the monogamy inequality proposes an upper bound on the distribution of bipartite quantum correlation between a single party and each of the remaining parties in the system, in terms of the amount of quantum correlation shared by that party with the rest of the system taken as a whole. However, it is well-known that not all quantum correlation measures universally satisfy the monogamy inequality. In this work, we aim at determining the non-trivial value by which the monogamy inequality can be violated by a quantum correlation measure. Using an information-theoretic complementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum correlation in any given multiparty state, we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the negative monogamy score for the quantum correlation measure. In particular, for the three-qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von Neumann entropy of the single qubit reduced density matrix. We analytically examine the tightness of the derived lower bound for certain $n$-qubit quantum states. Further, we report numerical results of the same for monogamy violating correlation measures using Haar uniformly generated three-qubit states.

abstract: Using a polaron master equation approach we investigate the resonance fluorescence spectra from coherently driven quantum dots (QDs) coupled to an acoustic phonon bath and a photonic crystal waveguide with a rich local density of photon states (LDOS). Resonance fluorescence spectra from QDs in semiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures of electron-phonon interactions, but when coupled to a structured photonic reservoir, the QD emission properties are also determined by the frequency dependence of the LDOS of the photon reservoir. Here, we investigate the simultaneous role of coupled photon and phonon baths on the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a strongly driven QD. As an example structured photonic reservoir, we first study a photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguide, and find that photons and phonons have counter-interacting effects near the upper mode-edge of the coupled-cavity waveguide, thus establishing the importance of their separate roles in determining the emission spectra. The general theory is developed for arbitrary photonic reservoirs and is further applied to determine resonance the fluorescence spectra from a realistic, disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide showing important photon-phonon interaction effects that are directly relevant to emerging experiments and theoretical proposals.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.02992
abstract: Quasi-Exactly Solvable Schr\"odinger Equations occupy an intermediate place between exactly-solvable (e.g. the harmonic oscillator and Coulomb problems etc) and non-solvable ones. Their major property is an explicit knowledge of several eigenstates while the remaining ones are unknown. Many of these problems are of the anharmonic oscillator type with a special type of anharmonicity. The Hamiltonians of quasi-exactly-solvable problems are characterized by the existence of a hidden algebraic structure but do not have any hidden symmetry properties. In particular, all known one-dimensional (quasi)-exactly-solvable problems possess a hidden $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\bf{R})-$ Lie algebra. They are equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\bf{R})$ Euler-Arnold quantum top in a constant magnetic field. Quasi-Exactly Solvable problems are highly non-trivial, they shed light on delicate analytic properties of the Schr\"odinger Equations in coupling constant. The Lie-algebraic formalism allows us to make a link between the Schr\"odinger Equations and finite-difference equations on uniform and/or exponential lattices, it implies that the spectra is preserved. This link takes the form of quantum canonical transformation. The corresponding isospectral spectral problems for finite-difference operators are described. The underlying Fock space formalism giving rise to this correspondence is uncovered. For a quite general class of perturbations of unperturbed problems with the hidden Lie algebra property we can construct an algebraic perturbation theory, where the wavefunction corrections are of polynomial nature, thus, can be found by algebraic means.

abstract: Photonic crystals provide an extremely powerful toolset for manipulation of optical dispersion and density of states, and have thus been employed for applications from photon generation to quantum sensing with NVs and atoms. The unique control afforded by these media make them a beautiful, if unexplored, playground for strong coupling quantum electrodynamics, where a single, highly nonlinear emitter hybridizes with the band structure of the crystal. In this work we demonstrate that such hybridization can create localized cavity modes that live within the photonic band-gap, whose localization and spectral properties we explore in detail. We then demonstrate that the coloured vacuum of the photonic crystal can be employed for efficient dissipative state preparation. This work opens exciting prospects for engineering long-range spin models in the circuit QED architecture, as well as new opportunities for dissipative quantum state engineering.

abstract: The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics is a realistic interpretation of quantum theory. It shares the same ontology of classical mechanics: particles following continuous trajectories in space through time. For this ontological continuity, it seems to be a good candidate for recovering the classical limit of quantum theory. Indeed, in a Bohmian framework, the issue of the classical limit reduces to showing how classical trajectories can emerge from Bohmian ones, under specific classicality assumptions. In this paper, we shall focus on a technical problem that arises from the dynamics of a Bohmian system in bounded regions; and we suggest that a possible solution is supplied by the action of environmental decoherence. However, we shall show that, in order to implement decoherence in a Bohmian framework, a stronger condition is required (disjointness of supports) rather than the usual one (orthogonality of states).

abstract: Physical vacuum is a special superfluid medium populated by enormous amount of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. Its motion is described by the modified Navier-Stokes equation: (a)~the pressure gradient divided by the mass density is replaced by the gradient from the quantum potential; (b)~time-averaged the viscosity vanishes, but its variance is not zero. Vortex structures arising in this medium show infinitely long lifetime owing to zero average viscosity. The nonzero variance is conditioned by exchanging the vortex energy with zero-point vacuum fluctuations. The vortex has a non-zero core where the orbital speed vanishes. The speed reaches a maximal value on the core wall and further it decreases monotonically. The vortex trembles around some average value and possesses by infinite life time. The vortex ball resulting from topological transformation of the vortex ring is considered as a model of a particle with spin. Anomalous magnetic moment of electron is computed.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of an atom with a magnetic quadrupole moment that interacts with an external field subject to a harmonic and a linear confining potentials is investigated. It is shown that the interaction between the magnetic quadrupole moment and an electric field gives rise to an analogue of the Coulomb potential and, by confining this atom to a harmonic and a linear confining potentials, a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of the angular frequency on the quantum numbers of the system is obtained. In particular, it is shown that the possible values of the angular frequency associated with the ground state of the system are determined by a third-degree algebraic equation.

abstract: We present a method to optimize qubit control parameters during error detection which is compatible with large-scale qubit arrays. We demonstrate our method to optimize single or two-qubit gates in parallel on a nine-qubit system. Additionally, we show how parameter drift can be compensated for during computation by inserting a frequency drift and using our method to remove it. We remove both drift on a single qubit and independent drifts on all qubits simultaneously. We believe this method will be useful in keeping error rates low on all physical qubits throughout the course of a computation. Our method is O(1) scalable to systems of arbitrary size, providing a path towards controlling the large numbers of qubits needed for a fault-tolerant quantum computer

abstract: We find a sufficient condition to imprint the single-mode bosonic phase-space nonclassicality onto a bipartite state as modal entanglement and vice versa using an arbitrary beam splitter. Surprisingly, the entanglement produced or detected in this way depends only on the nonclassicality of the marginal input or output states, regardless of their purity and separability. In this way, our result provides sufficient condition for generating entangled states of arbitrary high temperature and arbitrary large number of particles. We also study the evolution of the entanglement within a lossy Mach-Zehnder interferometer and show that unless both modes are totally lost, the entanglement does not diminish.

abstract: Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware. The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than can be solved directly on current hardware.

abstract: This paper presents formulae for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement generated from $N$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs) interconnected in a linear coherent feedback (CFB) chain in the idealized lossless scenario and infinite bandwidth limit. The lossless scenario sets the ultimate EPR entanglement (two-mode squeezing) that can be achieved by this linear chain of NOPAs while the infinite bandwidth limit simplifies the analysis but gives an accurate approximation to the EPR entanglement at low frequencies of interest. Two adjustable phase shifts are placed at the outputs of the system to achieve the best EPR entanglement by selecting appropriate quadratures of the output fields.

abstract: The role of the side channels in the continuous-variable quantum key distribution is studied. It is shown how the information leakage through a side channel from the trusted sender station increases the vulnerability of the protocols to the eavesdropping in the main quantum communication channel. Moreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted receiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum channel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage on the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the side-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light on the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation on the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case of the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side channel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving side, the method of optimal monitoring of the residual noise from the side-channel noise infusion is suggested and shown to be able to completely eliminate the presence of the noisy side channel. We therefore prove that the side-channel effects can be completely removed using feasible operations if the trusted parties access the respective parts of the side channels.

abstract: We construct an amplifier that interpolates between a nondeterministic, immaculate linear amplifier and a deterministic, ideal linear amplifier and beyond to nonideal linear amplifiers. The construction involves cascading an immaculate linear amplifier that has amplitude gain $g_1$ with a (possibly) nonideal linear amplifier that has gain $g_2$. With respect to normally ordered moments, the device has output noise $\mu^2(G^2-1)$ where $G=g_1 g_2$ is the overall amplitude gain and $\mu^2$ is a noise parameter. When $\mu^2\ge1$, our devices realize ideal ($\mu^2=1$) and nonideal ($\mu^2>1$) linear amplifiers. When $0\le\mu^2<1$, these devices work effectively only over a restricted region of phase space and with some subunity success probability $p_{\checkmark}$. We investigate the performance of our $\mu^2$-amplifiers in terms of a gain-corrected probability-fidelity product and the ratio of input to output signal-to-noise ratios corrected for success probability.

abstract: The need for secrecy and security is essential in communication. Secret sharing is a conventional protocol to distribute a secret message to a group of parties, who cannot access it individually but need to cooperate in order to decode it. While several variants of this protocol have been investigated, including realizations using quantum systems, the security of quantum secret sharing schemes against eavesdroppers and dishonest participants remained unproven. Here we establish an unconditional security proof for continuous variable entanglement-based quantum secret sharing schemes, in the limit of asymptotic keys and for an arbitrary number of players, by utilizing ideas from the recently developed one-sided device-independent approach to quantum key distribution. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our scheme, which can be implemented by Gaussian states and homodyne measurements, with no need for ideal single-photon sources or quantum memories. Our results establish quantum secret sharing as a viable and practically relevant primitive for quantum communication technologies.

abstract: The control of quantum correlations in solid state systems by means of material engineering is a broad avenue to be explored, since it makes possible steps toward the limits of quantum mechanics and the design of novel materials with applications on emerging quantum technologies. In this context, this Letter explores the potential of molecular magnets to be prototypes of materials for quantum information technology. More precisely, we engineered a material and from its geometric quantum discord we found significant quantum correlations up to 9540 K (even without entanglement); and, in addition, a pure singlet state occupied up to around 80 K (above liquid nitrogen temperature). These results could only be achieved due to the carboxylate group promoting a metal-to-metal huge magnetic interaction.

abstract: Entanglement depth characterizes the minimal number of particles in a system that are mutually entangled. For symmetric states, we show that there is a dichotomy for entanglement depth: an $N$-particle symmetric state is either fully separable, or fully entangled---the entanglement depth is either $1$ or $N$. This property is even stable under non-symmetric noise. We propose an experimentally accessible method to detect entanglement depth in atomic ensembles based on a bound on the particle number population of Dicke states, and demonstrate that the entanglement depth of some Dicke states, for example the twin Fock state, is very stable even under a large arbitrary noise. Our observation can be applied to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to infer that these systems can be highly entangled with the entanglement depth that is of the order of the system size (i.e. several thousands of atoms).

abstract: Entangling properties of a mixed 2-qubit system can be described by the local homogeneous unitary invariant polynomials in elements of the density matrix. The structure of the corresponding invariant polynomial ring for the special subclass of states, the so-called mixed X-states, is established. It is shown that for the X-states there is an injective ring homomorphism of the quotient ring of SU(2)xSU(2) invariant polynomials modulo its syzygy ideal and the SO(2)xSO(2)-invariant ring freely generated by five homogeneous polynomials of degrees 1,1,1,2,2.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize a topological insulator with optical-passive elements, and analyze the effects of Kerr-nonlinearities in its topological behavior. In the linear regime, our design gives rise to an optical spectrum with topological features and where the bandwidths and bandgaps are dramatically broadened. The resulting edge modes cover a very wide frequency range. We relate this behavior to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian describing the system's amplitudes is long-range. We also develop a method to analyze the scheme in the presence of a Kerr medium. We assess robustness and stability of the topological features, and predict the presence of chiral squeezed fluctuations at the edges in some parameter regimes.

abstract: Repeated observations inhibit the coherent evolution of quantum states through the quantum Zeno effect. In multi-qubit systems this effect provides new opportunities to control complex quantum states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that repeatedly projecting joint observables of multiple spins creates coherent quantum Zeno subspaces and simultaneously suppresses dephasing caused by the environment. We encode up to two logical qubits in these subspaces and show that the enhancement of the dephasing time with increasing number of projections follows a scaling law that is independent of the number of spins involved. These results provide new insights into the interplay between frequent multi-spin measurements and non-Markovian noise and pave the way for tailoring the dynamics of multi-qubit systems through repeated projections.

abstract: Trapped ions are a promising tool for building a large-scale quantum computer. The number of required radiation fields for the realisation of quantum gates in any proposed ion-based architecture scales with the number of ions inside the quantum computer, posing a major challenge when imagining a device with millions of qubits. Here we present a fundamentally different approach, where this scaling entirely vanishes. The method is based on individually controlled voltages applied to each logic gate location to facilitate the actual gate operation analogous to a traditional transistor architecture within a classical computer processor. We demonstrate the key principle of this approach by implementing a versatile quantum gate method based on long-wavelength radiation where we generate a maximally entangled two-qubit state with fidelity 0.985(12). This quantum gate also constitutes a simple-to-implement tool for quantum metrology, sensing and simulation.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The concept of 'super-indeterminism' captures the notion that the free choice assumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following requirement: an agent's free-choice performance in the selection of measurement settings must not represent an exception to the rule of irreducible quantum indeterminism in the physical universe (i.e, "universal indeterminism"). Any additional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism, i.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter "freedom", "free will", or "free choice", is redundant in relation to the predictive success of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views as redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a negative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a necessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts, for example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will theorem by Conway and Kochen. The concept of super-indeterminism is of great assistance in clarifying the often misunderstood meaning of the concept of "free variables" as used by John Bell. The present work argues that Bell sought an operational, effective free will theorem, one based upon the notion of "determinism without predetermination", i.e., one wherein "free variables" represent universally uncomputable variables. In conclusion, the standard interpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer in order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of whether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to free-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents in quantum mechanics.

abstract: The factorization method is used to construct two different spectrum generating algebras for the radial oscillator. The states are classified in hierarchies according to either the orbital angular momentum or the energy. It is shown that the Lie groups SU(1,1) and SU(2) are the dynamical groups of the definite orbital angular momentum and definite energy hierarchies respectively. Different representation spaces of finite dimension are constructed in the latter case. The generators of the Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2) are expressed in the Schwinger representation and the corresponding generalized coherent states are constructed. It is shown that squeezing occurs in terms of the complex parameter that labels the coherent states.

Our source provides photon pairs that display, simultaneously, the key properties for high-performance quantum information and fundamental quantum science tasks. Specifically, the source provides for high heralding efficiency, high quantum state purity and high entangled state fidelity at the same time. Among different tests we apply to our source we observe almost perfect non-classical interference between photons from independent sources with a visibility of $(100\pm5)\%$.

abstract: Suppose a quantum system starts to evolve under a Hamiltonian from some initial state. When for the first time, will an observable attain a preassigned value? To answer this question, one method often adopted is to make instantaneous measurements periodically and note down the serial number for which the desired result is obtained for the first time. We apply this protocol to an interacting spin system at zero temperature and show analytically that the response of this system shows a non-analyticity as a function of the parameter of the Hamiltonian and the time interval of measurement. In contrast to quantum phase transitions, this new type of phase transition is not a property of the ground state and arises from the Hamiltonian dynamics and quantum mechanical nature of the measurement. The specific system studied is transverse Ising chain and the measurement performed is, whether the total transverse magnetic moment (per site) is not equal to 1. The results for some other types of measurement is also discussed.

We use a high-rate source of heralded single-photon path-entangled states, combined with high-efficiency superconducting-based detectors, in a scheme that is free of any post-selection and thus immune to the detection loophole. This result conclusively demonstrates single-photon entanglement in a one-sided device-independent scenario, and opens the way towards implementations of device-independent quantum technologies within the paradigm of path entanglement.

This Raman amplification process can be used to realize atom-light hybrid interferometer. We numerically calculate the phase sensitivities and the signal-to-noise ratios of this interferometer with the method of homodyne detection and intensity detection, and give their differences between this two methods. In the presence of loss of light field and atomic decoherence the measure precision will be reduced which can be explained by the break of the intermode decorrelation conditions of output modes

abstract: We investigate the resonant quantum dynamics of a multi-qubit ensemble in a microcavity. Both the quantum-dot subsystem and the microcavity mode are pumped coherently. We found that the microcavity photon statistics depends on the phase difference of the driving lasers which is not the case for the photon intensity at resonant driving. This way, one can manipulate the two-photon correlations. In particular, higher degrees of photon correlations and, eventually, stronger intensities are obtained. Furthermore, the microcavity photon statistics exhibits steady-state oscillatory behaviors as well as asymmetries.

abstract: Memory-assisted measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MA-MDI-QKD) has recently been proposed as a possible intermediate step towards the realization of quantum repeaters. Despite its relaxing some of the requirements on quantum memories, the choice of memory in relation to the layout of the setup and the protocol has a stark e?ect on our ability to beat existing no-memory systems. Here, a variant of MA-MDI-QKD that relies on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers as its quantum memories is proposed. We particularly focus on the cavity-enhanced NV centers and show that, in terms of the secret key rate per transmitted pulse, we can beat the existing no-memory QKD systems by up to three orders of magnitude. Using system parameters achievable by the today's state of the art, we then anticipate some total key rate advantage in the distance range between 300 km and 500 km. Our analysis accounts for major sources of error including the dark current, the channel loss, and the decoherence of the quantum memories.

abstract: We report on the measurement of the time required for a wave packet to tunnel through the potential barriers of an optical lattice. The experiment is carried out by loading adiabatically a Bose-Einstein condensate into a 1D optical lattice. A sudden displacement of the lattice by a few tens of nm excites the micromotion of the dipole mode. We then directly observe in momentum space the splitting of the wave packet at the turning points and measure the delay between the reflected and the tunneled packets for various initial displacements. Using this atomic beam splitter twice, we realize a chain of coherent micron-size Mach-Zehnder interferometers at the exit of which we get essentially a wave packet with a negative momentum, a result opposite to the prediction of classical physics.

abstract: In this work we study the entanglement entropy of a uniform quantum Ising chain in transverse field undergoing a periodic driving of period $\tau$. By means of Floquet theory we show that, for any subchain, the entanglement entropy tends asymptotically to a value $\tau$-periodic in time. We provide a semi-analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic value: It is constant in time and obeys a volume law. The asymptotic value is always smaller than the thermal one. Because of integrability the system does not thermalize locally, but relaxes to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Remarkably, the asymptotic entropy shows marked features in correspondence to some non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions undergone by a Floquet state analog of the ground state.

abstract: We introduce a general class of su$(1|1)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interactions which includes as particular cases the su$(1|1)$ Inozemtsev (elliptic) and Haldane-Shastry chains, as well as the XX model. We show that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of the algebraic properties of the su$(1|1)$ permutation operator, and take advantage of this fact to analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential term is present in the Hamiltonian. We first study the low energy excitations and the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$ when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\mathcal E(\pi))$, $\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation. We also analyze the von Neumann and R\'enyi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that they exhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins characteristic of a one-boson $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show that the models under study are quantum critical when the chemical potential belongs to the critical interval, with central charge $c=1$. From the analysis of the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a quantum phase transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further confirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which is studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the su$(1|1)$ elliptic chain.

Unlike traditional phase estimation, our approach does not require ancillary qubits nor does it require well characterised gates. Instead, it only requires the ability to perform approximate Haar-random unitary operations, applying the unitary whose eigenspectrum is sought out and performing measurements in the computational basis. We discuss application of these ideas to in-place amplitude estimation and quantum device calibration.

abstract: Quantum walks are a promising framework that can be used to both understand and implement quantum information processing tasks. The quantum stochastic walk is a recently developed framework that combines the concept of a quantum walk with that of a classical random walk, through open system evolution of a quantum system. Quantum stochastic walks have been shown to have applications in as far reaching fields as artificial intelligence. However, there are significant constraints on the kind of open system evolutions that can be realized in a physical experiment. In this work, we discuss the restrictions on the allowed open system evolution, and the physical assumptions underpinning them. We show that general implementations would require the complete solution of the underlying unitary dynamics, and sophisticated reservoir engineering, thus weakening the benefits of experimental investigations.

abstract: The quantum max-flow min-cut conjecture relates the rank of a tensor network to the minimum cut in the case that all tensors in the network are identical\cite{mfmc1}. This conjecture was shown to be false in Ref. \onlinecite{mfmc2} by an explicit counter-example. Here, we show that the conjecture is almost true, in that the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut converges to $1$ as the dimension $N$ of the degrees of freedom on the edges of the network tends to infinity. The proof is based on estimating moments of the singular values of the network. We introduce a generalization of "rainbow diagrams"\cite{rainbow} to tensor networks to estimate the dominant diagrams. A direct comparison of second and fourth moments lower bounds the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut by a constant. To show the tighter bound that the ratio tends to $1$, we consider higher moments. In addition, we show that the limiting moments as $N \rightarrow \infty$ agree with that in a different ensemble where tensors in the network are chosen independently, this is used to show that the distributions of singular values in the two different ensembles weakly converge to the same limiting distribution. We present also a numerical study of one particular tensor network, which shows a surprising dependence of the rank deficit on $N \mod 4$ and suggests further conjecture on the limiting behavior of the rank.

abstract: Quantum photonic chips, which integrate quantum light sources alongside active and passive optical elements, as well as single photon detectors, show great potential for photonic quantum information processing and quantum technology. Mature semiconductor nanofabrication processes allow for scaling such photonic integrated circuits to on-chip networks of increasing complexity. Second order nonlinear materials are the method of choice for generating photonic quantum states in the overwhelming part of linear optic experiments using bulk components but integration with waveguide circuitry on a nanophotonic chip proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate such an on-chip parametric down-conversion source of photon pairs based on second order nonlinearity in an Aluminum nitride microring resonator. We show the potential of our source for quantum information processing by measuring high-visibility antibunching of heralded single photons with nearly ideal state purity. Our down conversion source operates with high brightness and low noise, yielding pairs of correlated photons at MHz-rates with high coincidence-to-accidental ratio. The generated photon pairs are spectrally far separated from the pump field, providing good potential for realizing sufficient on-chip filtering and monolithic integration of quantum light sources, waveguide circuits and single photon detectors.

abstract: Entangling two remote quantum systems which never interact directly is an essential primitive in quantum information science. In quantum optics, remote entanglement experiments provides one approach for loophole-free tests of quantum non-locality and form the basis for the modular architecture of quantum computing. In these experiments, the two qubits, Alice and Bob, are each first entangled with a traveling photon. Subsequently, the two photons paths interfere on a beam-splitter before being directed to single-photon detectors. Such concurrent remote entanglement protocols using discrete Fock states can be made robust to photon losses, unlike schemes that rely on continuous variable states. This robustness arises from heralding the entanglement on the detection of events which can be selected for their unambiguity. However, efficiently detecting single photons is challenging in the domain of superconducting quantum circuits because of the low energy of microwave quanta. Here, we report the realization of a novel microwave photon detector implemented in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) framework of superconducting quantum information, and the demonstration, with this detector, of a robust form of concurrent remote entanglement.

abstract: Quantum annealing aims to exploit quantum mechanics to speed up the solution to optimization problems. Most problems exhibit complete connectivity between the logical spin variables after they are mapped to the Ising spin Hamiltonian of quantum annealing. To account for hardware constraints of current and future physical quantum annealers, methods enabling the embedding of fully connected graphs of logical spins into a constant-degree graph of physical spins are therefore essential. Here, we compare the recently proposed embedding scheme for quantum annealing with all-to-all connectivity due to Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) [Science Advances 1 (2015)] to the commonly used minor embedding (ME) scheme. Using both simulated quantum annealing and parallel tempering simulations, we find that for a set of instances randomly chosen from a class of fully connected, random Ising problems, the ME scheme outperforms the LHZ scheme when using identical simulation parameters, despite the fault tolerance of the latter to weakly correlated spin-flip noise. This result persists even after we introduce several decoding strategies for the LHZ scheme, including a minimum-weight decoding algorithm that results in substantially improved performance over the original LHZ scheme. We explain the better performance of the ME scheme in terms of more efficient spin updates, which allows it to better tolerate the correlated spin-flip errors that arise in our model of quantum annealing. Our results leave open the question of whether the performance of the two embedding schemes can be improved using scheme-specific parameters and new error correction approaches.

abstract: We study nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with a quantum generalization of broadcasts. We show that, with number-in-hand classical inputs, the communication complexity of a Boolean function in this communication model equals the logarithm of the support rank of the corresponding tensor, whereas the approximation complexity in this model equals the logarithm of the border support rank. This characterisation allows us to prove a log-rank conjecture posed by Villagra et al. for nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with message-passing. The support rank characterization of the communication model connects quantum communication complexity intimately to the theory of asymptotic entanglement transformation and algebraic complexity theory. In this context, we introduce the graphwise equality problem. For a cycle graph, the complexity of this communication problem is closely related to the complexity of the computational problem of multiplying matrices, or more precisely, it equals the logarithm of the asymptotic support rank of the iterated matrix multiplication tensor. We employ Strassen's laser method to show that asymptotically there exist nontrivial protocols for every odd-player cyclic equality problem. We exhibit an efficient protocol for the 5-player problem for small inputs, and we show how Young flattenings yield nontrivial complexity lower bounds.

abstract: To exploit a given physical system for quantum information processing, it is critical to understand the different types of noise affecting quantum control. The ability to distinguish coherent and incoherent error is extremely useful, as these errors contribute differently to the fault tolerance threshold, but coherent error is generally easier to reduce at the hardware level. In this work, we characterize the quantum control of a single (ensemble) qubit via solid-state pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR). We use randomized benchmarking (RB) together with purity benchmarking (PB) to quantify the total error and the incoherent error in a set of Clifford gates. The lowest error rates are achieved when the transfer function of the pulsed ESR control system is carefully accounted for, and we find that incoherent errors make up the majority of the total error. The robustness of RB to gate-dependent noise is investigated by using gate-set tomography and numerical simulations, where it is found that RB and PB are surprisingly robust.

abstract: We demonstrate optomechanical quantum control of the internal electronic states of a diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in the resolved-sideband regime by coupling the NV to both optical fields and surface acoustic waves via a phonon-assisted optical transition and by taking advantage of the strong excited-state electron-phonon coupling of a NV center. Optomechanically-driven Rabi oscillations as well as quantum interferences between the optomechanical sideband and the direct dipole-optical transitions have been realized. These studies open the door to using resolved-sideband optomechanical coupling for quantum control of both the atom-like internal states and the motional states of a coupled NV-nanomechanical system, leading to the development of a solid-state analog of trapped ions.

abstract: Entangled states are a crucial resource for quantum-based technologies such as quantum computers and quantum communication systems (1,2). Exploring new methods for entanglement generation is important for diversifying and eventually improving current approaches. Here, we create entanglement in atomic ions by applying laser fields to constrain the evolution to a restricted number of states, in an approach that has become known as "quantum Zeno dynamics" (3-5). With two trapped $^9\rm{Be}^+$ ions, we obtain Bell state fidelities up to $0.990^{+2}_{-5}$, with three ions, a W-state (6) fidelity of $0.910^{+4}_{-7}$ is obtained. Compared to other methods of producing entanglement in trapped ions, this procedure is relatively insensitive to certain imperfections such as fluctuations in laser intensity, laser frequency, and ion-motion frequencies.

abstract: Floquet theory provides rigorous foundations for the theory of periodically driven quantum systems. In the case of non-periodic driving, however, the situation is not so well understood. Here, we provide a critical review of the theoretical framework developed for quasi-periodically driven quantum systems. Although the theoretical footing is still under development, we argue that quasi-periodically driven quantum systems can be treated with generalizations of Floquet theory in suitable parameter regimes. Moreover, we provide a generalization of the Floquet-Magnus expansion and argue that quasi-periodic driving offers a promising route for quantum simulations.

abstract: During many years since the birth of quantum mechanics, instrumentalist interpretations prevailed: the meaning of the theory was expressed in terms of measurements results. But in the last decades, several attempts to interpret it from a realist viewpoint have been proposed. Among them, modal interpretations supply a realist non-collapse account, according to which the system always has definite properties and the quantum state represents possibilities, not actualities. However, the traditional modal interpretations faced some conceptual problems when addressing imperfect measurements. The modal-Hamiltonian interpretation, on the contrary, proved to be able to supply an adequate account of the measurement problem, both in its ideal and its non-ideal versions. Moreover, in the non-ideal case, it gives a precise criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements. Nevertheless, that criterion depends on the particular state of the measured system, and this might be considered as a shortcoming of the proposal. In fact, one could ask for a criterion of reliability that does not depend on the features of what is measured but only on the properties of the measurement device. The aim of this article is precisely to supply such a criterion: we will adopt an informational perspective for this purpose.

abstract: Phase transitions are commonly held to occur only in the thermodynamical limit of large number of system components. Here we exemplify at the hand of the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model and its generalization to finite JC-lattices that finite component systems of coupled spins and bosons may exhibit quantum phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we find a continuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic condensate with a macroscopic occupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation. For the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a Mott-insulator to superfluid QPT. We identify as the underlying principle of the emergence of finite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy and increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which allows for the exploration of an increasingly large portion of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that finite system phase transitions will be present in a broad range of physical systems.

abstract: It is an oft cited fact that no quantum code can support a set of fault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however, is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable method of code switching.

abstract: The von Neumann lattice refers to a discrete basis of Gaussians located on a lattice in phase space. It provides an attractive approach for solving quantum mechanical problems, allowing the pruning of tensor-product basis sets using phase space considerations. In a series of recent articles Shimshovitz et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 7 (2012)], Takemoto et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics 137 1 (2012)] Machnes et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics, accepted (2016)]), we have introduced two key new elements into the method: a formalism for converging the basis and for efficient pruning by use of the biorthogonal basis. In this paper we review the key components of the theory and then present new, efficient and parallelizable iterative algorithms for solving the time-independent and time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. The algorithms dynamically determine the active reduced basis iteratively without resorting to classical analogs. These algorithmic developments, combined with the previous formal developments, allow quantum dynamics to be performed directly and economically in phase space. We provide two illustrative examples: double-well tunneling and double ionization of helium.

This generalizes a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of the matrix multiplication tensor.

abstract: Entanglement-assisted quantum communication employs pre-shared entanglement between sender and receiver as a resource. We apply the same framework to quantum metrology, introducing shared entanglement between the preparation and the measurement stage, namely using some entangled ancillary system that does not interact with the system to be sampled. This is known to be useless in the noiseless case, but was recently shown to be useful in the presence of noise. Here we detail how and when it can be of use. For example, surprisingly it is useful when randomly time sharing two channels where ancillas do not help (depolarizing). We show that it is useful for all levels of noise for many noise models and propose a simple experiment to test these results.

abstract: The creation of composite quantum gates that implement quantum response functions $\hat{U}(\theta)$ dependent on some parameter of interest $\theta$ has historically been more of an art than a science. Through inspired design, a sequence of $L$ primitive gates also depending on $\theta$ can engineer a highly nontrivial $\hat{U}(\theta)$ that enables myriad precision metrology, spectroscopy, and control techniques. However, discovering new useful examples of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ requires great intuition to perceive the possibilities, and often brute-force to find optimal implementations. These demands hobble our imagination of new applications. We present a systematic and efficient methodology for composite gate design of arbitrary length, where phase-controlled primitive gates all rotating by $\theta$ act on a single spin. We fully characterize the realizable family of $\hat{U}(\theta)$, provide an efficient algorithm that decomposes a choice of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ into its shortest sequence of gates, and show how to efficiently choose achievable $\hat{U}(\theta)$ that for fixed $L$, are optimal approximations to objective functions on its quadratures. A strong connection is forged with \emph{classical} discrete-time signal processing, allowing us to swiftly construct, as examples, compensated gates with optimal bandwidth that implement arbitrary single spin rotations with optimal sub-wavelength spatial selectivity.

abstract: We present a complete classification of quantum stabilizer gates in terms of the functions they generate assuming the ability to swap qubits and use ancillary workspace. Because we view these stabilizer circuits as subroutines of some general quantum computation, we insist that any ancilla qubits used during the computation must not change in an input-dependent manner. This is the first attempt at a quantum extension of the classification of reversible classical gates introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious program to classify all quantum gate sets. The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau representation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which elementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57 different stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the single-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining classes are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the CNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to X-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining classes are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the T_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates.

abstract: As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, (transient) superballistic transport is not well understood but it has been experimentally observed recently. We here calculate the white noise effect (in Markov approximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model with disordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to perfect lattices at both ends. Here we show the effect of white noise on spreading of the wave packet initially located at the center of the sublattice. We find threshold values of the white noise strength, beyond which the quantum hyperdiffusion does not occur. We predict from our numerical studies that the quantum hyperdiffusion exponent can be tuned by the strength of applied white noise. Therefore we can manually apply noise to a system to drive it to desired diffusion rate.

abstract: Pulsed ESR experiments are reported for ensembles of negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) in diamonds at X-band magnetic fields (280-400 mT) and low temperatures (2-70 K). The NV$^-$ centers in synthetic type IIb diamonds (nitrogen impurity concentration $<1$~ppm) are prepared with bulk concentrations of $2\cdot 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $4\cdot 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ by high-energy electron irradiation and subsequent annealing. We find that a proper post-radiation anneal (1000$^\circ$C for 60 mins) is critically important to repair the radiation damage and to recover long electron spin coherence times for NV$^-$s. After the annealing, spin coherence times of T$_2 = 0.74$~ms at 5~K are achieved, being only limited by $^{13}$C nuclear spectral diffusion in natural abundance diamonds. At X-band magnetic fields, strong electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) is observed originating from the central $^{14}$N nucleus. The ESEEM spectral analysis allows for accurate determination of the $^{14}$N nuclear hypefine and quadrupole tensors. In addition, the ESEEM effects from two proximal $^{13}$C sites (second-nearest neighbor and fourth-nearest neighbor) are resolved and the respective $^{13}$C hyperfine coupling constants are extracted.

abstract: Boson sampling is a problem intractable for classical computers, but can be naturally solved on a specialized photonic quantum simulator which requires less resources than building a universal quantum computer. The biggest challenge to implement boson sampling with a large number of photons has been the lack of reliable single-photon sources. Here we demonstrate a scalable architecture of boson sampling using a solid-state single-photon source with simultaneously high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability. The single photons are time-bin encoded and interfered in an electrically programmable loop-based network. We implement and validate boson sampling with input three and four single photons, and track the dynamical multi-photon evolution inside the circuit. With further refinement of the system efficiency, our approach may be feasible to be scaled up to >20-boson sampling to outperform classical computers, and thus provide experimental evidence against the Extended Church-Turing Thesis.

The ratio between the width and the separation determines the detection result. { In particular, it is shown that the bunching parameter of bosons is not a well-defined physical property. Moreover, it may suggests that } there is a difficulty in quantum measurement theory in the interpretation of coordinate measurement of two particles.

abstract: Spectrum Broadcast Structures are a new and fresh concept in the quantum-to-classical transition, introduced recently in the context of decoherence and the appearance of objective features in quantum mechanics. These are specific quantum state structures, responsible for an apparent objectivity of a decohered state of a system. Recently they have been shown to appear in the well known Quantum Brownian Motion model, however the final analysis relied on numerics. Here, after a presentation of the main concepts, we perform analytical studies of the model, showing the timescales and the efficiency of the spectrum broadcast structure formation. We consider a massive central system and a somewhat simplified environment being random with a uniform distribution of the frequencies.

abstract: Standard error correction techniques only provide a quantum memory and need extra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are small angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A. 91, 042315 (2015)], though it uses nearly half the resources to achieve the same output error rate. Direct access to small angle rotations reduces the need for costly gate synthesis techniques. We find a magic state approach can reduce resource costs by approximately a factor of 40 compared to using gate synthesis, with some variation depending on the parameter regime of interest.

We first provide examples of such repeated measurements where all the obtainable information is reached after a finite number of repetitions. We also prove, however, that repeating the L\"uders measurement of an unsharp non-trivial two-outcome observable yields novel information at each step, and we characterize the information obtained in the limit of infinitely many repetitions. Our result implies that a repeated measurement can be used to correct the inherent noise of an unsharp observable.

abstract: We prove the equivalence between two approaches to the characterisation of quantum Markovianity, divisibility and lack of information backflow. We show that a dynamical map is completely-positive-divisible if and only if a monotonic non-increase of distinguishability is observed for two equiprobable states of the evolving system and an ancilla. Moreover our proof is constructive for invertible dynamical maps: given any such a map that is not completely-positive-divisible, we give an explicit construction of two states that exhibit information backflow. Finally, while an ancilla is necessary for the equivalence to hold in general, we show that it is always possible to witness the non-Markovianity of maps without using any entanglement between system and ancilla.

abstract: Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum information applications due to their bright single photon emission and optically accessible spin states. Furthermore, SiV centers in low-strain diamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e. they show very weak spectral diffusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV centers interesting for sensing applications. We here report on photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy on an SiV ensemble in a low strain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure the fine structure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the SiV centers. We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and position of the fine structure peaks. Our measurements reveal linewidths of about 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on the order of 0.1 GHz. This difference arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions caused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral hole burning spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited homogeneous linewidth of 279 MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of coherent interaction in the system by driving a $\Lambda$-scheme. Additional measurements on single emitters created by ion implantation confirm the homogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate the ground state splitting to the decoherence rate.

title: Universal Optimal Estimation of the Polarization of Light with Arbitrary Photon Statistics

abstract: A universal and optimal method for the polarimetry of light with arbitrary photon statistics is presented. The method is based on the continuous maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued measure (ML-POVM) for pure polarization states over the surface of the Bloch sphere. The success probability and the mean fidelity are used as the figures of merit to show its performance. The POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization estimation with respect to the mean fidelity. As demonstrations, explicit results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized coherent state (Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that the estimation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are almost identical, while that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests that thermal light leaks less information to an eavesdropper and hence could potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quantum communication protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally, comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical communications are made to show the better and more stable performance of the continuous ML-POVM.

abstract: The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds with basic principles in quantum mechanics. While statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium, an isolated many-body system undergoing Schr\"odinger dynamics has zero entropy because, at any given time, it is described by a single quantum state. The underlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly antithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of systems. Here we observe experimentally how this conflict is resolved: we perform microscopy on an evolving quantum state, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. Although the full state has zero entropy, entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a near-volume law in the entanglement entropy.

abstract: The advent of quantum devices, which exploit the two essential elements of quantum physics, coherence and entanglement, has sparked renewed interest in the control of open quantum systems. Successful implementations face the challenge to preserve the relevant nonclassical features at the level of device operation. A major obstacle is decoherence which is caused by interaction with the environment. Optimal control theory is a tool that can be used to identify control strategies in the presence of decoherence. We review here recent advances in optimal control methodology that allow for tackling typical tasks in device operation for open quantum systems and discuss examples of relaxation-optimized dynamics. Optimal control theory is also a useful tool to exploit the environment for control. We discuss examples and point out possible future extensions.

abstract: We present an approach to universal quantum computation based on the modulation of a longitudinal qubit-oscillator coupling. We show how to realize a controlled-phase gate by simultaneously modulating the coupling of two qubits to a common oscillator mode. In contrast to the situation with the more familiar transversal qubit-oscillator coupling, the magnitude of the effective qubit-qubit interaction here does not rely on a small perturbative parameter. As a result, this effective interaction strength can be made large, leading to short gate times and high gate fidelities. We moreover show how the gate fidelity can be exponentially improved with single-mode squeezing and how the entangling gate can be generalized to qubits coupled to separate oscillators.

abstract: Memristors are resistive elements retaining information of their past dynamics. They have garnered substantial interest due to their potential for representing a paradigm change in electronics, information processing and unconventional computing. Given the advent of quantum technologies, a design for a quantum memristor with superconducting circuits may be envisaged. Along these lines, we introduce such a quantum device whose memristive behavior arises from quasiparticle-induced tunneling when supercurrents are cancelled. For realistic parameters, we find that the relevant hysteretic behavior may be observed using current state-of-the-art measurements of the phase-driven tunneling current. Finally, we develop adequate methods to quantify the memory retention in this system.

abstract: The two-photon quantum Rabi model with quadratic coupling is studied using extended squeezed states and we derive $G$-functions for Bargmann index $q=1/4$ and $3/4$. The simple singularity structure of the $G$-function allows to draw conclusions about the distribution of eigenvalues along the real axis. The previously found picture of the spectral collapse at critical coupling $g_{\mathrm{c}}$ has to be modified regarding the low lying states, especially the ground state: We obtain a finite gap between ground state and the continuum of excited states at the collapse point. For large qubit splitting, also other low lying states may be separated from the continuum at $g_{\mathrm{c}}$. We have carried out a perturbative analysis allowing for explicit and simple formulae of the eigenstates. Interestingly, a vanishing of the gap between ground state and excited continuum at $g_{\mathrm{c}}$ is obtained in each finite order of approximation. This demonstrates cleary the non-pertubative nature of the excitation gap. We corroborate these findings with a variational calculation for the ground state.

abstract: Traditionally, spectroscopy is performed by examining the position of absorption lines. However, at frequencies near the transition frequency, additional information can be obtained from the phase shift. In this work we consider the information about the transition frequency obtained from both the absorption and the phase shift, as quantified by the Fisher information in an interferometric measurement. We examine the use of multiple single-photon states, NOON states, and numerically optimized states that are entangled and have multiple photons. We find the optimized states that improve over the standard quantum limit set by independent single photons for some atom number densities.

abstract: The correlation diagram of the vibrational energy spectra associated with the stretching modes of triatomic molecules such as CO$_2$ and H$_2$O is analyzed by means of two interacting Morse oscillators. By considering a linear dependence of the structure and force constants ($x_g=g^o_{rr'}/g^o_{rr}, x_f=f_{rr'}/f_{rr}$) going from the water parameters to the carbon dioxide, it is shown that the fidelity, entropy and Poincar\'e sections detect the polyad breaking process manifested in the transition from local to normal mode behaviors. Additionally Poincar\'e sections show a transition to chaos where the polyad cannot be defined.

abstract: Quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than any possible conventional computer. Small quantum algorithms have been demonstrated in multiple quantum computing platforms, many specifically tailored in hardware to implement a particular algorithm or execute a limited number of computational paths. Here, we demonstrate a trapped-ion quantum computer module that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic gates. We compile algorithms into a fully-connected set of gate operations native to the hardware. Reconfiguring these gate sequences provides the flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms without altering the hardware. As examples, we implement the Deutsch- Jozsa (DJ), Bernstein-Vazirani (BV), and quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithms on five trapped-ion qubits. This small quantum computer can be scaled to larger numbers of qubits within a single module, and can be further expanded by connecting many modules through ion shuttling or photonic quantum channels.

abstract: We consider an open quantum system described by a Lindblad-type master equation with two times-scales. The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and drives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform the adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric asymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the time-scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation theory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it provides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive parameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the low-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and trace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics, we obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation since it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At the first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master equation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian perturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order slow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated on a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the ancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system.

abstract: We consider the dissipative single-qubit circuit QED architecture in which the atomic transition frequency undergoes a weak external time-modulation. For sinusoidal modulation with linearly varying frequency we derive effective Hamiltonians that resemble the Landau-Zener problem of finite duration associated to a two- or multi-level systems. The corresponding off-diagonal coupling coefficients originate either from the rotating or the counter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian, depending on the values of the modulation frequency. It is demonstrated that in the dissipation less case one can accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare Rabi Hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep. To assess the experimental feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the phenomenological and the microscopic quantum master equations in the Markovian regime at zero temperature. Both models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior and indicate that photon generation from vacuum via effective Landau-Zener transitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales of a few microseconds. Moreover, unlike the harmonic dynamical Casimir effect implementations, our proposal does not require the precise knowledge of the resonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon generation.

abstract: The concept of flat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated many-body physics. However, the demonstration of the flat band physics is highly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations in conventional condensed matter materials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator of the 2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a flat middle band. By exploiting the simple parametric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with \textit{in situ} tunable hopping strengths in a 2D array of coupled superconducting transmissionline resonators. Moreover, the flexibility of our proposal enables the immediate incorporation of both the artificial gauge field and the strong photon-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously demonstrate the synthesized flat band, we further investigate the observation of the flat band localization of microwave photons through the pumping and the steady-state measurements of only few sites on the lattice. Requiring only current level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic circuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new way towards the future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall fluids including anomalous quantum Hall effect and bosonic fractional quantum Hall states without magnetic fields.

abstract: We use Rabi spectroscopy to explore the low-energy excitation spectrum of a finite-temperature Bose gas of rubidium atoms across the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). To record this spectrum, we coherently drive the atomic population between two spin states. A small relative displacement of the spin-specific trapping potentials enables sideband transitions between different motional states. The intrinsic non-linearity of the motional spectrum, mainly originating from two-body interactions, makes it possible to resolve and address individual excitation lines. Together with sensitive atom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited atoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As an example, we show that for a nearly pure BEC of N = 800 atoms the first excited state has a population of less than 5 atoms, corresponding to an upper bound on the temperature of 30 nK.

abstract: We introduce a new board game based on the ancient Chinese game of Go (Weiqi, Igo, Baduk). The key difference from the original game is that players no longer alternatively play single stones on the board but instead they take turns placing pairs of entangled go stones. A phenomenon of quantum-like collapse occurs when one of the stones in an entangled pair is directly in contact with at least one other stone. The player to whom the entangled pair belongs must then remove one of the stones in the pair from the board. The aim of the game is still to surround more territory than the opponent and as the number of stones increases, all the entangled pairs of stones eventually reduce to single stones. Quantum Go provides an interesting and tangible illustration of quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement and collapse.

The description extends earlier work to include the effects on the states of two or more interacting particles. Emphasis is placed on the effects on entangled states. The resulting scaling field is generalized to describe the effects on these states. It is also seen that one can use fiber bundles with fibers associated with single locations of the underlying space to describe the effects of scaling on arbitrary numbers of particles.

abstract: Quantum state discrimination between two wave functions on a ring is considered. The optimal minimum-error probability is known to be given by the Helstrom bound. A new strategy is introduced by inserting instantaneously two impenetrable barriers dividing the ring into two chambers. In the process, the candidate wave functions, as the insertion points become nodes, get entangled with the barriers and can, if judiciously chosen, be distinguished with smaller error probability. As a consequence, the Helstrom bound under idealised conditions can be violated.

abstract: We present improvements in both theoretical understanding and experimental implementation of the cross resonance (CR) gate that have led to shorter two-qubit gate times and interleaved randomized benchmarking fidelities exceeding 99%. The CR gate is an all-microwave two-qubit gate offers that does not require tunability and is therefore well suited to quantum computing architectures based on 2D superconducting qubits. The performance of the gate has previously been hindered by long gate times and fidelities averaging 94-96%. We have developed a calibration procedure that accurately measures the full CR Hamiltonian. The resulting measurements agree with theoretical analysis of the gate and also elucidate the error terms that have previously limited the gate fidelity. The increase in fidelity that we have achieved was accomplished by introducing a second microwave drive tone on the target qubit to cancel unwanted components of the CR Hamiltonian.

However, claims continue to be made that this approach, also known as "Quantum Darwinism," is the correct way to understand classical emergence. This Letter reviews the basic problem and points out an additional logical flaw in the argument. It is concluded that the "Quantum Darwinism" program fails.

abstract: In contrast to strong projective measurement, which freezes the system evolution by quantum Zeno effect, weak measurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to nontrivial effects. Here we consider global weak measurement addressing several bosonic modes at the same time, thus preserving quantum superpositions due to the lack of which path information. While for certainty we focus on ultracold atoms, the idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems, including various quantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely photonic systems with multiple-path interferometers. We show that light scattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining macroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent dynamics. Even for constant external measurement, the quantum measurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi-periodically and induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms. We introduce an effective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an analytic solution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its stable point. We confirm our finding describing the atomic observables in terms of stochastic differential equations.

abstract: The vacuum state of a relativistic quantum field contains entanglement between regions separated by spacelike intervals. Such spatial entanglement can be revealed using an operational method introduced in Ann. Phys. 351, 112 (2014), Phys. Rev. D 91, 016005 (2014). In this approach, a cavity is instantaneously divided into halves by an introduction of an extra perfect mirror. Causal separation of the two regions of the cavity reveals nonlocal spatial correlations present in the field, which can be quantified by measuring particles generated in the process. We use this method to study spatial entanglement properties of nonvacuum Gaussian field states. In particular we show how to enhance the amount of harvested spatial entanglement by an appropriate choice of the initial state of the field in the cavity. We find a counterintuitive influence of the initial entanglement between cavity modes on the spatial entanglement which is revealed by dividing the cavity in half.

To this end, we consider the spin-boson model with a cold reservoir, accounting for the exact time-dependent correlations between the system and the bath to study the exchange of information and heat. We use an information theoretic measure of the relevant memory effects and demonstrate that the information backflow from the reservoir to the system does not necessarily correlate with the backflow of heat. We also examine the influence of temperature and coupling strength on the loss and gain of information between the system and the bath. Finally, we discuss how additional driving changes the backflow of information, giving rise to potential applications in reservoir engineering.

In this case, we consider a complex linear quantum system plant consisting of a network of quantum harmonic oscillators. Conditions are given for which there exists a direct coupling observer which estimates a collection of variables in the quantum plant. It is shown that the order of the observer can be the same as the number of variables to be estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced order observer.

abstract: This paper surveys some recent results on the theory of quantum linear systems and presents them within a unified framework. Quantum linear systems are a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of quantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described or approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities, beam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical squeezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum technology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new challenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error correction, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom lasers, and superconducting quantum circuits. A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear systems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear system. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent quantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum information, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This paper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal controllers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An important issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems and in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of physical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given set of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of quantum mechanics.

abstract: In this contribution a geometric approach to describe a rotating fullerene molecule with Ih symmetry is developed. We analyze the quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in continuum limit considering a description of fullerene in a spherical solution of the G\"odel-type space-time with a topological defect. As a result, we study the molecule in a rotating frame. Also we combine the well know non-Abelian monopole approach with this geometric description, including the case of the presence of the external Aharonov-Bohm flux. The energy levels and the persistent current for this study are obtained, and we show that they depend on the geometrical and topological properties of the fullerene. Also, we verify recovering of the well known results for limiting cases.

abstract: Slowing/stopping the light travelling in free space with electromagnetically induced transparency to im- plement the optical quantum information processings and store information has been paid much attention in recent years. For the waveguide photons, here, we propose an approach to stop them with a controllable atomic cavity generated by a pair of atomic mirrors; one of them reflects the photon completely and an- other one with the adjustable reflected/transmitted probability of the photons. Based on the full quantum mechanical theory in real space, we show that the reflected/transmitted probability of the waveguide photon with a fixed frequency can be controlled by adjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e., atomic mirrors). As a consequence, the photon can be controllably transmitted/reflected along the waveguide by the aside atomic mirrors with the adjustable atomic energy levels. Ideally, the photons could be stopped in the atomic cavity. This provides a novel mechanism to stop/retravel the waveguide photon in a controllable ways. The feasibility of the proposal with the current integrated optical devices is also discussed.

abstract: The resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) technique is an important approach to increasing the detection efficiency (DE) of typical free-space coupling photons. Here, we show that such a technique can also be utilized to increase the detection probability (DP) of a single waveguide-coupled photon. Based on a fully quantum mechanical theory in real space, we exactly calculated the absorption probability of a single photon for a two-level detector next to the waveguide. We find that the DP of the waveguide photon for the detector in a waveguide-coupled ring cavity is significantly higher than that for the bare detector directly coupled to the photon. Physically, the DP of the photon for the bare detector next to the waveguide is always limited by the finite transmission and reflection probabilities of the photon. The cavity technique is used to store the photon and thus increase its DP. The feasibility of the proposal with current integrated optical devices is then discussed.

abstract: In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.

abstract: We analyze the asymptotic scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for quantum walks on a line. In contrast to the classical random walk there is no connection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay constant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering the initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse power-law behaviour.

abstract: We present an error correcting protocol that enhances the lifetime of stabilizer code based qubits which are susceptible to the creation of pairs of localized defects (due to string-like error operators) at finite temperature, such as the toric code. The primary tool employed is dynamic application of a local, unitary operator which exchanges defects and thereby translates localized excitations. Crucially, the protocol does not require any measurements of stabilizer operators, and therefore can be used to enhance the lifetime of a qubit in the absence of such experimental resources.

abstract: NOON states play the important roles in quantum information processings and quantum metrology, but the fidelities of these states generated previously are limited typically by the practically-unavoidable decoherence and operational imperfections. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to generate photonic NOON states alternatively by rapid population passage technique via shortcut to adiabaticity (STA), rather than the usual Rabi oscillations. Since the deterministic population passages based on the STAs are insensitive to details of the operations and can be implemented as fast as the Rabi oscillations, the fidelity of the generated NOON state could be satisfactorily high. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit QED systems by rapidly driving two artifical qutrits.

abstract: Any tripartite state which saturates the strong subadditivity relation for the quantum entropy is defined as the Markov state.A tripartite pure state describing an open system, its environment and their purifying system isa pure Markov state iff the bipartite marginal state of purifying system and environment is a product state. It has been shown that as long as the purification of the input system-environment state is a pure Markov state the reduced dynamics of the open system can be described, on the support of initial system state, by a quantum channel for every joint unitary evolution of the system-environment composite even in the presence of initial correlations. Entanglement, discord and classical correlations of the initial system-environment states implied by the pure Markov state are analyzed and it has been shown that all these correlations are entirely specified by the entropy of the environment. Some implications concerning perfect quantum error correction procedure and quantum Markovian dynamics are presented.

abstract: We report the dissemination of an ultrastable optical frequency signal to two distant users simultaneously using a branching network. The ultrastable signal is extracted along a main fibre link; it is optically tracked with a narrow-linewidth laser diode, which light is injected in a secondary link. The propagation noise of both links is actively compensated. We implement this scheme with two links of 50-km fibre spools, the extraction being setup at the mid-point of the main link. We show that the extracted signal at the end of the secondary link exhibits fractional frequency instability of 1.4x10-15 at 1-s measurement time, almost equal to the 1.3x10-15 instability of the main link output end. The long-term instabilities are also very similar, at a level of 3-5x10-20 at 3x104-s integration time. We also show that the setting up of this extraction device, or a simpler one, at the main link input, can test the proper functioning of the noise rejection on this main link. This work is a significant step towards a robust and flexible ultra-stable network for multi-users dissemination.

When we consider light as a quantum mechanical object, new ways of information processing become possible. In this review I give an overview how quantum information processing can be implemented with single photons, and what hurdles still need to be overcome to implement the various applications in practice. I will place special emphasis on the quantum mechanical properties of light that make it different from classical light, and how these properties relate to quantum information processing tasks.

abstract: Adiabatic evolution is a powerful technique in quantum information and computation. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different models to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The first model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation, introduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In addition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary $n$-qubit {\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\it state} teleportation. In the second model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show how we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this task can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. These two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the superadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time intervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost necessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.

abstract: Quantum steering is observed when performing appropriate local measurements on an entangled state. Here we discuss the possibility of simulating classically this effect, using classical communication instead of entanglement. We show that infinite communication is necessary for exactly simulating steering for any pure entangled state, as well as for a class of mixed entangled states. Moreover, we discuss the communication cost of steering for general entangled states, as well as approximate simulation. Our findings reveal striking differences between Bell nonlocality and steering, and provide a natural way of measuring the strength of the latter.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the communication cost of reproducing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering correlations arising from bipartite quantum systems. We characterize the set of bipartite quantum states which admits a local hidden state model augmented with $c$ bits of classical communication from an untrusted party (Alice) to a trusted party (Bob). In case of one bit of information ($c=1$), we show that this set has a nontrivial intersection with the sets admitting a local hidden state and a local hidden variables model for projective measurements. On the other hand, we find that an infinite amount of classical communication is required from an untrusted Alice to a trusted Bob to simulate the EPR steering correlations produced by a two-qubit maximally entangled state. It is conjectured that a state-of-the-art quantum experiment would be able to falsify two bits of communication this way.

abstract: We study the angular deflection of the circular polarized components of a linearly polarized probe field in a weakly birefringent atomic system in tripod configuration. A spatially inhomogeneous control field incident obliquely onto an atomic vapor cell facilitates a large angular divergence between circular components. We show that the angular resolution can be dynamically controlled by optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse profile of the control beam. For instance, by employing a Laguerre-Gaussian profile of the control field, one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular components close to the entry face of the atomic vapor cell. We further demonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the probe field, thereby acting as a convex or a concave lens with multiple foci. The absorption in the medium remains negligible at resonance as a cumulative effect of coherent population oscillations (CPO) and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).

abstract: We report on an optimal single-electron charge qubit for a solid-state double quantum dot (DQD) system and analyse its dynamics under a time-dependent linear detuning, using GPU accelerated numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The optimal qubit is found to have basis states defined as the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest energy bonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge qubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this choice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap with an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not localised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires a particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial fiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$. We determine this sequence using pulses that incorporate the expected experimental finite rise times. We also show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere using spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at most two single pulses. Measurement of the optimal qubits is achieved by determining the probability of finding the electron in one of the dots.

abstract: We theoretically studied the implementation of a quantum memory and an optical transistor in a system composed by a single atom trapped inside a high finesse cavity. In order to store and map the quantum state of an input pulse onto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out as an optical transistor) where the information can be transferred to the dark state of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a {\Lambda}-type configuration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the control field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and retrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was obtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by input-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and ii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and commonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best configuration for the optical transistor, the maximum quantum memory efficiency can not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50% for symmetric cavities. On the other hand, with single-sided cavity the quantum memory efficiency increases considerably and can reach values close to 100% in the strong atom-field coupling regime. However this specific setup is not favourable to observe the cavity-EIT effect in the transmission spectrum and then it is not appropriate to control the transmission of light pulses.

abstract: This work aims at understanding the interplay between the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), initial state independent equilibration and quantum chaos in systems that do not have a direct classical counterpart. It is based on numerical investigations of asymmetric Heisenberg spin ladders with varied interaction strengths between the legs, i.e., along the rungs. The relaxation of the energy difference between the legs is investigated. Two different parameters, both intended to quantify the degree of accordance with the ETH, are computed. Both indicate violation of the ETH at large interaction strengths but at different thresholds. Indeed the energy difference is found not to relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction strength which coincides with one of the thresholds. At the same point the level statistics shift from Poisson-type to Wigner-type. Hence the system may be considered to become integrable again in the strong interaction limit.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the decoherence patterns of a topological qubit made of two Majorana zero modes in the generic linear and circular motions in the Minkowski spacetime. We show that the reduced dynamics is exact without Markov approximation. Our results imply that the acceleration will cause thermalization as expected by Unruh effect. However, for the short-time scale, we find the rate of decoherence is anti-correlated with the acceleration, as kind of decoherence impedance. This is in fact related to the "anti-Unruh" phenomenon previously found by studying the transition probability of Unruh-DeWitt detector. We also obtain the information backflow by some time modulations of coupling constant or acceleration, which is a characteristic of the underlying non-Markovian reduced dynamics. Moreover, by exploiting the nonlocal nature of the topological qubit, we find that some incoherent accelerations of the constituent Majorana zero modes can preserve the coherence instead of thermalizing it.

abstract: Photons mediate long-range optomechanical forces between atoms in high finesse resonators, which can induce the formation of ordered spatial patterns. When a transverse laser drives the atoms, the system undergoes a second order phase transition, that separates a uniform spatial density from a Bragg grating maximizing scattering into the cavity and is controlled by the laser intensity. Starting from a Fokker-Planck equation describing the semiclassical dynamics of the $N$-atom distribution function, we systematically develop a mean-field model and analyse its predictions for the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The validity of the mean-field model is tested by comparison with the numerical simulations of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation and by means of a BBGKY hierarchy. The mean-field theory predictions well reproduce several results of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation for sufficiently short times, and are in good agreement with existing theoretical approaches based on field-theoretical models. Mean-field, on the other hand, predicts thermalization time scales which are at least one order of magnitude shorter than the ones predicted by the $N$-body dynamics. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the mean-field ansatz discards the effects of the long-range incoherent forces due to cavity losses.

abstract: Multiple-degrees-of-freedom free-space communication combining polarization and high-order spatial modes promises high-capacity communication channel. While high-order spatial modes have been widely exploited for dense coding and high-dimensional quantum information processing, the properties of polarization preservation of high-order spatial beams propagating in turbulent atmosphere have not been comprehensively investigated yet. Here we focus on the properties of polarization preservation of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating along different atmospheric turbulence paths. The analytical expressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been derived. It is shown that the larger the coherence length is, and the larger the beam order m, n are, the less the polarization is changed. We find that the evolution properties of the polarization in slant-down paths through turbulent atmosphere are similar to the case in free space if the condition zenith angle {\xi}<{\pi}/4 is satisfied. While at a long propagation distance, evolution properties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs much from that in free space and in slant paths. The results may allow one to choose the optimal propagation path in terms of specific applications, which is helpful for future experimental implementation of multiple-degrees-of-freedom free-space communication.

abstract: Recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has instigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including near-field radiative heat transfer and many-body dynamics in trapped ultracold atoms and ions. Born-Markov and local thermal equilibrium are two of the most widely used approximations for describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems. The impact of these approximations on dispersion forces, e.g. Casimir-Polder interactions and quantum friction, has often been largely underestimated. Using general theoretical arguments and exactly solvable models, we show that these approximations can lead to erroneous predictions of fluctuation-induced interactions with regard to both strength and functional dependencies on system parameters.

We show a relation between the pre- and post- gauging models and use this to construct short range entangled phases with fractal like symmetries, one of which is mapped to the cubic code by the gauging.

abstract: Using a graphical presentation of the spin $S$ one dimensional Valence Bond Solid (VBS) state, based on the representation theory of the $SU(2)$ Lie-algebra of spins, we compute the spectrum of a mixed state reduced density matrix. This mixed state of two blocks of spins $A$ and $B$ is obtained by tracing out the spins outside $A$ and $B$, in the pure VBS state density matrix. We find in particular that the negativity of the mixed state is non-zero only for adjacent subsystems. The method introduced here can be generalized to the computation of entanglement properties in Levin-Wen models, that possess a similar algebraic structure to the VBS state in the groundstate.

The corresponding quantum phase diagrams are obtained by means of a variational procedure. Both configurations exhibit normal and collective (super-radiant) regimes. While the latter in the $\lambda$-configuration divides itself into $2$ subregions, corresponding to each of the modes, that in the $N$-configuration may be divided into $2$ or $3$ subregions depending on whether the field modes divide the atomic system into $2$ separate subsystems or not. Our variational procedure compares well with the exact quantum solution. The properties of the relevant field and matter observables are obtained.

abstract: We study Bell nonlocality in the one-sided device-independent framework native of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. We derive a closed-form necessary and sufficient criterion for systems composed of a qubit and an untrusted black-box device to violate -- under general dichotomic measurements on the qubit -- a generic Bell inequality from a very broad family of linear inequalities with arbitrarily many outputs for the untrusted device and inputs for both parties. The optimal quantum measurements for maximal violation are also obtained. For 2 inputs and 2 outputs per user, our criterion becomes necessary and sufficient for Bell nonlocality. Furthermore, in that setting, its form generalizes recently obtained steering inequalities, which allows us to provide useful feedback from nonlocality to the detection of steering. Finally, our results are directly generalizable to multipartite scenarios. Our findings constitute a powerful tool for the study of the interplay between EPR steering and Bell nonlocality, with applications expected in the near future.

abstract: Coherence vectors and correlation matrices are important functions frequently used in physics. The numerical calculation of these functions directly from their definitions, which involves Kronecker products and matrix multiplications, may appear to be a reasonable option. Notwithstanding, as we show in this article, some algebraic manipulations before programming can reduce considerably their computational complexity. Besides, we provide Fortran code to generate generalized Gell Mann matrices and to compute the optimized and unoptimized versions of the associated coherence vectors and correlation matrix, in the case of bipartite quantum systems. As a code test and application example, we consider the calculation of Hilbert-Schmidt quantum discords.

abstract: If a quantum channel is commutable with a certain set of operators, a Choi state of the channel becomes a sufficient resource for any entanglement generation achieved by a single use of the channel with the help of local operation and classical communications (LOCC). This property, called the teleportation stretchable, could be useful to determine an upper bound of a fundamental rate-loss trade-off for optical quantum key distribution. Unfortunately, the known formulation of the teleportation-stretching expansion for lossy Gaussian channels is based on an additional assumption of the Choi state with infinite energy. In this paper, we present an entanglement-assisted LOCC protocol with a bounded energy entangled state, and identify a resource state being sufficient for a general entanglement generation protocol through a single use of lossy Gaussian channels. We also extend this protocol for the cases of general single-mode Gaussian channels. Our results provide a regular path to determine an ultimate limit of quantum communication.

abstract: It is shown that violation of the Born Rule leads to a breakdown of the correspondence between the quantum electromagnetic field and its classical counterpart. Specifically, the relationship of the quantum coherent state to the classical electromagnetic field turns out to imply that if the Born Rule were violated, this could result in apparent deviations from the energy conservation law applying to the field and its sources (Poynting's Theorem). The result suggests that the Born Rule is just as fundamental a law of Nature as are the conservation laws.

abstract: We show that the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological insulators can be modified in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We consider a one-dimensional tight-binding model with gain and loss as well as long-range hopping. The system is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that encircles an exceptional point in momentum space. The winding number has a fractional value of 1/2. There is only one dynamically stable zero-energy edge state due to the defectiveness of the Hamiltonian. This edge state is robust to disorder due to protection by a chiral symmetry. We also discuss experimental realization with arrays of coupled resonator optical waveguides.

abstract: Rare earth ions have exceptionally long coherence times, making them an excellent candidate for quantum information processing. A key part of this processing is quantum state transfer. We demonstrate that high fidelity quantum state transfer between two ensembles of rare earth ions can be achieved by time reversing the connecting optical quantum channel, and suggest using a gradient echo memory to perform this time reversal. We demonstrate that the superradiant coupling between the ensemble of ions and an intermediate cavity coupled to the optical channel can lead to higher transfer fidelities than would otherwise be possible with an individual ion. We suggest increasing the size of the ensemble can overcome unwanted loss processes that reduce the transfer fidelity.

abstract: The past decade has seen great advances in developing color centers in diamond for sensing, quantum information processing, and tests of quantum foundations. Increasingly, the success of these applications as well as fundamental investigations of light-matter interaction depend on improved control of optical interactions with color centers -- from better fluorescence collection to efficient and precise coupling with confined single optical modes. Wide ranging research efforts have been undertaken to address these demands through advanced nanofabrication of diamond. This review will cover recent advances in diamond nano- and microphotonic structures for efficient light collection, color center to nanocavity coupling, hybrid integration of diamond devices with other material systems, and the wide range of fabrication methods that have enabled these complex photonic diamond systems.

abstract: In a recent work, Moshkovitz [FOCS '14] presented a transformation on two-player games called "fortification", and gave an elementary proof of an (exponential decay) parallel repetition theorem for fortified two-player projection games. In this paper, we give an analytic reformulation of Moshkovitz's fortification framework, which was originally cast in combinatorial terms. This reformulation allows us to expand the scope of the fortification method to new settings. First, we show any game (not just projection games) can be fortified, and give a simple proof of parallel repetition for general fortified games. Then, we prove parallel repetition and fortification theorems for games with players sharing quantum entanglement, as well as games with more than two players. This gives a new gap amplification method for general games in the quantum and multiplayer settings, which has recently received much interest. An important component of our work is a variant of the fortification transformation, called "ordered fortification", that preserves the entangled value of a game. The original fortification of Moshkovitz does not in general preserve the entangled value of a game, and this was a barrier to extending the fortification framework to the quantum setting.

abstract: We demonstrate stable control of a massive oscillator's displacement response to an applied force, an important step towards reveling the quantum behavior of massive objects. In this technique, a suspended mirror is optically trapped via a detuned cavity, and its dissipation is controlled by electrical active feedback on an another mirror, which generates damping forces on the target mirror through optical rigidity. We experimentally demonstrate the technique with a 5-mg suspended mirror, which is a part of a triangular optical cavity. The observed enhancement of the pendulum's resonant frequency is from 2.14 Hz to 1.06 kHz, and the lowest temperature achieved is 15 mK. Using this technique we demonstrate reduction of the thermal decoherence rate, i.e. the inverse time of the absorption of a phonon from the thermal environment, of 60-fold from its bare value.

abstract: In physics, we are supposed to learn from experiments what constitutes a good/correct theoretical/mathematical model of any physical concept, and our physical space should not be an exception. The best picture of the physical space, in Newtonian physics, is given by the configuration space of a free particle. The space, as well as the phase space, can be constructed as a representation space of the relativity symmetry. Starting with the corresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the construction of a quantum space along the lines of the quantum phase space and demonstrate the retrieval of the classical picture as an approximation through the contraction of the (relativity) symmetry and the representations of it. The result suggests a picture of the physical space beyond that of a finite dimensional manifold.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.05402
abstract: This paper studies the stochastic differential equation (SDE) associated to a quantum system subject to Hamiltonian evolution as well as unmonitored and monitored decoherence channels. The latter imply a stochastic evolution of the quantum state (density operator), whose associated probability distribution we characterize. We show that for two sets of typical experimental settings, corresponding either to weak quantum non demolition measurements or to weak fluorescence measurements, the three Bloch coordinates of a two-level quantum system (qubit) remain in fact confined to a deterministically evolving surface or curve inside the Bloch sphere. We explicitly solve the deterministic evolution, and we provide a closed-form expression for the probability distribution on this surface or curve. Finally, we relate the existence in general of such deterministically evolving submanifolds to an accessibility question of control theory, which can be answered with an explicit algebraic criterion on the SDE. This allows us to show that, for a qubit, the above two sets of weak qubit measurements are essentially the only ones featuring deterministic surfaces or curves.

abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general techniques for quantum computing, both of which are described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolutions by Schr\"odinger's equation. In the former, the Hamiltonian is fixed, while in the latter, the Hamiltonian varies with time. As a result, their formulations of Grover's algorithm evolve differently through Hilbert space. We show that this difference is fundamental; they cannot be made to evolve along each other's path without introducing structure more powerful than the standard oracle for unstructured search. For an adiabatic quantum evolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm, it must interpolate between three fixed Hamiltonians, one of which is complex and introduces structure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Conversely, for a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm, it must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted, directed star graph with structure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Thus the two techniques, although similar in being described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolution, compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means.

abstract: We report on the first observation of stationary light pulses and narrowband light storage inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Laser-cooled atoms were first loaded into the fiber core providing strong light-matter coupling. Light pulses were then stored in a collective atomic excitation using a single control laser beam. By applying a second counterpropagating control beam, a light pulse could be brought to a standstill. Our work paves the way towards the creation of strongly-correlated many-body systems with photons and applications in the field of quantum information processing.

abstract: We show through the Choi matrix approach that the effect of Unruh acceleration on a qubit is similar to the interaction of the qubit with a vacuum bath, despite the finiteness of the Unruh temperature. Thus, rather counterintuitvely, from the perspective of decoherence in this framework, the particle experiences a vacuum bath with a temperature-modified interaction strength, rather than a thermal bath. We investigate how this "relativistic decoherence" is modified by the presence of environmentally induced decoherence, by studying the degradation of quantum information, as quantified by parameters such as nonlocality, teleportation fidelity, entanglement, coherence and quantum measurement-induced disturbance (a discord-like measure). Also studied are the performance parameters such as gate and channel fidelity. We highlight the distinction between dephasing and dissipative environmental interactions, by considering the actions of quantum non-demolition and squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels, respectively, where, in particular, squeezing is shown to be a useful quantum resource.

abstract: In a quantum system with d-dimensional Hilbert space, the Q-function of a Hermitian positive semide?nite operator ?, is de?ned in terms of the d2 coherent states in this system. The Choquet integral CQ of the Q-function, is introduced using a ranking of the values of the Q-function, and Mobius transforms which remove the overlaps between coherent states. It is a ?gure of merit of the quantum properties of Hermitian operators, and it provides upper and lower bounds to various physical quantities in terms of the Q-function. Comonotonicity is an important concept in the formalism, which is used to formalize the vague concept of physically similar operators. Comonotonic operators are shown to be bounded, with respect to an order based on Choquet integrals. Applications of the formalism to the study of the ground state of a physical system, are discussed. Bounds for partition functions, are also derived.

abstract: When searching for a marked vertex in a graph, Szegedy's usual search operator is defined by using the transition probability matrix of the random walk with absorbing barriers at the marked vertices. Instead of using this operator, we analyze searching with Szegedy's quantum walk by using reflections around the marked vertices, that is, queries. We show we can boost the probability to 1 of finding a marked vertex in the complete graph. Numerical simulations suggests that the success probability can be improved for other graphs, like the two-dimensional grid. We also prove that, for a certain class of graphs, we can express Szegedy's search operator, obtained from the absorbing walk, using the query model.

abstract: An optical chopper periodically interrupts a classical light beam. We propose a realizable quantum version of the optical chopper, where the time-periodic driving of the light-matter coupling is achieved through a nonlinear three wave mixing element. We theoretically investigate how our scheme can be used for the controllable shaping of few photon light. Using Floquet dynamics, we find strong periodic modulations of the transmission and reflection envelopes in the scattered few-photon pulses, including photon compression and blockade, as well as dramatic changes in the quantum light statistics. Our theoretical analysis allows us to explain these non-trivial phenomena as arising from non-adiabatic memory effects.

abstract: We construct a practical method for finding optimal Gaussian probe states for the estimation of parameters encoded by Gaussian unitary channels. This method can be used for finding all optimal probe states, rather than focussing on the performance of specific states as shown in previous studies. As an example, we apply this method to find optimal probes for the channel that combines the phase-change and squeezing channels, and for generalized two-mode squeezing and mode-mixing channels. The method enables a comprehensive study of temperature effects in Gaussian parameter estimation. It has been shown that the precision in parameter estimation using single mode states can be enhanced by increasing the temperature of the probe. We show that not only higher temperature, but also larger temperature differences between modes of two-mode probe states can enhance the estimation precision.

abstract: Electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling is a ground-state cooling technique for trapped particles. EIT offers a broader cooling range in frequency space compared to more established methods. In this work, we experimentally investigate EIT cooling in strings of trapped atomic ions. In strings of up to 18 ions, we demonstrate simultaneous ground state cooling of all radial modes in under 1 ms. This is a particularly important capability in view of emerging quantum simulation experiments with large numbers of trapped ions. Our analysis of the EIT cooling dynamics is based on a novel technique enabling single-shot measurements of phonon numbers, by rapid adiabatic passage on a vibrational sideband of a narrow transition.

abstract: Memoryless time evolutions are ubiquitous in nature but often correspond to a resolution-induced approximation, i.e. there are correlations in time whose effects are undetectable. Recent advances in the dynamical control of small quantum systems provide the ideal scenario to probe some of these effects. Here we experimentally demonstrate the precise induction of memory effects on the evolution of a quantum coin (qubit) by correlations engineered in its environment. In particular, we design a collisional model in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and precisely control the strength of the effects by changing the degree of correlation in the environment and its time of interaction with the qubit. We also show how these effects can be hidden by the limited resolution of the measurements performed on the qubit. The experiment reinforces NMR as a test bed for the study of open quantum systems and the simulation of their classical counterparts.

Our architecture relies upon ion transport and can readily be expanded to larger systems. The algorithm is demonstrated using two- and three-ion chains. For three ions, an improvement is achieved compared to a classical system using the same number of oracle queries. For two ions and one query, we correctly determine an unknown bit string with probability 97.6(8)%. For three ions, we succeed with probability 80.9(3)%.

abstract: Using quantum devices supported by classical computational resources is a promising approach to quantum-enabled computation. One example of such a hybrid quantum-classical approach is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) built to utilize quantum resources for the solution of eigenvalue problems and optimizations with minimal coherence time requirements by leveraging classical computational resources. These algorithms have been placed among the candidates for first to achieve supremacy over classical computation. Here, we provide evidence for the conjecture that variational approaches can automatically suppress even non-systematic decoherence errors by introducing an exactly solvable channel model of variational state preparation. Moreover, we show how variational quantum-classical approaches fit in a more general hierarchy of measurement and classical computation that allows one to obtain increasingly accurate solutions with additional classical resources. We demonstrate numerically on a sample electronic system that this method both allows for the accurate determination of excited electronic states as well as reduces the impact of decoherence, without using any additional quantum coherence time or formal error correction codes.

abstract: The recently reported violation of a Bell inequality using entangled electronic spins in diamonds (Hensen et al., Nature 526, 682-686) provided the first loophole-free evidence against local-realist theories of nature. Here we report on data from a second Bell experiment using the same experimental setup with minor modifications. We find a violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality of $2.35 \pm 0.18$, in agreement with the first run, yielding an overall value of $S = 2.38 \pm 0.14$. We calculate the resulting $P$-values of the second experiment and of the combined Bell tests. We provide an additional analysis of the distribution of settings choices recorded during the two tests, finding that the observed distributions are consistent with uniform settings for both tests. Finally, we analytically study the effect of particular models of random number generator (RNG) imperfection on our hypothesis test. We find that the winning probability per trial in the CHSH game can be bounded knowing only the mean of the RNG bias, implying that our experimental result is robust for any model underlying the estimated average RNG bias.

abstract: We propose a method to detect genuine quantum correlation for multi-qubit pure states. We then derive a complementarity relations for pure quantum states of N qubits. We prove that in all many-qubit systems there exist strict monogamy laws for quantum correlations. On the other hand, it is known that the entanglement monogamy equality proposed by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters is in general not true for multiqubit states. Inducing from the CKW equality, we find a proper form of entanglement monogamy equality for arbitrary quantum states. The total quantum correlation of qubit k with the remaining qubits Rk can be characterizes. Furthermore, the quantum correlation of qubit mn with the remaining qubits Rmn can also be obtained. Furthermore, some monogamy relations have been obtained.

In particular, there is great interest to realize scalable solid state platforms that can emit triggered photons on demand to achieve scalable nanophotonic networks. We report on a visible-spectrum single photon emitter in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC). The emitter is photostable at room- and low-temperature enabling photon counts per second (cps) in excess of 2$\times$10$^6$ from unpatterned, bulk SiC. It exists in two orthogonally polarized states, which have parallel absorption and emission dipole orientations. Low temperature measurements reveal a narrow zero phonon line (linewidth $<0.1~$nm) that accounts for $>30~$% of the total photoluminescence spectrum.

abstract: The products of weak values of quantum observables are shown to be of value in deriving quantum uncertainty and complementarity relations, for both weak and strong measurement statistics. First, a 'product representation formula' allows the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation to be derived from a classical uncertainty relation for complex random variables. We show this formula also leads to strong uncertainty relations for unitary operators, and underlies an interpretation of weak values as optimal (complex) estimates of quantum observables. Furthermore, the two system observables that are weakly and strongly measured in a weak measurement context are shown to obey a complementarity relation under the interchange of these observables, in the form of an upper bound on the product of the corresponding weak values. Moreover, general tradeoff relations, between weak purity, quantum purity and quantum incompatibility, and also between weak and strong joint probability distributions, are obtained based on products of real and imaginary components of weak values, where these relations quantify the degree to which weak probabilities can take anomalous values in a given context.

abstract: The passive states of a quantum system minimize the average energy among all the states with a given spectrum. We prove that they are the optimal inputs of a large class of lossy quantum channels, in the sense that the output generated by a passive state is still passive and majorizes (i.e. it is less noisy than) the output generated by any other state with the same spectrum. This is an extension of De Palma et al. [arXiv:1511.00293], where the same result is proved for one-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. We also prove that for finite temperature this optimality property can fail already in a two-level system, where the best input is a coherent superposition of the two energy eigenstates.

abstract: The existence of non-local quantum correlations is certainly the most important specific property of the quantum world. However, it is a challenging task to distinguish correlations of classical origin from genuine quantum correlations, especially when the system involves more than two parties, for which different partitions must be simultaneously considered. In the case of mixed states, intermediate levels of correlations must be introduced, coined by the name inseparability. In this work, we revisit in more detail such a concept in the context of continuous-variable quantum optics. We consider a six-partite quantum state that we have effectively generated by the parametric downconversion of a femtosecond frequency comb, the full 12 x 12 covariance matrix of which has been experimentally determined. We show that, though this state does not exhibit "genuine entanglement", it is undoubtedly multipartite-entangled. The consideration of not only the entanglement of individual mode-decompositions but also of combinations of those solves the puzzle and exemplifies the importance of studying different categories of multipartite entanglement.

abstract: We consider a mechanical resonator made of diamond, which contains a nitrogen-vacancy center (NV center) locating at the end of the oscillator. A second order magnetic gradient is applied and inducing coupling between mechanical modes and the NV center. By applying proper external magnetic field, the energy difference between NV center electron spin levels can be tuned to match the energy difference between two mechanical modes $a$ and $b$. A laser is used for continuously initializing the NV center electron spin. The mode $a$ with lower frequency is driven by a thermal bath. We find that the temperature of the mode $b$ is significantly cooled when the heating bath temperature is increased. We discuss the conditions that quantum regime cooling requires, and confirm the results by numerical simulation. Finally we give the intuitive physical explanation on this unusual effect.

abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, that is, a combined parity and time-reversal symmetry is a key milestone for non-Hermite systems exhibiting entirely real eigenenergy. In the present work, motivated by a recent experiment, we study $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks. We present the explicit definition of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by employing a concept of symmetry time frames. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition so that the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks retains $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model depend on position. It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded in the time-evolution operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the non-unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

abstract: We present a multi-step quantum algorithm for solving the $3$-bit exact cover problem, which is one of the NP-complete problems. In this algorithm, the clauses of the boolean formula are applied sequentially to project out the state that satisfies the clauses. In each round of the algorithm, the state that satisfies the clauses can be obtained and verified in finite number of trials. The runtime of the algorithm is proportional to the number of clauses, therefore scales polynomial to the size of the problem. Our results indicate that quantum computers may be able to outperform classical computers in solving NP-complete problems.

abstract: In analogy with usual Anderson localization taking place in time-independent disordered quantum systems where the disorder acts in configuration space, systems exposed to temporally disordered potentials can display Anderson localization in the time domain. We demonstrate this phenomenon with one-dimensional examples where a temporally disordered potential induces localization during the quantum evolution of wave-packets, in contrast with a fully delocalized classical dynamics. This is an example of a time crystal phenomenon, i.e., a crystalline behavior in the time domain.

abstract: We present a platform for the simulation of quantum magnetism with full control of interactions between pairs of spins at arbitrary distances in one- and two-dimensional lattices. In our scheme, two internal atomic states represent a pseudo-spin for atoms trapped within a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). With the atomic transition frequency aligned inside a band gap of the PCW, virtual photons mediate coherent spin-spin interactions between lattice sites. To obtain full control of interaction coefficients at arbitrary atom-atom separations, ground-state energy shifts are introduced as a function of distance across the PCW. In conjunction with auxiliary pump fields, spin-exchange versus atom-atom separation can be engineered with arbitrary magnitude and phase, and arranged to introduce non-trivial Berry phases in the spin lattice, thus opening new avenues for realizing novel topological spin models. We illustrate the broad applicability of our scheme by explicit construction for several well known spin models.

abstract: We calculate the first two moments and full probability distribution of the work performed on a system of bosonic particles in a two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian when the self-interaction term is varied instantaneously or with a finite-time ramp. In the instantaneous case, we show how the irreversible work scales differently depending on whether the system is driven to the Josephson or Fock regime of the bosonic Josephson junction. In the finite-time case, we use optimal control techniques to substantially decrease the irreversible work to negligible values. Our analysis can be implemented in present-day experiments with ultracold atoms and we show how to relate the work statistics to that of the population imbalance of the two modes.

abstract: We propose a method to create higher orbital states of ultracold atoms in the Mott regime of an optical lattice. This is done by periodically modulating the position of the trap minima (known as shaking) and controlling the interference term of the lasers creating the lattice. These methods are combined with techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As an example of this, we show specifically how to create an anti-ferromagnetic type ordering of angular momentum states of atoms. The specific pulse sequences are designed using Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants and a four-level model for each well. The results are compared with numerical simulations of the full Schroedinger equation.

abstract: We construct explicit codes for transmitting classical or quantum information over the thermal-noise Bosonic Gaussian channel. For classical information transmission, our codes achieve the classical capacity, recently characterized by Giovannetti et al. [Nature Photonics 8, 796 (2014)], while in the quantum case they transmit at a rate given by the Gaussian coherent information. The construction is based on concatenating polar codes with a suitable discretization of the channel input into a finite "constellation" of coherent states. The codes have efficient encoders, but the complexity of decoding is unknown. Our results are based on a quantum version of Wu and Verd\'u's technique of determining the achievable rates of finite constellations for the classical Gaussian-noise channel [Allerton 2010, pp. 620].

abstract: It is assumed that in a measurement the system under study interacts with a macroscopic measuring apparatus, in such a way that the density matrix of the measured system evolves according to the Lindblad equation. Under an assumption of non-decreasing von Neumann entropy, conditions on the operators appearing in this equation are given that are necessary and sufficient for the late-time limit of the density matrix to take the form appropriate for a measurement. Where these conditions are satisfied, the Lindblad equation can be solved explicitly. The probabilities appearing in the late-time limit of this general solution are found to agree with the Born rule, and are independent of the details of the operators in the Lindblad equation.

abstract: The finite-time operation of a quantum heat engine that uses a single particle as a working medium generally increases the output power at the expense of inducing friction that lowers the cycle efficiency. We propose to scale up a quantum heat engine utilizing a many-particle working medium in combination with the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity to boost the nonadiabatic performance by eliminating quantum friction and reducing the cycle time. To this end, we first analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of a quantum Otto cycle implemented with a quantum fluid confined in a time-dependent harmonic trap. We show that nonadiabatic effects can be controlled and tailored to match the adiabatic performance using a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As a result, the nonadiabatic dynamics of the scaled-up many-particle quantum heat engine exhibits no friction and the cycle can be run at maximum efficiency with a tunable output power. We demonstrate our results with a working medium consisting of particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions, that includes noninteracting and hard-core bosons as limiting cases.

abstract: An information theoretical model for quantum secret sharing was introduced by A. C. A. Nascimento et al.[Quantum Inf. Comput. Vol.5,1,205,68-79(2003)], which was analyzed by quantum information theory. In this paper, we analyze this information theoretical model using the properties of the quantum access structure. By the analysis we propose a generalized model definition for the quantum secret sharing schemes. In our model, there are more quantum access structures which can be realized by our generalized quantum secret sharing schemes than those of the previous one. In addition, we also analyse two kinds of important quantum access structures to illustrate the existence and rationality of the generalized quantum secret sharing schemes and consider the security of the scheme by simple examples.

Our construction can be seen as an improvement on previous results in that it requires only a single prover, who is restricted to measuring qubits in the $X$ or $Z$ basis, while requiring only one way communication, from the prover to the verifier. We also show similar constant round protocols with purely classical verifiers are not possible, unless BQP is contained in the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.

abstract: Two dimensional tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states (PEPS) are generally hard to contract. This is arguably the main reason why variational tensor network methods in 2D are still not as successful as in 1D. However, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network represents a gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many constraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new approach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS tensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to estimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network around the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier to do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a semi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the expectation value. We test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the expectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision, even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.

abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled, AME, states are pure multipartite states that, when half or more of the sites are traced out, the maximum entropy mixed state is obtained. AME states have been studied in a number of papers and found applications in fields like teleportation or quantum secret sharing, and provide links between different areas of mathematics, like coding theory, orthogonal arrays, quantum error correcting codes, combinatorial designs or multiunitary matrices. In this paper, the existence of absolutely maximally entangled states of minimal support is found for certain values of the number of sites and of the local dimension. A negative result is also proved, that shows that a known necessary condition for the existence of those AME states is not sufficient

abstract: In a circuit consisting of two or more resonators, the inter-cavity crosstalk is inevitable, which could create some problems, such as degrading the performance of quantum operations and the fidelity of various quantum states. The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in large-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network consisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2N resonators of different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system (qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an effective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators.~The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of inter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of different frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is virtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This effective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with photonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR pairs of photonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that it is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of four one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

abstract: In this paper we intend to discuss the importance of providing a physical representation of quantum superpositions which goes beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and measurement outcomes. This proposal goes in the opposite direction of the orthodox project which attempts to "bridge the gap" between the quantum formalism and common sense "classical reality" --precluding, right from the start, the possibility of interpreting quantum superpositions through non-classical notions. We will argue that in order to restate the problem of interpretation of quantum mechanics in truly ontological terms we require a radical revision of the problems and definitions addressed within the orthodox literature. On the one hand, we will discuss the need of providing a formal redefinition of superpositions which captures their contextual character. On the other hand, we attempt to replace the focus on the measurement problem, which concentrates on the justification of measurement outcomes from "weird" superposed states, and introduce the superposition problem which concentrates instead on the conceptual representation of superpositions themselves. In this respect, after presenting three necessary conditions for objective physical representation, we will provide arguments which show why the classical (actualist) representation of physics faces severe difficulties to solve the superposition problem. Finally, we will also argue that, if we are willing to abandon the (metaphysical) presupposition according to which 'Actuality = Reality', then there is plenty of room to construct a conceptual representation for quantum superpositions.

The reflection and transmission coefficients are analytically obtained. Then, the correlations between the potential parameters and the reflection-transmission coefficients are investigated, and a transmission resonance condition is derived. Occurrence of the transmission resonance has been shown when incident energy of the particle is equal to one of the resonance energies of the quasi-bound states.

We construct the maximal number of such bases for the 4 and 2 dimensional subspaces while proving the nonexistence of such a construction for the 3 dimensional case. We also provide the average fidelity for estimating any of such a transformation and show that it is equal to the case for estimating a completely unknown unitary from $\text{SU}(2)$.

We discover that the average position $\bar{x}=\max(\bar{x})\cos(\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi)$, with coin operator $U(\alpha,\pi/4,\gamma)$ and initial state $\mid\Phi_{0}(\pi/4,\phi,\varphi)\rangle=(e^{i\phi}\mid0L\rangle+e^{i\varphi}\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2$. If we set initial state and coin operator to $\mid\Phi_{0}\rangle(\theta,\pi/2,0)=i\cos\theta\mid0L\rangle+\sin\theta\mid0R\rangle)$ and coin operator $U(0,\pi/4,0)$, for $\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi=\pi/2$, we discover that $\bar{x}=-\max(\bar{x})\cos(2\theta).$ Last we verify the result above, and obtain the summarize properties of quantum walks with an arbitrary state. We get that $\bar{x}(\theta,\phi,\varphi,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,t)=\cos2\theta*\bar{x}_{|0L\rangle}(\beta,t)+\sin2\theta*\cos(\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi)*\bar{x}_{(\mid0L\rangle+\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2}(\alpha=\gamma=0,\beta,t)$. If the average positions $\bar{x}$ with initial state $|0L\rangle$ and $\mid\Psi_{0}\rangle=(\mid0L\rangle+\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2$ and coin operator $U(0,\beta,0)$ are known, we can get the average position result of quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state and a U(2) coin operator.

abstract: Machine learning is a fascinating and exciting field within computer science. Recently, this excitement has been transferred to the quantum information realm. Currently, all proposals for the quantum version of machine learning utilize the finite-dimensional substrate of discrete variables. Here we generalize quantum machine learning to the more complex, but still remarkably practical, infinite-dimensional systems. We present the critical subroutines of quantum machine learning algorithms for an all-photonic continuous-variable quantum computer that achieve an exponential speedup compared to their equivalent classical counterparts. Finally, we also map out an experimental implementation which can be used as a blueprint for future photonic demonstrations.

abstract: We study a range of radio-frequency ion trap geometries and investigate the effect of integrating dielectric cavity mirrors on their trapping potential. We aim to identify ion trap and cavity configurations that are best suited for achieving small cavity volumes and thus large ion-photon coupling as required for scalable quantum information networks. In particular, we investigate the trapping potential distortions caused by the dielectric material of the cavity mirrors for different mirror orientations with respect to the trapping electrodes, as well as for mirror misalignment. We also analyze the effect of the mirror material properties such as dielectric constants and surface conductivity, and study the effect of surface charges on the mirrors. The smallest trapping potential distortions are found if the cavities are aligned along the major symmetry axis of the electrode geometries. These cavity configurations also appear to be the most stable with respect to any mirror misalignment.

In our scheme, local operations make use of the strong dipole-dipole interaction between Rydberg excitations, which give rise to fast and reliable quantum operations involving all atoms in the ensemble. The necessary entanglement between distant ensembles is mediated by single-photon quantum channels and collectively enhanced light-matter couplings. These techniques can be used to create the recently proposed quantum clock network based on neutral atom optical clocks. We specifically analyze a possible realization of this scheme using neutral Yb ensembles.

abstract: Single photon sources based on spontaneous photon-pair generation have enabled pioneering experiments in quantum optics. However, their non-determinism presents a bottleneck to scaling up photonic and hybrid quantum-enhanced technologies. Furthermore, photon pairs are typically emitted into many correlated frequency modes, producing an undesirable mixed state on heralding. Here we present a complete fibre-integrated heralded single photon source that addresses both these difficulties simultaneously. We use active switching to provide a path to deterministic operation by multiplexing separate spontaneous sources, and dispersion engineering to minimise frequency correlation for high-purity single photon generation. All the essential elements -- nonlinear material with dispersion control, wavelength isolation, optical delay, and fast switching -- are incorporated in a low-loss alignment-free package that heralds photons in telecoms single-mode fibre. Our results demonstrate a scalable approach to delivering pure single photons directly into guided-wave photonic devices.

Two (primary and auxiliary) time scales are particularly identified in the strong-coupling regime where the open system and its environment are strongly interacted with evident non-Markovianity being revealed. The new method provides acceptable approximation compared with traditional perturbation methods for generically structured reservoirs and indicates correct oscillatory and decay behaviors, helping us to recognize non-Markovianity in a perturbative way.

abstract: It is generally assumed that on-off detectors with single-photon sensitivity cannot distinguish coherent states from phase-mixed coherent states without some form of quadrature-based tomography. Here, we show that it is theoretically possible to distinguish these states without quadrature-based methods by comparing the vacuum probability of one output port of a variable beam splitter (VBS) that has two different phase-mixed coherent states as its inputs to the well-known case of dual coherent-state inputs. As an application, a method is proposed to test whether a laser field is in a coherent state over a given time by simply measuring the VBS output populations with an on-off single-photon detector. Unfortunately, timing limitations of present technology prohibit such simple tests, but the technique may become practical in the future.

abstract: This dissertation reports our investigation into the existence of anyons, which interpolate between bosons and fermions, in light of the Symmetrization Postulate, which states that only the two extremes exist. The Symmetrization Postulate can be understood as asserting that there are only two consistent ways of combining the behavior of distinguishable particles to obtain the behavior of identical ones. We showed that anyonic behavior then arises because of the way in which the probability amplitudes of distinguishable particles in two dimensions are affected by the topology of the space. These can then be combined in one of the ways arising from the Symmetrization Postulate, to form identical anyons. Therefore, anyons do not invalidate the Symmetrization Postulate, but are entirely compatible with it. In order to show that anyons can arise without particle identity, we investigated how distinguishable particles can gain particular properties from the topology of their configuration space. We managed to do so, and in the process, discovered a novel approach for quantizing multiply-connected spaces, in a way that is more suited to anyons than the standard approach.

abstract: One of the most difficult problems in quantum mechanics is the analysis of the measurement processes. In this paper, we point out that many of these difficulties originate from the different roles of measurement outcomes and observable quantities, which cannot simply be identified with each other. Our analysis shows that the Hilbert space formalism itself describes a fundamental separation between quantitative properties and qualitative outcomes that needs to be taken into account in an objective description of quantum measurements. We derive fundamental relations between the statistics of measurement outcomes and the values of physical quantities that explain how the objective properties of a quantum system appear in the context of different measurement interactions. Our results indicate that non-classical correlations can be understood in terms of the actual role of physical properties as quantifiable causes of the external effects observed in a quantum measurement.

abstract: A fundamental property of any quantum device is its communication capacity, i.e. the maximal amount of information that can be reliably conveyed per single use in the asymptotic limit. For quantum measurements, this quantity is equivalent to the informational power, that is the maximal amount of information that can be conveyed through a single use. Here, we operationally introduce mixed quantum t designs as the most general arbitrary-rank extension of projective quantum t designs which preserves indistinguishability from the uniform distribution for t copies, and we quantify the communication capacity of mixed quantum t measurements. Our result is twofold. First, we derive upper bounds on the communication capacity of any mixed t design measurement, for 1 <= t <= 5. Second, we explicitly compute the capacity of several mixed t designs measurements, including the depolarized version of: any qubit and qutrit symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) measurement and complete mutually unbiased bases (MUB), the qubit icosahedral measurement, the Hoggar SIC measurement, and the uniform distribution over pure states, for any value of the depolarizing parameter.

abstract: In this paper we consider quantum walks whose evolution converges to the Dirac equation one in the limit of small wave-vectors. We show exact Fast Fourier implementation of the Dirac quantum walks in one, two and three space dimensions. The behaviour of particle states, defined as states smoothly peaked in some wave-vector eigenstate of the walk, is described by an approximated dispersive differential equation that for small wave-vectors gives the usual Dirac particle and antiparticle kinematics. The accuracy of the approximation is provided in terms of a lower bound on the fidelity between the exactly evolved state and the approximated one. The jittering of the position operator expectation value for states having both a particle and an antiparticle component is analytically derived and observed in the numerical implementations.

abstract: An {\it exact} quantum algorithm requires its output to be correct certainly, and this kind of algorithms has been studied mostly in the query model since the discoveries of Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the solution of Simon's problem. In this article, we prove the optimal exact quantum query complexity for a generalized Deutsch-Jozsa problem and characterize the symmetrically partial Boolean functions in terms of exact quantum query complexity. More specifically, (1) we give an optimal exact quantum query algorithm with complexity $k+1$ for computing the symmetrically partial Boolean function $DJ_n^k$ defined as: $DJ_n^k(x)=1$ for $|x|=n/2$, $DJ_n^k(x)=0$ for $|x|$ in the set $\{0, 1,\ldots, k, n-k, n-k+1,\ldots,n\}$, and it is undefined for the rest cases, where $n$ is even, $|x|$ is the Hamming weight of $x$. The case of $k=0$ is the well-known Deutsch-Jozsa problem. (2) We prove that any symmetrically partial Boolean function $f$ has exact quantum 1-query complexity if and only if $f$ can be computed by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. (3) We also discover the optimal exact quantum 2-query complexity for solving a variant of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, i.e. distinguishing between inputs of Hamming weight $\{ \lfloor n/2\rfloor, \lceil n/2\rceil \}$ and Hamming weight in the set $\{ 0, n\}$ for all odd $n$. We further discuss the optimal exact quantum algorithms for distinguishing between inputs of two different Hamming weights $k$ and $l$. (4) We provide an algorithm to determine the degree of any symmetrically partial Boolean function.

abstract: Quantum work is usually determined from two projective measurements of the energy at the beginning and at the end of a thermodynamic process. However, this paradigm cannot be considered thermodynamically consistent as it does not account for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this conceptual inconsistency we introduce a novel paradigm that relies only on the expected change of the average energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In particular, we completely omit quantum measurements in the definition of quantum work, and hence quantum work is identified as a thermodynamic quantity of only the system. As main results we derive a modified quantum Jarzynski equality and a sharpened maximum work theorem in terms of the information free energy. Comparison of our results with the standard approach allows to quantify the informational cost of projective measurements.

abstract: In this work we extend the discussion that was began in the Ref. [A. L. de Paula Jr., J. G. G. de Oliveira Jr., J. G. Peixoto de Faria, Dagoberto S. Freitas and M. C. Nemes, {\it Phys. Rev.} {\bf A89}, (2014) 022303] to deal with the dynamics of the concurrence of a many-body system. In that previous paper, the discussion was focused in the residual entanglement between the partitions of the system. The purpose of the present contribution is to shed some light on the dynamical properties of entanglement among the environment oscillators. We consider a system consisting of a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to N others and solve the corresponding dynamical problem analytically. We divide the environment in arbitrary two partitions and the entanglement dynamics between any of these partitions is quantified and it shows that in the case that excitations in each partitions are equal, the concurrence reaches the value one and the two partition of the environment are maximally entangled. For long times the excitations of the main oscillator are completely transferred to environment and the environment oscillators are found entangled.

abstract: The photon-photon scattering in vacuum is extremely weak. However, strong effective interactions between single photons can be realized by employing strong light-matter coupling. These interactions are a fundamental building block for quantum optics, bringing many-body physics to the photonic world and providing important resources for quantum photonic devices and for optical metrology. In this Colloquium, we review the physics of strongly-interacting photons in one-dimensional systems with no optical confinement along the propagation direction. We focus on two recently-demonstrated experimental realizations: (i) superconducting qubits coupled to open transmission lines, and (ii) interacting Rydberg atoms in a cold gas. Advancements in the theoretical understanding of these systems are presented in complementary formalisms and compared to experimental results. The experimental achievements are summarized alongside of a systematic description of the quantum optical effects and quantum devices emerging from them.

abstract: We propose a microwave frequency single photon transistor which can operate under continuous wave probing, and represents an efficient single microwave photon detector. It can be realized using an impedance matched system of a three level artificial ladder-type atom coupled to two microwave cavities connected to input/output waveguides. Using classical drive on the upper transition, we find the parameter space where a single photon control pulse incident on one of cavities can be fully absorbed into hybridized excited states. This subsequently leads to series of quantum jumps in the upper manifold and the appearance of a photon flux leaving the second cavity through a separate input/output port. The proposal does not require time variation of the probe signals, thus corresponding to a passive version of single photon transistor. The resulting device is robust to qubit dephasing processes, possesses low dark count rate, and can be readily implemented using current technology.

abstract: Quantum key distribution can be enhanced and extended if nonclassical single-photon states of light are used. We study a connection between the security of quantum key distribution and quantum non-Gaussianity of light arriving at the receiver's detection system in three different realistic models for discrete-variable quantum key distribution schemes. We show that while quantum nonclassicality exhibited by the light arriving at the receiver's station is a necessary condition for the security of all the analyzed models, quantum non-Gaussianity becomes a sufficient condition for their security. Therefore, checking for non-Gaussianity of this light by performing standard autocorrelation function measurement can be used for prior verification of the usability of prepare-and-measure DV QKD schemes. It can play similar role to the prior verification of the quantum correlations sufficient to violate Bell inequalities for entanglement-based protocols.

abstract: A specific algebraic coupling model involving multiple quantization axes is presented in which previously indistinguishable SU(2) symmetry groups become distinguishable when coupled into a SU(3) group structure. The model reveals new intrinsic angular momentum (or isospin) eigenvectors whose structural symmetries are detailed, some of which are not available for groups having only one quantization axis available for configurations. Additionally, an intrinsic cyclic ordering of the quantization axes and internal geometric phase relations between the basis states naturally fall out from the algebraic properties of the group. The nature of the coupling into a SU(3) symmetry group also allows for the definition of both positive and negative basis states along each quantization axis relative to the center of the group. These basis states configurations mimic those observed in color-charge and electroweak theories.

abstract: Satellites carrying sources of entangled photons could establish a global quantum network, enabling private encryption keys between any two points on Earth. Despite numerous proposals, demonstration of space-based quantum systems has been limited due to the cost of traditional satellites. We are using very small spacecraft to accelerate progress. We report the in-orbit operation of a photon pair source aboard a 1.65 kg nanosatellite and demonstrate pair generation and polarization correlation under space conditions. The in-orbit photon correlations exhibit a contrast of 97+/-2%, matching ground-based tests. This pathfinding mission overcomes the challenge of demonstrating in-orbit performance for the components of future entangled photon experiments. Ongoing operation establishes the in-orbit lifetime of these critical components. More generally, this demonstrates the ability for nanosatellites to enable faster progress in space-based research.

abstract: We have proposed a scheme of the generation and preservation of two-qubit steady state quantum correlations through quantum channels where successive uses of the channels are correlated. Different types of noisy channels with memory, such as amplitude damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels have been taken into account. Some analytical or numerical results are presented. The effect of channels with memory on dynamics of quantum correlations has been discussed in detail. The results show that, steady state entanglement between two independent qubits without entanglement subject to amplitude damping channel with memory can be generated. Besides, we compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum discord when a two-qubit system is prepared in an entangled state. We show that entanglement dynamics suddenly disappears, while quantum discord displays only in the asymptotic limit. Two-qubit quantum correlations can be preserved at a long time in the limit of $\mu\rightarrow1$.

abstract: It is well known that random bipartite pure states are typically maximally entangled within an arbitrarily small error. Showing that the marginals of random bipartite pure states are typically extremely close to the maximally mixed state, is a way to prove the above. However, a more direct way to prove the above is to estimate the distance of random bipartite pure states from the set of maximally entangled states. Here, we find the average distance between a random bipartite pure state and the set of maximally entanglement states as quantified by three different quantifiers of the distance and investigate the typical properties of the same. We then consider random pure states of a single quantum system and give an account of the typicality of the average $l_1$ norm of coherence for these states scaled by the maximum value of the $l_1$ norm of coherence. We also calculate the variance of the $l_1$ norm of coherence of random pure states to elaborate more on the typical nature of the scaled average $l_1$ norm of coherence. Moreover, We compute the distance of a random pure state from the set of maximally coherent states and obtain the average distance.

abstract: A ${\cal PT }$-symmetric model for three interacting wave guides is investigated. Each wave guide is represented by an attractive $\delta$-function potential being in equidistant positions. The two outer potentials are complex describing loss and gain, respectively. The real parts of the outer potentials are assumed to be equal. The major focus of the study lies on the occurrence of an exceptional point of third order and the physical effects of such singularity. While some results resemble those from similar studies with two wave guides, the three wave guides appear to have a richer structure. Emphasis is placed on the fine tuning in the approach of the EP3 as this appears to be a particular challenge for an experimental realization.

abstract: We provide a description of the problem of the discrimination of two quantum states in terms of receiver operation characteristics analysis, a prevalent approach in classical statistics. Receiveroperation characteristics diagrams provide an expressive representation of the problem, in which quantities such as the fidelity and the trace distance also appear explicitly. In addition we introduce an alternative quantum generalization of the classical Bhattacharyya coefficient. We evaluate our quantum Bhattacharyya coefficient for certain situations and describe some of its properties. These properties make it applicable as another possible quantifier of the similarity of quantum states.

Extending our method to multi-photon levels, a scalable Grover search can be realized with novel fabrication designs.

abstract: A key task in quantum computation is the application of a sequence of gates implementing a specific unitary operation. However, the decomposition of an arbitrary unitary operation into simpler quantum gates is a nontrivial problem. Here we propose a general and robust protocol to decompose any target unitary into a sequence of Pauli rotations. The procedure involves identifying a commuting subset of Pauli operators having a high trace overlap with the target unitary, followed by a numerical optimization of their corresponding rotation angles. The protocol is demonstrated by decomposing several standard quantum operations. The applications of the protocol for quantum state preparation and quantum simulations are also described. Finally, we describe an NMR experiment implementing a three-body quantum simulation, wherein the above decomposition technique is used for the efficient realization of propagators.

abstract: In the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle, the position and momentum operators obey the modified commutation relation $[X,P]=i\hbar\left(1+\beta P^2\right)$ where $\beta$ is the deformation parameter. Since the validity of the uncertainty relation for the Shannon entropies proposed by Beckner, Bialynicki-Birula, and Mycieslki (BBM) depends on both the algebra and the used representation, we show that using the formally self-adjoint representation, i.e., $X=x$ and $P=\tan\left(\sqrt{\beta}p\right)/\sqrt{\beta}$ where $[x,p]=i\hbar$, the BBM inequality is still valid in the form $S_x+S_p\geq1+\ln\pi$ as well as in ordinary quantum mechanics. We explicitly indicate this result for the harmonic oscillator in the presence of the minimal length.

abstract: We observe and study the phenomenon of Anderson localization in a system of true quantum kicked rotors. Nitrogen molecules in a supersonic molecular jet are cooled down to 27~K and are rotationally excited by a periodic train of 24~high-intensity femtosecond pulses. Exponential distribution of the molecular angular momentum - the most unambiguous signature of Anderson localization - is measured directly by means of coherent Raman scattering. We demonstrate the suppressed growth of the molecular rotational energy with the number of laser kicks and study the dependence of the localization length on the kick strength. Both timing and amplitude noise in the pulse train is shown to destroy the localization and revive the diffusive growth of angular momentum.

abstract: We report the experimental point-by-point sampling of the Wigner function for nonclassical states created in an ultrafast pulsed type-II parametric down-conversion source. We use a loss-tolerant time-multiplexed detector based on a fiber-optical setup and a pair of photon-number-resolving avalanche photodiodes. By capitalizing on an expedient data-pattern tomography, we assess the properties of the light states with outstanding accuracy. The method allows us to reliably infer the squeezing of genuine two-mode states without any phase reference.

abstract: Interference between independent single photons is perhaps the most fundamental interaction in quantum optics. It has become increasingly important as a tool for optical quantum information science, as one of the rudimentary quantum operations, together with photon detection, for generating entanglement between non-interacting particles. Despite this, demonstrations of large-scale photonic networks involving more than two independent sources of quantum light have been limited due to the difficulty in constructing large arrays of high-quality single photon sources. Here, we solve the key challenge, reporting a novel array of more than eighteen near-identical, low-loss, high-purity, heralded single photon sources achieved using spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) on a silica chip. We verify source quality through a series of heralded Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments, and further report the experimental three-photon extension of the entire Hong-Ou-Mandel interference curves, which map out the interference landscape between three independent single photon sources for the first time.

abstract: We study a quantum algorithm that consists of a simple quantum Markov process, and we analyze its behavior on restricted versions of Quantum 2-SAT. We prove that the algorithm solves this decision problem with high probability for n qubits, L clauses, and promise gap c in time O(n^2 L^2 c^{-2}). If the Hamiltonian is additionally polynomially gapped, our algorithm efficiently produces a state that has high overlap with the satisfying subspace. The Markov process we study is a quantum analogue of Sch\"oning's probabilistic algorithm for k-SAT.

abstract: From Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80(1998)4999] one knows that the quantum states secretly chosen from a certain set can be probabilistically cloned with positive cloning efficiencies if and only if all the states in the set are linearly independent. In this paper, we focus on the probabilistic quantum cloning (PQC) of linearly dependent states with nonnegative cloning efficiencies. We show that a linearly independent subset of the linearly dependent quantum states can be probabilistically cloned if and only if any one state in the subset can not be expressed as the linear superposition of the other states in the set. The optimal possible cloning efficiencies are also investigated.

abstract: The one- and two-photon scattering matrix S is obtained analytically for a one-dimensional waveguide a point-like scatterer with N excited levels (generalized V -type atom). We compute the two photon resonance fluorescence. We argue that a two-photon input state contains sufficient information to distinguish between different level structures which are equivalent for single-photon scattering, such as an atom with N = 2 excited levels and two two-level systems (2LS). Finally, we find two-photon Electromagnetic Induced Transparency (EIT), where the nonlinear part of the two-photon scattering matrix vanishes as each incident photon fulfills single-photon EIT conditions.

abstract: We present two results which combined enable one to reliably detect multimode, multipartite entanglement in the presence of measurement errors. The first result leads to a method to compute the best (approximated) physical covariance matrix given a measured non-physical one. The other result states that a widely used entanglement condition is a consequence of negativity of partial transposition. Our approach can quickly verify entanglement of experimentally obtained multipartite states, which is demonstrated on several realistic examples. Compared to existing detection schemes, ours is very simple and efficient. In particular, it does not require any complicated optimizations.

abstract: Quantum coherent feedback control is a measurement-free control method fully preserving quantum coherence. In this paper we show how time-delayed quantum coherent feedback can be used to control the degree of squeezing in the output field of a cavity containing a degenerate parametric oscillator. We focus on the specific situation of Pyragas-type feedback control where time-delayed signals are fed back directly into the quantum system. Our results show how time-delayed feedback can enhance or decrease the degree of squeezing as a function of time delay and feedback strength.

abstract: Nanomechanical resonators strongly coupled to the electromagnetic field are a promising resource for quantum-limited mass and force sensors, and as transducers for coupling otherwise incompatible quantum systems such as microwave and optical photons. In particular, suspended nanomem-branes obtained by chemical release of a high-tensile stress layer are an advantageous platform for such transducers, combining an extremely high mechanical quality factor and a low mass. We demonstrate the successful implementation of a photonic-crystal reflector on a high-tensile stress $Si\_3N\_4$ nanomembrane, enabling its direct coupling to a high-finesse optical cavity. This approach is particularly well suited for hybrid opto-electro-mechanical transducers, where the membrane motion is simultaneously coupled to an optical and a microwave cavity. We provide an illustration of the physical process underlying the high reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the photonic-crystal membrane inside a high-finesse cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.79 $\pm$ 0.02%, and show that the material absorption is not the main source of optical losses.

Motivated by the complete population inversion effect of zero-area pulses found in [1], we consider a scheme where a given coupling function is transformed to a zero-area coupling by performing phase-jump in the middle of the evolution. We also derive a universal formula for the effect of the phase-jump.

abstract: We investigate the maximum rates for transmitting quantum information, distilling entanglement and distributing secret keys between a sender and a receiver in a multipoint communication scenario, with the assistance of unlimited two-way classical communication involving all parties. First we consider the case where a sender communicates with an arbitrary number of receivers, so called quantum broadcast channel. Here we also provide a simple analysis in the bosonic setting where we consider quantum broadcasting through a sequence of beamsplitters. Then, we consider the opposite case where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with a single receiver, so called quantum multiple-access channel. Finally, we study the general case of a quantum interference channel where an arbitrary number of senders communicate with an arbitrary number of receivers. Since our bounds are formulated for quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, they can be applied to many different physical scenarios involving multipoint quantum communication.

abstract: This article sets up a new formalism to investigate stochastic thermodynamics of out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, where stochasticity primarily comes from quantum measurement. In the absence of any bath, we define a purely quantum component to heat exchange, that corresponds to energy fluctuations induced by measurement back-action. By providing a central position to quantum measurement, our formalism bridges the gap between quantum optics and quantum thermodynamics: Thermal signatures of measurement induced irreversibility are identified in a simple implementation of Jarzynski equality, while quantum thermodynamics sheds new light on textbook paradoxical trajectories in quantum optics.

abstract: Equidistant and non-equidistant single pulse "bang-bang" dynamical controls are investigated in the context of mean ergodic theorems. We show the requirements in which the limit of infinite pulse control for both the equidistant and the non-equidistant dynamical control converges to the same unitary evolution. It is demonstrated that the generator of this evolution can be obtained by projecting the generator of the free evolution onto the commutant of the unitary operator representing the pulse. Inequalities are derived to prove this statement and in the case of non-equidistant approach these inequalities are optimised as a function of the time intervals.

abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) superconducting microwave cavities with large mode volumes typically have high quality factors ($>10^6$). This is due to a reduced sensitivity to surface dielectric losses, which is the limiting source of dissipation in two-dimensional transmission line resonators. In recent years, 3D microwave cavities have been extensively used for coupling and interacting with superconducting quantum bits (qubits), providing a versatile platform for quantum information processing and hybrid quantum systems. A current issue that has arisen is that 3D superconducting cavities do not permit magnetic field control of qubits embedded in these cavities. In contrast, microwave cavities made of normal metals can be transparent to magnetic fields, but experience a much lower quality factor ($\sim 10^4$), which negates many of the advantages of the 3D architecture. In an attempt to create a device that bridges a gap between these two types of cavities, having magnetic field control and high quality factor, we have created a hybrid 3D cavity. This new cavity is primarily composed of aluminium but also contains a small copper insert. We measured the internal quality factor of the hybrid cavity to be $102000$, which is an order of magnitude improvement over all previously tested copper cavities. An added benefit to that our hybrid cavity possesses is that it also provides an improved thermal link to the sample that superconducting cavities alone cannot provide. In order to demonstrate precise magnetic control within the cavity, we performed spectroscopy of three superconducting qubits placed in the cavity, where individual control of each qubit's frequency was exerted with small wire coils attached to the cavity. A large improvement in quality factor and magnetic field control makes this 3D hybrid cavity an attractive new platform for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments.

abstract: This thesis reports advances in the theory of design, characterization and simulation of multi-photon multi-channel interferometers. I advance the design of interferometers through an algorithm to realize an arbitrary discrete unitary transformation on the combined spatial and internal degrees of freedom of light. This procedure effects an arbitrary $n_{s}n_{p}\times n_{s}n_{p}$ unitary matrix on the state of light in $n_{s}$ spatial and $n_{p}$ internal modes. I devise an accurate and precise procedure for characterizing any multi-port linear optical interferometer using one- and two-photon interference. Accuracy is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision are attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to a curve simulated using measured source spectra. The efficacy of our characterization procedure is verified by numerical simulations. I develop group-theoretic methods for the analysis and simulation of linear interferometers. I devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson realizations of the canonical SU$(n)$ basis states, which reduce the canonical subgroup chain, for arbitrary $n$. The boson realizations are employed to construct $\mathcal{D}$-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary irreducible representations, of SU$(n)$ in the canonical basis. I show that immanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum of the diagonal $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$-functions of group element $\Omega$ over $t$ determined by the choice of submatrix and over the irrep $(\lambda)$ determined by the immanant under consideration. The algorithm for $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ $\mathcal{D}$-function computation and the results connecting these functions with immanants open the possibility of group-theoretic analysis and simulation of linear optics.

abstract: Understanding the resource consumption in distributed scenarios is one of the main goals of quantum information theory. A prominent example for such a scenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge their parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging, entanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum operations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments show that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is reasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local operations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of incoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to local incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are quantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for studying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While quantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply that no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time. We also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and show that the bound is tight for all pure states. Our results also lead to an incoherent version of Schumacher compression: in this case the compression rate is equal to the von Neumann entropy of the diagonal elements of the corresponding quantum state.

abstract: Phonon blockade is a purely quantum phenomenon, analogous to Coulomb and photon blockades, in which a single phonon in an anharmonic mechanical resonator can impede the excitation of a second phonon. We propose an experimental method to realize phonon blockade in a driven harmonic nanomechanical resonator coupled to a qubit, where the coupling is proportional to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$. This is in contrast to the standard realizations of phonon and photon blockade effects in Kerr-type $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear systems. The nonlinear coupling strength can be adjusted conveniently by changing the coherent drive field.As an example, we apply this model to predict and describe phonon blockade in a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a Cooper-pair box (i.e., a charge qubit) with a linear longitudinal coupling. By obtaining the solutions of the steady state for this composite system, we give the conditions forobserving strong antibunching and sub-Poissonian phonon-number statistics in this induced second-order nonlinear system. Besides using the qubit to produce phonon blockade states, the qubit itself can also be employed to detect blockade effects by measuring its states. Numerical simulations indicate that the robustness of the phonon blockade, and the sensitivity of detecting it, will benefit from this strong induced nonlinear coupling.

abstract: Quantum key distribution using three states in equiangular configuration combines a security threshold comparable with the one of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol and a quantum bit error rate (QBER) estimation that does not need to reveal part of the key. We implement an entanglement-based version of the Renes 2004 protocol, using only passive optic elements in a linear scheme for the measurement POVM, generating an asymptotic secure key rate of more than 10 kbit/s, with a mean QBER of 1.6%. We then demonstrate its security in the case of finite key and evaluate the key rate for both collective and general attacks.

Our derivation is based on the work of Moller, who pointed out that, in special relativity, a particle with spin must always have a finite extension. We generalize Mollers classical result to the quantum regime and show that it leads to a new contribution to the energy, which is the special relativistic interaction term.

abstract: Quantum walks (QWs) describe particles evolving coherently on a lattice. The internal degree of freedom corresponds to a Hilbert space, called coin system. We consider QWs on Cayley graphs of some group $G$. In the literature, investigations concerning infinite $G$ have been focused on graphs corresponding to $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$ with coin system of dimension 2, whereas for one-dimensional coin (so called scalar QWs) only the case of finite $G$ has been studied. Here we prove that the evolution of a scalar QW with $G$ infinite Abelian is trivial, providing a thorough classification of this kind of walks. Then we consider the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$, that is the unique non-Abelian group $G$ containing a subgroup $H\cong\mathbb{Z}$ with two cosets. We characterize the class of QWs on the Cayley graphs of $D_\infty$ and, via a coarse-graining technique, we show that it coincides with the class of spinorial walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfies parity symmetry. This class of QWs includes the Weyl and the Dirac QWs. Remarkably, there exist also spinorial walks that are not coarse-graining of a scalar QW, such as the Hadamard walk.

abstract: We study the problem of compilation of quantum algorithms into optimized physical-level circuits executable in a quantum information processing (QIP) experiment based on trapped atomic ions. We report a complete strategy: starting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program, we compile it into a high-level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages of decomposition into progressively lower-level circuits until we reach the physical execution-level specification. We skip the fault-tolerance layer, as it is not necessary in this work. The different stages are structured so as to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account numerous optimization criteria, including minimizing the number of expensive two-qubit gates, minimizing the number of less expensive single-qubit gates, optimizing the runtime, minimizing the overall circuit error, and optimizing classical control sequences. Our approach allows a trade-off between circuit runtime and quantum error, as well as to accommodate future changes in the optimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated improvements in the physical-level control of the experiment.

abstract: The recent maturation of hybrid quantum devices has led to significant enhancements in the functionality of a wide variety of quantum systems. In particular, harnessing mechanical resonators for manipulation and control has expanded the use of two-level systems in quantum information science and quantum sensing. In this letter, we report on a monolithic hybrid quantum device in which strain fields associated with resonant vibrations of a diamond cantilever dynamically control the optical transitions of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect center in diamond. We quantitatively characterize the strain coupling to the orbital states of the NV center, and with mechanical driving, we observe NV-strain couplings exceeding 10 GHz. Furthermore, we use this strain-mediated coupling to match the frequency and polarization dependence of the zero-phonon lines of two spatially separated and initially distinguishable NV centers. The experiments demonstrated here mark an important step toward engineering a quantum device capable of realizing and probing the dynamics of non-classical states of mechanical resonators, spin-systems, and photons.

abstract: We study a general double Dirac delta potential to show that this is the simplest yet versatile solvable potential to introduce double wells, avoided crossings, resonances and perfect transmission ($T=1$). Perfect transmission energies turn out to be the critical property of symmetric and anti-symmetric cases wherein these discrete energies are found to correspond to the eigenvalues of Dirac delta potential placed symmetrically between two rigid walls. For well(s) or barrier(s), perfect transmission [or zero reflectivity, $R(E)$] at energy $E=0$ is non-intuitive. However, earlier this has been found and called "threshold anomaly". Here we show that it is a critical phenomena and we can have $ 0 \le R(0)<1$ when the parameters of the double delta potential satisfy an interesting condition. We also invoke zero-energy and zero curvature eigenstate ($\psi(x)=Ax+B$) of delta well between two symmetric rigid walls for $R(0)=0$. We resolve that the resonant energies and the perfect transmission energies are different and they arise differently.

abstract: In two recent papers (Phys. Rev. A90 (2014), 062121 and Phys. Rev. A91 (2015), 052110) an interesting method of analyzing the breaking of Bell inequalities has been proposed which is based on the theory of finite group representations. We apply here this method to more complicated example of $S_4$ symmetry. We show how the Bell inequality can be related to the symmetries of regular tetrahedron. By choosing the orbits of threedimensional representation of $S_4$ determined by the geometry of tetrahedron we find that the Bell inequality under consideration is broken in quantum theory. The corresponding nonlocal game is analyzed.

abstract: We discuss the energetic cost of superadiabatic models of quantum computation. Specifically, we investigate the energy-time complementarity in general transitionless controlled evolutions and in shortcuts to the adiabatic quantum search over an unstructured list. We show that the additional energy resources required by superadiabaticity for arbitrary controlled evolutions can be minimized by using probabilistic dynamics, so that the optimal success probability is fixed by the choice of the evolution time. In the case of analog quantum search, we show that the superadiabatic approach induces a non-oracular counter-diabatic Hamiltonian, with the same energy-time complexity as equivalent adiabatic implementations.

abstract: We examine two proposals for marginally self-correcting quantum memory, the cubic code by Haah and the welded code by Michnicki. In particular, we prove explicitly that they are absent of topological order above zero temperature, as their Gibbs ensembles can be prepared via a short-depth quantum circuit from classical ensembles. Our proof technique naturally gives rise to the notion of free energy associated with excitations. Further, we develop a framework for an ergodic decomposition of Davies generators in CSS codes which enables formal reduction to simpler classical memory problems. We then show that memory time in the welded code is doubly exponential in inverse temperature via the Peierls argument. These results introduce further connections between thermal topological order and self-correction from the viewpoint of free energy and quantum circuit depth.

abstract: A new scenario for energy distribution, security and shareability is presented that assumes the availability of quantum information heat engines and a thermal bath. It is based on the convertibility between entropy and work in the presence of a thermal reservoir. Our approach to the informational content of physical systems that are distributed between users is complementary to the conventional perspective of quantum communication. The latter places the value on the unpredictable content of the transmitted quantum states, while our interest focuses on their certainty. Some well-known results in quantum communication are reused in this context. Particularly, we describe a way to securely distribute quantum states to be used for unlocking energy from thermal sources. We also consider some multi-partite entangled and classically correlated states for a collaborative multi-user sharing of work extraction possibilities.

abstract: We provide examples where Simon's algorithm can be used to show insecurity of cryptographic symmetric-key primitives in a post-quantum setting. Specifically, these examples consist of a quantum distinguisher for the 3-round Feistel Network and a forgery attack on CBC-MAC which forges a tag for a chosen-prefix message querying only other messages (of the same length). We assume that an adversary has quantum-oracle access to the respective classical primitives. These results shed new light on the post-quantum security of commonly used cryptoschemes.

abstract: Quantum steering is a relatively simple test for quantumness of correlations, proving that the values of quantum-mechanical measurement outcomes come into being only in the act of measurement. By exploiting quantum correlations Alice can influence -- steer -- Bob's physical system in a way inaccessible in classical world, leading to violation of some inequalities. Demonstrating this and similar quantum effects for systems of increasing size, approaching even the classical limit, is a long-standing challenging problem. Here we provide experimentally feasible signature of unbounded violation of a steering inequality. We derive its universal form where tolerance for measurement-setting-errors is explicitly build-in by means of the Deutsch-Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation. Then, generalizing the mutual unbiasedness, we apply the inequality to the multi-singlet and multi-particle bipartite Bell-state. However, the method is general and opens the possibility of employing multi-particle bipartite steering for randomness certification and development of quantum technologies, e.g.\ random access codes.

This scheme combines the technique of spectral engineering of biphotons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the technique of spectrally resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We characterized the comb-like spectral correlation structures of the qudits by time of arrival measurement and correlated spectral intensity measurement. The generation and distribution of the distinct entangled frequency modes may be useful for quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, quantum remote synchronization, as well as fundamental test of stronger violation of local realism.

abstract: Machine learning applications are limited by computational power. In this paper, we gain novel insights into the application of quantum annealing (QA) to machine learning (ML) through experiments in natural language processing (NLP), seizure prediction, and linear separability testing. These experiments are performed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared to an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an early implementation of a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer, via resampling and ensembling of predicted probabilities to produce a more robust class estimator. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, resampled QBoost (RQBoost) is tested across several datasets and compared to QBoost and traditional ML. We show and explain how QBoost in combination with a commercial QA device are unable to perfectly separate binary class data which is linearly separable via logistic regression with shrinkage. We further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure prediction and find QA-enabled ML using QBoost and RQBoost is outperformed by traditional techniques. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of algorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of this QA hardware. Through these experiments, we provide unique insights into the state of quantum ML via boosting and the use of quantum annealing hardware that are valuable to institutions interested in applying QA to problems in ML and beyond.

abstract: We investigate the effects of systematic errors of the control parameters on single-qubit gates based on non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric holonomies and those relying on purely dynamical evolution. It is explicitly shown that the systematic error in the Rabi frequency of the control fields affects these two kinds of gates in different ways. In the presence of this systematic error, the transformation produced by the non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric gate is not unitary in the computational space, and the resulting gate infidelity is larger than that with the dynamical method. Our results provide a theoretical basis for choosing a suitable method for implementing elementary quantum gates in physical systems, where the systematic noises are the dominant noise source.

abstract: Key to realising quantum computers is minimising the resources required to build logic gates into useful processing circuits. While the salient features of a quantum computer have been shown in proof-of-principle experiments, difficulties in scaling quantum systems have made more complex operations intractable. This is exemplified in the classical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate for which, despite theoretical proposals, no quantum analogue has been realised. By adding control to the SWAP unitary, we use photonic qubit logic to demonstrate the first quantum Fredkin gate, which promises many applications in quantum information and measurement. We implement example algorithms and generate the highest-fidelity three-photon GHZ states to-date. The technique we use allows one to add a control operation to a black-box unitary, something impossible in the standard circuit model. Our experiment represents the first use of this technique to control a two-qubit operation and paves the way for larger controlled circuits to be realised efficiently.

abstract: We report on the observation of an unusual type of parametric down-conversion. In the regime where collinear degenerate emission is in the anomalous range of group-velocity dispersion, its spectrum is restricted in both angle and wavelength. Detuning from exact collinear-degenerate phasematching leads to a ring shape of the wavelength-angular spectrum, suggesting a new type of spatiotemporal coherence and entanglement of photon pairs. By imposing a phase varying in a specific way in both angle and wavelength, one can obtain an interesting state of an entangled photon pair, with the two photons being never at the same point at the same time.

abstract: We derive laws for the distribution of quantum steering among different parties in multipartite Gaussian states under Gaussian measurements. We prove that a monogamy relation akin to the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality holds quantitatively for a recently introduced measure of Gaussian steering. We then define the residual Gaussian steering, stemming from the monogamy inequality, as an indicator of collective steering-type correlations. For pure three-mode Gaussian states, the residual acts a quantifier of genuine multipartite steering, and is interpreted operationally in terms of the guaranteed key rate in the task of secure quantum secret sharing. Optimal resource states for the latter protocol are identified, and their possible experimental implementation discussed. Our results pin down the role of multipartite steering for quantum communication.

abstract: I revisit the problem of the interaction between two dissimilar atoms with one atom in an excited state, recently addressed by the authors of Refs.[1-3], and for which precedent approaches have given conflicting results. In the first place, I discuss to what extent Refs.[1], [2] and [3] provide equivalent results. I show that the phase-shift rate of the two-atom wave function computed in Ref.[1], the van der Waals potential of the excited atom in Ref.[2] and the level shift of the excited atom in Ref.[3] possess equivalent expressions in the quasistationary approximation. In addition, I show that the level shift of the ground state atom computed in Ref.[3] is equivalent to its van der Waals potential. A diagrammatic representation of all those quantities is provided. The equivalences among them are however not generic. In particular, it is found that for the case of the interaction between two identical atoms excited, the phase-shift rate and the van der Waals potentials differ. Concerning the conflicting results of previous approaches in regards to the spatial oscillation of the interactions, I conclude in agreement with Refs.[1,3] that they refer to different physical quantities. The impacts of free-space dissipation and finite excitation rates on the dynamics of the potentials are analyzed. In contrast to Ref.[3], the oscillatory versus monotonic spatial forms of the potentials of each atom are found not to be related to the reversible versus irreversible nature of the excitation transfer involved.

abstract: The notion of monogamy, usually representing a peculiar tradeoff in correlations between multiple sites, can be generalized to the case in which the projective measurements, as well as measuring outcomes, of all sites behave in a collective manner, thereby leading to the discovery of a hidden monogamy even present in bipartite systems, regardless of any specific quantum states and measuring directions. The extensions to multipartite systems are possible and very promising. The Tsirelson bound can be derived out in particular. A potential connection with uncertainty relations is also discussed.

abstract: We address the question of quantifying eavesdropper's information gain in an individual attack on systems of quantum key distribution. It is connected with the concept of conclusive eavesdropping introduced by Brandt. Using the BB84 protocol, we examine the problem of estimating a performance of conclusive entangling probe. The question of interest depends on the choice of a quantitative measure of eavesdropper's information about the error-free sifted bits. The Fuchs--Peres--Brandt probe realizes a very powerful individual attack on the BB84 scheme. In the usual formulation, Eve utilizes the Helstrom scheme in distinguishing between the two output probe states. In conclusive eavesdropping, the unambiguous discrimination is used. Comparing these two versions allows to demonstrate serious distinctions between widely used quantifiers of mutual information. In particular, the so-called R\'{e}nyi mutual information does not seem to be a completely legitimate measure of an amount of mutual information. It is brightly emphasized with the example of conclusive eavesdropping.

abstract: The free will theorem states that if experimenters have free will in the sense that their choices are not a function of the past, so must some elementary particles. The theorem goes beyond Bell's theorem as it connects the two fundamental resources behind quantum technologies: single-particle contextuality, which supplies the power for quantum computation, and two-particle non-locality, which allows for quantum secure communication. The theorem relies on three axioms: (i) There is a maximum speed for propagation of information, (ii) single particles can exhibit contextuality, (iii) two separated particles can exhibit Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. Here we report the first experimental test of the free will theorem. We used pairs of hyper-entangled photons entangled in path and polarization and enforced the conditions for invoking axiom (i) by measuring each photon in a different laboratory. We certified axiom (ii) by testing the violation of the Peres-Mermin non-contextuality inequality and axiom (iii) by showing EPR correlations between the two laboratories. The three axioms imply an upper bound on the sum of the correlations among the outcomes of sequential measurements in the same laboratory and the correlations between the outcomes in both laboratories. We observed a violation of this bound by more than 66 standard deviations. This reveals that quantum non-locality can be produced when single-particle contextuality is combined with correlations which are not non-local by themselves. Our results demonstrate the resources needed for quantum computation and quantum secure communication simultaneously in the same experiment and open the door to quantum machines that efficiently achieve both tasks.

abstract: Contextuality is one of the fundamental deviations of quantum mechanics from classical physics. The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem shows that non-contextual classical physics with hidden variables is inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics. Parity proof is one of the many different approaches applied to prove KS theorem for quantum system with different dimensionality. This method of proof requires KS sets that composed of an odd number of bases and an even number of projectors. In most of the cases, the number of KS sets produced is large and its production is generally aided by computer calculation. However, manually generation of KS sets are also reported previously for qutrit and two-qubit systems. We put forward the first and surprisingly simple method to generate manually KS sets, with respect to Mermin pentagram, that can be used for the parity proof of KS theorem in a state space of eight-dimensional three-qubit system .

abstract: We demonstrate how a quantum Otto engine (QOE) can be implemented using a single ion and an always-on thermal environment. The internal degree of freedom of the ion is chosen as the working fluid, while the motional degree of freedom can be used as the cold bath. We show, that by adiabatically changing the local magnetic field, the work efficiency can be asymptotically made unity. We propose a projective measurement of the internal state of the ion that mimics the release of heat into the cold bath during the engine cycle. In our proposal, the coupling to the hot and the cold baths need not be switched off and on in an alternative fashion during the engine cycle, unlike other existing proposals of QOE. This renders the proposal experimentally feasible using the available tapped-ion engineering technology.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.08438
abstract: It is shown that there exists a class of locally indistinguishable, completable, small set of $n$-party ($n\geq3$) orthogonal product states, with $2n(d-1)$ members in $(d)^{\otimes n}$ dimensions ($d\geq2$), imposing the condition that no party is able to begin with a nontrivial and orthogonality preserving measurement in $d\times d$ dimensions. In fact, it is possible to construct a multipartite nonlocal orthogonal product basis in $(d)^{\otimes n}$ dimensions which contains fewer than $2n(d-1)$ such states (along with other product states) and that does not satisfy the above mentioned condition. As a result of which some information, useful for state discrimination, can be extracted without disturbing the orthogonality of the post measurement states. So, imposing such a condition, is related to the stronger form of nonlocality. Finally, it is shown that a $2\times2$ maximally entangled state as resource, along with a local protocol, is sufficient for perfect discrimination of such a nonlocal set of n-party orthogonal product states in $(d)^{\otimes n}$ dimensions.

abstract: We report on the generation of an indistinguishable heralded single-photon state, using highly nondegenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Spectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a broadband pump pulse and a group-velocity matching (GVM) condition in a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. The heralding photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of off-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in the telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum. We observe spectral factorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90%) of the produced heralded single photons by several different techniques. Because this source can also realize a high heralding efficiency (> 90%), it would be suitable for time-multiplexing techniques, enabling a pseudo-deterministic single-photon source, a critical resource for optical quantum information and communication technology.

abstract: Entropic Dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows the formulation of dynamical theories as an application of entropic methods of inference. In the generic application of ED to derive the Schroedinger equation for N particles the dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion in which the system follows a "Brownian" trajectory with fluctuations superposed on a smooth drift. We show that there is a family of ED models that differ at the "microscopic" or sub-quantum level in that one can enhance or suppress the fluctuations relative to the drift. Nevertheless, members of this family belong to the same universality class in that they all lead to the same emergent Schroedinger behavior at the "macroscopic" or quantum level. The model in which fluctuations are totally suppressed is of particular interest: the system evolves along the smooth lines of probability flow. Thus ED includes the Bohmian or causal form of quantum mechanics as a special limiting case. We briefly explore a different universality class -- a non-dissipative dynamics with microscopic fluctuations but no quantum potential. The Bohmian limit of these hybrid models is equivalent to classical mechanics. Finally we show that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is unaffected either by enhancing or suppressing microscopic fluctuations or by switching off the quantum potential.

abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer the potential to examine quantum behavior at large length and time scales, as well as forming promising candidates for quantum technology applications. Thus, the manipulation of BECs using control fields is a topic of prime interest. We consider BECs in the mean field model of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which contains linear and nonlinear features, both of which are subject to control. In this work we report successful optimal control simulations of a one dimensional GPE by modulating the linear and nonlinear terms to stimulate transitions into excited coherent modes. The linear and nonlinear controls are allowed to freely vary over space and time to seek their optimal forms. The determination of the excited coherent modes targeted for optimization is numerically performed through an adaptive imaginary time propagation method. Numerical simulations are performed for optimal control of mode-to-mode transitions between the ground coherent mode and excited modes of a BEC trapped in a harmonic well. The results show greater than 99% success for nearly all trials utilizing reasonable initial guesses for the controls, and analysis of the optimal controls reveals primarily direct transitions between initial and target modes. The success of using solely the nonlinearity term as a control opens up further research toward exploring novel control mechanisms inaccessible to linear Schr\"odinger-type systems.

abstract: We study polarization squeezing of a pure photon number state which is obviously polarized but the mere change in the basis of polarization leads to simultaneous polarization squeezing in all the components of Stokes operator vector except those falling along or perpendicular to the direction of polarization state, is observed. We use the most general definition of polarization squeezing and discuss the experimental feasibility of the result. We also observe that a squeezing operation like non-degenerate parametric amplification of the state does not reveal simultaneous squeezing in all Stokes operator vectors and decreases in this sense.

abstract: We introduce the concept of assemblage moment matrices, i.e., a collection of matrices of expectation values, each associated with a conditional quantum state obtained in a steering experiment. We demonstrate how it can be used for quantum state and measurement characterization in a device-independent manner, i.e., without invoking any assumption about the measurement nor the preparation device. Specifically, we show how the method can be used to lower bound the steerability of an underlying quantum state directly from the observed correlation between measurement outcomes. Combining such device-independent quantifications with earlier results established by Piani and Watrous [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 060404 (2015)], our approach immediately provides a device-independent lower bound on the generalized robustness of entanglement, as well as the usefulness of the underlying quantum state for a type of subchannel discrimination problem. In addition, by proving a quantitative relationship between steering robustness and the recently introduced incompatibility robustness, our approach also allows for a device-independent quantification of the incompatibility between various measurements performed in a Bell-type experiment. Explicit examples where such bounds provide a kind of self-testing of the performed measurements are provided.

abstract: In a recent paper Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) described a means to translate a Hamiltonian of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with `all-to-all' interactions into a larger physical lattice with only on-site energies and local parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of quantum annealing. Here we provide a stabiliser-based formulation of this approach, which permits some generalisation to the parity constraints proposed by LHZ. One variant we obtain may simplify the physical realisation since the required ancillas are only spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems (i.e.~qubits, rather than qutrits) and moreover the interactions {are} very simple. We make a preliminary assessment of the impact of different design choices by simulating small (few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.

abstract: Recently, along with the development of quantum information, quantum entanglemant became a hot topic of people. Quantum entanglemant is one of the most amazing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is totally different from classical physics. However, system would interact with environment in the practical quantum information process. The entanglement would be broken. In this paper, we study the disentanglement evolution of three spin qubits in an XY spin-chain environment. The dynamical process of the disentanglement is investigated. We found the exact expression of the coherence factor. We discuss the coherence factor and the parameters, and then we illustrate that the disentanglement of central spins is best enhanced by the quantum critical behavior of the environmental spin chain. Furthermore, a scaling rule is obtained.

We show that the physics of Fano interference can manifest as an asymmetric spectral line shape in the frequency dependence of the two-photon correlation function. The two-photon fluorescence spectrum, on the other hand, does not exhibit the physics of Fano interference.

abstract: Optomechanical systems typically use light to control the quantum state of a mechanical resonator. In this paper, we propose a scheme for controlling the quantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled beam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states enables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical resonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control, entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent amplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon interference via a classically controlled beam splitter. The visibility of the two-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in the mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically transduced weak-force sensor.

abstract: We propose a practical approach to manipulate the counter-rotating (CR) interactions in the quantum Rabi model by introducing a sinusoidal modulation to the transition frequency of the quantum two-level system in this model. By choosing appropriate modulation frequency and amplitude, enhancement and suppression of the CR interactions can be achieved in the Jaynes-Cummings regime (including both weak- and strong-coupling cases) as well as the ultrastrong-coupling regime. In particular, we calculate the output photon emission of the cavity vacuum state under enhanced CR terms. Our results show that continuous and steady photon emission from the cavity vacuum can be observed in the Jaynes-Cummings regime as a consequence of this enhancement. Our approach can be realized in superconducting quantum circuits.

By the conventional one "Einstein was wrong and Bohr was right, there is spooky action at a distance, quantum realism is incompatible with locality." However, we show that it is still possible to treat quantum mechanics without appealing to nonlocality or denying realism. We hope that this note will attract attention of the experts in quantum foundations and convince them to come with their own comments on the final Bell's test.

abstract: A recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $n$ products by a group of $m$ users, in order to provide personalised recommendations to individual users. The information is modelled as an $m \times n$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good $k$-rank approximation, for a small constant $k$. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time $O(\text{poly}(k)\text{polylog}(mn))$. All classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides a real world application of quantum algorithms in machine learning.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.08718
abstract: We consider a time dependent trap externally manipulated in such a way that one of its bound states is brought into an instant contact with the continuum threshold, and then down again. It is shown that, in the limit of slow evolution, the probability to remain in the bound state, $P^{stay}$ tends to a universal limit, and is determined only by the manner in which the adiabatic bound state approaches and leaves the threshold. The task of evaluating the $P^{stay}$ in the adiabatic limit can be reduced to studying the loss from a zero range well, and is performed numerically. Various types of trapping potentials are considered. Applications of the theory to cold atoms in traps, and to propagation of traversal modes in tapered wave guides are proposed.

abstract: Topological quantum error correction codes are currently among the most promising candidates for efficiently dealing with the decoherence effects inherently present in quantum devices. Numerically, their theoretical error threshold can be calculated by mapping the underlying quantum problem to a related classical statistical-mechanical spin system with quenched disorder. Here, we present results for the general fault-tolerant regime, where we consider both qubit and measurement errors. However, unlike in previous studies, here we vary the strength of the different error sources independently. Our results highlight peculiar differences between toric and color codes. This study complements previous results published in New J. Phys. 13, 083006 (2011).

abstract: A parity deformed Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) is introduced, which describes an interaction of a two-level atom with a $\lambda$-deformed quantized field. In the rotating wave approximation (RWA), all eigen-values and eigen-functions of this model are obtained exactly. Assuming that initially the field is prepared in the Wigner cat state (WCS) and the two-level atom is in the excited state, it has been shown that the atomic Rabi oscillations exhibit a quasi-periodic behavior in the collapse and revival patterns. The influence of the deformation parameter on the time evolution of non-classical features of the radiation field such as the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effect are also analyzed. Interestingly, the main finding here is that we can realize maximally entangled atom-field states. In this note it is shown that the high fidelity is possible in the weak coupling regime, while the deformation parameter becomes large values.

It is shown that WHA verifies the deformed commutation rule $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}_{\lambda}] = i(1 + 2\lambda \hat{R})$ and also highlights the dynamical symmetries of the pseudo-harmonic oscillator( PHO). \textbf{The present article is devoted to the study of new cat-states} built from $\lambda$-deformed Schr\"{o}dinger coherent states, which according to the Barut-Girardello scheme are defined as the eigenstates of the generalized annihilation operator. Particular attention is devoted to the limiting case where the Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are obtained. Nonclassical features and quantum statistical properties of these states are studied by evaluation of Mandel's parameter and quadrature squeezing with respect to the $\lambda-$deformed canonical pairs $( \hat{x}, \hat{p}_{\lambda})$. It is shown that these states minimize the uncertainty relations of each pair of the $su(1,1)$ components.

abstract: The decohering environment of a quantum bit is often described by the coupling to a large bath of spins. The quantum bit itself can be seen as a spin $S=1/2$ which is commonly called the central spin. The resulting central spin model describes an important mechanism of decoherence. We provide mathematically rigorous bounds for a persisting magnetization of the central spin in this model with and without magnetic field. In particular, we show that there is a well defined limit of infinite number of bath spins. Only if the fraction of very weakly coupled bath spins tends to 100\% no magnetization persists.

abstract: We establish ultimate limits on how precise a parameter, e.g. frequency or the strength of a magnetic field, can be estimated with the aid of full and fast quantum control. We consider uncorrelated noisy evolutions of N qubits and show that fast control allows to fully restore the Heisenberg scaling (~1/N^2) for all rank-one Pauli noise except dephasing. For all other types of noise the asymptotic quantum enhancement is unavoidably limited to a constant-factor improvement over the standard quantum limit (~1/N) even when allowing for the full power of fast control. The latter holds both in the single-shot and infinitely-many repetitions scenarios. However, even in this case allowing for fast quantum control helps to increase the improvement factor. Furthermore, for frequency estimation with finite resource we show how a parallel scheme utilizing any fixed number of entangled qubits but no fast quantum control can be outperformed by a simple, easily implementable, sequential scheme which only requires entanglement between one sensing and one auxiliary qubit.

abstract: For multilevel spin systems, the robustness of the quantum mechanical (QM) violation of macrorealism (MR) with respect to unsharp (coarse-grained) measurements is investigated using three different necessary conditions of MR, namely, the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), Wigner's form of the Leggett-Garg inequality (WLGI) and the condition of no signalling in time (NSIT). It is demonstrated that, contingent upon using a suitable measurement scheme, while for ideal sharp measurements, in the asymptotic limit of spin, the algebraic maxima of the QM violations of all these three necessary conditions of MR are attained, the QM violations of LGI, WLGI and NSIT persist in that limit even for \textit{arbitrary} unsharp measurements, i.e. for any non zero value of the sharpness parameter characterizing the degree of coarse-graining of the relevant measurements.

abstract: Remote state preparation (RSP) provides an indirect way of manipulating quantum information based on the nonlocal effect of quantum measurement. Although RSP has been demonstrated in recent years to remotely prepare multi-photon states, quantum measurement on the same number of photons was required, i.e., to prepare N-photon states via RSP, quantum measurement on the other N-photons was required, hence significantly limiting practicality and applicability of RSP. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of remote preparation of three-photon entangled states by measuring only a single-photon entangled with the three photons. We further generalize our protocol to prepare multi-photon entangled states with arbitrary photon number and purity via single-photon measurement. As our RSP scheme relies on the nonlinearity induced by single-photon measurement, it enables quantum state engineering of multi-photon entangled states beyond the linear optical limit. Our results are expected to have significant impacts on quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the phase sensitivity with parity detection on an SU(1,1) interferometer with a coherent state combined with a squeezed vacuum state. This interferometer is formed with two parametric amplifiers for beam splitting and recombination instead of beam splitters. We show that the sensitivity of estimation phase approaches Heisenberg limit and give the corresponding optimal condition. Moreover, we derive the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound of the SU(1,1) interferometer.

abstract: In this paper we investigate the coherence properties of a quantum dot under two-photon resonant excitation in combination with an additional photo-neutralization laser. The photo-neutralization increases the efficiency of the excitation process and thus, the brightness of the source, by a factor of approximately 1.5 for biexciton-exciton pairs. This enhancement does not degrade the relevant coherences in the system; neither the single photon coherence time, nor the coherence of the excitation process.

abstract: We propose two setups for realizing a chiral quantum network, where two-level systems representing the nodes interact via directional emission into discrete waveguides, as introduced in Ref.~[T.\ Ramos \emph{et al.}, arXiv:1602.00926]. The first implementation realizes a spin waveguide via Rydberg states in a chain of atoms, whereas the second one realizes a phonon waveguide via the localized vibrations of a string of trapped ions. For both architectures, we show that strong chirality can be obtained by a proper design of synthetic gauge fields in the couplings from the nodes to the waveguide. In the Rydberg case, this is achieved via intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the dipole-dipole interactions, while for the trapped ions it is obtained by engineered sideband transitions. We take long-range couplings into account that appear naturally in these implementations, discuss useful experimental parameters, and analyze potential error sources. Finally, we describe effects that can be observed in these implementations within state-of-the-art technology, such as the driven-dissipative formation of entangled dimer states.

We demonstrate the existence of a class of states for which entanglement is forever frozen during the dynamics, even if the state of the system does evolve. At the same time non-local correlations, quantified by the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, either undergo sudden death or are trapped during the dynamics.

abstract: The notion of complementarity or mutually exclusiveness of physical processes has always been of keen interest to the physicists whether it came from the realms of quantum mechanical processes or it arose from the information processing tasks associated with quantum information theory. In this work we show that there exists a complementary relationship in terms of the genuine non-locality as a principle between a system and its subsystems. Our approach to this problem is a device independent approach which works irrespective of any theoretical setting. We consider Svetlichny games in a multiparty binary input and output scenario with a threshold value of the winning probability as a signature of genuine multiparty non locality. We analytically show that, in the Svetlichny games setup, there exists complementary relations between Svetlichny correlations of $n$ party and Svetlichny correlations of $k\leq n$ parties within the no-signaling framework. In other words, in general non local theories, the genuine multiparty non locality for multiparty systems comes at the price of upper bounding the genuine multiparty non locality of the reduced subsystem. In addition to Svetlichny games we consider many other non local games like Mermin games, Bancal \emph{et al's} IP, Guess Your Neighbors Input game and provide numerical findings ( in case of no-signaling and quantum correlations ) in support of our main result.

abstract: Using the coherent state functional integral formulation of the partition function, we show that the sine-Gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime arises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly imperfect Bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow, when these fluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle Hilbert space. We consider bipartitions of the single-particle Hilbert space relevant to experiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g., restriction to high or low energy sectors of the dynamics, and spatial bipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar Bose gases. By assuming full unitary quantum control in the low energy subspace of a trapped gas, we show that: 1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the lowest energy mode partially decouples the low and high energy sectors, allowing any low-energy single-particle wavefunction to define a background for sine-Gordon dynamics on curved spacetime, and 2) macroscopic occupation of a quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an analogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows, with respective weights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed quantum states.

abstract: In 1954, Dicke showed that a system of quantum emitters within a subwavelength volume produced a superradiant burst. For such a burst to occur, the emitters must be in the special Dicke state in which all emitters are excited and indistinguishable. We demonstrate that a superradiance burst may arise for non-Dicke initial states as well. The mechanisms of this superradiance phenomenon are discussed.

abstract: Levitated diamond nanocrystals with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in high vacuum have been proposed as a unique system for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, including the generation of large quantum superposition states and tests of quantum gravity. This system promises extreme isolation from its environment while providing quantum control and sensing through the NV centre spin. While optical trapping has been the most explored method of levitation, recent results indicate that excessive optical heating of the nanodiamonds under vacuum may make the method impractical with currently available materials. Here, we study an alternative magneto-gravitational trap for diamagnetic particles, such as diamond nanocrystals, with stable levitation from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum. Magnetic field gradients from permanent magnets confine the particle in two dimensions, while confinement in the third dimension is gravitational. We demonstrate that feedback cooling of the centre-of-mass motion of a trapped nanodiamond cluster results in cooling of one degree of freedom to less than 1 K.

abstract: We consider non-Hermitian dynamics of a quantum particle hopping on a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice made of $N$ sites with asymmetric hopping rates induced by a time-periodic oscillating imaginary gauge field. A deeply different behavior is found depending on the lattice topology. While in a linear chain (open boundary conditions) an oscillating field can lead to a complex quasi energy spectrum via a multiple parametric resonance, in a ring topology (Born-von Karman periodic boundary conditions) an entirely real quasi energy spectrum can be found and the dynamics is pseudo-Hermitian. In the large $N$ limit, parametric instability and pseudo-Hermitian dynamics in the two different lattice topologies are physically explained on the basis of a simple picture of wave packet propagation.

abstract: We define the statistical quadrature evolution (QE) method for multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CVs) for information transmission. The QE scheme utilizes the theory of mathematical statistics and statistical information processing. The QE model is based on the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) framework to provide a minimal error estimate of the CV state quadratures. The QE block evaluates a unique and stable estimation of the non-observable continuous input from the measurement results and through the statistical inference method yielded from the GQI framework. The QE method minimizes the overall expected error by an estimator function and provides a viable, easily implementable, and computationally efficient way to maximize the extractable information from the observed data. The QE framework can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol and measurement setting and is implementable by standard low-complexity functions, which is particularly convenient for experimental CVQKD.

abstract: The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attractive properties for a number of quantum technologies that rely on the spin angular momentum of the electron and the nuclei adjacent to the center. The nucleus with the strongest interaction is the $^{13}$C nuclear spin of the first shell. Using this degree of freedom effectively hinges on precise data on the hyperfine interaction between the electronic and the nuclear spin. Here, we present detailed experimental data on this interaction, together with an analysis that yields all parameters of the hyperfine tensor, as well as its orientation with respect to the atomic structure of the center.

abstract: Analog quantum simulators (AQS) will likely be the first nontrivial application of quantum technology for predictive simulation. However, there remain questions regarding the degree of confidence that can be placed in the results of AQS since they do not naturally incorporate error correction. Specifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model will produce predictions that agree with the ideal model in the presence of inevitable imperfections? At the same time there is a widely held expectation that certain quantum simulation questions will be robust to errors and perturbations in the underlying hardware. Resolving these two points of view is a critical step in making the most of this promising technology. In this work we formalize the notion of AQS reliability by determining sensitivity of AQS outputs to underlying parameters, and formulate conditions for robust simulation. Our approach naturally reveals the importance of model symmetries in dictating the robust properties of a quantum simulation. To demonstrate the approach, we present analytical and numerical results that characterize the robust features of several quantum many-body models, including the transverse field Ising model and the Fermi-Hubbard model.

abstract: We investigate the cost of Grover's quantum search algorithm when used in the context of pre-image attacks on the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families of hash functions. Our cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface code based fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area metric that costs the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit in units of surface code cycles. As a surface code cycles involves a significant classical processing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but direct, comparisons of classical and quantum algorithms. We exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is approximately $2^{149}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{13}$ logical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{162}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is approximately $2^{146}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{16}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{162}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in a quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these attacks may be as much as $17$ billion times more expensive than one would expect from the simple query analysis.

abstract: We propose and analyse a feasible experimental scheme for a quantum force sensor based on the elimination of back-action noise through coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) in a hybrid atom-cavity optomechanical setup assisted with squeezed vacuum injection. The force detector, which allows for a continuous, broad-band detection of weak forces well below the standard quantum limit (SQL), is formed by a single optical cavity simultaneously coupled to a mechanical oscillator and to an ensemble of ultracold atoms. The latter acts as a negative-mass oscillator so that atomic noise cancels exactly the back-action noise from the mechanical oscillator due to destructive quantum interference. Squeezed vacuum injection enforces this cancellation and allows to reach sub-SQL sensitivity in a very wide frequency band, and at much lower input laser powers.

abstract: In this work we study the spontaneous decay of an impurity coupled to a linear array of bosonic cavities forming a single band waveguide. The frequency of the emitted photon is different from the resonance single-photon scattering frequency, which perfectly matches the bare frequency of the impurity. This breaks down the correspondence between spontaneous emission and scattering. We study how the position of the impurity energy with respect to the photonic band influences the profile in position space of the emitted photon. In addition, the impurity presents a rich dynamics: it shows an exponential decay for intermediate times, followed by a power-law tail in the long time regime and finally reaches an oscillatory stationary regime.

The effect is engineered using intrinsic parameters, such as hopping amplitudes and on-site potentials. A theoretical description of the apparatus relying on a generalized Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation beyond Dirac points is given. Our results are verified numerically by means of wavepacket evolution, including an analysis of Zitterbewegung on the lattice. The necessary tools for microwave realizations, such as complex hopping amplitudes and chiral effects, are simulated.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.09430
abstract: In this Letter, we explore the possibility of developing Bell inequalities predicated on models using a single Local Hidden Variable (s-LHV), a strict subset of general LHV models. Because of the less strenuous constraints imposed by s-LHV models, we were able to derive a contingent Bell inequality in analogy to the CHSH inequality, but which does not require bounding of measurement statistics. Following this, we show by explicit example that there are cases of states that rule out s-LHV models by violating our inequality, but which nonetheless have a multivariate LHV model. Even so, we show how merely ruling out s-LHV models is still sufficient to allow for fully device independent quantum key distribution (QKD) and entanglement witnessing. This being the case, our inequality illustrates two things. First, it makes fully device-independent QKD on continuous variables substantially more straightforward. Second, it shows how the degree of correlation needed to demonstrate device-independent QKD is distinct from both Bell-nonlocality and EPR-steering. Although nonlocality in general requires ruling out all LHV models, s-LHV models are sufficiently useful to warrant further exploration.

abstract: Quantum mechanics notoriously faces the measurement problem, the problem that if read thoroughly, it implies the nonexistence of definite outcomes in measurement procedures. A plausible reaction to this and to related problems is to regard a system's quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ merely as an indication of our lack of knowledge about the system, i.e., to interpret it epistemically. However, there are radically different ways to spell out such an epistemic view of the quantum state. We here investigate new developments in the branch that introduces hidden variables $\lambda$ in addition to the quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ and has its roots in Einstein's views. In particular, we confront purported achievements of the view in the light of recent no-go results. It will be demonstrated that, despite the debatability of the premises of such results, they force the hidden variable theorist to make ad hoc moves which undermine the very conceptual basis of his own approach.

abstract: An upgraded concept of solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger-type equations is proposed. In a broader methodical context of non-perturbative quantum theory the innovation involves potentials which are piece-wise analytic yielding differential equations solvable in terms of special functions. In our illustrative example, Whittaker functions are employed and a single point of non-analyticity is admitted in the origin. In a symbolic-manipulation-based practical implementation of the method a serendipitous advantage of the construction of bound states is found in the both-sided nature of the numerical localization of their energies.

abstract: The R\'enyi entropies $R_{p}[\rho], 0<p<\infty$ of the probability density $\rho_{n,l,m}(\vec{r})$ of a physical system completely characterize the chemical and physical properties of the quantum state described by the three integer quantum numbers $(n,l,m)$. The analytical determination of these quantities is practically impossible up until now, even for the very few systems where their Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solved. In this work, the R\'enyi entropies of Rydberg (highly-excited) hydrogenic states are explicitly calculated in terms of the quantum numbers and the parameter $p$. To do that we use a methodology which first connects these quantities to the $\mathcal{L}_{p}$-norms $N_{n,l}(p)$ of the Laguerre polynomials which characterize the state's wavefunction. Then, the R\'enyi, Shannon and Tsallis entropies of the Rydberg states are determined by calculating the asymptotics ($n\rightarrow\infty$) of these Laguerre norms. Finally, these quantities are numerically examined in terms of the quantum numbers and the nuclear charge.

The states which interact with many other degrees of freedom, such as the center of mass of a macro-object, play important role. Although the random phase mechanism is effective as same as Zurek's strong correlation model, there are enormous states, each of which independently developes due to the orthogonality of the environmental states. In these privileged states, the subsystem picture with the separability is stable.

abstract: Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The solution of the optimisation problem then corresponds to the ground state of the system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the ground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing devices is the fact that many real world optimisation problems require interactions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as a unit cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbour four-body interactions.

abstract: A general method is introduced for verifying multi-time quantum correlations through the characteristic function of the time-dependent P functional, that generalizes the Glauber-Sudarshan P function. Quantum-correlation criteria are derived which identify quantum effects for an arbitrary number of points in time. The Magnus expansion is used to visualize the impact of the required time-ordering. We show that the latter affects the multi-time characteristic function and, therefore, the temporal evolution of the nonclassicality. As an example, we apply our technique to an optical parametric process with a frequency mismatch. The resulting two-time characteristic function yields full insight into the two-time quantum correlation properties of such a system.

Furthermore, upper bare-state population inversion occurs as well.

abstract: We experimentally and theoretically investigate the quantum trajectories of jointly monitored transmon qubits embedded in spatially separated microwave cavities. Using nearly quantum-noise limited superconducting amplifiers and an optimized setup to reduce signal loss between cavities, we can efficiently track measurement-induced entanglement generation as a continuous process for single realizations of the experiment. The quantum trajectories of transmon qubits naturally split into low and high entanglement classes corresponding to half-parity collapse. The distribution of concurrence is found at any given time and we explore the dynamics of entanglement creation in the state space. The distribution exhibits a sharp cut-off in the high concurrence limit, defining a maximal concurrence boundary. The most likely paths of the qubits' trajectories are also investigated, resulting in three probable paths, gradually projecting the system to two even subspaces and an odd subspace. We also investigate the most likely time for the individual trajectories to reach their most entangled state, and find that there are two solutions for the local maximum, corresponding to the low and high entanglement routes. The theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with the experimental entangled qubit trajectory data.

In particular, we attempt to present a clear explanation of what is meant by an "event" in quantum mechanics and of the significance of this notion. We then outline a theory of direct (projective) and indirect observations or recordings of physical quantities and events. Some key ideas underlying our general theory are illustrated by studying a simple quantum-mechanical model of a mesoscopic system.

By comparing it to the axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics presented by Giles it is shown that for finite dimensional systems the two theories are formally inequivalent. The same approach is used to demonstrate the full equivalence in the asymptotic limit for pure quantum states. For mixed states a different method for obtaining the second law is described applied to two different classes of operations, PPT-preserving and asymptotically non-entangling operations.

abstract: We present a new scheme for quantum homomorphic encryption which is compact and allows for efficient evaluation of arbitrary polynomial-sized quantum circuits. Building on the framework of Broadbent and Jeffery and recent results in the area of instantaneous non-local quantum computation, we show how to construct quantum gadgets that allow perfect correction of the errors which occur during the homomorphic evaluation of T gates on encrypted quantum data. Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already used by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the space complexity of the classical decryption function -- which aligns well with the current efforts to minimize the complexity of the decryption function. Our scheme (or slight variants of it) offers a number of additional advantages such as ideal compactness, the ability to supply gadgets "on demand", circuit privacy for the evaluator against passive adversaries, and a three-round scheme for blind delegated quantum computation which puts only very limited demands on the quantum abilities of the client.

abstract: The behaviour of fermions in the background of a double-step potential is analyzed with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous chiral-conjugation transformation. Provided the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling, a Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step potential shows that the transmission coefficient exhibits oscillations and that a finite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-state solutions might appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. An isolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled first-order equations might also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound solutions disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of the so-called spin and pseudospin symmetries in a four-dimensional space-time. Furthermore, we show that due to the additional mass acquired by the fermion from the scalar background the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime does not violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

abstract: We investigate an efficient two-photon up-conversion process in more than one molecule coupled to an optical antenna. In the previous work [Y. Osaka et al., PRL 112, 133601 (2014)], we considered the two-photon up-conversion process in a single molecule within one-dimensional input-output theory, and revealed that controlling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the efficient up-conversion with radiative loss in the antenna suppressed. In this work, aiming to propose a way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend the model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more than one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome the difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies that, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can enlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion.

abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this work, we propose an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum currents. Our detection scheme relies on initiating the system in an anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a $4$-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown to be robust under a weak disorder.

abstract: A branching process treatment for the nonlocal Wigner pseudo-differential operator and its numerical applications in quantum dynamics is proposed and analyzed. We start from the discussion on two typical truncations of the nonlocal term, i.e., the $k$-truncated and $y$-truncated models. After introducing an auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})$, the (truncated) Wigner equation is reformulated into the integral formulation as well as its adjoint correspondence, both of which can be regarded as the renewal-type equations and have transparent stochastic interpretation. We prove that the moment of a branching process happens to be the solution for the adjoint equation, which connects rigorously the Wigner quantum dynamics to the stochastic branching process, and thus a sound mathematical framework for the Wigner Monte Carlo methods is established. Within the framework, the branching process for the $y$-truncated model recovers the popular signed particle Monte Carlo method which needs a discretization of the momentum space beforehand, whereas the $k$-truncated branching method allows a continuous momentum sampling. More interestingly, with the help of the rigorous connection, we find that a constant auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})\equiv\gamma_0$ performs better from the point of view of both theoretical and numerical aspects. In theory, we obtain a simple but analytical calculation formula for the growth rate of particle number, i.e., $\me^{2\gamma_0 t}$ with $t$ being the time. In numerics, the constant auxiliary function may facilitate the random sampling from the exponential distribution and improve the accuracy. Typical numerical experiments on the Gaussian barrier scattering validate our theoretical findings, as well as demonstrate the accuracy, the efficiency and thus the computability of the Wigner branching process.

abstract: We investigate photon merging and splitting processes in inhomogeneous, slowly varying electromagnetic fields. Our study is based on the three-photon polarization tensor following from the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. We put special emphasis on deviations from the well-known constant field results, also revisiting the selection rules for these processes. In the context of high-intensity laser facilities, we analytically determine compact expressions for the number of merged/split photons as obtained in the focal spots of intense laser beams. For the parameter range of a typical petawatt class laser system as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe, we provide estimates for the numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment. The combination of frequency upshifting, polarization dependence and scattering off the inhomogeneities renders photon merging an ideal signature for the experimental exploration of nonlinear quantum vacuum properties.

abstract: The spectacular successes of quantum physics have made it a commonplace to assert that we live in a quantum world. This idea seems to imply a kind of "quantum fundamentalism" according to which everything in the universe (if not the universe as a whole) is fundamentally of a quantum nature and ultimately describable in quantum-mechanical terms. Bohr's conception of quantum mechanics has traditionally been seen as opposed to such a view, not least because of his insistence on the necessity of the concepts of classical physics in the account of quantum phenomena. Recently, however, a consensus seems to be emerging among careful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to some version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by re-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional reading of Bohr in which (1) the answer to what an object is (quantum or classical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any physical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be treated that way at the same time.

abstract: It is well known that Niels Bohr insisted on the necessity of classical concepts in the account of quantum phenomena. But there is little consensus concerning his reasons, and what he exactly meant by this. In this paper, I re-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the necessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists in distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a purely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence concerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his interpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen interpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the literature. I conclude with a few remarks on how Bohr's ideas make much sense also when modern developments in quantum gravity and early universe cosmology are taken into account.

abstract: We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.

abstract: Motivated by the current interest in dynamically preparing topological states in ultracold atomic gases, we consider a two-dimensional system initialized in a topologically trivial state before its Hamiltonian is ramped into a Chern-insulator phase. Under coherent dynamics, the non-equilibrium Hall response is found to approach a topologically quantized time averaged value in the limit of slow parameter ramps, even though the Chern number of the state is constrained to remain trivial. Quite remarkably, the destruction of quantum coherence by dephasing stabilizes the Hall response towards its asymptotically quantized mean value by damping its oscillations. We demonstrate how this phenomenology generically arises from the interplay of Landau-Zener dynamics and dephasing. In the limit of a fast ramp (quench), we show how the presence of a cooling quantum bath enables a dynamical transition of the state's Chern number from trivial to non-trivial, accompanied by the onset of a quantized Hall response.

abstract: The environment of a quantum dot, which is connected to two leads, is modeled by telegraph noise, i.e. random Markovian jumps of the (spinless) electron energy on the dot between two levels. The temporal evolutions of the charge on the dot and of the currents in the leads are studied using a recently developed single-particle basis approach, which is particularly convenient for the averaging over the histories of the noise. In the steady state limit we recover the Landauer formula. At a very fast jump rate between the two levels, the noise does not affect the transport. As the jump rate decreases, the effective average transmission crosses over from the transmission through a single (average) level to an incoherent sum of the transmissions through the two levels. 13 pages, 6 figuresThe transient temporal evolution towards the steady state is dominated by the displacement current at short times, and by the Landauer current at long times. It contains oscillating terms, which decay to zero faster than for the case without noise. When the average chemical potential on the leads equals the dot's "original" energy, without the noise, the oscillations disappear completely and the transient evolution becomes independent of the noise.

abstract: We perform spectroscopic measurements of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a strongly interacting Rydberg gas, and observe a significant spectral shift of the transparency from the single-atom EIT resonance as well as a spectral dephasing of the same order. We characterize the shift and dephasing as a function of atomic density, probe Rabi frequency, and principal quantum number of Rydberg states, and demonstrate that the observed spectral shift and dephasing are reduced if the size of a Gaussian atomic cloud is increased. We simulate our experiment with a semi-analytical model, which gives results in good agreement with our experimental data.

abstract: Generation of even-order harmonics due to spatial symmetry breaking in high-order harmonic generation investigated by numerically solving one-dimensional electronic time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The simple molecular ions H$_2^+$ and T$_2^+$ is chosen under a 14-cycle trapezoidal laser pulse at 800 nm wavelength and $I=$3 $\times 10^{14}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity. For an isotope (H$_2^+$) that has not a significant HHG at the laser falling edge, only odd harmonic orders are observed. Whereas, for one (T$_2^+$) with considerable HHG at the falling part of the laser pulse, frequency redshift occurs for odd-order harmonics and also even harmonic orders appear as a result of spatial symmetry breaking. To clarify further, spatial distribution of HHG and resolving HHG into different components are demonstrated. The contribution of different electronic states to the complexities in terms of internuclear distance is also demonstrated. The results also help to understand better complicated features observed for even a non-trapezoidal laser pulse and even a multi-electron molecular system.

abstract: Using numerical simulations of two-photon electronic absorption with femtosecond pulses in Na$_2$ we show that: i) it is possible to avoid the characteristic saturation or dumped Rabi oscillations in the yield of absorption by time-delaying the laser pulses; ii) it is possible to accelerate the onset of adiabatic passage by using the vibrational coherence starting in a wave packet; and iii) it is possible to prepare the initial wave packet in order to achieve full state-selective transitions with broadband pulses. The findings can be used, for instance, to achieve ultrafast adiabatic passage by light-induced potentials and understand its intrinsic robustness.

abstract: The scattering of matter wave solitons on attractive potentials enables one to populate bound states, a feature impossible with noninteracting wave packets. Compared to noninteracting states, the populated states are renormalized by the attractive interactions between atoms and keep the same topology. This renormalization can even transform a virtual state into a bound state. Our numerical studies show how such scattering experiments can reveal and characterize the surface states of a periodic structure whose translational invariance has been broken. Our proposal can be implemented with current experimental techniques.

abstract: A new perspective on how to manipulate molecules by means of very strong laser pulses is emerging with insights from the so-called light-induced potentials, which are the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of molecules severely distorted by the effect of the strong field. Different effects appear depending on how the laser frequency is tuned, to a certain electronic transition, creating light-induced avoided crossings, or very off-resonant, generating Stark shifts. In the former case it is possible to induce dramatic changes in the geometry and redistribution of charges in the molecule while the lasers are acting and to fully control photodissociation reactions as well as other photochemical processes. Several theoretical proposals taken from the work of the authors are reviewed and analyzed showing the unique features that the strong-laser chemistry opens to control the transient properties and the dynamics of molecules.

Applications of these solutions include angular momenta, a quantitative calculation of the absorption spectrum and accurate plots of surfaces of amplitude functions. The shape of an amplitude function, and even the quantum numbers in a particular set to specify such an individual function, depend on the coordinates in a particular chosen system, and are therefore artefacts of that particular coordinate representation within wave mechanics. All discussion of atomic or molecular properties based on such shapes or quantum numbers therefore lacks general significance

abstract: We analyze the temporal response of the fluorescence light that is emitted from a dense gas of cold atoms driven by a laser. When the average interatomic distance is smaller than the wavelength of the photons scattered by the atoms, the system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective dissipation. We solve the exact dynamics of small systems with different geometries and show how these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties such as the photon emission rate, the power spectrum and the second-order correlation function. By calculating these quantities beyond the weak driving limit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective behavior in these many-body systems. Furthermore, we clarify the role of disorder on the resonance fluorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental efforts that aim at the exploration of many-body effects in dipole-dipole interacting gases of atoms.

The model consists of a lattice of Rabi systems coupled by a photon hopping term between near neighbor sites. The phase diagram consists of only two phases: a coherent phase and an incoherent one. The Mott phases which are present in the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model are not observed here due to the presence of non-negligible counter-rotating terms. We find that these two models become equivalent when the detuning is negative and large enough, or if the counter-rotating terms are small enough.

Our approach relies on an electronic quantum bus, consisting either of quantum Hall edge channels or surface acoustic waves, that can mediate long-range coupling between localized spins over distances of tens of micrometers. Since the entanglement is actively stabilized by dissipative dynamics, our scheme is inherently robust against noise and imperfections.

abstract: We construct momentum space expansions for the wave functions that solve the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for tachyons, recognizing that the mass shell for such fields is very different from what we are used to for ordinary (slower than light) particles. We find that we can postulate commutation or anticommutation rules for the operators that lead to physically sensible results: causality, for tachyon fields, means that there is no connection between spacetime points separated by a timelike interval. Calculating the conserved charge and 4-momentum for these fields allows us to interpret the number operators for particles and antiparticles in a consistent manner; and we see that helicity plays a critical role for the spinor field. Some questions about Lorentz invariance are addressed and some remain unresolved; and we show how to handle the group representation for tachyon spinors.

abstract: The tunneling junction between one-dimensional topological superconductor and integer (fractional) topological insulator (TI), realized via point contact, is investigated theoretically with bosonization technology and renormalization group methods. For the integer TI case, in a finite range of edge interaction parameter, there is a non-trivial stable fixed point which corresponds to the physical picture that the edge of TI breaks up into two sections at the junction, with one side coupling strongly to the Majorana fermion and exhibiting perfect Andreev reflection, while the other side decouples, exhibiting perfect normal reflection at low energies. This fixed point can be used as a signature of the Majorana fermion and tested by nowadays experiment techniques. For the fractional TI case, the universal low-energy transport properties are described by perfect normal reflection, perfect Andreev reflection, or perfect insulating fixed points dependent on the filling fraction and edge interaction parameter of fractional TI.

abstract: Disordered quantum networks, as those describing light-harvesting complexes, are often characterized by the presence of peripheral ring-like structures, where the excitation is initialized, and inner reaction centers (RC), where the excitation is trapped. The peripheral rings display coherent features: their eigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant states. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of disorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC, while the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states, creating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal transfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder strength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level system. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial condition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an excitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of the order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the initial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the superradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC energy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an optimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence of dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent' resonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of the superradiant state.

abstract: We present electrically detected electron nuclear double resonance measurements of the nuclear spins of ionized and neutral arsenic donors in strained silicon. In addition to a reduction of the hyperfine coupling, we find significant quadrupole interactions of the nuclear spin of the neutral donors of the order of 10 kHz. By comparing these to the quadrupole shifts due to crystal fields measured for the ionized donors, we identify the effect of the additional electron on the electric field gradient at the nucleus. This extra component is expected to be caused by the coupling to electric field gradients created due to changes in the electron wavefunction under strain.

abstract: High-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoresonators have become an attractive choice for electro- and optomechanical devices. Membrane resonators can achieve quality factor ($Q$) - frequency ($f$) products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz, enabling (in principle) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam resonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller $Q\cdot f$ products; however, on account of their much larger $Q$-to-mass ratio and reduced mode density, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge sensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at cryogenic temperatures. Here we explore two techniques to enhance the $Q$-factor of a nanomechanical beam. The techniques relate to two main loss mechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for large aspect ratios and $f\lesssim100$ MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios and $f\gtrsim100$ MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D phononic crystal, it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it against radiation loss. Using this method, we realize $f>100$ MHz modes with $Q\sim 10^4$, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with unshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the $Q\cdot f$ products of high-order modes of mm-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape dependence of stress-induced `loss-dilution', we realize a $f\approx 4$ MHz mode with $Q\cdot f\approx9\cdot 10^{12}$ Hz. Our results can extend room temperature quantum coherent operation to ultra-low-mass 1D nanomechanical oscillators.

abstract: Out-of-equilibrium systems can host phenomena that transcend the usual restrictions of equilibrium systems. Here we unveil how out-of-equilibrium states, prepared via a quantum quench, can exhibit a non-zero Hall-type response that persists at long times, and even when the instantaneous Hamiltonian is time reversal symmetric; both these features starkly contrast with equilibrium Hall currents. Interestingly, the persistent Hall effect arises from processes beyond those captured by linear response, and is a signature of the novel dynamics in out-of-equilibrium systems. We propose quenches in two-band Dirac systems as natural venues to realize persistent Hall currents, which exist when either mirror or time-reversal symmetry are broken (before or after the quench). Its long time persistence, as well as sensitivity to symmetry breaking, allow it to be used as a sensitive diagnostic of the complex out-equilibrium dynamics readily controlled and probed in cold-atomic optical lattice experiments.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate quantum correlation of an interacting Fermi system, which is a nodal superconductor (d-wave superconductor) at zero temperature, via quantum entanglement of two electron spins forming Cooper pairs (Werner state), tripartite and quantum discord. After calculating single-electron Green functions, the two-electron space-spin density matrix, which has X-state form, is obtained. The dependence of quantum correlation to the relative distance of electrons spins of Cooper pair and energy gap is investigated. One of the results is, for d-wave case, concurrence (as a measure of entanglement), quantum discord and tripartite are sensitive to the change of magnitude of gap. Another result is both concurrence and discord oscillate. Then, we consider three-dimensional rectangular nano-superconducting grain in the weak coupling frame. The nano-size effect is entered via gap fluctuation. The dependence of quantum correlation to length of superconductor and lower bound of robustness of tripartite entanglement are determined. Moreover, we show that quantum correlation of d-wave nano-size superconducting grain strongly depends on length of grain (in contrast to s-wave case). In general, it is found that the length of grain lower, the effect of nano-size on quantum correlation higher. Quantum tripartite for nano-scale d-wave superconductor is better than for bulk d-wave superconductor. However, we find out both bulk and nano-size s-wave superconductors have the same tripartite. Furthermore, entanglement length and quantum correlation length are investigated and it is shown that there is a length of superconductor in which discord becomes zero. Also, for a given fixed length of superconductor, both a peak in discord and a peak in concurrence occur simultaneously.

abstract: Using a perturbative treatment, we quantify the influence of non-adiabatic leakage and system dissipation on the transfer fidelity of a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) process. We find that, optimizing transfer time rather than coupling profiles, leads to a significant improvement of the transfer fidelity. The upper bound of the fidelity has been found as a simple analytical function of system cooperativities. We also provide a systematic approach to reach this upper bound efficiently.

abstract: Ultra-cold atom-ion mixtures are gaining increasing interest due to their potential applications in quantum chemistry, quantum computing and many-body physics. The polarization potential between atoms and ions scales as 1/r^4 and extends to 100's of nm. This long length-scale interaction can form macroscopic objects while exhibiting quantum features such as Feshbach and shape resonances at sufficiently low temperatures. So far, reaching the quantum regime of atom-ion interaction has been impeded by the ion's excess micromotion (EMM) which sets a scale for the steady-state energy. In this work, we studied the dynamics of a ground-state cooled ion with negligible EMM during few, to many, Langevin (spiraling) collisions with ultra-cold atoms. We measured the energy distribution of the ion using both coherent (Rabi) and non-coherent (photon scattering) spectroscopy. We observed a clear deviation from a Maxwell-Boltzmann thermal distribution to a Tsallis energy distribution characterized by a power-law tail of high energies. Unlike previous experiments, here the energy scale of atom-ion interactions is not determined by either the atomic cloud temperature or the EMM energy. In fact, it is determined by the force the atom exerts on the ion during a collision which is then amplified by the trap dynamics. This effect is intrinsic to ion Paul traps and sets the lower bound of atom-ion steady-state interaction energy in these systems. We also show that, even though the ion's mean energy diverges due to the long tail of the energy distribution, the energy transfer per collision is relatively small. Therefore, despite the fact that our system is eventually driven out of the ultra-cold regime, we are, in principle, capable of studying quantum effects by limiting the interaction time to the first few collisions.

We analyze their performance both in the near-infrared wavelength regime around 1600 nm and at 765 nm. Near-IR detection is important for compatibility with the telecommunication infrastructure, while operation in the visible wavelength range is relevant for compatibility with the emission line of silicon vacancy centers in diamond which can be used as efficient single-photon sources. Our detectors feature high critical currents (up to 31 {\mu}A) and high performance in terms of efficiency (up to 74% at 765 nm), noise-equivalent power (down to 4.4*10^-19 W/(Hz^1/2) at 765 nm) and timing jitter (down to 23 ps).

abstract: In this paper we report the evaluation of an optical lattice clock based on neutral mercury down to a relative uncertainty of $1.7\times 10^{-16}$. Comparing this characterized frequency standard to a Cs atomic fountain we determine the absolute frequency of the $^1S_0 \rightarrow \phantom{}^3P_0$ transition of $^{199}$Hg as $\nu_{\mathrm{Hg}} = 1 128\,575\,290\,808\,154.62\,$Hz $\pm\,0.19\,$Hz (statistical) $\pm\,0.38\,$Hz (systematic), limited solely by the realization of the SI second. Furthermore, by comparing the mercury optical lattice clock to a Rb atomic fountain, we determine for the first time to our knowledge the ratio between the $^{199}$Hg clock transition and the $^{87}$Rb ground state hyperfine transition. Finally we present a direct optical to optical measurement of the $^{199}$Hg/$^{87}$Sr frequency ratio. The obtained value of $\nu_{\mathrm{Hg}}/\nu_{\mathrm{Sr}}=2.629\,314\,209\,898\,909\,15$ with a fractional uncertainty of $1.8\times10^{-16}$ is in excellent agreement with the same measurement obtained by Yamanaka et al. (arXiv:1503.07941). This makes this frequency ratio one of the few physical quantities agreed upon by different laboratories to this level of uncertainty. Frequency ratio measurements of the kind of those reported in this paper have a strong impact for frequency metrology but also for fundamental physics as they can be used to monitor putative variations of fundamental constants.

abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a new platform to study nonstationary cavity QED phenomena. An example of such a phenomenon is a dynamical Lamb effect which is a parametric excitation of an atom due to the nonadiabatic modulation of its Lamb shift. This effect has been initially introduced for a natural atom in a varying cavity, while we suggested its realization in a superconducting qubit-cavity system with dynamically tunable coupling. In the present paper, we study the interplay between the dynamical Lamb effect and the energy dissipation, which is unavoidable in realistic systems. We find that despite of naive expectations this interplay can lead to unexpected dynamical regimes. One of the most striking results is that photon generation from vacuum can be strongly enhanced due to the qubit relaxation, which opens a new channel for such a process. We also show that dissipation in the cavity can increase the qubit excited state population. Our results can be used for the experimental observation and investigation of the dynamical Lamb effect and accompanying quantum effects.

abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first detected passage time of a quantum walk. The postulates of quantum theory, in particular the collapse of the wave function upon measurement, reveal an intimate connection between the wave function of a process free of measurements, i.e. the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, and the statistics of first detection events on a site. For stroboscopic measurements a quantum renewal equation yields basic properties of quantum walks. For example, for a tight binding model on a ring we discover critical sampling times, diverging quantities such as the mean time for first detection, and an optimal detection rate. For a quantum walk on an infinite line the probability of first detection decays like $(\mbox{time})^{-3}$ with a superimposed oscillation, critical behavior for a specific choice of sampling time, and vanishing amplitude when the sampling time approaches zero due to the quantum Zeno effect.

abstract: It is shown that the celebrated Heun operator $H_e=-(a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x) \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + (b_0 x^2 + b_1 x + b_2)\frac{d}{dx} + c_0 x$ is the Hamiltonian of the $sl(2,R)$-quantum Euler-Arnold top of spin $\nu$ in a constant magnetic field. For $a_0 \neq 0$ it is canonically-equivalent to $BC_1(A_1)-$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum models, if $a_0=0$, all known one-dimensional quasi-exactly-solvable problems are reproduced, if, in addition, $b_0=c_0=0$, then all four well-known one-dimensional exactly-solvable problems are reproduced. If spin $\nu$ of the top takes (half)-integer value the Hamiltonian gets finite-dimensional invariant subspace and a number of polynomial eigenfunctions occurs. Discrete systems on uniform and exponential lattices are introduced which are canonically-equivalent to one described by the Heun operator.

abstract: Optically trapped nanospheres in high-vaccum experience little friction and hence are promising for ultra-sensitive force detection. Here we demonstrate measurement times exceeding $10^5$ seconds and zeptonewton force sensitivity with laser-cooled silica nanospheres trapped in an optical lattice. The sensitivity achieved exceeds that of conventional room-temperature solid-state force sensors, and enables a variety of applications including electric field sensing, inertial sensing, and gravimetry. The optical potential allows the particle to be confined in a number of possible trapping sites, with precise localization at the anti-nodes of the optical standing wave. By studying the motion of a particle which has been moved to an adjacent trapping site, the known spacing of the lattice anti-nodes can be used to calibrate the displacement spectrum of the particle. Finally, we study the dependence of the trap stability and lifetime on the laser intensity and gas pressure, and examine the heating rate of the particle in high vacuum in the absence of optical feedback cooling.

abstract: A large part of operational quantum mechanics can be reproduced from a classical statistical theory with a restriction which implies a limit on the amount of knowledge that an agent can have about an individual system [6, 17]. These epistemic restrictions have recently been restated via the symplectic structure of the underlying classical theory [18]. Starting with this symplectic framework, we obtain C*-algebraic formulation for the epistemically restricted theories. In the case of continuous variables, the groupoid quantization recipe of E. Hawkins provides us a twisted group C*-algebra which is the usual Moyal quantization of a Poisson vector space [11].

abstract: We introduce a numerical method for identifying topological order in two-dimensional models based on one-dimensional bulk operators. The idea is to identify approximate symmetries supported on thin strips through the bulk that behave as string operators associated to an anyon model. We can express these ribbon operators in matrix product form and define a cost function that allows us to efficiently optimize over this ansatz class. We test this method on spin models with abelian topological order by finding ribbon operators for $\mathbb{Z}_d$ quantum double models with local fields and Ising-like terms. In addition, we identify ribbons in the abelian phase of Kitaev's honeycomb model which serve as the logical operators of the encoded qubit for the quantum error-correcting code. We further identify the topologically encoded qubit in the quantum compass model, and show that despite this qubit, the model does not support topological order. Finally, we discuss how the method supports generalizations for detecting nonabelian topological order.

abstract: Physical systems with loss or gain feature resonant modes that are decaying or growing exponentially with time. Whenever two such modes coalesce both in their resonant frequency and their rate of decay or growth, a so-called "exceptional point" occurs, around which many fascinating phenomena have recently been reported to arise. Particularly intriguing behavior is predicted to appear when encircling an exceptional point sufficiently slowly, like a state-flip or the accumulation of a geometric phase. Experiments dedicated to this issue could already successfully explore the topological structure of exceptional points, but a full dynamical encircling and the breakdown of adiabaticity inevitably associated with it remained out of reach of any measurement so far. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an exceptional point can be mapped onto the problem of scattering through a two-mode waveguide, which allows us for the first time to access the elusive effects occurring in this context. Specifically, we present experimental results from a waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an exceptional point during the transmission process. In this way mode transitions are induced that make this device perfectly suited as a robust and asymmetric switch between different waveguide modes. Our work opens up new and exciting avenues to explore exceptional point physics at the crossroads between fundamental research and practical applications.

abstract: A novel, optimized numerical method of modeling of an exciton-polariton superfluid in a semiconductor microcavity was proposed. Exciton-polaritons are spin-carrying quasiparticles formed from photons strongly coupled to excitons. They possess unique properties, interesting from the point of view of fundamental research as well as numerous potential applications. However, their numerical modeling is challenging due to the structure of nonlinear differential equations describing their evolution. In this paper, we propose to solve the equations with a modified Runge--Kutta method of 4th order, further optimized for efficient computations. The algorithms were implemented in form of C++ programs fitted for parallel environments and utilizing vector instructions. The programs form the EPCGP suite which have been used for theoretical investigation of exciton-polaritons.

abstract: We explain the concept of superadiabatic approximations and show how in the context of the Born- Oppenheimer approximation they lead to an explicit formula that can be used to predict transitions at avoided crossings. Based on this formula, we present a simple method for computing wave packet dynamics across avoided crossings. Only knowledge of the adiabatic electronic energy levels near the avoided crossing is required for the computation. In particular, this means that no diabatization procedure is necessary, the adiabatic energy levels can be computed on the fly, and they only need to be computed to higher accuracy when an avoided crossing is detected. We test the quality of our method on the paradigmatic example of photo-dissociation of NaI, finding very good agreement with results of exact wave packet calculations.

This system can be mapped onto a spin chain of the Heisenberg type with exchange coefficients that depend on the external trap. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can be used to compute these exchange coefficients. We introduce an open source code CONAN (Coefficients of One-dimensional N-Atom Networks) which is based on this algorithm. CONAN works with arbitrary external potentials and we have tested its reliability for system sizes up to around 35 particles. The computation time typically scales with the number of particles as $O(N^{3.5 \pm 0.4})$. Computation times are around 10 seconds for $N=10$ particles and less than 10 minutes for $N=20$ particles.

abstract: Development of exponentially scaling methods has seen great progress in tackling larger systems than previously thought possible. One such technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo, is a useful algorithm that allows exact diagonalization through stochastically sampling determinants. The method derives its utility from the information in the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, along with a stochastic projected wave function, to find the important parts of Hilbert space. However, the stochastic representation of the wave function is not required to search Hilbert space efficiently, and here we describe a highly efficient deterministic method to achieve chemical accuracy for a wide range of systems, including the difficult Cr$_{2}$ dimer. In addition our method also allows efficient calculation of excited state energies, for which we illustrate with benchmark results for the excited states of C$_{2}$.

abstract: We propose to control light trapping in a large ensemble of cold atoms by an external, static magnetic field. For an appropriate choice of frequency and polarization of the exciting pulse, the field is expected to speed up the fluorescence of a dilute atomic system but can significantly slow it down in a dense ensemble. The slowing down of fluorescence is due to the excitation of spatially localized collective atomic states that appear only under a strong magnetic field and have exponentially long lifetimes. The control of fluorescence by the magnetic field may be of interest for use in future quantum-information processing devices. It also paves a way towards the experimental observation of the disorder-induced localization of light in cold atomic systems.

abstract: The localization of the valence electron of $H$, $Li$ and $Na$ atoms enclosed by three different fullerene molecules is studied. The structure of the fullerene molecules is used to calculate the equilibrium position of the endohedrally atom as the minimum of the classical $(N+1)$-body Lennard-Jones potential. Once the position of the guest atom is determined, the fullerene cavity is modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule symmetry, and the enclosed atom is modeled by an effective one-electron potential. In order to examine whether the endohedral compound is formed by a neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene molecule $X@C_{N}$ or if the valence electron of the encapsulated atom localizes in the fullerene giving rise to a state with the form $X^{+}@C_{N}^{-}$, we analyze the electronic density, the projections onto free atomic states, and the weights of partial angular waves.

abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions play a key role in several condensed matter, cosmology and nuclear physics theoretical models. Its observation in real systems is often hampered by finite temperatures and limited control of the system parameters. In this work we report for the first time the experimental observation of the full quantum phase diagram across a transition where the spatial parity symmetry is broken. Our system is made of an ultra-cold gas with tunable attractive interactions trapped in a spatially symmetric double-well potential. At a critical value of the interaction strength, we observe a continuous quantum phase transition where the gas spontaneously localizes in one well or the other, thus breaking the underlying symmetry of the system. Furthermore, we show the robustness of the asymmetric state against controlled energy mismatch between the two wells. This is the result of hysteresis associated with an additional discontinuous quantum phase transition that we fully characterize. Our results pave the way to the study of quantum critical phenomena at finite temperature, the investigation of macroscopic quantum tunneling of the order parameter in the hysteretic regime and the production of strongly quantum entangled states at critical points.

Kadyshevsky devoted to the creation of the which \emph{\emph{to the geometric quantum field theory with a fundamental mass}} containing non-Hermitian mass extensions. It is important that these ideas recently received a powerful development in the form of construction of the non-Hermitian algebraic approach. The central point of these theories is the construction of new scalar products in which the average values of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are valid. Among numerous works on this subject may be to allocate as purely mathematical and containing a discussion of experimental results. In this regard, we consider as the development of algebraic relativistic pseudo-Hermitian quantum theory with a maximal mass and experimentally significant investigations are discussed

abstract: Recently the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, especially methods of quantum probability theory, started to be widely used in a variety of applications outside of physics, e.g., cognition and psychology as well as economy and finances. To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical models, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak about, e.g., "quantum cognition"). These novel applications generate a number of foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science - foundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was mainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the probabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive psychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical probability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by the formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another question attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications, there are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover completely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability models have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in foundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check Sorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note we present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of this test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum probability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional quantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting experimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition.

abstract: We have proposed a unified framework towards the dynamics of optical and electron vortex beams from the perspective of geometric phase and the associated Hall effects. The unification is attributed to the notion that the spin degrees of freedom of a relativistic particle, either massive or massless, is associated with a vortex line. %The formulation in cylindrical coordinates leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum(OAM). Based on cylindrical corodinate formulation, which leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum (OAM), it can be shown that when electron vortex beams (EVBs) move in an external electric field paraxial beams give rise to OAM Hall effect and non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices initiate spin Hall effect in free space as well as in an external field. A similar analysis reveals that the paraxial optical vortex beams(OVBs) in an inhomogeneous medium induce OAM Hall effect whereas non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices drive the spin Hall effect. Moreover, both OVBs and EVBs with tilted vortices give rise to OAM states with arbitrary fractional value.

abstract: Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers [1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast to the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to be performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near zero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have identified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic chains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of Majoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire segment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced superconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy splitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred nanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied, as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor of about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices longer than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs through a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum, yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling of topological protection with end-mode separation.

abstract: The spectrum of 1-state and 2-states per line quantum buses is used to determine the effective $V_{ab}(N)$ electronic coupling between emitter and receiver states through the bus as a function of the number $N$ of parallel lines in the bus. When the calculation of $V_{ab}(N)$ is spectrally difficult, an Heisenberg-Rabi time dependent quantum exchange process can be triggered through the bus by preparing a specific initial non-stationanry state and identifying a target state to capture the effective oscillation frequency $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ between those. For $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ (for $V_{ab}(N)$), two different regimes are observed as a function of $N$: linear and $\sqrt{N}$ more moderate increases. This state preparation was remplaced by electronically coupling the quantum bus to two semi-infinite electrodes. The native quantum transduction process at work in this tunnel junction is not faithfully following the $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ variations with $N$. Due to normalisation to unity of the electronic transparency of the quantum bus and to the low pass filter character of the transduction, large $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ cannot be followed by the tunnel junction. At low coupling and when $N$ is small enough not to compensate the small through line coupling, an $N^2$ power law is preserved for $\Omega_{ab}(N)$. The limitations of the quantum transduction in a tunnel junction is pointing how the broadly used concept of electrical contact between a metallic nanopad and a molecular wire can be better described as a quantum transduction process.

abstract: The past few decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to manipulate and coherently control matter-waves. Although the duality between particles and waves has been well tested since de Broglie introduced the matter-wave analog of the optical wavelength in 1924, manipulating atoms with a level of coherence that enables one to use these properties for precision measurements has only become possible with our ability to produce atomic samples exhibiting temperatures of only a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. Since the initial experiments a few decades ago, the field of atom optics has developed in many ways, with both fundamental and applied significance. The exquisite control of matter waves offers the prospect of a new generation of force sensors exhibiting unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy, for applications from navigation and geophysics to tests of general relativity. Thanks to the latest developments in this field, the first commercial products using this quantum technology are now available. In the future, our ability to create large coherent ensembles of atoms will allow us an even more precise control of the matter-wave and the ability to create highly entangled states for non-classical atom interferometry.

abstract: Sound waves in and dielectric liquid, that consists of subsystems of valency electrons with effective mass and ions which interact through the long-wave potential electric field are considered, on analogies with and metallic liquid, but with the requirement, that electric current is absent. It is shown that usual description of sound wave in an ideal liquid as wave of mass density and mass velocity follows from the offered consideration. It is also shown that sound waves with other side can be considered as waves of potential electric field in an environment. Introduction of phonons in both cases is considered.

abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of entanglement entropy, induced by an oscillating time periodic driving of the transverse field, h(t), of a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We consider several realizations of h(t), and we find a number of results in analogy with entanglement entropy dynamics induced by a sudden quantum quench. After short-time relaxation, the dynamics of entanglement entropy synchronises with h(t), displaying an oscillatory behaviour at the frequency of the driving. Synchronisation in the dynamics of entanglement entropy, is spoiled by the appearance of quasi-revivals which fade out in the thermodynamic limit, and which we interpret using a quasi-particle picture adapted to periodic drivings. Taking the time-average of the entanglement entropy in the synchronised regime, we find that it obeys a volume law scaling with the subsystem's size. Such result is reminiscent of a thermal state or of a Generalised Gibbs ensemble of a quenched Ising chain, although the system does not heat up towards infinite temperature as a consequence of the integrability of the model.

abstract: A new, so called odd Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible covariant tensor representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n). The related Gel'fand-Zetlin patterns are based upon the decomposition according to a particular chain of subalgebras of gl(n|n). This chain contains only genuine Lie superalgebras of type gl(k|l) with k and l nonzero (apart from the final element of the chain which is gl(1|0)=gl(1)). Explicit expressions for a set of generators of the algebra on this Gel'fand-Zetlin basis are determined. The results are extended to an explicit construction of a class of irreducible highest weight modules of the general linear Lie superalgebra gl(\infty|\infty).

abstract: Hysteresis can be found in driven many-body systems such as magnets and superfluids. Rate-dependent hysteresis arises when a system is driven periodically while relaxing towards equilibrium. A two-state paramagnet driven by an oscillating magnetic field in the relaxation approximation clearly demonstrates rate-dependent hysteresis. A noninteracting atomic Fermi gas in an optical ring potential, when driven by a periodic artificial gauge field and subjected to dissipation, is shown to exhibit hysteresis loops of atomic current due to a competition of the driving time and the relaxation time. This is in contrast to electronic systems exhibiting equilibrium persistent current driven by magnetic flux due to rapid relaxation. Universal behavior of the dissipated energy in one hysteresis loop is observed in both the magnetic and atomic systems, showing linear and inverse-linear dependence on the relaxation time in the strong and weak dissipation regimes. While interactions in general invalidate the framework for rate-dependent hysteresis, an atomic Fermi gas with artificial spin-orbit coupling exhibits hysteresis loops of atomic currents. Cold-atoms in ring-shape potentials are thus promising in demonstrating rate-dependent hysteresis and its associated phenomena.

abstract: We critically discuss the measure of very short time intervals. By means of a Gedankenexperiment, we describe an ideal clock based on the occurrence of completely random events. Many previous thought experiments have suggested fundamental Planck-scale limits on measurements of distance and time. Here we present a new type of thought experiment, based on a different type of clock, that provide further support for the existence of such limits. We show that the minimum time interval $\Delta t$ that this clock can measure scales as the inverse of its size $\Delta r$. This implies an uncertainty relation between space and time: $\Delta r$ $\Delta t$ $> G \hbar / c^4$; where G, $\hbar$ and c are the gravitational constant, the reduced Planck constant, and the speed of light, respectively. We outline and briefly discuss the implications of this uncertainty conjecture.

abstract: The complete characterisation of the charge transport in a mesoscopic device is provided by the Full Counting Statistics (FCS) $P_t(m)$, describing the amount of charge $Q = me$ transmitted during the time $t$. Although numerous systems have been theoretically characterized by their FCS, the experimental measurement of the distribution function $P_t(m)$ or its moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$ are rare and often plagued by strong back-action. Here, we present a strategy for the measurement of the FCS, more specifically its characteristic function $\chi(\lambda)$ and moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$, by a qubit with a set of different couplings $\lambda_j$, $j = 1,\dots,k,\dots k+p$, $k = \lceil n/2 \rceil$, $p \geq 0$, to the mesoscopic conductor. The scheme involves multiple readings of Ramsey sequences at the different coupling strengths $\lambda_j$ and we find the optimal distribution for these couplings $\lambda_j$ as well as the optimal distribution $N_j$ of $N = \sum N_j$ measurements among the different couplings $\lambda_j$. We determine the precision scaling for the moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$ with the number $N$ of invested resources and show that the standard quantum limit can be approached when many additional couplings $p\gg 1$ are included in the measurement scheme.

abstract: Recent results in deeply subwavelength thickness films demonstrated coherent control and logical gate operations with both classical and single photon light sources. However, quantum processing and devices typically involve more than one photon and non-trivial input quantum states. Here we experimentally investigate two-photon N00N state coherent absorption in a multilayer graphene film. Depending on the N00N state input phase, it is possible to selectively choose between single or two photon absorption of the input state in the graphene film. These results demonstrate that coherent absorption in the quantum regime exhibits unique features opening up applications in multiphoton spectroscopy and imaging.

abstract: We analyze the generation process of quantum fluctuations in the quantum Ising model in order to characterize the entanglement dynamic properties between two distant qubits (spins). Starting from a strong dominant magnetic field where the spin system is in a paramagnetic regime, we switch on a spin coupling susceptible of creating correlations responsible for the ferromagnetism order. We use the large coordination expansion method to study two cases: the adiabatic switching that monitors the evolution of the ground state until it reaches the quantum transition to ordered states; a sudden sweep (quench) that monitors instead the wave behavior of the quantum fluctuations and simulate the generation of off-site correlations.

abstract: We consider the quantum centipede made of $N$ fermionic quantum walkers on the one-dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all hard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads ballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the interactions between the internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its center-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time limit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution. The spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the first few values of $N$. Some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary $N$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-$N$ limit.

abstract: In the presented note we aim at exploring the possibility of abandoning complex numbers in the representation of quantum states and operations. We demonstrate a simplified version of quantum mechanics in which the states are represented using real numbers only. The main advantage of this approach is that the simulation of the $n$-dimensional quantum system requires $n^2$ real numbers, in contrast to the standard case where $n^4$ real numbers are required. The main disadvantage is the lack of hermicity in the representation of quantum states. Using Mathematica computer algebra system we develop a set of functions for manipulating real-only quantum states. With the help of this tool we study the properties of the introduced representation and the induced representation of quantum channels.

abstract: We demonstrate fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP) cavities with concave mirrors that can be operated at cavity lengths as large as 1.5mm without significant deterioration of the finesse. This is achieved by using a laser dot machining technique to shape spherical mirrors with ultralow roughness and employing single-mode fibers with large mode area for good mode matching to the cavity. Additionally, in contrast to previous FFPs, these cavities can be used over an octave-spanning frequency range with adequate coatings. We also show directly that shape deviations caused by the fiber's index profile lead to a finesse decrease as observed in earlier attempts to build long FFP cavities, and show a way to overcome this problem.

abstract: Coherent dressing of a quantum two-level system provides access to a new quantum system with improved properties - a different and easily tuneable level splitting, faster control, and longer coherence times. In our work we investigate the properties of the dressed, donor-bound electron spin in silicon, and probe its potential for the use as quantum bit in scalable architectures. The two dressed spin-polariton levels constitute a quantum bit that can be coherently driven with an oscillating magnetic field, an oscillating electric field, by frequency modulating the driving field, or by a simple detuning pulse. We measure coherence times of $T_{2\rho}^*=2.4$ ms and $T_{2\rho}^{\rm Hahn}=9$ ms, one order of magnitude longer than those of the undressed qubit. Furthermore, the use of the dressed states enables coherent coupling of the solid-state spins to electric fields and mechanical oscillations.

abstract: We investigate a hybrid quantum system consisting of spatially separated resonant exchange qubits, defined in three-electron semiconductor triple quantum dots, that are coupled via a superconducting transmission line resonator. Drawing on methods from circuit quantum electrodynamics and Hartmann-Hahn double resonance techniques, we analyze three specific approaches for implementing resonator-mediated two-qubit entangling gates in both dispersive and resonant regimes of interaction. We calculate entangling gate fidelities as well as the rate of relaxation via phonons for resonant exchange qubits in silicon triple dots and show that such an implementation is particularly well-suited to achieving the strong coupling regime. Our approach combines the favorable coherence properties of encoded spin qubits in silicon with the rapid and robust long-range entanglement provided by circuit QED systems.

abstract: We present a first-principles CFT calculation corresponding to the spherical collapse of a shell of matter in three dimensional quantum gravity. In field theory terms, we describe the equilibration process, from early times to thermalization, of a CFT following a sudden injection of energy at time t=0. By formulating a continuum version of Zamolodchikov's monodromy method to calculate conformal blocks at large central charge c, we give a framework to compute a general class of probe observables in the collapse state, incorporating the full backreaction of matter fields on the dual geometry. This is illustrated by calculating a scalar field two-point function at time-like separation and the time-dependent entanglement entropy of an interval, both showing thermalization at late times. The results are in perfect agreement with previous gravity calculations in the AdS$_3$-Vaidya geometry. Information loss appears in the CFT as an explicit violation of unitarity in the 1/c expansion, restored by nonperturbative corrections.

abstract: In this paper, based on lectures by the authors at the May 2015 workshop {\it Resurgence, Physics and Numbers}, at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgio of the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, we explain the origin of resurgent trans-series in the Mathieu equation spectral problem, using uniform WKB and all-orders (exact) WKB. Exact quantization conditions naturally arise, and their expansion in the weak coupling regime produces resurgent trans-series expressions which exhibit precise relations between different instanton sectors. Indeed, the perturbative expansion encodes all orders of the multi-instanton expansion, an explicit realization of the general concept of "resurgence". We also discuss the transition from weak to strong coupling, an explicit realization of "instanton condensation".

abstract: Tensor network (TN) methods, in particular the Matrix Product States (MPS) ansatz, have proven to be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of lattice gauge theories. They allow for a very good precision, much better than standard Monte Carlo (MC) techniques for the models that have been studied so far, due to the possibility of reaching much smaller lattice spacings. The real reason for the interest in the TN approach, however, is its ability, shown so far in several condensed matter models, to deal with theories which exhibit the notorious sign problem in MC simulations. This makes it prospective for dealing with the non-zero chemical potential in QCD and other lattice gauge theories, as well as with real-time simulations. In this paper, using matrix product operators, we extend our analysis of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to show the feasibility of this approach also at finite temperature. This is an important step on the way to deal with the sign problem of QCD. We analyze in detail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases and show that the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of temperatures, essentially from zero to infinite temperature.

abstract: By modelling heat engines as driven multi-partite system we show that their dissipation can be expressed in terms of the lag (relative entropy) between the perturbed state of each partition and their equilibrium state, and the correlations that build up among the partitions. We illustrate the rich interplay between correlations and lags with a two-qubit device driven by a quantum gate.

abstract: We study the environment assisted local transitionless dynamics in closed spin systems driven through quantum critical points. In general shortcut to adaiabaticity (STA) in quantum critical systems requires highly non-local control Hamiltonians. In this work we develop an approach to achieve local shortcuts to adiabaticity (LSTA) in spin chains, using local control fields which scale polynomially with the system size, following universal critical exponents. We relate the control fields to reduced fidelity susceptibility and use transverse Ising model in one dimension to exemplify our generic results. We also extend our analysis to achieve LSTA in central spin models.

abstract: We study the excitonic coupling and homogeneous spectral line width of brick layer J-aggregate films. We begin by analysing the structural information revealed by the two-exciton states probed in two-dimensional spectra. Our first main result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the spectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for the same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure, which leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices. We next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population relaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in linear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure dephasing dominates the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover temperature, which explains the linear temperature dependence of the homogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased density of states at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the contribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are suggested to directly measure the lifetime of the bright state and can therefore support the proposed model.

abstract: We have investigated the one-way surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the interface of a continuous magneto-plasma material and metal. We demonstrated that TM modes inside a continuous material can be assigned non-trivial Chern numbers analogous to those of topological photonic crystals; moreover these Chern numbers can be calculated analytically. This leads to the appearance of topologically protected surface modes propagating at frequencies inside the bandgap of the magneto-plasma. Previous works considered 2D structures; here we consider the effects of 3D defects, and show that, although backward propagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take place and it has significant effect on the propagation of the surface mode. Several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of side-scattering, and we also consider the effects of metal loss.

abstract: We provide a discussion of some main ideas in our project about the physical foundation of the time concept in cosmology. It is standard to point to the Planck scale (located at $\sim 10^{-43}$ seconds after a fictitious "Big Bang" point) as a limit for how far back we may extrapolate the standard cosmological model. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically motivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude before the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model and its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are connected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine the notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such considerations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly acute above the electroweak phase transition (before $\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds). Other limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame, or even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe constituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if a pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say, $\sim 10^{-34}$ seconds.

abstract: We actively stabilize the harmonic oscillation frequency of a laser-cooled atomic ion confined in a rf Paul trap by sampling and rectifying the high voltage rf applied to the trap electrodes. We are able to stabilize the 1 MHz atomic oscillation frequency to better than 10 Hz, or 10 ppm. This represents a suppression of ambient noise on the rf circuit by 34 dB. This technique could impact the sensitivity of ion trap mass spectrometry and the fidelity of quantum operations in ion trap quantum information applications.

abstract: Calculating strong-field, momentum-resolved photoelectron spectra (PES) from numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is a very demanding task due to the large spatial excursions and drifts of electrons in intense laser fields. The time-dependent surface flux (t-SURFF) method for the calculation of PES [L. Tao, A. Scrinzi, New Journal of Physics 14, 013021 (2012)] allows to keep the numerical grid much smaller than the space over which the wavefunction would be spread at the end of the laser pulse. We present an implementation of the t-SURFF method in the well established TDSE-solver Qprop [D. Bauer, P. Koval, Comput. Phys. Commun. 174, 396 (2006)]. Qprop efficiently propagates wavefunctions for single-active electron systems with spherically symmetric binding potentials in classical, linearly (along $z$) or elliptically (in the $xy$-plane) polarized laser fields in dipole approximation. Its combination with t-SURFF makes the simulation of PES feasible in cases where it is just too expensive to keep the entire wavefunction on the numerical grid, e.g., in the long-wavelength or long-pulse regime.

abstract: LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ heterostructure with polar and non-polar constituents has been shown to exhibit interface metallic conductivity due to fractional charge transfer to the interface. The interface reconstruction by electron redistribution along (001) orientation, in which half of an electron is transferred per two dimensional unit cell to the adjacent planes, resulting in a net transfer of half of the charge, to both the interface and top most atomic planes, has been ascribed to a polar discontinuity at the interface in the Polar Catastrophe model. This avoids the divergence of electrostatic potential, as the number of layers are increased, producing an oscillatory electric field and finite potential. Akin to the description of charge fractionalization in quasi one-dimensional polyacetylene by the field theoretic Jackiw-Rebbi model with fermions interacting with topologically non-trivial background field, we show an analogous connection between polar catastrophe model and Bell-Rajaraman model, where the charge fractionalization occurs in the soliton free sector as an end effect.

abstract: We show that degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in nonlinear optics can be described by an effective Hamiltonian that is pseudo-Hermitian, which enables a transition between a pseudo-Hermitian phase with real eigenvalues and a broken pseudo-Hermitian phase with complex conjugate eigenvalues. While bearing certain similarity to that in Parity-Time symmetric systems, this transition is in stark contrast because of the absence of gain and loss in the effective Hamiltonian. The latter is real after factoring out the system decay, and the onset of non-Hermiticity in degenerate FWM is due to the total phase change of the signal wave and the idler wave. This property underlines the intrinsic coherence in FWM, which opens the door to probe quantum implications of exceptional points.

abstract: Today's best atomic clocks are limited by frequency noise on the lasers used to interrogate the atoms. A proposed solution to this problem is to create a superradiant laser using an optical clock transition as its gain medium. This laser would act as an active atomic clock, and would be highly immune to the fluctuations in reference cavity length that limit today's best lasers. Here, we demonstrate and characterize superradiant emission from the mHz linewidth clock transition in an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Sr atoms trapped within a high-finesse optical cavity. We measure a collective enhancement of the emission rate into the cavity mode by a factor of more than 10,000 compared to independently radiating atoms. We also demonstrate a method for seeding superradiant emission and observe interference between two independent transitions lasing simultaneously. We use this interference to characterize the relative spectral properties of the two lasing sub-ensembles.

abstract: This paper considers the problem of communication over a memoryless classical-quantum wiretap channel subject to the constraint that the eavesdropper on the channel should not be able to learn whether the legitimate parties are using the channel to communicate or not. Specifically, the relative entropy between the output quantum states at the eavesdropper when a codeword is transmitted and when no input is provided must be sufficiently small. Extending earlier works, this paper proves the "square-root law" for a broad class of classical-quantum channels: the maximum amount of information that can be reliably and covertly transmitted over $n$ uses of such a channel scales like $\sqrt{n}$. The scaling constant is also determined.

abstract: We present a pulsed four-wave mixing (FWM) scheme via a Rydberg state to create, store and retrieve collective Rydberg polaritons. The storage medium consists of a gas of thermal Rb atoms confined in a 220 {\mu}m thick cell, which are heated above room temperature. The experimental sequence consists of a pulsed excitation of Rydberg polaritons via the D1 line, a variable delay or storage time, and a final retrieval pulse via the D2 line. The lifetime of the Rydberg polaritons is around 1.2 ns, almost entirely limited by the excitation bandwidth and the corresponding motional dephasing of the atoms. The presented scheme combined with a tightly confined atomic ensemble is a good candidate for a deterministic single-photon source, as soon as strong interactions in terms of a Rydberg blockade are added.

abstract: The ESA mission "Space Optical Clock" project aims at operating an optical lattice clock on the ISS in approximately 2023. The scientific goals of the mission are to perform tests of fundamental physics, to enable space-assisted relativistic geodesy and to intercompare optical clocks on the ground using microwave and optical links. The performance goal of the space clock is less than $1 \times 10^{-17}$ uncertainty and $1 \times 10^{-15} {\tau}^{-1/2}$ instability. Within an EU-FP7-funded project, a strontium optical lattice clock demonstrator has been developed. Goal performances are instability below $1 \times 10^{-15} {\tau}^{-1/2}$ and fractional inaccuracy $5 \times 10^{-17}$. For the design of the clock, techniques and approaches suitable for later space application are used, such as modular design, diode lasers, low power consumption subunits, and compact dimensions. The Sr clock apparatus is fully operational, and the clock transition in $^{88}$Sr was observed with linewidth as small as 9 Hz.

abstract: A major limitations for many heat engines is that their functioning demands on-line control, and/or an external fitting between environmental parameters (e.g. temperatures of thermal baths) and internal parameters of the engine. We study a model for an adaptive heat engine, where---due to feedback from the functional part---the engine's structure adapts to given thermal baths. Hence no on-line control and no external fitting are needed. The engine can employ unknown resources, it can also adapt to results of its own functioning that makes the bath temperatures closer. We determine thermodynamic costs of adaptation and relate them to the prior information available about the environment. We also discuss informational constraints on the structure-function interaction that are necessary for adaptation.

abstract: The dynamics of spatial coherence and momentum distribution of polaritons in the regime of Bose-Einstein condensation are investigated in a GaAs microcavity with embedded quantum wells under nonresonant excitation with picosecond laser pulses. It is shown that the onset of the condensate first order sparial coherence is accompanied by narrowing of the polariton momentum distribution. At the same time, at sufficiently high excitation densities, there is significant qualitative discrepancy between the dynamic behavior of the width of the polariton momentum distribution determined from direct measurements and that calculated from the coherence spatial distribution. This discrepancy is observed at the fast initial stage of the polariton system kinetics and, apparently, results from the strong spatial nonuniformity of the phase of the condensate wave function, which equilibrates on a much longer time scale.

abstract: The time-dependent energy transfer in a driven quantum system strongly coupled to a heat bath is studied within an influence functional approach. Exact formal expressions for the statistics of energy dissipation into the different channels are derived. The general method is applied to the driven dissipative two-state system. It is shown that the energy flows obey a balance relation, and that, for strong coupling, the interaction may constitute the major dissipative channel. Results in analytic form are presented for a particular value of strong Ohmic dissipation. The energy flows show interesting behaviors including driving-induced coherences and quantum stochastic resonances.

The Rabi splitting of eigenfrequencies of coupled motion is observed both in the cavity reflection spectrum and ac current of electrons, the latter probed by measuring their bolometric photoresponse. Despite the fact that similar observations of the Rabi splitting in many-particle systems have been described as a quantum-mechanical effect, we show that the observed splitting can be explained completely by a model based on the classical electrodynamics.

When then turn to general features in the time evolution of local observables after the quench, using a simple model of free fermions as an example. In the second part we present an overview of recent progress in describing quench dynamics in two key paradigms for quantum integrable models, the transverse field Ising chain and the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.

abstract: Ultracold bosons in a triangular lattice are a promising candidate for observing quantum spin liquid behavior. Here we investigate, for such system, the role of a harmonic trap giving rise to an inhomogeneous density. We construct a modified spin-wave theory for arbitrary filling, and predict the breakdown of order for certain values of the lattice anisotropy. These regimes, identified with the spin liquid phases, are found to be quite robust upon changes in the filling factor. This result is backed by an exact diagonalization study on a small lattice.

We label classes of the analyzed set $W$ by pairs of numbers counting the exposed faces of dimension one and two. Generically, $W$ belongs to the class of ovals. Assuming $\dim(W)=3$, the faces of dimension two are ellipses and only ten classes exist. We identify an object in each class and use random matrices and dual varieties for illustrations.

abstract: We investigate the transmission of both classical and quantum information between two arbitrary observers in globally hyperbolic spacetimes using a quantum field as a communication channel. The field is supposed to be in some arbitrary quasifree state and no choice of representation of its canonical commutation relations is made. Both sender and receiver posses some localized two-level quantum system with which they can interact with the quantum field to prepare the input and receive the output of the channel, respectively. The interaction between the two-level systems and the quantum field is such that one can trace out the field degrees of freedom exactly and thus obtain the quantum channel in a non-perturbative way. We end the paper determining the unassisted as well as the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum channel capacities.

abstract: This article gives an overview on recent theoretical progress in controlling the charge and spin dynamics in nanostructures by means of ultrashort, broadband electromagnetic pulses. A particular focus is put on so-called half-cycle and single-cycle pulses that offer efficient schemes for coherent control. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is shorter than the characteristic time scales of the unperturbed system. We summarize the current knowledge presenting a consistent theoretical approach for describing the action of such pulses on charge carriers in nanostructures. In essence, the action amounts to a quantum map between the system quantum states at an appropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence of a particular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several integral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The implications of the theory for acting on the system with a periodic pulse sequence are described. Steering the system to a target quantum state, we work out and discuss conditions for the sustainability of this coherent state. Associated physical quantities characterizing the quasistationarity of a periodically evolving quantum dynamics are introduced and analyzed. This approach is used to control charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom in nanostructures on picosecond and subpicosecond time scales. An overview is given over several applications in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires and superlattices, double quantum dots, semiconductor and graphene quantum rings. The integrated and time-dependent spectra of the light emitted from the driven system deliver information on its spin-dependent dynamics. We review examples of such spectra emitted from pulse-driven nanostructures as well as a possibility to characterize and control the light polarization on an ultrafast time scale.

We use a DMD to probe a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity in single-mode and near-degenerate confocal configurations. Pumping arbitrary modes of the cavity is possible with excellent specificity by virtue of the spatial overlap between the incident light field and the cavity mode.

abstract: We consider light dynamics in a circular multicore fiber with balanced gain and loss core distribution, and show that transition from unbroken to broken $\mathcal{PT}$ phases can be conveniently controlled by geometric twist of the fiber. The twist introduces Peierls' phases in the coupling constants and thus acts as an artificial gauge field. As an application, we discuss twist-induced tuning of optical transmission in a six-core fiber with one lossy core.

abstract: The sensitivity of classical and quantum sensing is impaired in a noisy environment. Thus, one of the main challenges facing sensing protocols is to reduce the noise while preserving the signal. State of the art quantum sensing protocols that rely on dynamical decoupling achieve this goal under the restriction of long noise correlation times. We implement a proof of principle experiment of a protocol to recover sensitivity by using an error correction for photonic systems that does not have this restriction. The protocol uses a protected entangled qubit to correct a bit-flip error. Our results show a recovery of about 87% of the sensitivity, independent of the noise rate.

abstract: We discuss a model of quantum photosynthesis with degeneracy in the light-harvesting system. We consider interaction of excitons in chromophores with light and phonons (vibrations of environment). These interactions have dipole form but are different (are related to non-parallel vectors of "bright" states). We show that this leads to excitation of non-decaying "dark" states. We discuss relation of this model to the known from spectroscopical experiments phenomenon of existence of photonic echo in quantum photosynthesis.

The observed rapid decay rate is accompanied by its counterpart, the cooperative Lamb shift. The rate of the strongly directional decay, and the associated shift, scale linearly with the number of atoms and show a strong dependence on the sample shape, demonstrating the collective nature of the observed quantities.

abstract: The virial expansion for cold two-component Fermi and Bose atomic gases is considered in presence of a waveguide and in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. The interaction between atoms and the coupling with the Feshbach molecules is modeled by using a quantitative separable two-channel model. The scattering phase-shift in a atomic waveguide is defined. This permits to extend the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the second order virial coefficient to this inhomogeneous case.

abstract: Both metaphysical and practical considerations related to time inversion have intrigued scientists for generations. Physicists have strived to devise and implement time-inversion protocols, in particular different forms of "time mirrors" for classical waves. Here we propose two conceptually different realisations of instantaneous time mirrors for quantum systems, i.e. controlled time discontinuities acting through pulses on wavefronts and leading to distinct wave function echoes with high fidelities. The first concept exploits up to now unrelated mechanisms of wavefront time inversion and population reversal in spatially extended two-level systems, the latter quintessential to spin echoes. It can be implemented in Dirac-like systems, such as (real or artificial) graphene. The second protocol is based on a non-linear mirror for a Bose-Einstein condensate whose dynamics is described by the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation, and is realisable in cold atom setups.

abstract: Interest in the black hole information paradox has recently been catalyzed by the newer "firewall" argument. The crux of the updated argument is that previous solutions which relied on observer complementarity are in violation of the quantum condition of monogamy of entanglement; with the prescribed remedy being to discard the equivalence principle in favor of an energy barrier (or firewall) at the black hole horizon. Differing points of view have been put forward, including the "ER=EPR" counterargument and the final-state solution, both of which can be viewed as potential resolutions to the apparent conflict between quantum monogamy and Einstein equivalence. After reviewing these recent developments, this paper argues that the ER=EPR and final-state solutions can -- thanks to observer complementarity -- be seen as the same resolution of the paradox but from two different perspectives: inside and outside the black hole.

abstract: We discuss electron transfer in benchmark donor-bridge-acceptor systems using time-dependent methods based on exact diagonalizations. For the small bridge sizes studied, the exact solution leads to results far different from perturbation theory. Notably, we do not obtain destructive interferences in the electron transfer for the arrangements of the bridge molecules which lead to this result using the perturbation theory. The calculated currents for various donor-bridge-acceptor configurations attached to electrodes show two distinct regimes: hopping and tunnelling, where in the latter, the current increases as a function of the energy of the transferred electron, a regime inaccessible by conventional scattering theory.

abstract: The Sagnac speed meter interferometer topology can potentially provide enhanced sensitivity to gravitational waves in the audio-band compared to equivalent Michelson interferometers. A challenge with the Sagnac speed meter interferometer arises from the intrinsic lack of sensitivity at low frequencies where the velocity-proportional signal is smaller than the noise associated with the sensing of the signal. Using as an example the on-going proof-of-concept Sagnac speed meter experiment in Glasgow, we quantify the problem and present a solution involving the extraction of a small displacement-proportional signal. This displacement signal can be combined with the existing velocity signal to enhance low frequency sensitivity, and we derive optimal filters to accomplish this for different signal strengths. We show that the extraction of the displacement signal for low frequency control purposes can be performed without reducing significantly the quantum non-demolition character of this type of interferometer.

abstract: We show that the second law of thermodynamics holds for isolated genuine quantum systems, where pure quantum states obey unitary dynamics, by a rigorous theoretical proof based on the Lieb-Robinson bound and numerical simulation. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem is shown connected to thermodynamic heat, highlighting the foundation of the information-thermodynamics link. Furthermore, we show that the nonequilibrium fluctuation theorem, characterizing the small probability of occasional entropy decrease, holds true for pure quantum states, which implies that thermal fluctuations emerge from purely quantum fluctuations in nonequilibrium dynamics. Our result establishes a scenario that thermodynamics emerges from quantum mechanics, and can experimentally be tested by ultracold atoms.

abstract: In a previous article [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 084108 (2013)], we showed that the transition-state-theory ($t\rightarrow 0_+$) limit of ring-polymer molecular dynamics rate-theory (RPMD-TST) is also the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit of a new type of quantum flux-side time-correlation function, in which the dividing surfaces are invariant to imaginary-time translation; in other words, that RPMD-TST is a $t\rightarrow 0_+$ quantum transition-state theory (QTST). Recently, Jang and Voth [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 084110 (2016)] rederived this quantum $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit, and claimed that it gives instead the centroid-density approximation. Here we show that the $t\rightarrow 0_+$ limit derived by Jang and Voth is in fact RPMD-TST.

abstract: Given two quantum states of $N$ q-bits we are interested to find the shortest quantum circuit consisting of only one- and two- q-bit gates that would transfer one state into another. We call it the quantum maze problem for the reasons described in the paper. We argue that in a large $N$ limit the quantum maze problem is equivalent to the problem of finding a semiclassical trajectory of some lattice field theory (the dual theory) on an $N+1$ dimensional space-time with geometrically flat, but topologically compact spatial slices. The spatial fundamental domain is an $N$ dimensional hyper-rhombohedron, and the temporal direction describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary target state. We first consider a complex Klein-Gordon field theory and argue that it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not involve generators composed of tensor products of multiple Pauli $Z$ matrices. Since such situation is not generic we call it the $Z$-problem. On the dual field theory side the $Z$-problem corresponds to massless excitations of the phase (Goldstone modes) that we attempt to fix using Higgs mechanism. The simplest dual theory which does not suffer from the massless excitation (or from the $Z$-problem) is the Abelian-Higgs model which we argue can be used for finding the shortest quantum circuits. Since every trajectory of the field theory is mapped directly to a quantum circuit, the shortest quantum circuits are identified with semiclassical trajectories. We also discuss the complexity of an actual algorithm that uses a dual theory prospective for solving the quantum maze problem and compare it with a geometric approach. We argue that it might be possible to solve the problem in sub-exponential time in $2^N$, but for that we must consider the Klein-Gordon theory on curved spatial geometry and/or more complicated (than $N$-torus) topology.

abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of optical pathways for formation of cold Ca($^1$S)Na$^+$($^1$S) molecular ions via an intermediate state. The formation schemes are based on ab initio potential energy curves and transition dipole moments calculated using effective-core-potential methods of quantum chemistry. In the proposed approach, starting from a mixture of cold trapped Ca$^+$ ions immersed into an ultracold gas of Na atoms, (NaCa)$^+$ molecular ions are photoassociated in the excited E$^{1}\Sigma^+$ electronic state and allowed to spontaneously decay either to the ground electronic state or an intermediate state from which the population is transferred to the ground state via an additional optical excitation. By analyzing all possible pathways, we find that the efficiency of a two-photon scheme, via either B$^{1}\Sigma^+$ or C$^{1}\Sigma^+$ potential, is sufficient to produce significant quantities of ground state (NaCa)$^+$ molecular ions. A single-step process results in lower formation rates that would require either a high density sample or a very intense photoassociation laser to be viable.

abstract: Near transform-limited single photon sources are required for perfect photon indistinguishability in quantum networks. Having such sources in nanodiamonds is particularly important since it can enable engineering hybrid quantum photonic systems. In this letter, we report the generation of optically stable, nearly transform-limited single silicon vacancy emitters in nanodiamonds. Lines as narrow as 325 MHz are reported, which is comparable to the lifetime limited linewidth. Moreover, the emitters exhibit minimal spectrum diffusion and absolute photostability, even if pumped well above saturation. Our results suggest that nanodiamonds can host color centers with supreme properties suitable for hybrid photonic devices and quantum information.

abstract: In this letter we explore how the microscopic dynamics of charge transfer (CT) excitons are influenced by the presence of an external magnetic field in disordered molecular semiconductors. This influence is driven by the dynamic interplay between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the electron-hole pair. To account for this interplay we have developed a numerical framework that combines a traditional model of quantum spin dynamics with a coarse-grained model of stochastic charge transport. This combination provides a general and efficient methodology for simulating the effects of magnetic field on CT state dynamics, therefore providing a basis for revealing the microscopic origin of experimentally observed magnetic field effects. We demonstrate that simulations carried out on our model are capable of reproducing experimental results as well as generating theoretical predictions related to the efficiency of organic electronic materials.

abstract: One of the main interest in quantum cosmology is to determine which type of boundary conditions for the wave function of the universe can predict observational data of our universe. For this purpose, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation numerically and evaluate probabilities for an observable representing evolution of the classical universe, especially, the number of e-foldings of the inflation. To express boundary conditions of the wave function, we use exact solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with constant scalar field potential. These exact solutions include wave functions with well known boundary condition proposals, the no-boundary proposal and the tunneling proposal. We specify them introducing two real parameters which discriminate boundary conditions and estimate values of these parameters resulting in observationally preferable predictions. We obtain the probability for these parameters under the requirement of the sufficient e-foldings of the inflation.

All the three stokes parameters of the light produced on the output port of polarization beam splitter are found to be squeezed and squeezing factor also depends upon the parameters of coherent light.

abstract: Dimensional regularization is a common method used to regulate the UV divergence of field theoretic quantities. When it is used in the context of Renyi entropy, however, it is important to consider whether such a procedure eliminates the statistical interpretation thereof as a measure of entanglement of states living on a Hilbert space. We therefore examine the dimensionally regularized Renyi entropy of a 4d unitary CFT and show that it admits no underlying Hilbert space in the state-counting sense. This gives a concrete proof that dimensionally regularized Renyi entropy cannot always be obtained as a limit of the Renyi entropy of some finite-dimensional quantum system.

abstract: Universal multiport interferometers, which can be programmed to implement any linear transformation between multiple channels, are emerging as a powerful tool for both classical and quantum photonics. These interferometers are typically composed of a regular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, allowing for straightforward fabrication using integrated photonic architectures and ready scalability. The current, standard design for universal multiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 58, 1994). We demonstrate a new design for universal multiport interferometers based on an alternative arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters, which outperforms that by Reck et al. Our design occupies half the physical footprint of the Reck design and is significantly more robust to optical losses.

We demonstrate electrically driven single-photon emission from localised sites in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2). To achieve this, we fabricate a light emitting diode structure comprising single layer graphene, thin hexagonal boron nitride and TMD mono- and bi-layers. Photon correlation measurements are used to confirm the single-photon nature of the spectrally sharp emission. These results present the TMD family as a platform for hybrid, broadband, atomically precise quantum photonics devices.

Schleich, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 053608 (2013)]. We excite Rabi oscillations between the three coupled momentum states $\left| 0 \hbar k \right\rangle$ and $\left| \pm 2 \hbar k \right\rangle$. By selecting appropriate interaction times we generate highly efficient beamsplitters and mirrors for Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition, we demonstrate higher-order double Bragg diffraction and display beamsplitters with up to $ \pm 6 \hbar k$ momentum transfer. We compare double Bragg diffraction to several other experimental realizations of beamsplitters. Finally, we show that double Bragg diffraction is well suited for matter wave interferometry by realizing a Ramsey-type interferometer in a quasi one-dimensional waveguide.

abstract: In this letter the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation is used to study the relativistic generalization of the $\kappa$-deformed Landau levels and the consequences of the deformation on the Hall conductivity. The isolated solutions for the first order differential equations, excluded from the Sturm-Liouville problem, are investigated. They do exist, but are independent of the deformation parameter. An expression for the $\kappa$-deformed relativistic Landau levels is obtained. It is observed that the deformation parameter breaks the Landau levels degeneracy. Considering the $\kappa$-deformed Landau levels in the nonrelativistic regime the Hall conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas is obtained. The expression obtained recovers the well-known result for the usual Hall conductivity in the limit $\varepsilon=\kappa^{-1}\to 0$. It is also observed that deformation generates new plateaus of conductivity in a such way that the plateaus widths of the deformed system are less than the undeformed one.

abstract: While the concept of the block universe has a most respectable scientific provenance, many physicists nevertheless do not accept that future events are just as embedded in spacetime as are those of the present and the past. This paper proposes an experiment to demonstrate the block universe using interplanetary distances and high relative speeds such as those accessible through the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The proposed experiment hinges on signals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of some tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the past of the Orbiter. Since this experiment can be performed at any time, and since the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in proportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer can always be found for whom the past is in the future of another observer. The only explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all events in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded into spacetime.

The goal of this work is to expose the classical origins of such links, and to demonstrate how they come to life in some quasi-exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics. By studying the global properties of the Riemannian surface of the classical momentum, we reveal that the abbreviated classical action possesses a symmetry which holds also at the quantum level and underlies the energy reflection symmetry of the quantum energy levels.

abstract: There are successful applications of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence to high energy and condensed matter physics. We apply the holographic approach to photosynthesis that is an important example of nontrivial quantum phenomena relevant for life which is being studied in the emerging field of quantum biology. Light harvesting complexes of photosynthetic organisms are many-body quantum systems, in which quantum coherence has recently been experimentally shown to survive for relatively long time scales even at the physiological temperature despite the decohering effects of their environments. We use the holographic approach to evaluate the time dependence of entanglement entropy and quantum mutual information in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein-pigment complex in green sulfur bacteria during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction center. It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the mutual information simulating the Lindblad master equation in some cases can be obtained by means of a dual gravity describing black hole formation in the AdS-Vaidya spacetime. The wake up and scrambling times for various partitions of the FMO complex are discussed.

abstract: We calculate the quantum state of the plasmon field excited by an ensemble of molecular emitters, which are driven by exchange of electrons with metallic nano-particle electrodes. Assuming identical emitters that are coupled collectively to the plasmon mode but are otherwise subject to independent relaxation channels, we show that symmetry constraints on the total system density matrix imply a drastic reduction in the numerical complexity. For $N_{\text{m}}$ three-level molecules we may thus represent the density matrix by a number of terms scaling as $(N_{\rm m}+8)!/(8!N_{\rm m}!)$ instead of $9^{N_{\text{m}}}$, and this allows exact simulations of up to $N_{\text{m}}=10$ molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that many emitters compensate strong plasmon damping and lead to the population of high plasmon number states and a narrowed linewidth of the plasmon field. For large $N_{\text{m}}$, our exact results are reproduced by an approximate approach based on the plasmon reduced density matrix. With this approach, we have extended the simulations to more than $50$ molecules and shown that the plasmon number state population follows a Poisson-like distribution. An alternative approach based on nonlinear rate equations for the molecular state populations and the mean plasmon number also reproduce the main lasing characteristics of the system.

abstract: The influence of spacetime foam on a broad class of bosonic fields with arbitrary numbers of particles in the low energy regime is investigated. Based on recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitational systems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to their mean frequencies. For the long time propagation, the Markov approximation is employed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. In this case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from the noisy spacetime, we show that such phenomena turn out to be completely suppressed for scalar bosons, photons, and gravitons, which are coupled to gravity but otherwise free. The short time effects are then recovered through the transient non-Markovian evolution. Focusing on scalar bosons in initially incoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation depend strongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. We further identify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for a large number of particles. The surprising new effect tends to "bundle" identical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a width inversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations, or its square root due to the vacuum fluctuations of spacetime.

abstract: We consider the nonlinear scattering theory for three-terminal thermoelectric devices, used for power generation or refrigeration. Such a system is a quantum phase-coherent version of a thermocouple, and the theory applies to systems in which interactions can be treated at a mean-field level. We consider an arbitrary three-terminal system in any external magnetic field, including systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as chiral thermoelectrics, as well as systems in which the magnetic field plays no role. We show that the upper bound on efficiency at given power output is of quantum origin and is stricter than Carnot's bound. The bound is exactly the same as previously found for two-terminal devices, and can be achieved by three-terminal systems with or without broken time-reversal symmetry. Thus the bound appears to be universal for two-terminal and three-terminal (chiral and non-chiral) thermoelectrics.

abstract: As experiments are increasingly able to probe the quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom, it is interesting to probe fundamental bounds on the dynamics of quantum information. We elaborate on the relationship between one such bound---the Lieb-Robinson bound---and the butterfly effect in strongly-coupled quantum systems. The butterfly effect implies the ballistic growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the "butterfly" velocity $v_B$. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that $v_B$ is a state-dependent effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that, depending on the way length and time scale, $v_B$ acquires a temperature dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental prospects and on the relationship between the butterfly velocity and signaling.

abstract: Motional ground state cooling and internal state preparation are important elements for quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS), a class of quantum information processing. Since QLS does not require the high gate fidelities usually associated with quantum computation and quantum simulation, it is possible to make simplifying choices in ion species and quantum protocols at the expense of some fidelity. Here, we report sideband cooling and motional state detection protocols for $^{138}$Ba$^+$ of sufficient fidelity for QLS without an extremely narrowband laser or the use of a species with hyperfine structure. We use the two S$_{1/2}$ Zeeman sublevels of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ to Raman sideband cool a single ion to the motional ground state. Because of the small Zeeman splitting, near-resonant Raman sideband cooling of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ requires only the Doppler cooling lasers and two additional AOMs. Observing the near-resonant Raman optical pumping fluorescence, we estimate a final average motional quantum number $\bar{n}\approx0.17$. We additionally employ a second, far-off-resonant laser driving Raman $\pi$-pulses between the two Zeeman sublevels to provide motional state detection for QLS and to confirm the sideband cooling efficiency, measuring a final $\bar{n} = 0.15(6)$.

abstract: We review the recent progress in the understanding of the relaxation of isolated near-integrable quantum many-body systems. Focusing on prethermalization and universal dynamics following a quench, we describe the experiments with ultracold atomic gases that illustrate these phenomena and summarize the essential theoretical concepts employed to interpret them. Our discussion highlights the key topics that link the different approaches to this interdisciplinary field, including the generalized Gibbs ensemble, non-thermal fixed points, critical slowing and universal scaling. Finally, we point to new experimental challenges demonstrating these fundamental features of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium.

abstract: We study potential scattering in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the limit that the energy of the scattering electron approaches the bottom of the lower spin-split band. Focusing on two spin-independent circularly symmetric potentials, an infinite barrier and a delta-function shell, we show that scattering in this limit is qualitatively different from both scattering in the higher spin-split band and scattering of electrons without spin-orbit coupling. The scattering matrix is purely off-diagonal with both off-diagonal elements equal to one, and all angular momentum channels contribute equally; the differential cross section becomes increasingly peaked in the forward and backward scattering directions; the total cross section exhibits quantized plateaus. These features are independent of the details of the scattering potentials, and we conjecture them to be universal. Our results suggest that Rashba scattering in the low-energy limit becomes effectively one-dimensional.

abstract: We address the problem of estimating the mass of a (quantum) particle interacting with a classical gravitational field. In particular, we analyze in details the ultimate bounds to precision imposed by quantum mechanics and study the effects of gravity in a variety of settings. Our results show that the presence of a gravitational field generally leads to a precision gain, which can be significant in a regime half-way between the quantum and classical domains. We also address quantum enhancement to precision, i.e. the advantages coming from taking into account the quantum nature of the probe particle, and show that non-classicality is indeed a relevant resource for mass estimation. In particular, we suggest schemes for mass-sensing measurements using quantum probes and show that upon employing non-classical states like quantum coherent superpositions one may improve precisions by orders of magnitude. In addition, we discuss the compatibility of the weak equivalence principle (WEP) within the quantum regime using as a guide the notion of Fisher Information. We find that the information on the probe's mass that can be extracted through position measurements is unchanged by turning on a uniform gravitational field. This conclusion is somehow at variance with certain views expressed in the literature that the WEP cannot hold in the quantum regime. In fact, our results show that in an information-theoretic framework, no clash occurs between quantum mechanics and the WEP.

abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging two dimensional material for quantum photonics owing to its large bandgap and hyperbolic properties. Here we report a broad range of multicolor room temperature single photon emissions across the visible and the near infrared spectral ranges from point defects in hBN multilayers. We show that the emitters can be categorized into two general groups, but most likely possess similar crystallographic structure. We further show two approaches for engineering of the emitters using either electron beam irradiation or annealing, and characterize their photophysical properties. The emitters exhibit narrow line widths of sub 10 nm at room temperature, and a short excited state lifetime with high brightness. Remarkably, the emitters are extremely robust and withstand aggressive annealing treatments in oxidizing and reducing environments. Our results constitute the first step towards deterministic engineering of single emitters in 2D materials and hold great promise for the use of defects in boron nitride as sources for quantum information processing and nanophotonics.

abstract: We present an efficient preconditioner for the orbital minimization method when the Hamiltonian is discretized using planewaves (i.e., pseudospectral method). This novel preconditioner is based on an approximate Fermi operator projection by pole expansion, combined with the sparsifying preconditioner to efficiently evaluate the pole expansion for a wide range of Hamiltonian operators. Numerical results validate the performance of the new preconditioner for the orbital minimization method, in particular, the iteration number is reduced to $O(1)$ and often only a few iterations are enough for convergence.

abstract: The quantum problem of an electron moving in a plane under the field created by two Coulombian centers admits simple analytical solutions for some particular inter-center distances. These elementary eigenfunctions, akin to those found by Demkov for the analogous three dimensional problem, are calculated using the framework of quasi-exact solvability of a pair of entangled ODE's descendants from the Heun equation. A different but interesting situation arises when the two centers have the same strength. In this case completely elementary solutions do not exist.
