**1.    Two-step hyperentanglement purification with the quantum-state-joining method**  
Bao-Cang Ren, Fang-Fang Du, Fu-Guo Deng  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 052309 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0048  
<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing, especially for increasing the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication. Hyperentanglement purification is an important method to obtain high-fidelity nonlocal hyperentangled states from mixed hyperentangled states in a long-distance quantum communication process with noisy channels. Here, we present a two-step hyperentanglement purification protocol for nonlocal mixed hyperentangled states with polarization bit-flip errors and spatial-mode phase-flip errors, resorting to polarization-spatial phase-check quantum nondemolition detectors and the quantum-state-joining method (QSJM). With QSJM, the protocol can preserve the states that are discarded in the previous hyperentanglement purification protocols. It has the advantage of a high efficiency, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems with several degrees of freedom in long-distance high-capacity quantum communication.

**2.    Fault-Tolerant Quantum Walks**  
S. D. Freedman, Y. H. Tong, J. B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1250  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are expected to serve important modelling and algorithmic applications in many areas of science and mathematics. Although quantum walks have been successfully implemented physically in recent times, no major efforts have been made to combat the error associated with these physical implementations in a fault-tolerant manner. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to implement fault-tolerant quantum walks in discrete time on arbitrarily complex graphs, using quantum states encoded with the Steane code and a set of universal fault tolerant matrix operations.

**3.    Complexity analysis of quantum walk based search algorithms**  
B. L. Douglas, J. B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1616  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present several families of graphs that allow both efficient quantum walk implementations and efficient quantum walk based search algorithms. For these graphs, we construct quantum circuits that explicitly implement the full quantum walk search algorithm, without reference to a `black box' oracle. These circuits provide a practically implementable method to explore quantum walk based search algorithms with the aim of eventual real-world applications. We also provide a numerical analysis of a quantum walk based search along a twisted toroid family of graphs, which requires O($\sqrt{n}$ log($n$)) elementary 2-qubit quantum gate operations to find a marked node.

**4.    Information Dimension of Dissipative Quantum Walks**  
P. Schijven, O. Muelken  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the temporal growth of the von Neumann entropy for dissipative quantum walks on networks. By using a phenomenological quantum master equation, the quantum stochastic walk (QSW), we are able to parametrically scan the crossover from purely coherent quantum walks to purely diffusive random walks. In the latter limit the entropy shows a logarithmic growth, which is proportional to the information dimension of the random walk on the network. Here we present results for the von Neumann entropy based on the reduced density operator of the QSW. It shows a similar logarithmic growth for a wide range of parameter values and networks. As a consequence, we propose the logarithmic growth rate of the von Neumann entropy to be a natural extension of the information dimension to dissipative quantum systems. We corroborate our results by comparing to numerically exact simulations.

**5.    Quantum lower bound for inverting a permutation with advice**  
Aran Nayebi, Scott Aaronson, Aleksandrs Belovs, Luca Trevisan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3193  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a random permutation $f: [N] \to [N]$ as a black box and $y \in [N]$, we want to output $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Supplementary to our input, we are given classical advice in the form of a pre-computed data structure; this advice can depend on the permutation but \emph{not} on the input $y$. Classically, there is a data structure of size $\tilde{O}(S)$ and an algorithm that with the help of the data structure, given $f(x)$, can invert $f$ in time $\tilde{O}(T)$, for every choice of parameters $S$, $T$, such that $S\cdot T \ge N$. We prove a quantum lower bound of $T^2\cdot S \ge \tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon N)$ for quantum algorithms that invert a random permutation $f$ on an $\epsilon$ fraction of inputs, where $T$ is the number of queries to $f$ and $S$ is the amount of advice. This answers an open question of De et al. We also give a $\Omega(\sqrt{N/m})$ quantum lower bound for the simpler but related Yao's box problem, which is the problem of recovering a bit $x_j$, given the ability to query an $N$-bit string $x$ at any index except the $j$-th, and also given $m$ bits of advice that depend on $x$ but not on $j$.

**6.    One-Dimensional Coinless Quantum Walks**  
Renato Portugal, Stefan Boettcher, Stefan Falkner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5166  
<blockquote>
<p>
A coinless, discrete-time quantum walk possesses a Hilbert space whose dimension is smaller compared to the widely-studied coined walk. Coined walks require the direct product of the site basis with the coin space, coinless walks operate purely in the site basis, which is clearly minimal. These coinless quantum walks have received considerable attention recently because they have evolution operators that can be obtained by a graphical method based on lattice tessellations and they have been shown to be as efficient as the best known coined walks when used as a quantum search algorithm. We argue that both formulations in their most general form are equivalent. In particular, we demonstrate how to transform the one-dimensional version of the coinless quantum walk into an equivalent extended coined version for a specific family of evolution operators. We present some of its basic, asymptotic features for the one-dimensional lattice with some examples of tessellations, and analyze the mixing time and limiting probability distributions on cycles.

**7.    Thermodynamics of N-dimensional quantum walks**  
Alejandro Romanelli, Raul Donangelo, Renato Portugal, Franklin L. Marquezino  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5300  
<blockquote>
<p>
The entanglement between the position and coin state of a $N$-dimensional quantum walker is shown to lead to a thermodynamic theory. The entropy, in this thermodynamics, is associated to the reduced density operator for the evolution of chirality, taking a partial trace over positions. From the asymptotic reduced density matrix it is possible to define thermodynamic quantities, such as the asymptotic entanglement entropy, temperature, Helmholz free energy, etc. We study in detail the case of a $2$-dimensional quantum walk, in the case of two different initial conditions: a non-separable coin-position initial state, and a separable one. The resulting entanglement temperature is presented as function of the parameters of the system and those of the initial conditions.

**8.    Driven Quantum Walks**  
Craig S. Hamilton, Regina Kruse, Linda Sansoni, Christine Silberhorn, Igor Jex  
Phys. Rev Lett. 113, 083602 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6647  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this letter we introduce the concept of a driven quantum walk. This work is motivated by recent theoretical and experimental progress that combines quantum walks and parametric down- conversion, leading to fundamentally different phenomena. We compare these striking differences by relating the driven quantum walks to the original quantum walk. Next, we illustrate typical dynamics of such systems and show these walks can be controlled by various pump configurations and phase matchings. Finally, we end by proposing an application of this process based on a quantum search algorithm that performs faster than a classical search.

**9.    The expressive power of quantum walks in terms of language acceptance**  
Katie Barr, Viv Kendon  
EPTCS 158, 2014, pp. 39-51  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0051  
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum computation. This has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal quantum gate set. In this paper, we examine computation by quantum walks in terms of language acceptance, and present two ways in which discrete time quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty. These walks can take quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is quantum, the walks can also be interpreted as performing the task of quantum state discrimination.
