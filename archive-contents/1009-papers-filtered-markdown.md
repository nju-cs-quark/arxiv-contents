**1.    Interference Phenomena in Quantum Information**  
Martin Stefanak  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0200  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the key features of quantum mechanics is the interference of probability amplitudes. The reason for the appearance of interference is mathematically very simple. It is the linear structure of the Hilbert space which is used for the description of quantum systems. In terms of physics we usually talk about the superposition principle valid for individual and composed quantum objects. So, while the source of interference is understandable it leads in fact to many counter-intuitive physical phenomena which puzzle physicists for almost hundred years. The present thesis studies interference in two seemingly disjoint fields of physics. However, both have strong links to quantum information processing and hence are related. In the first part we study the intriguing properties of quantum walks. In the second part we analyze a sophisticated application of wave packet dynamics in atoms and molecules for factorization of integers. The main body of the thesis is based on the original contributions listed separately at the end of the thesis. The more technical aspects and brief summaries of used methods are left for appendices.

**2.    Finding structural anomalies in graphs by means of quantum walks**  
Edgar Feldman, Mark Hillery, Hai-Woong Lee, Daniel Reitzner, Hongjun Zheng, Vladimir Buzek

<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the possibility of using quantum walks on graphs to find structural anomalies, such as extra edges or loops, on a graph. We focus our attention on star graphs, whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central hub. If there are $N$ spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps. We initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one, the walk will not find the spoke without a loop, but this can be fixed if we choose the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the loop. Consequently, quantum walks can, under some circumstances, be used to find structural anomalies in graphs.

**3.    Statistical dynamics of a non-Abelian anyonic quantum walk**  
Lauri Lehman, Vaclav Zatloukal, Gavin K. Brennen, Jiannis K. Pachos, Zhenghan Wang  
Phys.Rev.Lett.106:230404,2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0813  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the single particle dynamics of a mobile non-Abelian anyon hopping around many pinned anyons on a surface. The dynamics is modelled by a discrete time quantum walk and the spatial degree of freedom of the mobile anyon becomes entangled with the fusion degrees of freedom of the collective system. Each quantum trajectory makes a closed braid on the world lines of the particles establishing a direct connection between statistical dynamics and quantum link invariants. We find that asymptotically a mobile Ising anyon becomes so entangled with its environment that its statistical dynamics reduces to a classical random walk with linear dispersion in contrast to particles with Abelian statistics which have quadratic dispersion.

**4.    Limit Theorems for the Discrete-Time Quantum Walk on a Graph with Joined Half Lines**  
Kota Chisaki, Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa  
Quantum Information and Computation 12, (2012) 0314--0333  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1306  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a discrete-time quantum walk $W_{t,\kappa}$ at time $t$ on a graph with joined half lines $\mathbb{J}_\kappa$, which is composed of $\kappa$ half lines with the same origin. Our analysis is based on a reduction of the walk on a half line. The idea plays an important role to analyze the walks on some class of graphs with \textit{symmetric} initial states. In this paper, we introduce a quantum walk with an enlarged basis and show that $W_{t,\kappa}$ can be reduced to the walk on a half line even if the initial state is \textit{asymmetric}. For $W_{t,\kappa}$, we obtain two types of limit theorems. The first one is an asymptotic behavior of $W_{t,\kappa}$ which corresponds to localization. For some conditions, we find that the asymptotic behavior oscillates. The second one is the weak convergence theorem for $W_{t,\kappa}$. On each half line, $W_{t,\kappa}$ converges to a density function like the case of the one-dimensional lattice with a scaling order of $t$. The results contain the cases of quantum walks starting from the general initial state on a half line with the general coin and homogeneous trees with the Grover coin.

**5.    Perfect state transfer, graph products and equitable partitions**  
Yang Ge, Benjamin Greenberg, Oscar Perez, Christino Tamon  
International Journal of Quantum Information 9(3):823-842, 2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1340  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe new constructions of graphs which exhibit perfect state transfer on continuous-time quantum walks. Our constructions are based on variants of the double cones [BCMS09,ANOPRT10,ANOPRT09] and the Cartesian graph products (which includes the n-cube) [CDDEKL05]. Some of our results include: (1) If $G$ is a graph with perfect state transfer at time $t_{G}$, where $t_{G}\Spec(G) \subseteq \ZZ\pi$, and $H$ is a circulant with odd eigenvalues, their weak product $G \times H$ has perfect state transfer. Also, if $H$ is a regular graph with perfect state transfer at time $t_{H}$ and $G$ is a graph where $t_{H}|V_{H}|\Spec(G) \subseteq 2\ZZ\pi$, their lexicographic product $G[H]$ has perfect state transfer. (2) The double cone $\overline{K}_{2} + G$ on any connected graph $G$, has perfect state transfer if the weights of the cone edges are proportional to the Perron eigenvector of $G$. This generalizes results for double cone on regular graphs studied in [BCMS09,ANOPRT10,ANOPRT09]. (3) For an infinite family $\GG$ of regular graphs, there is a circulant connection so the graph $K_{1}+\GG\circ\GG+K_{1}$ has perfect state transfer. In contrast, no perfect state transfer exists if a complete bipartite connection is used (even in the presence of weights) [ANOPRT09]. We also describe a generalization of the path collapsing argument [CCDFGS03,CDDEKL05], which reduces questions about perfect state transfer to simpler (weighted) multigraphs, for graphs with equitable distance partitions.

**6.    Asymptotic evolution of quantum walks with random coin**  
Andre Ahlbrecht, Holger Vogts, Albert H. Werner, Reinhard F. Werner  
J. Math. Phys. 52, 042201 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2019  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the asymptotic position distribution of general quantum walks on a lattice, including walks with a random coin, which is chosen from step to step by a general Markov chain. In the unitary (i.e., non-random) case, we allow any unitary operator, which commutes with translations, and couples only sites at a finite distance from each other. For example, a single step of the walk could be composed of any finite succession of different shift and coin operations in the usual sense, with any lattice dimension and coin dimension. We find ballistic scaling, and establish a direct method for computing the asymptotic distribution of position divided by time, namely as the distribution of the discrete time analog of the group velocity. In the random case, we let a Markov chain (control process) pick in each step one of finitely many unitary walks, in the sense described above. In ballistic order we find a non-random drift, which depends only on the mean of the control process and not on the initial state. In diffusive scaling the limiting distribution is asymptotically Gaussian, with a covariance matrix (diffusion matrix) depending on momentum. The diffusion matrix depends not only on the mean but also on the transition rates of the control process. In the non-random limit, i.e., when the coins chosen are all very close, or the transition rates of the control process are small, leading to long intervals of ballistic evolution, the diffusion matrix diverges. Our method is based on spatial Fourier transforms, and the first and second order perturbation theory of the eigenvalue 1 of the transition operator for each value of the momentum.

**7.    Crossovers induced by discrete-time quantum walks**  
Kota Chisaki, Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa, Yutaka Shikano  
Quantum Information and Computation 11 (2011) pp.0741-0760  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2131  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs in some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show that the position measurements per each step with probability $p \sim 1/n^\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\beta<1$. We also give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers from the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum walk) can be seen as the parameter $\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete- and continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we introduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the final time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW is obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence theorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties. Finally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently long-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random walks.

**8.    The Equivalence of Sampling and Searching**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5104  
<blockquote>
<p>
In a sampling problem, we are given an input x, and asked to sample approximately from a probability distribution D_x. In a search problem, we are given an input x, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A_x with high probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent. More precisely, for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R_S such that, if C is any "reasonable" complexity class, then R_S is in the search version of C if and only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that SampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can efficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and only if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers can solve. A second application is that, assuming a plausible conjecture, there exists a search problem R that can be solved using a simple linear-optics experiment, but that cannot be solved efficiently by a classical computer unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. That application will be described in a forthcoming paper with Alex Arkhipov on the computational complexity of linear optics.

**9.    Counting Statistics of Many-Particle Quantum Walks**  
Klaus Mayer, Malte C. Tichy, Florian Mintert, Thomas Konrad, Andreas Buchleitner  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 062307 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5241  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum walks of many non-interacting particles on a beam splitter array, as a paradigmatic testing ground for the competition of single- and many-particle interference in a multi-mode system. We derive a general expression for multi-mode particle-number correlation functions, valid for bosons and fermions, and infer pronounced signatures of many-particle interferences in the counting statistics.
