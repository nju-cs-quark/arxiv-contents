abstract: We report the observation of efficient and low-noise frequency conversion between two microwave modes, mediated by the motion of a mechanical resonator subjected to radiation pressure. We achieve coherent conversion of more than $10^{12}~\mathrm{photons/s}$ with a $95\mathrm{\%}$ efficiency and a $14~\mathrm{kHz}$ bandwidth. With less than $10^{-1}~\mathrm{photons \cdot s^{-1}\cdot Hz^{-1}}$ of added noise, this optomechanical frequency converter is suitable for quantum state transduction. We show the ability to operate this converter as a tunable beam splitter, with direct applications for photon routing and communication through complex quantum networks.

abstract: We improve Knabe's spectral gap bound for frustration-free translation-invariant local Hamiltonians in 1D. The bound is based on a relationship between global and local gaps. The global gap is the spectral gap of a size-$m$ chain with periodic boundary conditions, while the local gap is that of a subchain of size $n<m$ with open boundary conditions. Knabe proved that if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some $n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the thermodynamic limit $m\rightarrow \infty$. Here we improve the threshold to $\frac{6}{n(n+1)}$, which is better (smaller) for all $n>3$ and which is asymptotically optimal. As a corollary we establish a surprising fact about 1D translation-invariant frustration-free systems that are gapless in the thermodynamic limit: for any such system the spectral gap of a size-$n$ chain with open boundary conditions is upper bounded as $O(n^{-2})$. This contrasts with gapless frustrated systems where the gap can be $\Theta(n^{-1})$. It also limits the extent to which the area law is violated in these frustration-free systems, since it implies that the half-chain entanglement entropy is $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ as a function of spectral gap $\epsilon$. We extend our results to frustration-free systems on a 2D square lattice.

abstract: We consider the task of characterizing optimal protocols for approximating incompatible observables via jointly measurable observables. This amounts to jointly minimizing the approximation errors (suitably quantified), subject to the compatibility constraint. As a case study we consider the approximation of two-valued qubit observables and scrutinise two recent approaches that are based on different choices of error measures, each giving rise to a form of measurement uncertainty relation. We find a disparity between the respective optimal approximators singled out by the two approaches, which underlines the operational shortcomings of one of the error measures.

abstract: A 5-qubit quantum controlled teleportation scheme incorporated with a 3-qubit quantum error-corrective circuit is proposed for satellite control and communication. This means that the coordinates of a satellite on the unit two-dimensional Bloch sphere representation can be sent to the ground based operator via quantum teleportation. Applying quantum rotation operators to the initial quantum state, to obtain desired changes, the corrected/desired quantum state can be sent back to the satellite to adjust its coordinates.

abstract: Bell's theorem states that quantum mechanics is not a locally causal theory. This state is often interpreted as nonlocality in quantum mechanics. Toner and Bacon [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{91}, 187904 (2003)] have shown that a shared random-variables theory augmented by one bit of classical communication exactly simulates the Bell correlation in a singlet state. In this paper, we show that in Toner and Bacon protocol, one of the parties (Bob) can deduce another party's (Alice) measurement outputs, if she only informs Bob of one of her own outputs. Afterwards, we suggest a nonlocal version of Toner and Bacon protocol wherein classical communications is replaced by nonlocal effects, so that Alice's measurements cause instantaneous effects on Bob's outputs. In the nonlocal version of Toner and Bacon's protocol, we get the same result again. We also demonstrate that the same approach is applicable to Svozil's protocol.

abstract: Based on the integral representation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk (HK), and in the limit of high temperatures, we formulate a hybrid expression for the correlation function of infrared spectroscopy. This is achieved by performing a partial linearization inside the integral over the difference of phase space variables that occurs after a twofold application of the HK propagator. A numerical case study for a coupled anharmonic oscillator shows that already for a total number of only two degrees of freedom, one of which is treated in the simplified manner, a substantial reduction of the numerical effort is achieved.

abstract: Maximal violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is usually said to be a feature of anticommuting observables. In this work we show that even random observables exhibit near-maximal violations of the CHSH-Bell inequality. To do this, we introduce so-called free observables which are freely independent in some quantum probability space. We also study the fine-grained uncertainty of a sequence of free or random observables, and use this to construct a steering inequality with large violation.

We state and prove a relevant version of this inequality for the hitherto unaddressed case of these matrices being nonnegative. Our treatment also provides an alternate proof for the strictly positive case.

abstract: We study the the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor $\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown that the QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process, while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoir squeezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeeze parameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect of temperature on the QFI.

abstract: Ensembles of electron spins in hybrid microwave systems are powerful and versatile components for future quantum technologies. Quantum memories with high storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states that can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories, but induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a cavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work we show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of long-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we observe long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that is a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a factor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate. This significant reduction lives up to the promise of hybrid devices to perform better than their individual subcomponents. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we realise the first step towards a solid-state microwave spin multiplexer by engineering multiple long-lived dark states. Our results show that we can fully access the "decoherence free" subspace in our experiment and selectively prepare protected states by spectral hole burning. This technique opens up the way for truly long-lived quantum memories, solid-state microwave frequency combs, optical to microwave quantum transducers and spin squeezed states. Our approach also paves the way for a new class of cavity QED experiments with dense spin ensembles, where dipole spin-spin interactions become important and many-body phenomena will be directly accessible on a chip.

abstract: We theoretically generate nonclassical states from coherent state heralded by Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM)-type SU(3) interference. Injecting a coherent state in signal mode and two single-photon sources in other two auxiliary modes of SU(3) interferometry, a broad class of useful nonclassical states are obtained in the output signal port after making two single-photon-counting measurements in the two output auxiliary modes. The nonclassical properties, in terms of anti-bunching effect and squeezing effect as well as the negativity of the Wigner function, are studied in detail by adjusting the interaction parameters. The results show that the input coherent state can be transformed into non-Gaussian states with higher nonclassicality after measurement induction. The maximum squeezing of our generated states can be arrived at about 1.9 dB.

abstract: Light-pulse atom interferometers rely on the wave nature of matter and its manipulation with coherent laser pulses. They are used for precise gravimetry and inertial sensing as well as for accurate measurements of fundamental constants. Reaching higher precision requires longer interferometer times which are naturally encountered in microgravity environments such as drop-tower facilities, sounding rockets and dedicated satellite missions aiming at fundamental quantum physics in space. In all those cases, it is necessary to consider arbitrary trajectories and varying orientations of the interferometer set-up in non-inertial frames of reference. Here we provide a versatile representation-free description of atom interferometry entirely based on operator algebra to address this general situation. We show how to analytically determine the phase shift as well as the visibility of interferometers with an arbitrary number of pulses including the effects of local gravitational accelerations, gravity gradients, the rotation of the lasers and non-inertial frames of reference. Our method conveniently unifies previous results and facilitates the investigation of novel interferometer geometries.

abstract: Constructing local hidden variable (LHV) models for entangled quantum states is challenging, as the model should reproduce quantum predictions for all possible local measurements. Here we present a simple method for building LHV models, applicable to general entangled states, which consists in verifying that the statistics resulting from a finite set of measurements is local, a much simpler problem. This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit, fully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods are developed for constructing local hidden state models. We illustrate the practical relevance of these methods with several examples, and discuss further applications.

As applications we present new families of states with LHS models, including Bell-diagonal states, noisy GHZ and noisy W states, and generate a list of over 400000 new entangled two-qubit states with LHS model for projective measurements and 1400 for POVM measurements.

abstract: So far the Bloch-Siegert shift of the Rabi model has only been calculated numerically or by means of perturbation theory valid in either the weak or strong driving regime only. Recently Yan, L\"u, and Zheng [Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 91}, 053834 (2015)] showed how to reduce the problem to solving a system of three nonlinear equations. Here, we pursue an alternative approach based on a perturbation expansion extrapolation technique. We are thus able to derive an explicit analytical approximation formula for the Bloch-Siegert shift of the Rabi model which is valid for all parameter regimes from weak to strong driving. Comparison with numerically exact results reveals an excellent agreement over the entire driving-strength range.

abstract: A harmonic oscillator model in four dimensions is presented for the helium atom to estimate the distance to the inner and outer electron from the nucleus, the angle between electrons and the energy levels. The method is algebraic and is not based on the choice of correct trial wave function. Three harmonic oscillators and thus three quantum numbers are sufficient to describe the two-electron system. We derive a simple formula for the energy in the general case and in the special case of the Wannier Ridge. For a set of quantum numbers the distance to the electrons and the angle between the electrons are uniquely determined as the intersection between three surfaces. We show that the excited states converge either towards ionization thresholds or towards extreme parallel or antiparallel states and provide an estimate of the ground state energy.

abstract: We consider the real-time evolution of a strongly coupled system of lattice fermions whose dynamics is driven entirely by dissipative Lindblad processes, with linear or quadratic quantum jump operators. The fermion 2-point functions obey a closed set of diff?erential equations, which can be solved with linear algebra methods. The staggered occupation order parameter of the t-V model decreases exponentially during the dissipative time evolution. The structure factor associated with the various Fourier modes shows the slowing down of low-momentum modes, which is due to particle number conservation. The processes with nearest-neighbor-dependent Lindblad operators have a decay rate that is proportional to the coordination number of the spatial lattice.

Using the framework of nonlocal games, we relate measures of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics to certain norms in the Banach and operator space categories. We survey recent results that exploit this connection to derive large violations of Bell inequalities, study the complexity of the classical and quantum values of games and their relation to Grothendieck inequalities, and quantify the nonlocality of different classes of entangled states.

This is presented in three theorems. The first establishes the necessary bridge between ensemble theory and experiment. The second analyzes the most important theoretical ensemble entity: the eigen-projector of the relative frequency operator. Its physical meaning is the experimental relative frequency. The third theorem formulates the quantum probabilistic convergence, which is the final result of this investigation.

According these results, we make use of the shape invariance property to compute the exited eigenvalues and eigen-functions. These results help us to understand the Spin-weighted Spheroidal Wave and show that it is integral.

abstract: For the past two decades, researchers have attempted to create a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) by combining the merits of quantum computing and neural computing. In order to exploit the advantages of the two prolific fields, the QNN must meet the non-trivial task of integrating the unitary dynamics of quantum computing and the dissipative dynamics of neural computing. At the core of quantum computing and neural computing lies the qubit and perceptron, respectively. We see that past implementations of the quantum perceptron model have failed to fuse the two elegantly. This was due to a slow learning rule and a disregard for the unitary requirement. In this paper, we present a quantum perceptron that can compute functions uncomputable by the classical perceptron while analytically solving for parameters and preserving the unitary and dissipative requirements.

abstract: This paper presents a non-Markovian coherent feedback scheme to control single quantum dot systems. The feedback loop is closed via a quantum tunneling junction between the natural source and drain baths of the quantum dot. The exact feedback-controlled non-Markovian Langevin equation is derived for describing the dynamics of the quantum dot. To deal with the nonlinear memory function in the Langevin equation, we analyze the Green's function-based root locus, from which we show that the decoherence of the quantum dot can be suppressed via increasing the feedback coupling strength. This effectiveness of decoherence suppression induced by non-Markovian coherent feedback is verified by an example of single quantum dot systems.

abstract: A non-Markovian process is one that retains `memory' of its past. A systematic understanding of these processes is necessary to fully describe and harness a vast range of complex phenomena; however, no such general characterisation currently exists. This long-standing problem has hindered advances in understanding physical, chemical and biological processes, where often dubious theoretical assumptions are made to render a dynamical description tractable. Moreover, the methods currently available to treat non-Markovian quantum dynamics are plagued with unphysical results, like non-positive dynamics. Here we develop an operational framework to characterise arbitrary non-Markovian quantum processes. We demonstrate the universality of our framework and how the characterisation can be rendered efficient, before formulating a necessary and sufficient condition for quantum Markov processes. Finally, we stress how our framework enables the actual systematic analysis of non-Markovian processes, the understanding of their typicality, and the development of new master equations for the effective description of memory-bearing open-system evolution.

abstract: In this thesis we explore the benefits of relativistic constraints for cryptography. We first revisit non-communicating models and its applications in the context of interactive proofs and cryptography. We propose bit commitment protocols whose security hinges on communication constraints and investigate its limitations. We explain how some non-communicating models can be justified by special relativity and study the limitations of such models. In particular, we present a framework for analysing security of multiround relativistic protocols. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to analysing specific protocols. We start by considering a recently proposed two-round quantum bit commitment protocol. We propose a fault-tolerant variant of the protocol, present a complete security analysis and report on an experimental implementation performed in collaboration with an experimental group at the University of Geneva. We also propose a new, multiround classical bit commitment protocol and prove its security against classical adversaries. This demonstrates that in the classical world an arbitrarily long commitment can be achieved even if the agents are restricted to occupy a finite region of space. Moreover, the protocol is easy to implement and we report on an experiment performed in collaboration with the Geneva group.

In this sense, we show that genetic algorithms can be employed to increase the fidelity and optimize the resource requirements of digital quantum simulation protocols, while adapting naturally to the experimental constraints. Furthermore, this method allows us to reduce not only digital errors, but also experimental errors in quantum gates. Indeed, by adding ancillary qubits, we design a modular gate made out of imperfect gates, whose fidelity is larger than the fidelity of any of the constituent gates. Finally, we prove that the proposed modular gates are resilient against different gate errors.

abstract: The excitation dynamics of a laser-driven Rydberg gas exhibits cooperative effect due to the interatomic Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, but the large many-body system with inhomogeneous Rydberg coupling is hard to be exactly solved or numerically studied by density matrix equations. In this paper, we find that the laser-driven Rydberg gas with most of the atoms being in the ground state can be described by a simplified interaction model resembling the optical Kerr effect if the distance-dependent Rydberg-Rydberg interaction is replaced by an infinite-range coupling. We can then quantitatively study the effect of the quantum fluctuations on the Rydberg excitation with the interatomic correlation involved and analytically calculate the statistical characteristics of the excitation dynamics in the steady state, revealing the quantum signature of the driven-dissipative Rydberg gas. The results obtained here will be of great interest for other spin-1/2 systems with spin-spin coupling.

abstract: The Feynman path integral does not allow a "one real path" interpretation, because amplitudes contribute to probabilities in a non-separable manner. The opposite extreme, "all paths happen", is not a useful or informative account. In this paper it is shown that an intermediate parsing of the path integral, into realistic non-interfering possibilities, is always available. Each realistic possibility formally corresponds to numerous particle paths, but is arguably best interpreted as a spacetime-valued field. Notably, one actual field history can always be said to occur, although it will generally not have an extremized action. The most obvious concerns with this approach are addressed, indicating necessary follow-up research. But without obvious showstoppers, it seems plausible that the path integral might be reinterpreted to explain quantum phenomena in terms of Lorentz covariant field histories.

abstract: We investigate the influence of Unruh radiation on matter-wave interferometry experiments using neutral objects modeled as dielectric spheres. The Unruh effect leads to a loss of coherence through momentum diffusion. This is a fundamental source of decoherence that affects all objects having electromagnetic interactions. However, the effect is not large enough to prevent the observation of interference for objects of any size, even when the path separation is larger than the size of the object. When the acceleration in the interferometer arms is large, inertial tidal forces will disrupt the material integrity of the interfering objects before the Unruh decoherence of the centre of mass motion is sufficient to prevent observable interference.

abstract: While superconducting systems provide a promising platform for quantum computing, their networking poses a considerable challenge as they cannot be interfaced directly to light--the natural carrier for transmission of quantum signals through channels at room temperature. Here, we show that remote superconducting qubits can be prepared in entangled states by coupling them to mechanical oscillators whose positions are monitored with optical fields. Continuous homodyne detection of light provides information on the total spin of the two qubits such that entangled qubit states can be post-selected. Entanglement generation is possible without ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillators for systems with an optomechanical cooperativity moderately larger than unity; in addition, our setup tolerates a substantial loss of photons in transmission. The approach is scalable to generation of multipartite entanglement and represents a crucial step towards quantum networks with nodes using superconducting circuits.

abstract: The optimal design of a fault-tolerant quantum computer involves finding an appropriate balance between the burden of large-scale integration of noisy components and the load of improving the reliability of hardware technology. This balance can be evaluated by quantitatively modeling the execution of quantum logic operations on a realistic quantum hardware containing limited computational resources. In this work, we report a complete performance simulation software tool capable of (1) searching the hardware design space by varying resource architecture and technology parameters, (2) synthesizing and scheduling fault-tolerant quantum algorithm within the hardware constraints, (3) quantifying the performance metrics such as the execution time and the failure probability of the algorithm, and (4) analyzing the breakdown of these metrics to highlight the performance bottlenecks and visualizing resource utilization to evaluate the adequacy of the chosen design. Using this tool we investigate a vast design space for implementing key building blocks of Shor's algorithm to factor a 1,024-bit number with a baseline budget of 1.5 million qubits. We show that a trapped-ion quantum computer designed with twice as many qubits and one-tenth of the baseline infidelity of the communication channel can factor a 2,048-bit integer in less than five months.

abstract: Superconducting magnets enable precise control of nuclear and electron spins, and are used in experiments that explore biological and condensed matter systems, and fundamental atomic particles. In high-precision applications, a common view is that that slow (<1 Hz) drift of the homogeneous magnetic field limits control and measurement precision. We report on previously undocumented higher-frequency field noise (10 Hz to 200 Hz) that limits the coherence time of 9Be+ electron-spin qubits in the 4.46 T field of a superconducting magnet. We measure a spin-echo T2 coherence time of ~6 ms for the 9Be+ electron-spin resonance at 124 GHz, limited by part-per-billion fractional fluctuations in the magnet's homogeneous field. Vibration isolation of the magnet improved T2 to ~50 ms.

abstract: We calculate the quantum mechanical, temporal second-order coherence function for a single-mode, degenerate parametric amplifier for a system in the Gaussian state, viz., a displaced-squeezed thermal state. The calculation involves first the dynamical generation at time $t$ of the Gaussian state from an initial thermal state and subsequent measurements of two photons a time $\tau \geq 0$ apart. The generation of the Gaussian state by the parametric amplifier ensures that the temporal second-order coherence function depends only on $\tau$, via $\tau/t$, for given Gaussian state parameters, Gaussian state preparation time $t$, and average number $\bar{n}$ of thermal photons. It is interesting that the time evolution for displaced thermal states shows a power decay in $\tau/t$ rather than an exponential one as is the case for general, displaced-squeezed thermal states.

abstract: We present an exact quantum algorithm for solving the Exact Satisfiability problem, which is known to belong to the important NP-complete complexity class. The algorithm is based on an intuitive approach that can be divided into two parts: The first step consists in the identification and efficient characterization of a restricted subspace that contains all the valid assignments (if any solution exists) of the Exact Satisfiability; while the second part performs a quantum search in such restricted subspace. The quantum algorithm can be used either to find a valid assignment (or to certify that no solutions exist) or to count the total number of valid assignments. The query complexity for the worst-case is, respectively, bounded by $O(\sqrt{2^{n-M^{\prime}}})$ and $O(2^{n-M^{\prime}})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $M^{\prime}$ the number of linearly independent clauses. Remarkably, the proposed quantum algorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to solve dense formulas of Exact Satisfiability. When compared to heuristic techniques, the proposed quantum algorithm is faster than the classical WalkSAT heuristic and Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for random instances with a density of constraints close to the satisfiability threshold, the regime in which instances are typically the hardest to solve. The quantum algorithm that we propose can be straightforwardly extended to the generalized version of the Exact Satisfiability known as Occupation problems. The general version of the algorithm is presented and analyzed.

abstract: We present a very general geometrico-dynamical description of physical or more abstract entities, called the 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model, where not only states, but also measurement-interactions can be represented, and the associated outcome probabilities calculated. Underlying the model is the hypothesis that indeterminism manifests as a consequence of unavoidable fluctuations in the experimental context, in accordance with the 'hidden-measurements interpretation' of quantum mechanics. When the structure of the state space is Hilbertian, and measurements are of the 'universal' kind, i.e., are the result of an average over all possible ways of selecting an outcome, the GTR-model provides the same predictions of the Born rule, and therefore provides a natural completed version of quantum mechanics. However, when the structure of the state space is non-Hilbertian and/or not all possible ways of selecting an outcome are available to be actualized, the predictions of the model generally differ from the quantum ones, especially when sequential measurements are considered. Some paradigmatic examples will be discussed, taken from physics and human cognition. Particular attention will be given to some known psychological effects, like question order effects and response replicability, which we show are able to generate non-Hilbertian statistics. We also suggest a realistic interpretation of the GTR-model, when applied to human cognition and decision, which we think could become the generally adopted interpretative framework in quantum cognition research.

abstract: We investigate the degree of entanglement between an atom and a driven cavity mode, in the presence of dissipation. Previous work has shown that in the limit of weak driving fields, the steady state entanglement is proportional to the square of the driving intensity. This quadratic dependence is due to the generation of entanglement by the creation of pairs of photons/excitations. In this work we investigate the entanglement between an atom and a cavity in the presence of multiple photons. Nonlinearity of the atomic response is needed to generate entanglement, but as that nonlinearity saturates the entanglement vanishes. We posit that this is due to spontaneous emission, which puts the atom in the ground state and the atom-field state into a direct product state. An intermediate value of the driving field, near the field that saturates the atomic response, optimizes the atom-field entanglement. In a parameter regime for which multiphoton resonances occur, we find that entanglement recurs at those resonances. \\cite{Shamailov-10} In this regime, we find that the entanglement decreases with increaing photon number. We also investigate, in the bimodal regime of Alsing et. al.\cite{Alsing-91-DressedState} \cite{Alsing-92-DSS}\\cite{Carm-15-X}, the entanglement as a function of atom and/or cavity detuning. Here we find that there is evidence of a phase transition in the entanglement, which occurs at $2\epsilon/g \geq 1$.

abstract: Hybridizing collective spin excitations and a cavity with high cooperativity provides a new research subject in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics and can also have potential applications to quantum information. Here we report an experimental study of cavity quantum electrodynamics with ferromagnetic magnons in a small yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere at both cryogenic and room temperatures. We observe for the first time a strong coupling of the same cavity mode to both a ferromagnetic-resonance (FMR) mode and a magnetostatic (MS) mode near FMR in the quantum limit. This is achieved at a temperature ~ 22 mK, where the average microwave photon number in the cavity is less than one. At room temperature, we also observe strong coupling of the cavity mode to the FMR mode in the same YIG sphere and find a slight increase of the damping rate of the FMR mode. These observations reveal the extraordinary robustness of the FMR mode against temperature. However, the MS mode becomes unobservable at room temperature in the measured transmission spectrum of the microwave cavity containing the YIG sphere. Our numerical simulations show that this is due to a drastic increase of the damping rate of the MS mode.

abstract: Quantum vacuum fluctuations are a direct manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The dynamical Casimir effect allows for the observation of these vacuum fluctuations by turning them into real, observable photons. However, the observation of this effect in a cavity QED experiment would require the rapid variation of the length of a cavity with relativistic velocities, a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a quantum simulation of the dynamical Casimir effect using an ion chain confined in a segmented ion trap. We derive a discrete model that enables us to map the dynamics of the multimode radiation field inside a variable-length cavity to radial phonons of the ion crystal. We perform a numerical study comparing the ion-chain quantum simulation under realistic experimental parameters to an ideal Fabry-Perot cavity, demonstrating the viability of the mapping. The proposed quantum simulator, therefore, allows for probing the photon (respectively phonon) production caused by the dynamical Casimir effect on the single photon level.

abstract: Single photon sources (SPS) are a fundamental building block for optical implementations of quantum information protocols. Among SPSs, multiple crystal heralded single photon sources seem to give the best compromise between high pair production rate and low multiple photon events. In this work, we study their performance in a practical quantum key distribution experiment, by evaluating the achievable key rates. The analysis focuses on the two different schemes, symmetric and asymmetric, proposed for the practical implementation of heralded single photon sources, with attention on the performance of their composing elements. The analysis is based on the protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 and on its improvement exploiting decoy state technique. Finally, a simple way of exploiting the post-selection mechanism for a passive, one decoy state scheme is evaluated.

abstract: Dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical entities and Einstein insisted that physics should describe "the real states of the real systems". While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of states, modern device-independent approaches do away with the idea of entities: physics is not built of physical systems. Focusing on the correlations between operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods promote a view more distant from conventional theory than Einstein's 'principle theories' were from 'constructive theories'. On the examples of indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling question: if physical theory is not about systems, then what is it about? The answer given by the device-independent models is that physics is about languages. In moving away from the information-theoretic reconstructions of quantum theory, this answer marks a new conceptual development in the foundations of physics.

abstract: We report on the observation of bright emission of single photons under pulsed resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot (QD) in a micropillar cavity. The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced via the coupling to the fundamental mode of a micropillar, allowing us to determine a single photon extraction efficiency of $(20.7\pm0.8)~\%$ per linear polarization basis. This yields an overall extraction efficiency of $(41.4\pm1.5)~\%$ in our device. We observe the first Rabi-oscillation in a weakly coupled quantum dot-micropillar system under coherent pulsed optical excitation, which enables us to deterministically populate the excited QD state. In this configuration, we probe the single photon statistics of the device yielding $g^{(2)}(0)=0.072\pm0.011$ at a QD-cavity detuning of $75~\mu$eV.

abstract: Resonant excitation of solid state quantum emitters has the potential to deterministically excite a localized exciton while ensuring a maximally coherent emission. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent coupling of an exciton localized in a lithographically positioned, site-controlled semiconductor quantum dot to an external resonant laser field. For strong continuous-wave driving we observe the characteristic Mollow triplet and analyze the Rabi splitting and sideband widths as a function of driving strength and temperature. The sideband widths increase linearly with temperature and the square of the driving strength, which we explain via coupling of the exciton to longitudinal acoustic phonons. We also find an increase of the Rabi splitting with temperature, which indicates a temperature induced delocalization of the excitonic wave function resulting in an increase of the oscillator strength. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the exciton excited state population via pulsed resonant excitation and observe a damping of the Rabi oscillations with increasing pulse area, which is consistent with our exciton-photon coupling model. We believe that our work outlines the possibility to implement fully scalable platforms of solid state quantum emitters. The latter is one of the key prerequisites for more advanced, integrated nanophotonic quantum circuits.

abstract: Quantum computers are poised to radically outperform their classical counterparts by manipulating coherent quantum systems. A realistic quantum computer will experience errors due to the environment and imperfect control. When these errors are even partially coherent, they present a major obstacle to achieving robust computation. Here, we propose a method for introducing independent random single-qubit gates into the logical circuit in such a way that the effective logical circuit remains unchanged. We prove that this randomization tailors the noise into stochastic Pauli errors, leading to dramatic reductions in worst-case and cumulative error rates, while introducing little or no experimental overhead. Moreover we prove that our technique is robust to variation in the errors over the gate sets and numerically illustrate the dramatic reductions in worst-case error that are achievable. Given such tailored noise, gates with significantly lower fidelity are sufficient to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, and, importantly, the worst case error rate of the tailored noise can be directly and efficiently measured through randomized benchmarking experiments. Remarkably, our method enables the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation under the error rates observed in recent experiments.

abstract: It is a well established and understood fact that photons propagating in free space interact with the gravitational field, leading to well-known effects such as gravitational redshift or gravitational lensing. While these phenomena might give an impression that photons in free space have a sort of mass, this impression falls short upon considering their dispersion relation. In this letter we show that unlike in free space, when photons are brought to a stop within a planar cavity, they acquire a mass that cannot not be distinguished from that of a solid-state body freely moving in a bidimensional space, both from the inertial and gravitational point of view.

abstract: Bell-state analysis is a considerable challenge and an essential requirement for reliable implementation of quantum communication proposals. An open question is the one for the maximal fraction of successful Bell measurements. It has been pointed out that no scheme using only linear elements can implement a Bell state analyzer. Some effort has paid attention to the complete polarization-entangled Bell-state analysis using linear optics, with the aid of auxiliary means. Here we present a symmetry-broken scheme with linear optics only, without any aid of other auxiliary means, for discriminating polarization-entangled Bell states. Although our scheme is unable of realizing complete Bell-state measurement for less photon-pairs situation, it can deterministically identify four Bell states with success probabilities beyond 99.2% provided that photon-pairs are not less than 8. Our scheme as a significant breakthrough is simpler and feasible with respect to the current technology for the near-complete Bell-state analysis. Symmetry breaking is indispensable in our scheme as in other physical systems.

abstract: We studied the quantum correlations between the nodes in a quantum neural network built of an array of quantum dots with dipole-dipole interaction. By means of the quasiadiabatic path integral simulation of the density matrix evolution in a presence of the common phonon bath we have shown the coherence in such system can survive up to the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77K and above. The quantum correlations between quantum dots are studied by means of calculation of the entanglement of formation in a pair of quantum dots with the typical dot size of a few nanometers and the interdot distance of the same order. We have shown that the proposed quantum neural network can keep the mixture of entangled states of QD pairs up to the above mentioned high temperatures.

abstract: A Non-Abelian Thermal State (NATS), the thermal state of a system that exchanges heat and non-commuting charges with other systems, can be derived from the Principle of Maximum Entropy, even though the charges fail to commute with each other. To what extent this state has physical significance, and whether it aligns with other notions of the thermal state (such as complete passivity and equilibrium considerations), has been questioned. We show that the NATS is the thermal state, deriving its form via multiple strategies. We derive its form from the microcanonical state of the system-and-bath composite, by introducing the notion of an approximate microcanonical subspace. This gives plausibility to the notion that typical evolution laws will have the NATS as an equilibrium point locally. We also show that the form of the NATS can be derived from a resource theory in which the state is completely passive. We also prove a zeroeth law and a family of second laws for thermodynamics that involves noncommuting conserved charges.

abstract: We consider a generalisation of thermodynamics that deals with multiple conserved quantities at the level of individual quantum systems. Each conserved quantity, which, importantly, need not commute with the rest, can be extracted and stored in its own battery. Unlike in standard thermodynamics, where the second law places a constraint on how much of the conserved quantity (energy) that can be extracted, here, on the contrary, there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity that can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them which are allowed. We present explicit protocols which allow us to perform arbitrarily good trade-offs and extract arbitrarily good combinations of conserved quantities from individual quantum systems.

abstract: Electron shelving gives rise to bright and dark periods in the resonance fluorescence of a three-level atom. The corresponding incoherent spectrum contains a very narrow inelastic peak on top of a two-level-like spectrum. Using the theories of balanced and conditional homodyne detection we study ensemble averaged phase-dependent fluctuations of intermittent resonance fluorescence. The sharp peak is found only in the spectra of the squeezed quadrature. In balanced homodyne detection that peak is positive, which greatly reduces the squeezing, also seen in its variance. In conditional homodyne detectionCHD, for weak to moderate laser intensity, the peak is negative, enhancing the squeezing, and for strong fields the sidebands become dispersive which, together with the positive sharp peak dominate the spectrum. The latter effect is due to non-negligible third order fluctuations produced by the atom-laser nonlinearity and the increased steady state population of the shelving state. A simple mathematical approach allows us to obtain accurate analytical results.

abstract: General analytical solutions of the Quantum Hamilton Jacobi Equation for conservative one-dimensional or reducible motion are presented and discussed. The quantum Hamilton's characteristic function and its derivative, i.e. the quantum momentum function, are obtained in general, and it is shown that any one-dimensional wave function can be exactly represented in a WKB-like form. The formalism is applied to the harmonic oscillator and to the electron's motion in the hydrogen atom, and the above mentioned functions are computed and discussed for different quantum numbers. It is analyzed how the quantum quantities investigated tend to the corresponding classical ones, in the limit $\hbar\to 0$. These results demonstrate that the Quantum Hamilton Jacobi Equation is not only completely equivalent to the Schr\"odinger Equation, but allows also to fully investigate the transition from quantum to classical mechanics.

abstract: We propose a scheme for triggering a dissipation dominated highly efficient excitation transfer from a single photon wave packet to a single quantum emitter. This single photon induced optical pumping turns dominant dissipative processes, such as spontaneous photon emission by the emitter or cavity decay, into valuable tools for quantum information processing and quantum communication. It works for an arbitrarily shaped single photon wave packet with sufficiently small bandwidth provided a matching condition is satisfied which balances the dissipative rates involved. Our scheme does not require additional laser pulses or quantum feedback and is not restricted to highly mode selective cavity quantum electrodynamical architectures. In particular, it can be used to enhance significantly the coupling of a single photon to a single quantum emitter implanted in a one dimensional waveguide or even in a free space scenario. We demonstrate the usefulness of our scheme for building a deterministic quantum memory and a deterministic frequency converter between photonic qubits of different wavelengths.

abstract: We demonstrate that a phase-insensitive parametric amplifier, coupled to a quantum correlated source, can be used as a quantum information tap for noiseless three-way signal splitting. We find that the output signals are amplified noiselessly in two of the three output ports while the other can more or less keep its original input size without adding noise. This scheme is able to cascade and scales up for efficient information distribution in an optical network. Furthermore, we find this scheme satisfies the criteria for a non-ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and thus can serve as a QND measurement device. With two readouts correlated to the input, we find this scheme also satisfies the criterion for sequential QND measurement.

But quantum theory itself is both local and realistic when properly interpreted using a quantum Hilbert space rather than the classical hidden variables used to derive Bell inequalities. There is no spooky action at a distance in the real world we live in if it is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Violation of a Bell inequality guarantees the existence of quantum correlations in a quantum state. A pure bipartite quantum state, having nonvanishing quantum correlation, always violates a Bell inequality. Such correspondence is absent for multipartite pure quantum states. For a shared multipartite quantum state, we establish a connection between the monogamy of Bell inequality violation and genuine multi-site entanglement as well as monogamy-based multiparty quantum correlation measures. We find that generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and another single-parameter family states which we refer to as the "special Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger" states have the status of extremal states in such relations.

abstract: The present paper is the first of two articles aimed at constructing $n$-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems by an algebraic approach. In molecular spectroscopy, the construction of vibrational Hamiltonian for strongly excited molecular systems by using an algebraic formalism requires the introduction by hand the operators describing the change in energy by numerous quanta and it is tedious to predict in advance the total number of operators appearing in the development. The goal of the two articles is not only to propose in the local limit a systematic method for constructing a normalized vibrational Hamiltonian for a strongly excited $n$-degree-of-freedom molecular system from the generators of the Lie algebra, the algebra of polynomial invariants, but also to enumerate the number of independent operators needed for the construction of the Hamiltonian developed in the base of these generators up to the given order $N$. The first article introduces the theoretical tools used in the both papers (section \ref{norm}), and presents the method of construction in case of absence of resonance (section \ref{const}). Finally, an application for a triatomic non-linear ClOH molecule is considered in case close to the dissociation limit. (section \ref{Appli}).

abstract: In this paper, we show that it is possible to measure the phase shift between two pathways of light with an accuracy above the standard quantum limit without using entanglement. To illustrate this, we propose a quantum-enhanced metrology scheme based on a laser-driven optical cavity inside an instantaneous quantum feedback loop. The purpose of the feedback laser is to provide a reference frame and to enhance the dependence of the dynamics of the system on the measured phase. Since our scheme does not require highly-efficient single photon detectors, it is of practical interest until technologies for the generation of highly-entangled many-photon states become more readily available.

abstract: Measuring the state of a quantum system is a fundamental process in quantum mechanics and plays an essential role in quantum information and quantum technologies. One method to measure a quantum observable is to sort the system in different spatial modes according to the measured value, followed by single-particle detectors on each mode. Examples of quantum sorters are polarizing beam-splitters (PBS) -- which direct photons according to their polarization -- and Stern-Gerlach devices. Here we propose a general scheme to sort a quantum system according to the value of any $d$-dimensional degree of freedom, such as spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM), wavelength etc. Our scheme is universal, works at single-particle level and has a theoretical efficiency of 100%. As an application we design an efficient OAM sorter consisting of a single multi-path interferometer which is suitable for a photonic chip implementation.

abstract: We introduce open-loop quantum control protocols for characterizing the spectral properties of non-Gaussian noise, applicable to both classical and quantum dephasing environments. The basic idea is to engineer a multi-dimensional frequency comb via repetition of suitably designed pulse sequences, through which the desired high-order noise spectra may be related to observable properties of the qubit probe. We prove that access to a high time resolution is key to achieve spectral reconstruction over an extended bandwidth, overcoming limitations of existing schemes. Non-Gaussian spectroscopy is demonstrated for a classical noise model describing quadratic dephasing at an optimal point, as well as a quantum spin-boson model out of equilibrium. In both cases, we obtain spectral reconstructions that accurately predict the qubit dynamics in the non-Gaussian regime.

abstract: We present the first experimental characterization of the azimuthal Wigner distribution of a photon. Our protocol fully characterizes the transverse structure of a photon in conjugate bases of orbital angular momentum (OAM) and azimuthal angle (ANG). We provide a test of our protocol by characterizing pure superpositions and incoherent mixtures of OAM modes in a seven-dimensional space. The time required for performing measurements in our scheme scales only linearly with the dimension size of the state under investigation. This time scaling makes our technique suitable for quantum information applications involving a large number of OAM states.

abstract: Adaptive techniques have important potential for wide applications in enhancing precision of quantum parameter estimation. We present a recursively adaptive quantum state tomography (RAQST) protocol for finite dimensional quantum systems and experimentally implement the adaptive tomography protocol on two-qubit systems. In this RAQST protocol, an adaptive measurement strategy and a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm are performed. Numerical results show that our RAQST protocol can outperform the tomography protocols using mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and the two-stage MUB adaptive strategy even with the simplest product measurements. When nonlocal measurements are available, our RAQST can beat the Gill-Massar bound for a wide range of quantum states with a modest number of copies. We use only the simplest product measurements to implement two-qubit tomography experiments. In the experiments, we use error-compensation techniques to tackle systematic error due to misalignments and imperfection of wave plates, and achieve about 100-fold reduction of the systematic error. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement of RAQST over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states with a high level of purity. Our results also show that this recursively adaptive tomography method is particularly effective for the reconstruction of maximally entangled states, which are important resources in quantum information.

abstract: A fundamental requirement in the circuit model of quantum information processing is the realization of fault-tolerant multi-qubit quantum gates with entangling capabilities. A key step towards this end is to achieve control of qubit states through geometric phases at very small spatial scales in an effective and feasible way. A spin-electric coupling present in antiferromagnetic triangular single-molecule magnets (SMMs) allows for manipulation of the spin (qubit) states with a great flexibility. Here, we establish an all-electrical two-qubit geometric phase shift gate acting on the four-fold ground state manifold of a triangular SMM, which represents an effective two-qubit state space. We show that a two-qubit quantum gate with arbitrary entangling power can be achieved through the Berry phase effect, induced by adiabatically varying an external electric field in the plane of the molecule.

abstract: A system of harmonic oscillators coupled via nonlinear interaction is a fundamental model in many branches of physics, from biophysics to electronics and condensed matter physics. In quantum optics, weak nonlinear interaction between light modes has enabled, for example, the preparation of squeezed states of light and generation of entangled photon pairs. While strong nonlinear interaction between the modes has been realized in circuit QED systems, achieving significant interaction strength on the level of single quanta in other physical systems remains a challenge. Here we experimentally demonstrate such interaction that is equivalent to photon up- and down-conversion using normal modes of motion in a system of two Yb ions. The nonlinearity is induced by the intrinsic anharmonicity of the Coulomb interaction between the ions and can be used to simulate fully quantum operation of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator. We exploit this interaction to directly measure the parity and Wigner functions of ion motional states. The nonlinear coupling, combined with near perfect control of internal and motional states of trapped ions, can be applied to quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and even shed some light on the quantum information aspects of Hawking radiation.

abstract: We propose a method for measuring the Berry curvature from the wave-packet dynamics in perturbed arrays of evanescently coupled optical waveguides with honeycomb lattice structure. To disentangle the effects of the Berry curvature and the energy dispersion we suggest a difference measurement by propagating the wave packet under the influence of a constant external force back and forth. In this way a non-vanishing Berry curvature is obtained for photonic graphene with small sublattice bias or strain, where the relative error between the exact Berry curvature and the one derived from the semiclassical dynamics is largely negligible. For the strained lattice we demonstrate the robustness of the Berry curvature texture over the Brillouin zone compared to the energy dispersion. We also comment on a experimental realization of our method for mapping the Berry curvature.

abstract: The theoretical possibility to use an electron microscope as a spin polarizer is studied. It turns out that a Bessel beam passing a standard magnetic objective lens is intrinsically spin polarized. In the limit of infinitely small detectors on axis, the spin polarisation tends to 100 % . Increasing the detector size, the polarisation decreases rapidly, dropping below 10^-4 for standard settings of medium voltage microscopes. For extremely low voltages, the figure of merit increases by two orders of magnitude, approaching that of existing Mott detectors. Our findings may lead to new desings of spin filters, an attractive option in view of its inherent combination with the electron microscope, especially at low voltage.

abstract: We find a single parameter family of genuinely entangled three qubit pure states, called maximally Bell inequality violating states, which exhibits maximum Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite system for a fixed amount of genuine tripartite correlation. This in turn implies that there holds a complementary relation between the Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite systems and the genuine tripartite correlation present in the tripartite pure states. Tangle, generalized geometric measure and discord monogamy score have been considered to quantify the genuine quantum correlation of the tripartite pure states. The complementarity suggests the Bell violation in the reduced two qubit system comes at the price of the total tripartite correlations present in the entire system.

abstract: A recursive approach to determine the Hilbert-Schmidt measure of pairwise quantum discord in a special class of symmetric states of $k$ qubits is presented. We especially focus on the reduced states of $k$ qubits obtained from a balanced superposition of symmetric $n$-qubit states (multiqubit Schr\"odinger cat states) by tracing out $n-k$ particles $(k=2,3, \cdots ,n-1)$. Two pairing schemes are considered. In the first one, the geometric discord measuring the correlation between one qubit and the party grouping $(k-1)$ qubits is explicitly derived. This uses recursive relations between the Fano-Bloch correlation matrices associated with subsystems comprising $k$, $k-1$, $\cdots$ and $2$ particles. A detailed analysis is given for two, three and four qubit systems. In the second scheme, the subsystem comprising the $(k-1)$ qubits is mapped into a system of two logical qubits. We show that these two bipartition schemes are equivalents in evaluating the pairwise correlation in multi-qubits systems. The explicit expressions of classical states presenting zero discord are derived.

They include three-qubit states of ${\rm W}$, ${\rm GHZ}$ and Bell type. We also discuss the monogamy property of geometric quantum discord in some mixed three-qubit systems.

abstract: The Zeeman-split spin-states of a single electron confined in a self-assembled quantum dot provide an optically-accessible spin qubit. For III-V materials the nuclear spins of the solid-state host provide an intrinsic noise source, resulting in electron-spin dephasing times of few nanoseconds. While a comprehensive study of electron-spin dynamics at low magnetic field has recently been carried out, what limits the electron coherence in these systems remains unclear, in part due to the dominant effect of measurement-induced dynamic polarisation of the nuclear bath. We develop an all-optical method to access the quantum dot spin-state without perturbing the nuclear environment. We use this method to implement Hahn-echo decoupling and reach the intrinsic limit to coherence set by inhomogeneous strain fields coupling to quadrupolar moments of the nuclear bath. These results indicate that the extension of electron spin coherence beyond this few-microsecond limit necessitates the reduction of strain-induced quadrupolar broadening in these materials.

abstract: We consider pure fermionic states with varying number of quasiparticles and demonstrate that spectra of partial states (reduced with respect to some bipartition) are not identical as it takes place for bosons and conventional states in spaces with tensor product structure. We fully characterize pure states with equispectral partial states and show that they are related via local unitary operations with states satisfying the parity superselection rule. Thus, valid purifications for fermionic density operators are found. As a byproduct, the positive semidefinite density matrix for fermions is constructed without implying the state gaussianity. The developed formalism clearly indicates that the conventional partial trace methods are not applicable to fermionic systems.

abstract: The ability of matter to be superposed at two different locations while being intrinsically connected by a quantum phase is among the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum physics. While such superpositions have been created for a variety of systems, the in-situ observation of the phase coherence has remained out of reach. Using a heralding measurement on a spin-oscillator entangled state, we project a mechanical trapped-ion oscillator into a superposition of two spatially separated states, a situation analogous to Schr\"odinger's cat. Quantum interference is clearly observed by extracting the occupations of the energy levels. For larger states, we encounter problems in measuring the energy distribution, which we overcome by performing the analogous measurement in a squeezed Fock basis with each basis element stretched along the separation axis. Using 8 dB of squeezing we observe quantum interference for cat states with phase space separations of $\Delta \alpha = 15.6$, corresponding to wavepackets with a root-mean-square extent of 7.8 nm separated by over 240 nm. We also introduce a method for reconstructing the Wigner phase-space quasi-probability distribution using both squeezed and non-squeezed Fock bases. We apply this to a range of negative parity cats, observing the expected interference fringes and negative values at the center of phase space. Alongside the fundamental nature of these large state superpositions, our reconstruction methods facilitate access to the large Hilbert spaces required to work with mesoscopic quantum superpositions, and may be realized in a wide range of experimental platforms.

abstract: That superpositions of states can be useful for performing tasks in quantum systems has been known since the early days of quantum information, but only recently has quantitative theory of quantum coherence been proposed. Here we apply that theory to an analysis of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which depends on quantum coherence for its operation. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves a decision problem, and we focus on a probabilistic version of that problem, comparing probability of being correct for both classical and quantum procedures. In addition, we study a related decision problem in which the quantum procedure has one-sided error while the classical procedure has two-sided error. The role of coherence on the quantum success probabilities in both of these problems is examined.

abstract: We propose a multiple-range quantum communication channel to realize coherent two-way quantum state transport with high fidelity. In our scheme, an information carrier (a qubit) and its remote partner are both adiabatically coupled to the same data bus, i.e., an N}-site tight-binding chain that has a single defect at the center. At the weak interaction regime, our system is effectively equivalent to a three level system of which a coherent superposition of the two carrier states constitutes a dark state. The adiabatic coupling allows a well controllable information exchange timing via the dark state between the two carriers. Numerical results show that our scheme is robust and efficient under practically inevitable perturbative defects of the data bus as well as environmental dephasing noise.

abstract: Beyond the conventional quantum regression theorem, a general formula for non-Markovian correlation functions of arbitrary system operators both in the time- and frequency-domain is given. We approach the problem by transforming the conventional time-nonlocal master equation into dispersed time-local equations-of-motion. The validity of our approximations is discussed and we find that the non-Markovian terms have to be included for short times. While calculations of the density matrix at short times suffer from the initial value problem, a correlation function has a well defined initial state. The resulting formula for the non-Markovian correlation function has a simple structure and is as convenient in its application as the conventional quantum regression theorem for the Markovian case. For illustrations, we apply our method to investigate the spectrum of the current fluctuations of interacting quantum dots contacted with two electrodes. The corresponding non-Markovian characteristics are demonstrated.

abstract: An optical field inside a Fabry-Perot cavity would exhibit multistability either when an atomic medium, acting as a classical dielectric, is filled into the cavity or when the cavity becomes optomechanical where one reflecting end becomes movable. An external laser is essential in both cases to drive the cavity mode out of the zero equilibrium state. We study the equilibrium states of an atom-filled optomechanical cavity, where the atoms are considered a collective two-level systems as well as an active component that replaces the role of the driving laser. Multistability is found when the atomic ensemble is lossy, for which the complex atom-photon coupling breaks the \mathcal{PT}-symmetry of the system Hamiltonian and matches in a periodic pattern to the frequencies and the linewidths of the cavity mode and the collective bosonic mode of the atoms. We show an input-output hystersis cycle between the atomic mode and the cavity mode to demonstrate the driving role the atoms replace an extra-cavity laser.

abstract: We consider a non-equilibrium system of interacting emitters described by the XXZ model, whose excitonic transitions are spatially and spectrally coupled to a single mode cavity. We demonstrate how the output radiation field is sensitive to an interplay between the hopping ($J$) and the interactions ($U$) of the excitons. Moderate values of the short ranged interaction are shown to induce laser with maximal output at the Heisenberg point ($U=J$). In the laser regime, the chain of emitters shows short range charge-density-wave order for interactions below the Heisenberg point, and long range correlations at the Heisenberg point, in remarkable contrast to the equilibrium ground state behavior of the spin chain.

abstract: In this work we propose a measure for the quantum discord of indistinguishable particles, based on the definition of entanglement of particles given in [H. M. Wiseman et al., Phis. Rev. Lett 91, 097902 (2003)]. This discord of particles is then used to evaluate the quantum correlations in a system of two identical bosons (fermions), where the particles perform a quantum random walk described by the Hubbard hamiltonian in a 1D lattice. The dynamics of the particles is either unperturbed or subject to a classical environmental noise - such as random telegraph, pink or brown noise. The observed results are consistent with those for the entanglement of particles, and we observe that on-site interaction between particles have an important protective effect on correlations against the decoherence of the system.

abstract: We study theoretically how multiple scattering of light in a disordered medium can spontaneously generate quantum correlations. In particular we focus on the case where the input state is Gaussian and characterize the correlations between two arbitrary output modes. As there is not a single all-inclusive measure of correlation, we characterise the output correlations with three measures: intensity fluctuations, entanglement, and quantum discord. We found that, while a single mode coherent state input can not produce quantum correlations, any other Gaussian input will produce them in one form or another. This includes input states that are usually regarded as more classical than coherent ones, such as thermal states, which will produce a non zero quantum discord.

We demonstrate that two pairs of singlet states shared by two parties can be self-tested even in presence of collective measurements, with a tolerance to noise well within reach of state-of-the-art experiments.

abstract: One of the main signatures of quantum mechanics beyond classical physics is coherence, the existence of superposition states. The recently developed resource theory of quantum coherence quantifies this rigorously by supposing a fixed preferred basis for a given physical situation. The incoherent states are identified as mixtures of the preferred basis states, while the incoherent operations are defined such that they cannot create coherence. So far there has been little discussion about the physical meaning of these operations. We show that a subset known as strictly incoherent operations are more relevant to the question of whether a given process makes use of coherence: under strictly incoherent operations, the results of measurements in the preferred basis on the output state do not depend on the coherence of the input state. We demonstrate that measurements in a coherent basis are needed to make use of coherence, and that such measurements must be generated by coherent unitary interactions with an environment. Finally, we show that the strictly incoherent operations provide a natural setting in which to study the behaviour of discord-type quantum correlations, in particular how they may be consumed and generated.

abstract: $ \newcommand{\Xlin}{\mathcal{X}} \newcommand{\Zlin}{\mathcal{Z}} \newcommand{\C}{\mathbb{C}} $We give a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem in which there is a constant number of provers, questions are classical of length polynomial in the number of qubits, and answers are of constant length. The main novelty of our protocol is that the gap between completeness and soundness is directly proportional to the promise gap on the (normalized) ground state energy of the Hamiltonian. This result can be interpreted as a concrete step towards a quantum PCP theorem giving entangled-prover interactive proof systems for QMA-complete problems. The key ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld, where the function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is replaced by a pair of functions $\Xlin, \Zlin:\{0,1\}^n\to \text{Obs}_d(\C)$, the set of $d$-dimensional Hermitian matrices that square to identity. The test enforces that (i) each function is exactly linear, $\Xlin(a)\Xlin(b)=\Xlin(a+b)$ and $\Zlin(a) \Zlin(b)=\Zlin(a+b)$, and (ii) the two functions are approximately complementary, $\Xlin(a)\Zlin(b)\approx (-1)^{a\cdot b} \Zlin(b)\Xlin(a)$.

We study the algebraic structure of this graph. The relations for the algebra generated by the graph are derived. In the limiting case $\theta =\pm1$ the graph becomes abelian and degenerates into the direct sum of four one-dimensional irreducible representations of the Klein group.

abstract: Principal component analysis is a multivariate statistical method frequently used in science and engineering to reduce the dimension of a problem or extract the most significant features from a dataset. In this paper, using a similar notion to the quantum counting, we show how to apply the amplitude amplification together with the phase estimation algorithm to an operator in order to procure the eigenvectors of the operator associated to the eigenvalues defined in the range $\left[a, b\right]$, where $a$ and $b$ are real and $0 \leq a \leq b \leq 1$. This makes possible to obtain a combination of the eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues and so can be used to do principal component analysis on quantum computers.

abstract: The concept of a \emph{weak value} of a quantum observable was developed in the late 1980s by Aharonov and colleagues to characterize the value of an observable for a quantum system in the time interval between two projective measurements. Curiously, these values often lie outside the eigenspectrum of the observable, and can even be complex-valued. Nevertheless, the weak value of a quantum observable has been shown to be a valuable resource in quantum metrology, and has received recent attention in foundational aspects of quantum mechanics. This paper is driven by a desire to more fully understand the underlying mathematical structure of weak values. In order to do this, we allow an observable to be \emph{any} Hermitian operator, and use the pre- and post-selected states to develop well-defined linear maps between the Hermitian operators and their corresponding weak values. We may then use the inherent Euclidean structure on Hermitian space to geometrically decompose a weak value of an observable. In the case in which the quantum systems are qubits, we provide a full geometric characterization of weak values.

abstract: Deterministic optical quantum logic requires a nonlinear quantum process that alters the phase of a quantum optical state by $\pi$ through interaction with only one photon. Here, we demonstrate a large conditional cross-phase modulation between a signal field, stored inside an atomic quantum memory, and a control photon that traverses a high-finesse optical cavity containing the atomic memory. This approach avoids fundamental limitations associated with multimode effects for traveling optical photons. We measure a conditional cross-phase shift of up to $\pi/3$ between the retrieved signal and control photons, and confirm deterministic entanglement between the signal and control modes by extracting a positive concurrence. With a moderate improvement in cavity finesse, our system can reach a coherent phase shift of $\pi$ at low loss, enabling deterministic and universal photonic quantum logic.

abstract: The Terahertz frequency range bears intriguing opportunities, beyond very advanced applications in spectroscopy and matter control. Peculiar quantum phenomena are predicted to lead to light emission by non-trivial mechanisms. Typically, such emission mechanisms are unraveled by temporal correlation measurements of photon arrival times, as demonstrated in their pioneering work by Hanbury Brown and Twiss. So far, the Terahertz range misses an experimental implementation of such technique with very good temporal properties and high sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a room-temperature scheme to measure photon correlations at THz frequencies based on electro-optic sampling. The temporal resolution of 146 fs is faster than one cycle of oscillation and the sensitivity is so far limited to ~1500 photons. With this technique, we measure the photon statistics of a THz quantum cascade laser. The proposed measurement scheme allows, in principle, the measurement of ultrahigh bandwidth photons and paves the way towards THz quantum optics.

abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has been proposed as a quantum enhanced optimization heuristic exploiting tunneling. Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables this results in a time-to-99%-success-probability that is $\sim 10^8$ times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X runs up to $\sim 10^8$ times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA and better than the best known classical algorithms for this problem. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.

abstract: Complex information-processing systems, for example quantum circuits, cryptographic protocols, or multi-player games, are naturally described as networks composed of more basic information-processing systems. A modular analysis of such systems requires a mathematical model of systems that is closed under composition, i.e., a network of these objects is again an object of the same type. We propose such a model and call the corresponding systems causal boxes. Causal boxes capture superpositions of causal structures, e.g., messages sent by a causal box A can be in a superposition of different orders or in a superposition of being sent to box B and box C. Furthermore, causal boxes can model systems whose behavior depends on time. By instantiating the Abstract Cryptography framework with causal boxes, we obtain the first composable security framework that can handle arbitrary quantum protocols and relativistic protocols.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.02256
abstract: In this article we present a new prepare and measure quantum key distribution protocol that uses an experimentally accessible measure of single qubit contextuality to warranty the security of the quantum channel. The definition of contextuality used is that due to Spekkens in which any underlying hidden variable model of the physical system is noncontextual if the probability distribution of the model's hidden variables is independent of the preparation and measurement context. Under this more general definition of noncontextuality the measurement outcomes of a single qubit can be shown to require a contextual model in order to reproduce the results of some non-projective, positive operator valued measurements (POVMs). The proposed protocol utilizes a particular set of POVMs to exhibit the degree of contextuality of the qubits exiting the QKD system's quantum channel. The contextuality measure is defined in terms of the weak values of a set of projective measurements that are implemented as POVMs using weak measurements. The resulting QKD protocol should have a key rate that is equal to or greater than BB84 since none of the sifted key is used to test for the presence of an eavesdropper. Additionally, the new protocol is shown to be immune to detector based attacks.

Here we present the detailed characterization of such a hybrid system: a locally implanted rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ in Al$_2$O$_3$ spin system coupled to a superconducting micro-resonator. We investigate the properties of the implanted spin system through angular dependent micro-resonator electron spin resonance (micro-ESR) spectroscopy. We find, despite the high energy near-surface implantation, the resulting micro-ESR spectra to be in excellent agreement with the modelled Hamiltonian, supporting the integration of dopant ions into their relevant lattice sites whilst maintaining crystalline symmetries. Furthermore, we observe clear contributions from individual microwave field components of our micro-resonator, emphasising the need for controllable local implantation.

abstract: The evolution of a quantum state undergoing radiative decay depends on how the emission is detected. We employ phase-sensitive amplification to perform homodyne detection of the spontaneous emission from a superconducting artificial atom. Using quantum state tomography, we characterize the correlation between the detected homodyne signal and the emitter's state, and map out the conditional back-action of homodyne measurement. By tracking the diffusive quantum trajectories of the state as it decays, we characterize selective stochastic excitation induced by the choice of measurement basis. Our results demonstrate dramatic differences from the quantum jump evolution that is associated with photodetection and highlight how continuous field detection can be harnessed to control quantum evolution.

abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that photon-photon attraction can be engineered in the continuum of scattering states for pairs of photons propagating in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with cold atoms. The atoms are regularly spaced in an optical lattice configuration and the photons are resonantly tuned to an internal atomic transition. We show that the hard-core repulsion resulting from saturation of the atomic transitions induces bunching in the photonic component of the collective atom-photon modes (polaritons). Bunching is obtained in a frequency range as large as tens of GHz, and can be controlled by the inter-atomic separation. We provide a fully analytical explanation for this phenomenon by proving that correlations result from a mismatch of the quantization volumes for atomic excitations and photons in the continuum. Even stronger correlations can be observed for in-gap two-polariton bound states. Our theoretical results use parameters relevant for current experiments with Rb atoms excited on the D2-line.

abstract: Entanglement, a critical resource for quantum information processing, needs to be witnessed in many practical scenarios. Theoretically, witnessing entanglement is by measuring a special Hermitian observable, called entanglement witness (EW), which has non-negative expected outcomes for all separable states but can have negative expectations for certain entangled states. In practice, an EW implementation may suffer from two problems. The first one is \emph{reliability}. Due to unreliable realization devices, a separable state could be falsely identified as an entangled one. The second problem relates to \emph{robustness}. A witness may not to optimal for a target state and fail to identify its entanglement. To overcome the reliability problem, we employ a recently proposed measurement-device-independent entanglement witness, in which the correctness of the conclusion is independent of the implemented measurement devices. In order to overcome the robustness problem, we optimize the EW to draw a better conclusion given certain experimental data. With the proposed EW scheme, where only data postprocessing needs to be modified comparing to the original measurement-device-independent scheme, one can efficiently take advantage of the measurement results to maximally draw reliable conclusions.

This compact squeezed light source can be potentially utilized in the quantum information protocols such as quantum repeater and memory, and quantum metrology such as atomic magnetometer.

abstract: The well-known Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relations have state-dependent lower bounds which are trivial for certain states. We present a general approach to deriving tight state-independent uncertainty relations for qubit measurements that completely characterise the obtainable uncertainty values. This approach can give such relations for any number of observables, and we do so explicitly for arbitrary pairs and triples of qubit measurements. We show how these relations can be transformed into equivalent tight entropic uncertainty relations. More generally, they can be expressed in terms of any measure of uncertainty that can be written as a function of the expectation value of the observable for a given state.

abstract: Association rules mining is one of the most important problems in knowledge discovery and data mining. The goal of it is to acquire consumption habits of customers by discovering the relationships between items from a transaction database that has a large number of transactions and items. The most compute intensive process for ARM is to find out the frequent 1-itemsets and 2-itemsets. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for finding out the frequent 1-itemsets and 2-itemsets. In our algorithm, to mine the frequent 1-itemsets efficiently, we use the technique of amplitude amplification. To mine the frequent 2-itemsets efficiently, we propose a new tomography scheme, i.e., pure-state-based quantum state tomography. It is shown that our algorithm is potential to achieve exponential speedup in the number of transactions and polynomial speedup in the number of items over the classical algorithm.

Switching on the interaction between the molecule and the field at a particular time, we study the resulting temporal evolution of the Casimir-Polder interaction. The dynamical self-dressing of the molecule and its population-induced dynamics are accounted for and discussed. In particular, we find that the Casimir-Polder force between a chiral molecule and a perfect mirror oscillates in time with a frequency related to the molecular transition frequency, and converges to the static result for large times.

abstract: In this paper we investigate the robustness of the quantum correlations against the environment effects in various opto-mechanical bipartite systems. For two spatially separated opto-mechanical cavities, we give analytical formula for the global covariance matrix involving two mechanical modes and two optical modes. The logarithmic negativity as an indicator of the degree of entanglement and the Gaussian quantum discord which is a witness of quantumness of correlations are used as quantifiers to evaluate the different pairwise quantum correlations in the whole system. The evolution of the quantum correlations existing in this opto-mechanical system are analyzed in terms of the thermal bath temperature, squeezing parameter and the opto-mechanical cooperativity. We find that with desirable choice of these parameters, it is possible either enhance or annihilate the quantum correlations in the system. Various scenarios are discussed in detail.

abstract: I calculate the mixed threetangle $\tau_3[\rho]$ for the reduced density matrices of the four-qubit representant states found in Phys. Rev. A {\bf 65}, 052112 (2002) and compare with results presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 110501 (2014). I mostly find the convex roof, except in two classes, where I provide with an upper bound which is lower than those obtained in the latter publication. Since the method used by the authors usually results in higher values for the upper bound, in certain cases it can be understood why the convex roof is obtained. This is not so in one case, where the exact convex roof is obtained whereas a different result was expected. I also report on a false result that has been published therein, that however does not touch possible conclusions out of it. However, the central message of that work was impossible to be drawn by a negative lower bound of something being a tangle an hence being non-negative. One possibility is, to render this lower bound as large as possible or to replace it by an upper bound. Here, I follow the former way, confirming the lower bound of Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 110501 (2014). Together with the surmise that this result coincides with the convex roof, one would conclude that indeed a different monogamy extension had to be formulated.

Role of the relative phase in the initial superposition in attaining localisation and delocalisation is discussed. Effects of dissipation and decoherence are considered and the use of quantum interference in reducing dissipation is explored. Many of the features of the system are shown to be the consequences of quantum interference.

abstract: Various approaches of defining and determining work performed on a quantum system are compared. Any operational definition of work, however, must allow for two facts, first, that work characterizes a process rather than an instantaneous state of a system, and, second, that quantum systems are sensitive to the interactions with a measurement apparatus. We compare different measurement scenarios on the basis of the resulting post-measurement states and the according probabilities for finding a particular work value. In particular, we analyze a recently proposed work-meter for the case of a Gaussian pointer state and compare it with the results obtained by two projective and, alternatively, two Gaussian measurements. In the limit of a strong effective measurement strength the work distribution of projective two energy measurements can be recovered. In the opposite limit the average of work becomes independent of any measurement. Yet the fluctuations about this value diverge. The performance of the work-meter is illustrated by the example of a spin in a suddenly changing magnetic field.

abstract: Rapid state control of quantum systems is significant in reducing the influence of relaxation or decoherence caused by the environment and enhancing the capability in dealing with uncertainties in the model and control process. Bang-bang Lyapunov control can speed up the control process, but cannot guarantee convergence to a target state. This paper proposes two classes of new Lyapunov control methods that can achieve rapidly convergent control for quantum states. One class is switching Lyapunov control where the control law is designed by switching between bang-bang Lyapunov control and standard Lyapunov control. The other class is approximate bang-bang Lyapunov control where we propose two special control functions which are continuously differentiable and yet have a bang-bang type property. Related stability results are given and a construction method for the degrees of freedom in the Lyapunov function is presented to guarantee rapid convergence to a target eigenstate being isolated in the invariant set. Several numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve improved performance for rapid state control of quantum systems.

abstract: Dirac particle dynamics is encoded as a unitary path summation rule and implemented on a qubit array, where the qubit array represents both spacetime and the fermions contained therein. The unitary path summation rule gives a quantum algorithm to model a many-body system of Dirac particles in a gauge field with Lorentz invariance down to the grid scale (Planck scale)--the lattice-based model neither suffers the Fermi-sign problem nor breaks Lorentz invariance. Yet, for the Dirac Hamiltonian to generate the unitary evolution of the 4-spinor field at the Planck scale, there is time dilation between the shortest observable time near a single space point and that time measured at long-wavelength scales. We find gravitational time dilation where the model space around each point (with an even number of qubits) is curved like the space around a Schwarzschild black hole.

abstract: We consider the global thermal state of classical and quantum harmonic oscillators that interact with a reservoir. Ohmic damping of the oscillator can be exactly treated with a 1D scalar field reservoir, whereas general non-Ohmic damping is conveniently treated with a continuum reservoir of harmonic oscillators. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian of the total system, we calculate a number of thermodynamic quantities for the damped oscillator: the mean force internal energy, mean force free energy, and another internal energy based on the free-oscillator Hamiltonian. The classical mean force energy is equal to that of a free oscillator, for both Ohmic and non-Ohmic damping and no matter how strong the coupling to the reservoir. In contrast, the quantum mean force energy depends on the details of the damping and diverges for strictly Ohmic damping. These results give additional insight into the steady-state thermodynamics of open systems with arbitrarily strong coupling to a reservoir, complementing results for energies derived within dynamical approaches (e.g. master equations) in the weak-coupling regime.

abstract: In the 70's Smith and Tassie, and Bell and Ruegg independently found SU(2) symmetries of the Dirac equation with scalar and vector potentials. These symmetries, known as pseudospin and spin symmetries, have been extensively researched and applied to several physical systems. Twenty years after, in 1997, the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed by Ginocchio as a relativistic symmetry of the atomic nuclei when it is described by relativistic mean field hadronic models. The main feature of these symmetries is the suppression of the spin-orbit coupling either in the upper or lower components of the Dirac spinor, thereby turning the respective second-order equations into Schr\"odinger-like equations, i.e, without a matrix structure. In this paper we propose a generalization of these SU(2) symmetries for potentials in the Dirac equation with several Lorentz structures, which also allow for the suppression of the matrix structure of second-order equation equation of either the upper or lower components of the Dirac spinor. We derive the general properties of those potentials and list some possible candidates, which include the usual spin-pseudospin potentials, and also 2- and 1-dimensional potentials. An application for a particular physical system in two dimensions, electrons in graphene, is suggested.

abstract: Finding equilibration times is a major unsolved problem in physics with few analytical results. Here we look at equilibration times for quantum gases of bosons and fermions for coarse measurements when inter-particle interactions are negligible. To do this, we show that solving the N particle equilibration problem is equivalent to solving a single-particle equilibration problem. We look at some examples, including N fermions initially confined on one side of a partition in a box. The partition is removed and the fermions equilibrate in time O(1/N). We also show that, for these coarse measurements, equilibration occurs quite generally despite the fact that the particles are not interacting. Furthermore, the timescale generally appears to be, at worst, polynomial in N.

abstract: Classical measurement strategies in many areas are approaching their maximum resolution and sensitivity levels, but these levels often still fall far short of the ultimate limits allowed by the laws of physics. To go further, strategies must be adopted that take into account the quantum nature of the probe particles and that optimize their quantum states for the desired application. Here, we review some of these approaches, in which quantum entanglement, the orbital angular momentum of single photons, and quantum interferometry are used to produce optical measurements beyond the classical limit.

abstract: Distance measures between quantum states like the trace distance and the fidelity can naturally be defined by optimizing a classical distance measure over all measurement statistics that can be obtained from the respective quantum states. In contrast, Petz showed that the measured relative entropy, defined as a maximization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence over projective measurement statistics, is strictly smaller than Umegaki's quantum relative entropy whenever the states do not commute. We extend this result in two ways. First, we show that Petz' conclusion remains true if we allow general positive valued measures. To do this, we prove that maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence over general positive valued measures results in the measured relative entropy. Second, we extend the result to R\'enyi relative entropies and show that for non-commuting states the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy is strictly larger than the measured R\'enyi relative entropy for $\alpha \in (\frac12, \infty)$, and strictly smaller for $\alpha \in [0,\frac12)$. The latter statement provides counterexamples for the data-processing inequality of the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy for $\alpha < \frac12$. Our main tool is a new variational expression for the measured R\'enyi relative entropy, which we further exploit to show that certain lower bounds on quantum conditional mutual information are superadditive.

abstract: We study the evolution of the entanglement of two independent bosonic modes embedded in a thermal environment, in the framework of the theory of open quantum systems. As a measure of entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. For a non-zero temperature of the thermal reservoir the entangled initial Gaussian states become always separable in a finite time. For initial squeezed thermal states we calculate the survival time of entanglement and analyze its dependence on temperature, squeezing parameter and mean thermal photon numbers. For a zero temperature of the thermal bath an entangled initial state remains entangled for all finite times, but in the limit of asymptotically large times it becomes separable.

abstract: When quantum teleportation is performed with truly identical massive particles, indistinguishability allows us to teleport addressable degrees of freedom which do not identify particles, but e.g. orthogonal modes. The key resource of the protocol is a state of entangled modes, but the conservation of the total number of particles does not allow for perfect deterministic teleportation unless the number of particles in the resource state goes to infinity. Here, we study the convergence of teleportation performances in the above limit, and provide sufficient conditions for asymptotic perfect teleporation. We also apply these conditions to the case of resource states affected by noise.

abstract: The spatial modes of photons are one realization of a QuDit, a quantum system that is described in a D-dimensional Hilbert space. In order to perform quantum information tasks with QuDits, a general class of D-dimensional unitary transformations is needed. Among these, cyclic transformations are an important special case required in many high-dimensional quantum communication protocols. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a cyclic transformation in the high-dimensional space of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM). Using simple linear optical components, we show a successful four-fold cyclic transformation of OAM modes. Interestingly, our experimental setup was found by a computer algorithm. In addition to the four-cyclic transformation, the algorithm also found extensions to higher-dimensional cycles in a hybrid space of OAM and polarization. Besides being useful for quantum cryptography with QuDits, cyclic transformations are key for the experimental production of high-dimensional maximally entangled Bell-states.

In the Wigner-band random-matrix model, making use of a generalized Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory, we derive analytical expressions for the width of the NPT parts under weak and strong perturbation. An iterative algorithm is given, by which the NPT widths can be computed efficiently, and is used in numerical test of the analytical predictions.

abstract: We prove that the squared R\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement (SR$\alpha$E), which is the generalization of entanglement of formation (EOF), obeys a general monogamy inequality in an arbitrary $N$-qubit mixed state. Furthermore, for a class of R\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement, we prove that the monogamy relations of the SR$\alpha$E have a hierarchical structure when the $N$-qubit system is divided into $k$ parties. As a byproduct, the analytical relation between the R\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement and the squared concurrence is derived for bipartite $2\otimes d$ systems. Based on the monogamy properties of SR$\alpha$E, we can construct the corresponding multipartite entanglement indicators which still work well even when the indicators based on the squared concurrence and EOF lose their efficacy. In addition, the monogamy property of the $\mu$-th power of R\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement is analyzed.

abstract: W-state is an important resource for many quantum information processing tasks. In this paper, we for the first time propose a multi-party measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) protocol based on W-state. With linear optics, we design a W-state analyzer in order to distinguish the four-qubit W-state. This analyzer constructs the measurement device for four-party MDI-QKD. Moreover, we derived a complete security proof of the four-party MDI-QKD, and performed a numerical simulation to study its performance. The results show that four-party MDI-QKD is feasible over 150 km standard telecom fiber with off-the-shelf single photon detectors. This work takes an important step towards multi-party quantum communication and a quantum network.

abstract: We propose a quantitative test of the quantum nonlocality in the electromagnetic interaction that generates the Aharonov-Bohm effect. For this purpose, we derive an interaction Lagrangian based on the local action of gauge-invariant quantities only, and compare it with the standard potential-based ("nonlocal") Lagrangian. It is shown that the two models provide identical results for any phenomena involving classical equations of motion or topological quantum phases. Interestingly, we find an example violating this equivalence, that is, the interference of single charges coproduced from two independent sources. The two models yield different predictions of the interference fringe produced by the electromagnetic interaction and, therefore, one can decide which model is appropriate for describing the electromagnetic interaction in general. This result has profound implications as it can settle the issue of dynamical nonlocality in the quantum electromagnetic interaction.

abstract: Building up quantum network depends on the combination of different systems. Establishing a quantum interface that combines different functions of a network is of special importance. Highly excited collective state (Rydberg polariton) is ideal for quantum computing because of strong dipole-dipole interaction between Rydberg atoms, while the atomic spin wave consisted of atomic ground levels is an ideal candidate for a quantum memory in long-distance quantum communications due to the long coherence time of spin wave. To date, there is no any report about building up a hybrid entanglement between these two disparate atomic systems. Here, we report on the successful storage of a true single photon using the Rydberg polariton and establishment of the entanglement between Rydberg excited state and the ground state spin wave experimentally, making a primary step towards the construction of a hybrid quantum interface.

abstract: We propose a new approach to explore CPT violation of neutrino oscillation through a fluctuating matter based on time-dependent geometric quantities. By mapping the neutrino oscillation onto a Poincare sphere structure, we obtain an analytic solution of master equation and further define the geometric quantities, i.e., radius of Poincare sphere and geometric phase. We find that the mixing process between electron and muon neutrinos can be described by the radius of Poincare sphere that depends on the intrinsic CP-violating angle. Such a radius reveals a dynamic mechanism of CPT-violation, i.e., both spontaneous symmetry breaking and Majorana-Dirac neutrino confusion. We show that the time-dependent geometric phase can be used to find the neutrino nature and observe the CPT-violation because it is strongly enhanced under the neutrino propagation. We further show that the time-dependent geometric phase can be easily detected by simulating the neutrino oscillation based on fluctuating magnetic fields in nuclear magnetic resonance, which makes the experimental observation of CPT-violation possible in the neutrino mixing and oscillation.

abstract: When atoms and molecules are ionized by laser pulses of finite duration and increasingly high intensities, the validity of the much used dipole approximation, in which the spatial dependence and magnetic component of the external field are neglected, eventually breaks down. We report that when going beyond the dipole approximation for the description of atoms exposed to ultraviolet light, the spatial dependence of the pulse shape, the envelope, provides the dominant correction, while the spatial dependence of the carrier may safely be neglected in the general case. We present a first order beyond-dipole correction to the Hamiltonian which accounts exclusively for effects stemming from the carrier-envelope of the pulse. This much simpler form of the correction is further discussed in connection with various descriptions of the light-matter interaction. We demonstrate by ab initio calculations that this approximation, which we will refer to as the envelope approximation, reproduces the full interaction beyond the dipole approximation for absolute and differential observables and proves to be valid for a broad range of high-frequency fields. This is done both for the Schr\"odinger and the Dirac equation.

abstract: We present an equivalence theorem to unify the two formulations of the uncertainty relation, i.e., the variance based ones and the entropic forms, which shows that the entropy of an operator in a quantum system can be built from the variances of a set of commutative operators. That means an uncertainty relation in the language of entropy may be mapped onto a variance based one, and vice versa. Employing the equivalence theorem, new entropic uncertainty relations stronger than existing ones in the literature are obtained for qubit system, and a variance based uncertainty relation for spin-1 system is reached from the corresponding entropic uncertainty relation.

abstract: During optomechanical cooling of a dispersively coupled oscillator, it is only possible to reach the oscillator ground state in the resolved sideband regime, where the cavity-mode line width is smaller than the resonant frequency of the mechanical oscillator being cooled. In this paper, we show that the dispersively coupled system can be cooled to the ground state in the unresolved sideband regime using an ancillary oscillator, which is coupled to the same optical mode via dissipative interaction. The ancillary oscillator has a resonant frequency close to that of the target oscillator; thus, the ancillary oscillator is also in the unresolved sideband regime. We require only a single blue, detuned laser mode to drive the cavity.

We also show that the introduced model provides a simple recipe for improving the efficiency of the network exploration.

These criteria provide experimental implementation in detecting entanglement of unknown quantum states.

abstract: We propose to use the effect of measurements instead of their number to study the time evolution of quantum systems under monitoring. This time redefinition acts like a microscope which blows up the inner details of seemingly instantaneous transitions like quantum jumps. In the simple example of a continuously monitored qubit coupled to a heat bath, we show that this procedure provides well defined and simple evolution equations in an otherwise singular strong monitoring limit. We show that there exists anomalous observable localised on sharp transitions which can only be resolved with our new effective time. We apply our simplified description to study the competition between information extraction and dissipation in the evolution of the linear entropy. Finally, we show that the evolution of the new time as a function of the real time is closely related to a stable Levy process of index 1/2.

journal:

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.02885
abstract: A mixed semiclassical initial value representation expression for spectroscopic calculations is derived. The formulation takes advantage of the time-averaging filtering and the hierarchical properties of different trajectory based propagation methods. A separable approximation is then introduced that greatly reduces (about an order of magnitude) the computational cost compared with a full Herman-Kluk time-averaging semiclassical calculation for the same systems. The expression is exact for the harmonic case and it is tested numerically for a Morse potential coupled to one or two additional harmonic degrees of freedom. Results are compared to full Herman-Kluk time-averaging calculations and exact quantum wavepacket propagations. We found the peak positions of the mixed semiclassical approximations to be always in very good agreement with full quantum calculations, while overtone peak intensities are lower with respect to the exact ones. Given the reduced computational effort required by this new mixed semiclassical approximation, we believe the present method to make spectroscopic calculations available for higher dimensional systems than accessible before.

abstract: This paper presents a number of problems concerning the practical (real) implementation of the techniques known as Quantum Image Processing. The most serious problem is the recovery of the outcomes after the quantum measurement, which will be demonstrated in this work that is equivalent to a noise measurement, and it is not considered in the literature on the subject. It is noteworthy that this is due to several factors: 1) a classical algorithm that uses Dirac's notation and then it is coded in MATLAB does not constitute a quantum algorithm, 2) the literature emphasizes the internal representation of the image but says nothing about the classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical interfaces and how these are affected by decoherence, 3) the literature does not mention how to implement in a practical way (at the laboratory) these proposals internal representations, 4) given that Quantum Image Processing works with generic qubits this requires measurements in all axes of the Bloch sphere, logically, and 5) among others. In return, the technique known as Quantum Boolean Image Processing is mentioned, which works with computational basis states (CBS), exclusively. This methodology allows us to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters the results of the measured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended to quantum algorithms outside image processing too.

abstract: Binary quantum information can be fault tolerantly encoded in states defined in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Such states define a computational basis, and permit a perfect equivalence between continuous and discrete universal operations. The drawback of this encoding is that the corresponding logical states are unphysical, meaning infinitely localized in phase space. We use the modular variables formalism to show that, in a number of protocols relevant for quantum information and for the realization of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, it is possible to loosen the requirements on the logical subspace without jeopardizing neither their usefulness nor their successful implementation. Such protocols involve measurements of appropriately chosen modular observables that permit the readout of the encoded discrete quantum information from the corresponding logical states. Finally, we demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our approach by applying it to the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons.

abstract: A distinguishing feature of protective measurement is the possibility of obtaining information about expectation values while making the disturbance of the initial state arbitrarily small. Quantifying this state disturbance is of paramount importance. Here we derive exact and perturbative expressions for the state disturbance and the faithfulness of the measurement outcome in a model describing a spin-1/2 particle protectively measured by an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We determine constraints on the experimentally required field strengths from bounds imposed on the allowable state disturbance. We also demonstrate that the protective measurement may produce an incorrect result even when the particle's spin state is unaffected by the measurement, and show that successive measurements using multiple magnetic fields produce the same state disturbance as a single measurement involving a superposition of these fields. Our results supply comprehensive understanding of a paradigmatic model for protective measurement, may aid the experimental implementation of the measurement scheme, and illustrate fundamental properties of protective measurements.

abstract: We examine the question of whether quantum mechanics places limitations on the ability of small quantum devices to learn. We specifically examine the question in the context of Bayesian inference, wherein the prior and posterior distributions are encoded in the quantum state vector. We conclude based on lower bounds from Grover's search that an efficient blackbox method for updating the distribution is impossible. We then address this by providing a new adaptive form of approximate quantum Bayesian inference that is polynomially faster than its classical analogue and tractable if the quantum system is augmented with classical memory or if the low-order moments of the distribution are protected using a repetition code. This work suggests that there may be a connection between fault tolerance and the capacity of a quantum system to learn from its surroundings.

abstract: We report on Fourier spectroscopy experiments performed with near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond chip. By detecting the free precession of nuclear spins rather than applying a multipulse quantum sensing protocol, we are able to unambiguously identify the NMR species devoid of harmonics. We further show that by engineering different Hamiltonians during free precession, the hyperfine coupling parameters as well as the nuclear Larmor frequency can be selectively measured with high precision (here 5 digits). The protocols can be combined to demonstrate two-dimensional Fourier spectroscopy. The technique will be useful for mapping nuclear coordinates in molecules en route to imaging their atomic structure.

abstract: We introduce a scheme that exploits laser cooling and phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions in crystals of trapped atomic ions to explore the transport of energy through a quantum magnet. We show how to implement an effective transport window to control the flow of energy through the magnet even in the absence of fermionic statistics for the carriers. This is achieved by shaping the density of states of the effective thermal reservoirs that arise from the interaction with the external bath of the modes of the electromagnetic field, and can be experimentally controlled by tuning the laser frequencies and intensities appropriately. The interplay of this transport window with the spin-spin interactions is exploited to build an analogue of the Coulomb-blockade effect in nano-scale electronic devices, and opens new possibilities to study quantum effects in energy transport.

abstract: A two-party quantum communication process with classical inputs and outcomes can be simulated by replacing the quantum channel with a classical one. The minimal amount of classical communication required to reproduce the statistics of the quantum process is called its communication complexity. In the case of many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per instance is called the asymptotic communication complexity. Previously, we reduced the computation of the asymptotic communication complexity to a convex minimization problem. In most cases, the objective function does not have an explicit analytic form, as the function is defined as the maximum over an infinite set of convex functions. Therefore, the overall problem takes the form of a minimax problem and cannot directly be solved by standard optimization methods. In this paper, we introduce a simple algorithm to compute the asymptotic communication complexity. For some special cases with an analytic objective function one can employ available convex-optimization libraries. In the tested cases our method turned out to be notably faster. Finally, using our method we obtain 1.238 bits as a lower bound on the asymptotic communication complexity of a noiseless quantum channel with the capacity of 1 qubit. This improves the previous bound of 1.208 bits.

abstract: Quantifying entanglement in composite systems is a fundamental challenge, yet exact results are only available in few special cases. This is because hard optimization problems are routinely involved, such as finding the convex decomposition of a mixed state with the minimal average pure-state entanglement, the so-called convex roof. We show that under certain conditions such a problem becomes trivial. Precisely, we prove by a geometric argument that polynomial entanglement measures of degree 2 are independent of the choice of pure-state decomposition of a mixed state, when the latter has only one pure unentangled state in its range. This allows for the analytical evaluation of convex roof extended entanglement measures in classes of rank-two states obeying such condition. We give explicit examples for the square root of the three-tangle in three-qubit states, and show that several representative classes of four-qubit pure states have marginals that enjoy this property.

abstract: The contextuality of quantum mechanics can be shown by the violation of inequalities based on measurements of well chosen observables. An important property of such observables is that their expectation value can be expressed in terms of probabilities of obtaining two exclusive outcomes. In order to satisfy this, inequalities have been constructed using either observables with a dichotomic spectrum or using periodic functions obtained from displacement operators in phase space. Here we unify both strategies by introducing general conditions to demonstrate the contextuality of quantum mechanics from measurements of observables of arbitrary dimensions. Among the consequences of our results is the impossibility of having a maximal violation of contextuality in the Peres-Mermin scenario with discrete observables of odd dimensions. In addition, we show how to construct a large class of observables with a continuous spectrum enabling the realization of contextuality tests both in the gaussian and non-gaussian regimes.

abstract: We study the correlation between an impurity and a small ensemble of bosonic particles in one dimension. Our study analyzes the one-body density matrix and calculates the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy as a function of interaction strength between the impurity and the bosons when all particles have the same mass. We show that the entropy grows very fast for small and moderate interaction strength, and then increases slowly toward the strongly interacting regime. Then we study the effect over the quantum correlations of a mass imbalance between the impurity and the bosons. In the strongly interacting case, we discover that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons, then we have the least possible correlation. However, the entropy tops its maximum when the mass ratio is between 3 and 4 in the case where there are four bosonic particles and then falls off to its minimum for higher mass imbalance.

abstract: The BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution is semi device independent in the sense that its security depends only on the assumption that one of the users' devices is restricted to a qubit Hilbert space and that there are no preexisting correlations between the devices. Here, we derive an analytic lower bound on the asymptotic secret key rate for the entanglement-based version of BB84 assuming only that one of the users performs unknown qubit POVMs. The result holds against the class of collective attacks and reduces to the well known Shor-Preskill key rate if noisy versions of the ideal BB84 correlations are observed.

abstract: We present a scheme for generating robust steady-state entanglement between qubits that do not interact and do not exchange information, using Markovian reservoir engineering. Several realizations including natural or artificial atoms coupled to a single cavity or to separate cavities with a uni- or bidirectional decay channel between them are considered. The scheme requires no dynamic control, measurements or feedback, and is optimized to be robust with regard to arbitrarily large cavity and fiber losses, thereby opening a route to stabilization of truly long-range entanglement between distant qubits. The protocol is also robust with regard to uncertainty in the system parameters and atomic decoherence and requires no knowledge of the initial state of the system.

abstract: We present a product formula to approximate the exponential of a skew-Hermitian operator that is a sum of generators of a Lie algebra. The number of terms in the product depends on the structure factors. When the generators have large norm with respect to the dimension of the Lie algebra, or when the norm of the effective operator resulting from nested commutators is less than the product of the norms, the number of terms in the product is significantly less than that obtained from well-known results. We apply our results to construct product formulas useful for the quantum simulation of some continuous-variable and bosonic physical systems, including systems whose potential is not quadratic. For many of these systems, we show that the number of terms in the product can be sublinear or subpolynomial in the dimension of the relevant local Hilbert spaces, where such a dimension is usually determined by an energy scale of the problem. Our results emphasize the power of quantum computers for the simulation of various quantum systems.

abstract: Squeezed states of spin systems are an important entangled resource for quantum technologies, particularly quantum metrology and sensing. Here we consider the generation of spin squeezed states by interacting the spins with a dissipative ancillary system. We show that spin squeezing can be generated in this model by two different mechanisms: one-axis twisting and driven collective relaxation. We can interpolate between the two mechanisms by simply adjusting the detuning between the dissipative ancillary system and the spin system. Interestingly, we find that for both mechanisms, ancillary system dissipation need not be considered an imperfection in our model, but plays a positive role in spin squeezing. To assess the feasibility of spin squeezing we consider two different implementations with superconducting circuits. We conclude that it is experimentally feasible to generate a squeezed state of hundreds of spins either by one-axis twisting or by driven collective relaxation.

A distinguishing feature of our experiment is that the photons are generated via a non-degenerated spontaneous four-wave mixing process in a hot atomic ensemble; therefore the photon has narrow bandwidth. Besides, there is a large difference in frequency between two photons in a pair. Our works may be important to achieve more secure, large transmission capacity long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: I explore the use of quantum information as a security enabler for the future driverless vehicle. Specifically, I investigate the role combined classical and quantum information can have on the most important characteristic of the driverless vehicle paradigm - the vehicle location. By using information-theoretic verification frameworks, coupled with emerging quantum-based location-verification procedures, I show how vehicle positions can be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in classical-only networks. I also discuss how other quantum applications can be seamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure required for location verification. The two technology enablers required for the driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory timescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular communication infrastructure (underway). I argue the enhanced safety features delivered by the `Quantum Car' mean its eventual deployment is inevitable.

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has enormous applications. Multi-dimensional NMR has been an essential technique to characterize correlations between nuclei and hence molecule structures. Multi-dimensional spectroscopy has also been extended to optics to study correlations in molecules and many-body effects in semiconductors. Towards the ultimate goal of single-molecule NMR, dynamical decoupling (DD) enhanced diamond quantum sensing has enabled detection of single nuclear spins and nanoscale NMR. However, there is still lack of a standard method in DD-based quantum sensing to characterize correlations between nuclear spins in single molecules. Here we present a scheme of multi-dimensional DD-based quantum sensing, as a universal method for correlation spectroscopy of single molecules. We design multi-dimensional DD sequences composed of multiple sets of periodic DD sequences with different periods, which can be independently set to match different transition frequencies for resonant DD. We find that under resonant DD the sensor coherence patterns, as functions of multiple DD pulse numbers, can differentiate different types of correlations between nuclear spin transitions. This work offers a standard approach to correlation spectroscopy for single-molecule NMR.

abstract: A custom-built and precisely controlled quantum system may offer access to a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analog quantum simulator that makes the relevant observables, interactions, and states of a quantum model accessible could permit experimental insight into complex quantum dynamics that are intractable on conventional computers. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here we characterise two-dimensional arrays of three ions trapped by radio-frequency fields in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80 micrometer. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as tuning of crucial couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards an analog quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

abstract: We report on a precision measurement of the $D$ line tune-out wavelength of $^{87}$Rubidium in the hyperfine ground state $|F=1, m_F=0,\pm1 \rangle$ manifold at 790 nm, where the scalar ac Stark shifts of the $D_1$ and the $D_2$ lines cancel. This wavelength is sensitive to usually neglected contributions from vector and tensor ac Stark shifts, transitions to higher principle quantum numbers, and core electrons. The ac Stark shift is probed by Kapitza-Dirac scattering of a Rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice in free space and controlled magnetic environment. The tune-out wavelength of the magnetically insensitive $m_F=0$ state was determined to 790.01858(23) nm with sub pm accuracy. An in situ absolute polarization, and magnetic background field measurement is performed by employing the ac vector Stark shift for the $m_F=\pm 1$ states. Comparing our findings to theory, we get quantitative insight into atomic physics beyond commonly used two-level atom approximations or the neglect of inner shell contributions.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We address the dynamics of quantum correlations for a bipartite continuous-variable quantum system interacting with its fluctuating environment. In particular, we consider two independent quantum oscillators initially prepared in a Gaussian state, e.g. a squeezed thermal state, and compare the dynamics resulting from local noise, i.e. oscillators coupled to two independent external fields, to that originating from common noise, i.e. oscillators interacting with a single common field. We prove non-Markovianity (non-divisibility) of the dynamics in both regimes and analyze the connections between non-divisibility, backflow of information and revivals of quantum correlations. Our main results may be summarized as follows: (i) revivals of quantumness are present in both scenarios, however, the interaction with a common environment better preserves the quantum features of the system; (ii) the dynamics is always non-divisible but revivals of quantum correlations are present only when backflow of information is present as well. We conclude that non-divisibility in its own is not a resource to preserve quantum correlations in our system, i.e. it is not sufficient to observe recoherence phenomena. Rather, it represents a necessary prerequisite to obtain backflow of information, which is the true ingredient to obtain revivals of quantumness.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the coupling of an erbium doped crystal to a three-dimensional superconducting cavity of a $10^5$ $Q$-factor at zero magnetic field. A tunable loop-gap resonator is used to match the cavity frequency to the hyperfine transitions of an erbium sample. The observed spectrum differs from what predicted by the published spin Hamiltonian parameters. The narrow cavity linewidth also enables the observations of asymmetric lineshapes of these hyperfine transitions, which are understood as the super-hyperfine interactions between the erbium ions and their adjacent yttrium ions. Such a broadly tunable superconducting cavity architecture, from 1.6 GHz to 4.0 GHz in the current design, is promising in building hybrid quantum systems.

abstract: Based on the modified weak measurement scheme in [Y-X Zhang, S Wu and Z-B Chen, arXiv: 1504.07130], a modified direct state measurement (MDSM) is proposed without inherent bias. Compared with the existing direct state measurement (DSM), MDSM is more efficient and valid for any coupling strength. Through accurate Monte Carlo simulations, we get the optimal coupling strength to attain high efficiency. For the same reconstruction precision, we compare the number of copies needed in MDSM and the one in conventional quantum state tomography (QST) by simulations. We find MDSM is less efficient than conventional QST. However, MDSM is much easier to be realized in actual experiments, and might be more useful.

abstract: In recent decades it was established that the quantum measurements of physical quantities in space-time points divided by space-like intervals may be correlated. Though such correlation follows from the formulas of quantum mechanics its physics so far remains unclear and there is a number of different and rather contradictory interpretations. They concern particularly the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox where the momentary action at a distance together with non-local entangled states is used for the interpretation. We assume that the quantum theory can be formulated as local and look for the consequences of this assumption. Accordingly we try to explain the correlation phenomena in a local way looking for the origin of correlation. To exclude a presupposed correlation of participating quantum particles we consider two independent particle sources and two detectors that are independent as well. We show that the origin of the correlation is the feature that the occupation number of a particle (and other its measurable quantities) is formed by a pair of complex conjugated wave functions with in general arbitrary phases. We consider this point as crucial as it provides interpretation of the observed correlation phenomena that may otherwise look puzzling. We briefly discuss a special type of noise that is typical for the quantum correlation phenomena.

abstract: We extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum field theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and unstable states. Our derivation is a quite minimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar products, invariance under complex Lorentz transformations, and a non-standard but nonetheless perfectly legitimate interpretation of charge conjugation as an anti-linear operator. The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an anti-linear symmetry. The latter two requirements then force this anti-linear symmetry to be $CPT$, while forcing the Hamiltonian to be real rather than Hermitian. Our work justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the lifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. We show that the Euclidean time path integrals of a $CPT$ symmetric theory must always be real. In the quantum-mechanical limit the key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are recovered, with the $C$-operator of the $PT$ symmetry program being identified with the linear component of the charge conjugation operator.

abstract: Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into complex problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. Here we study non-equilibrium, quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of $^9$Be$^+$ ions in a Penning trap. We verify entanglement in the form of spin-squeezed states for up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0$\pm$0.9 dB of spectroscopic enhancement. We also observe evidence of non-Gaussian, over-squeezed states in the full counting statistics. We find good agreement with ab-initio theory that includes competition between entanglement and decoherence, laying the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, for which numerical solutions are, in general, classically intractable.

abstract: One examines putative corrections to the Bell operator due to the noncommutativity in the phase-space. Starting from a Gaussian squeezed envelop whose time evolution is driven by commutative (standard quantum mechanics) and noncommutative dynamics respectively, one concludes that, although the time evolving covariance matrix in the noncommutative case is different from the standard case, the squeezing parameter dominates and there are no noticeable noncommutative corrections to the Bell operator. This indicates that, at least for squeezed states, the privileged states to test Bell correlations, noncommutativity versions of quantum mechnics remains as non-local as quantum mechanics itself.

abstract: Recent years have seen an enormously revived interest in the study of thermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. This applies both to the study of notions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well as to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum many-body systems as such. In this work we bring together these two lines of research by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a sequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions. In this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics of quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be well described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable equilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i) the time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable models. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy production, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of optimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much room is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic quantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with respect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has implications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as suggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external heat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of freedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.

abstract: Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems, particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set. Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only $1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth of only $O(\log\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\rangle \mapsto |i, j + \delta_{i,2} \mod 3\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $P_9=\mbox{diag}(1,e^{2 \pi \, i/9},e^{4 \pi \, i/9})$. The two choices of elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis.

abstract: We consider a composite system consisting of coupled particles, and investigate decoherence due to coupling of the center-of-mass degree of freedom with the internal degrees of freedom. For a simple model of two bound particles, we show that in general such a decoherence effect exists, and leads to suppression of interference between different paths of the center-of-mass. For the special case of two harmonically-bound particles moving in an external potential in one dimension, we show that the coupling between the center-of-mass and internal degrees of freedom can be approximated as parametric driving, and that nontrivial coupling depends on the second derivative of the external potential. We find a partial solution to this parametric driving problem. For a simple interference experiment, consisting of two wave packets scattering off of a square well, we perform numerical simulations and show a close connection between suppression of interference and entanglement between the center-of-mass and internal degrees of freedom. We also propose a measure of compositeness which quantifies the extent to which a composite system cannot be approximated as a single, indivisible particle. We numerically calculate this quantity for our square well example system.

abstract: We investigate laser cooling of an ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity. We demonstrate that when atomic dipoles are sychronized in the regime of steady-state superradiance, the motion of the atoms may be subject to a giant frictional force leading to potentially very low temperatures. The ultimate temperature limits are determined by a modified atomic linewidth, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the cavity linewidth. The cooling rate is enhanced by the superradiant emission into the cavity mode allowing reasonable cooling rates even for dipolar transitions with ultranarrow linewidth.

Utilizing distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, this protocol can implement both quantum cryptographic conference and quantum secret sharing. To analyze the security of the protocol, we consider two kinds of attacks. One is entangling cloner attack, which is a practical individual attack. The other is coherent attack, which is the optimal attack Eve can implement. Finally, we show the optimal coherent attacks to the tripartite quantum cryptography for symmetric configuration.

abstract: We present a hybrid optomechanical scheme to achieve dynamical squeezing of position quadrature of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, that can be externally controlled by classical fields. A membrane-in-the-middle set up is employed, in which an atom in $\Lambda$ configuration is considered to be trapped on either side of the membrane inside the cavity. We show that a considerable amount of squeezing (beyond the 3 dB limit) can be achieved that is not affected by the decay of the cavity and the spontaneous emission of the atom. Squeezing depends upon the initial preparation of atomic states. Further, a strong effective coupling between the atom and the oscillator can be attained by using large control fields that pump the atom and the cavity. Effect of thermal phononic bath on squeezing is studied in terms of the squeezing spectrum. The results are supported by the detailed analytical calculations.

abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a widely used model for regression problems in supervised machine learning. Implementation of GP regression typically requires $O(n^3)$ logic gates. We show that the quantum linear systems algorithm [Harrow et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] can be applied to Gaussian process regression (GPR), leading to an exponential reduction in computation time in some instances. We show that even in some cases not ideally suited to the quantum linear systems algorithm, a polynomial increase in efficiency still occurs.

abstract: We observe the quantum Zeno effect -- where the act of measurement slows the rate of quantum state transitions -- in a superconducting qubit using linear circuit quantum electrodynamics readout and a near-quantum-limited following amplifier. Under simultaneous strong measurement and qubit drive, the qubit undergoes a series of quantum jumps between states. These jumps are visible in the experimental measurement record and are analyzed using maximum likelihood estimation to determine qubit transition rates. The observed rates agree with both analytical predictions and numerical simulations. The analysis methods are suitable for processing general noisy random telegraph signals.

abstract: Data mining is a key technology in big data analytics and it can discover understandable knowledge (patterns) hidden in large data sets. Association rule is one of the most useful knowledge patterns, and a large number of algorithms have been developed in the data mining literature to generate association rules corresponding to different problems and situations. Privacy becomes a vital issue when data mining is used to sensitive data sets like medical records, commercial data sets and national security. In this Letter, we present a quantum protocol for mining association rules on vertically partitioned databases. The quantum protocol can improve the privacy level preserved by known classical protocols and at the same time it can reduce the computational complexity and/or communication cost.

abstract: Given a problem which is intractable for both quantum and classical algorithms, can we find a sub-problem for which quantum algorithms provide an exponential advantage? We refer to this problem as the "sculpting problem." In this work, we give a full characterization of sculptable functions in the query complexity setting. We show that a total function f can be restricted to a promise P such that Q(f|_P)=O(polylog(N)) and R(f|_P)=N^{Omega(1)}, if and only if f has a large number of inputs with large certificate complexity. The proof uses some interesting techniques: for one direction, we introduce new relationships between randomized and quantum query complexity in various settings, and for the other direction, we use a recent result from communication complexity due to Klartag and Regev. We also characterize sculpting for other query complexity measures, such as R(f) vs. R_0(f) and R_0(f) vs. D(f). Along the way, we prove some new relationships for quantum query complexity: for example, a nearly quadratic relationship between Q(f) and D(f) whenever the promise of f is small. This contrasts with the recent super-quadratic query complexity separations, showing that the maximum gap between classical and quantum query complexities is indeed quadratic in various settings - just not for total functions! Lastly, we investigate sculpting in the Turing machine model. We show that if there is any BPP-bi-immune language in BQP, then every language outside BPP can be restricted to a promise which places it in PromiseBQP but not in PromiseBPP. Under a weaker assumption, that some problem in BQP is hard on average for P/poly, we show that every paddable language outside BPP is sculptable in this way.

abstract: We review the physical phenomena that arise when quantum mechanical energy levels are modulated in time. The dynamics resulting from changes in the transition frequency is a problem studied since the early days on quantum mechanics. It has been of constant interest both experimentally and theoretically since, with the simple two-level model providing an inexhaustible source of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is modulated, several effects appear: transitions to higher levels by Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana interference, motional averaging and narrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the appearance of sidebands in the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric phases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an exquisite experimental control in time domain over the parameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed the state of the system to be monitored nondestructively. These developments happened in the feld of quantum devices, especially superconducting qubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases, and as a result of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate these fundamental effects. The purpose of this review is to present some of these developments: from examples on two-level atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel and many-particle systems.

abstract: To begin with, it is pointed out that the form of the quantum probabil- ity formula originates in the very initial state of the object system as seen when the state is expanded with the eigen-projectors of the measured ob- servable. Making use of the probability reproducibility condition, which is a key concept in unitary measurement theory, one obtains the relevant coher- ent distribution of the complete-measurement results in the ?nal unitary- measurement state in agreement with the mentioned probability formula. Treating the transition from the final unitary, or premeasurement, state, where all possible results are present, to one complete-measurement result sketchily in the usual way, the well-known probability formula is derived. In conclusion it is pointed out that the entire argument is only formal unless one makes it physical assuming that the quantum probability law is valid in the extreme case of probability-one (certain) events (projectors).

We use quaternionic representation to describe the geometry of phase transition that is interesting interpretation to geometric phase and concurrence measure. It is shown that the geometric phase and ground state entanglement are complementary systems that can exhibit quantum phase transition in spin chain systems.

abstract: Nowadays, quantum router is playing a key role in quantum communication and quantum network- s. Here we propose a tunable single-photon routing scheme, based on quantum interference, which uses two distant artificial atoms coupling to two transmission lines. Depending on the distance between the two atoms, the collective effect will lead to destructive or constructive interference between the scattered photons. Under standing wave condition, single photon from the incident channel can be perfectly transmitted or redirected into another channel by asymmetric or symmet- ric reflected phase shift of atoms, respectively. Therefore, we show that our router can be controlled by adjusting the detuning of the atoms and interatomic distance, without any classical field.

abstract: A method for creation of ultracold molecules by stepwise adiabatic passage from the Feshbach state to the fundamentally ground state using an optical frequency comb is presented within a semiclassical multilevel model. The sinusoidal modulation of the spectral phase of the comb is implemented that leads to a creation of a quasi-dark dressed state having an insignificant population of the excited state manifold and, thus, efficiently mitigating decoherence in the system. In contrast, the cosine modulation does not lead to the quasi-dark state formation. The results demonstrate the importance of the parity of the spectral chirp in quantum control.

abstract: We present a family of quantum error-correcting codes that support a universal set of transversal logic gates using only local operations on a two-dimensional array of physical qubits. The construction is a subsystem version of color codes where gauge fixing through local measurements dynamically determines which gates are transversal. Although the operations are local, the underlying code is not topological in structure, which is how the construction circumvents no-go constraints imposed by the Bravyi-K\"onig and Pastawski-Yoshida theorems. We provide strong evidence that the encoding has no error threshold in the conventional sense, though it is still possible to have logical gates with error probability much lower than that of physical gates.

abstract: In this work we develop a semi-analytical variational ansatz to study the properties of few photon excitations interacting with a collection of quantum emitters in regimes that go beyond the rotating wave approximation. This method can be used to approximate both the static and dynamical properties of a superconducting qubit in an open transmission line, including the spontaneous emission spectrum and the resonances in scattering experiments. The approximations are quantitatively accurate for rather strong couplings, as shown by a direct comparison to Matrix-Product-State numerical methods, and provide also a good qualitative description for stronger couplings well beyond the Markovian regime.

abstract: The importance of integrated quantum photonics in the telecom band resides on the possibility of interfacing with the optical network infrastructure developed for classical communications. In this framework, femtosecond laser written integrated photonic circuits, already assessed for quantum information experiments in the 800 nm wavelength range, have great potentials. In fact these circuits, written in glass, can be perfectly mode-matched at telecom wavelength to the in/out coupling fibers, which is a key requirement for a low-loss processing node in future quantum optical networks. In addition, for several applications quantum photonic devices will also need to be dynamically reconfigurable. Here we experimentally demonstrate the high performance of femtosecond laser written photonic circuits for quantum experiments in the telecom band and we show the use of thermal shifters, also fabricated by the same femtosecond laser, to accurately tune them. State-of-the-art manipulation of single and two-photon states is demonstrated, with fringe visibilities greater than 95%. This opens the way to the realization of reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits on this technological platform.

abstract: Quantum tunneling governs numerous phenomena in biology, chemistry, physics and technology. Tunneling time, formulated in various different forms due to the absence of a time operator in quantum theory, has been measured recently in experiments based on the attoclock in ultrafast laser ionization of Helium atoms [A.~Landsman {\it et al.}, Optica {\bf 1}, 343 (2014)]. The experiment performs a refined measurement with which no tunneling time formula in the literature exhibits adequate congruence. Here we show that, entropic considerations lead to a real tunneling time which shows remarkable agreement with the experimental data and stays always subluminal. Indeed, with phase space volume setting the number of microstates for a single evanescing particle in a state of definite momentum consistent with energy conservation, one is naturally led to a statistical description for quantum tunneling in which thermal energy sets the tunneling time. This entropic tunneling time is rather general and might also be extended to photon and phonon tunneling phenomena.

abstract: With recent progress on experimental quantum information processing, an important question has arisen as to whether it is possible to verify arbitrary computation performed on a quantum processor. A number of protocols have been proposed to achieve this goal, however all are interactive in nature, requiring that the computation be performed in an interactive manner with back and forth communication between the verifier and one or more provers. Here we propose two methods for verifying quantum computation in a non-interactive manner based on recent progress in the understanding of the local Hamiltonian problem. Provided that the provers compute certain witnesses for the computation, this allows the result of a quantum computation to be verified after the fact, a property not seen in current verification protocols.

Due to photon exchange among the two components, we found long-time excitation oscillations which are significant longer than the inverse life-time of a single emitter. Furthermore, at a certain value of the parameter characterizing the inter-components interactions few-atom jumps to the excited state are feasible.

abstract: A quantum computer could solve problems intractable on any conventional machine, but the physical resources necessary to build one depend strongly on the precision with which its constituent qubits can be manipulated. We demonstrate laser-driven two-qubit and single-qubit logic gates with fidelities 99.9(1)% and 99.9934(3)% respectively, using qubits stored in long-lived hyperfine states of calcium-43 ions held in a room-temperature device. Calcium-43 ions have exhibited the longest coherence time ($T_2^*\approx 50$sec) and the highest state preparation and measurement fidelity of any single physical qubits. We study the speed/fidelity trade-off for the two-qubit gate, for gate times between 3.8$\mu$s and 520$\mu$s, and develop a theoretical model allowing us to identify the principal technical sources of error. We conclude that trapped-ion quantum logic is possible with the precision necessary for a practical quantum computer.

abstract: Trajectory-based mixed quantum-classical approaches to coupled electron-nuclear dynamics suffer from well-studied problems such as the lack of (or incorrect account for) decoherence in the trajectory surface hopping method and the inability of reproducing the spatial splitting of a nuclear wave packet in Ehrenfest-like dynamics. In the context of electronic non-adiabatic processes, these problems can result in wrong predictions for quantum populations and in unphysical outcomes for the nuclear dynamics. In this paper we propose a solution to these issues by approximating the coupled electronic and nuclear equations within the framework of the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear wave function. We present a simple quantum-classical scheme based on coupled classical trajectories, and test it against the full quantum mechanical solution from wave packet dynamics for some model situations which represent particularly challenging problems for the above-mentioned traditional methods.

abstract: Adiabatic pulses are used extensively to enable robust control of quantum operations. We introduce a new approach to adiabatic control that uses the superadiabatic quality or Q-factor as a performance metric to design robust, high fidelity pulses. Our approach permits the systematic design of quantum control schemes to maximize the adabaticity of a unitary operation in a given time interval, given the available control resources. We numerically examine the interplay between adiabaticity, fidelity and robustness of the resulting pulses for the case of single-qubit inversion, and demonstrate the improved robustness of superadiabatic pulses. We introduce a numerical search strategy to implement a broader class of adiabatic operations, including multi-qubit adiabatic uni- taries, and demonstrate the utility of the technique by designing control waveforms that adiabatically implement a two-qubit entangling gate for a model system.

abstract: The evolution of the spatial degrees of freedom of a photon propagating through atmospheric turbulence is treated as a non-Markovian process. Here, we derive and solve the evolution equation for this process. The turbulent medium is modeled by a sequence of multiple phase screens for general turbulence conditions. The non-Markovian perspective leads to a second-order differential equation with respect to the propagation distance. The solution for this differential equation is obtained with the aid of a perturbative analysis, assuming the turbulence is relatively weak. We also provide another solution for more general turbulence strength, but where we introduced a simplification to the differential equation.

abstract: Single photons are the natural link between the nodes of a quantum network: they coherently propagate and interact with many types of quantum bits including natural and artificial atoms. Ideally, one atom should deterministically control the state of a photon and vice-versa. The interaction between free space photons and an atom is however intrinsically weak and many efforts have been dedicated to develop an efficient interface. Recently, it was shown that the propagation of light can be controlled by an atomic resonance coupled to a cavity or a single mode waveguide. Here we demonstrate that the state of a single artificial atom in a cavity can be efficiently controlled by a few-photon pulse. We study a quantum dot optimally coupled to an electrically-controlled cavity device, acting as a near optimal one-dimensional atom. By monitoring the exciton population through resonant fluorescence, we demonstrate Rabi oscillations with a $\pi$-pulse of only 3.8 photons on average. The probability to flip the exciton quantum bit with a single photon Fock state is calculated to reach 55% in the same device.

abstract: Magic state distillation is a critical component in leading proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Relatively little is known, however, about how to construct a magic state distillation routine or, more specifically, which stabilizer codes are suitable for the task. While transversality of a non-Clifford gate within a code often leads to efficient distillation routines, it appears to not be a necessary condition. Here we have examined a number of small stabilizer codes and highlight a handful of which displaying interesting, albeit inefficient, distillation behaviour. Many of these distill noisy states right up to the boundary of the known undististillable region, while some distill toward non-stabilizer states that have not previously been considered.

abstract: Linear optical elements are pivotal instruments in the manipulation of classical and quantum states of light. The vast progress in integrated quantum photonic technology enables the implementation of large numbers of such elements on chip while providing interferometric stability. As a trade-off these structures face the intrinsic challenge of characterizing their optical transformation as individual optical elements are not directly accessible. Thus the unitary transformation needs to be reconstructed from a dataset generated with having access to the input and output ports of the device only. Here we present a novel approach to unitary reconstruction that significantly improves upon existing approaches. We compare its performance to several approaches via numerical simulations for networks up to 14 modes. We show that an adapted version of our approach allows to recover all mode-dependent losses and to obtain highest reconstruction fidelities under such conditions.

abstract: The interaction of quantum emitters with one-dimensional photon-like reservoirs induces strong and long-range dissipative couplings that give rise to the emergence of so-called Decoherence Free Subspaces (DFS) which are decoupled from dissipation. When introducing weak perturbations on the emitters, e.g., driving, the strong collective dissipation enforces an effective coherent evolution within the DFS. In this work, we show explicitly how by introducing single-site resolved drivings, we can use the effective dynamics within the DFS to design a universal set of one and two-qubit gates within the DFS of two-level atom-like systems. Using Liouvillian perturbation theory we calculate the scaling with the relevant figures of merit of the systems, such as the Purcell Factor and imperfect control of the drivings. Finally, we compare our results with previous proposals using atomic $\Lambda$ systems in leaky cavities.

abstract: We study the normal modes and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in circular dielectric microcavities through non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which come from the modifications due to system-environment coupling. Differences between the two types of modes are studied in detail, including the existence of resonances tails. Numerical calculations of the eigenvalues reveal the Lamb shift in the microcavity due to its interaction with the environment. We also investigate relations between the Lamb shift and quantized angular momentum of the whispering gallery mode as well as the refractive index of the microcavity. For the latter, we make use of the similarity between the Helmholtz equation and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, in which the refractive index can be treated as a control parameter of effective potential. Our result can be generalized to other open quantum systems with a potential term.

abstract: We theoretically explore the driven-dissipative physics of geometrically frustrated lattices of cavity resonators with relatively weak nonlinearities, i.e. a photon-photon interaction smaller than the loss rate. In such systems, photon modes with zero probability at 'dark' sites are present at the single-particle level due to interference effects. In particular, we study the behavior of a cell with three coupled resonators as well as extended Lieb lattices in 1D and 2D. By considering a fractional pumping scheme, with the driving field not applied to the dark sites, we predict that even in presence of relatively weak photon-photon interactions the nominally dark sites achieve a finite photonic population with strong correlations. We show that this is a consequence of biphoton and multiphoton states that in the absence of frustration would not be visible in the observables.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.04930
abstract: In instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation, two parties cooperate in order to perform a quantum computation on their joint inputs, while being restricted to a single round of simultaneous communication. Previous results showed that instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation is possible, at the cost of an exponential amount of prior shared entanglement (in the size of the input). Here, we show that a linear amount of entanglement suffices, (in the size of the computation), as long as the parties share nonlocal correlations as given by the Popescu-Rohlich box. This means that communication is not required for efficient instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation. Exploiting the well-known relation to position-based cryptography, our result also implies the impossibility of secure position-based cryptography against adversaries with non-signalling correlations. Furthermore, our construction establishes a quantum analogue of the classical communication complexity collapse under non-signalling correlations.

abstract: Using a technique based on quantum teleportation, we simplify the most general adaptive protocols for key distribution, entanglement distillation and quantum communication over a wide class of quantum channels in arbitrary dimension. Thanks to this method, we bound the ultimate rates for secret key generation and quantum communication through single-mode Gaussian channels and several discrete-variable channels. In particular, we derive exact formulas for the two-way assisted capacities of the bosonic quantum-limited amplifier and the dephasing channel in arbitrary dimension, as well as the secret key capacity of the qubit erasure channel. Our results establish the limits of quantum communication with arbitrary systems and set the most general and precise benchmarks for testing quantum repeaters in both discrete- and continuous-variable settings.

abstract: We discuss the properties of atom-photon bound states in waveguide QED systems consisting of single or multiple atoms coupled strongly to a finite-bandwidth photonic channel. Such bound states are formed by an atom and a localized photonic excitation and represent the continuum analog of the familiar dressed states in single-mode cavity QED. Here we present a detailed analysis of the linear and nonlinear spectral features associated with single- and multi-photon dressed states and show how the formation of bound states affects the waveguide-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between separated atoms. Our results provide a both qualitative and quantitative description of the essential strong-coupling processes in waveguide QED systems, which are currently being developed in the optical and the microwave regime.

abstract: We present quantum circuits to implement an exhaustive key search for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and analyze the quantum resources required to carry out such an attack. We consider the overall circuit size, the number of qubits, and the circuit depth as measures for the cost of the presented quantum algorithms. Throughout, we focus on Clifford$+T$ gates as the underlying fault-tolerant logical quantum gate set. In particular, for all three variants of AES (key size 128, 192, and 256 bit) that are standardized in FIPS-PUB 197, we establish precise bounds for the number of qubits and the number of elementary logical quantum gates that are needed to implement Grover's quantum algorithm to extract the key from a small number of AES plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

abstract: Specification of the strongest possible Bell inequalities for arbitrarily complicated physical scenarios -- any number of observers choosing between any number of observables with any number of possible outcomes -- is currently an open problem. Here I provide a new set of tools, which I refer to as "multideviations", for finding and analyzing these inequalities for the fully general case. In Part I, I introduce the multideviation framework and then use it to prove an important theorem: the Bell distributions can be generated from the set of joint distributions over all observables by deeming specific degrees of freedom unobservable. In Part II, I show how the theorem provides a new method for finding tight Bell inequalities. I then specify a set of new tight Bell inequalities for arbitrary event spaces -- the "even/odd" inequalities -- which have a straightforward interpretation when expressed in terms of multideviations. The even/odd inequalities concern degrees of freedom that are independent of those involved in parameter independence, raising the possibility of a new Bell's theorem with stronger philosophical implications. Also, contrary to expectations, the violation of the inequalities by quantum mechanics increases in size with the number of systems.

abstract: The demonstration of strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes of cavity QED with polyatomic molecules has opened new routes to control chemical dynamics at the nanoscale. We show that strong resonant coupling of a cavity field with an electronic transition can effectively decouple collective electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in a disordered molecular ensemble, even for molecules with high-frequency quantum vibrational modes having strong electron-vibration interactions. This type of polaron decoupling can be used to control chemical reactions. We show that the rate of electron transfer reactions in a cavity can be orders of magnitude larger than in free space, for a wide class of organic molecular species.

abstract: We demonstrate that the quantum corrections to the classical arrival time for a quantum object in a potential free region of space, as computed by Galapon [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 80}, 030102(R) (2009)], can be eliminated up to a given order of $\hbar$ by choosing an appropriate position-dependent phase for the object's wavefunction. This then implies that we can make the quantum arrival time of the object as close as possible to its corresponding classical arrival time, allowing us to synchronize a classical and quantum clock which tells time using the classical and quantum arrival time of the object, respectively. We provide an example for synchronizing such a clock by making use of a quantum object with a position-dependent phase imprinted on the object's initial wavefunction with the use of an impulsive potential.

We unify their approaches and give simple, graph-theoretic methods for finding inequality-free proofs of nonlocality or contextuality and for finding states exhibiting strong nonlocality or contextuality. Finally, we apply these methods to concrete examples in stabilizer quantum mechanics relevant to understanding contextuality as a resource in quantum computation via magic state distillation.

abstract: Detecting and isolating faults is crucial for synthesis of quantum circuits. Under the single fault assumption that is now routinely accepted in circuit fault analysis, we show that the behaviour of faulty quantum circuits can be fully characterized by the single faulty gate and the corresponding fault model. This allows us to efficiently determine test input states as well as measurement strategy that can be used to detect every single-gate fault using very few test cases and with minimal probability of error; in fact we demonstrate that most commonly used quantum gates can be isolated without any error under the single missing gate fault (SMGF) model. We crucially exploit the quantum nature of circuits to show vast improvement upon the existing works of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for quantum circuits.

We discuss the several realistic scenarios, i.e., a part and all of the qubits are subjected to the same or different types of noise. We find that more noise or less entanglement of qubits environment lead to more efficiency in terms of average fidelity. Furthermore, we show that a better approach to subject the qubits in different noise channels in order to obtain an increase of the efficiency for the protocol.

abstract: It has been demonstrated that, in (1+1) spacetime dimensions, massless fields can be used for information transmission even between parties that are time-like rather than light-like separated - and even without the receiver obtaining any energy from the sender. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon is not limited to a particular model of signaling device, but is based on general properties of the quantum field: energy propagates strictly only on the lightcone, whereas perturbations to the field amplitude, which can carry information, permeate also the inside of the future lightcone of the sender. It is also shown that this timelike and energyless signaling in massless fields occurs in Dirichlet cavities, which shows that the phenomenon is not confined to setups with a zero mode. Moreover, it is shown that the phenomenon extends beyond perturbation theory, namely by deriving the phenomenon non-perturbatively for the case where the sender and receiver systems are modelled as harmonic oscillators. To illustrate the propagation of energy in massless fields, the energy density is calculated that results from temporarily coupling an Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest to the vacuum of the field.

abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing in systems composed by both Majorana fermions and topologically unprotected quantum systems, e.g.~superconducting circuits or quantum dots, is studied in this paper. Errors induced by topologically unprotected quantum systems need to be corrected with error correction schemes, for instance the surface code. We find that the error-correction performance of such a hybrid topological quantum computer is not superior to a normal quantum computer unless the topological charge of Majorana fermions is insusceptible to noise. If errors changing the topological charge are rare, the fault-tolerance threshold is much higher than the threshold of a normal quantum computer, and a surface-code logical qubit could be encoded in only tens of topological qubits instead of about a thousand normal qubits.

abstract: Dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model is investigated by employing a multitude of the Davydov D$_1$ trial states, also known as the multi-D$_1$ Ansatz. Accuracy in dynamics simulations is improved significantly over the single D$_1$ Ansatz, especially in the weak system-bath coupling regime. The reliability of the multi-D$_1$ Ansatz for various coupling strengths and initial conditions are also systematically examined, with results compared closely with those of the hierarchy equations of motion and the path integral Monte Carlo approaches. In addition, a coherent-incoherent phase crossover in the nonequilibrium dynamics is studied through the multi-D$_1$ Ansatz. The phase diagram is obtained with a critical point $s_{c}=0.4$. For $s_{c}<s<1$, the coherent-to-incoherent crossover occurs at a certain coupling strength, while the coherent state recurs at a much larger coupling strength. For $s<s_{c}$, only the coherent phase exists.

Recent experimental progress in manipulation with high-dimensional quantum systems opens a new framework for implementation of teleportation protocol. We demonstrate that the one-qubit teleportation can be considered as a state transfer between subspaces of the whole Hilbert space of an indivisible eight-dimensional system. We explicitly show all corresponding operations and discuss an alternative way of implementation of similar tasks.

abstract: The usefulness of generating random configurations is recognized in a variety of contexts, as for instance in the simulation of physical systems, in the verification of bounds and/or ansatz solutions for optimization problems, and in secure communications. Fortran was born for scientific computing and has been one of the main programming languages in this area since then. And the several ongoing projects targeting towards its betterment indicate that it will keep this status in the decades to come. In this article, we describe Fortran codes produced, or organized, for the generation of the following random objects: numbers, probability vectors, unitary matrices, and quantum state vectors and density matrices. Some matrix functions are also included and may be of independent interest.

Our results provide a straightforward way to observe different kind of correlations, that complement other well known methods to tune the spatial correlations of paired photons.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.05243
abstract: We study relaxation after quenches across a driven-dissipative phase transition, which is characterized by conservative and dissipative long-range forces. The long-range forces are mediated by the photons of a single-mode cavity and can organize the atoms in regular patterns. The quench is realised by suddenly tuning the strength and frequency of the control field, here a laser that pumps atoms, across the critical value of the selforganization transition. The dynamics following this sudden quench exhibits long-lived metastable states with non-Gaussian momentum distributions. We characterize their onset and evolution towards equilibrium and show that, while the metastable non-thermal distribution is prevailingly due to the coherent long-range interactions, thermalization can be further slowed down by the incoherent dynamics. In particular, the incoherent processes leading to equilibrium are characterized by relaxation times that are orders of magnitude larger than the ones solely due to elastic photon-mediated collisions. This behaviour, that challenges the common understanding of the onset of equilibrium, is a peculiar property of the long-range interactions in this setup.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.05253
abstract: We consider the resonant interaction energy and force between two identical atoms, one in an excited state and the other in the ground state, interacting with the quantum electromagnetic field in the vacuum state and placed inside a photonic crystal. The two atoms are prepared in their symmetric or antisymmetric entangled state; the atomic excitation is thus distributed among the atoms. This problem is also strictly related to the coherent resonant energy transfer between two atoms. We consider the case of an atomic transition frequency inside the frequency gap of the photonic crystal and in proximity of the lower edge of its first band gap. We show that in this case the resonant interaction energy asymptotically decreases as $1/{r^2}$, compared with the $1/r$ dependence in both cases of free space and atomic frequency outside the photonic crystal gap. We argue that, although the resonant force is reduced by the presence of the photonic crystal, the configuration considered can be a good candidate for the observation of the resonant interaction because spontaneous emission is strongly suppressed and the correlated state is thus preserved by the decoherence effect due to its spontaneous decay.

abstract: In Crull (2015) it is argued that, in order to confront outstanding problems in cosmology and quantum gravity, interpretational aspects of quantum theory can by bypassed because decoherence is able to resolve them. As a result, Crull (2015) concludes that our focus on conceptual and interpretational issues, while dealing with such matters in Okon and Sudarsky (2014), is avoidable and even pernicious. Here we will defend our position by showing in detail why decoherence does not help in the resolution of foundational questions in quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem or the emergence of classicality.

abstract: Recent work proposed a variant on Ramsey interferometry for coupled spin-$1/2$ systems that directly measures the retarded spin-spin Green's function. We expand on that work by investigating nonequilibrium retarded spin-spin Green's functions within the transverse-field Ising model. We derive the lowest four spectral moments to understand the short-time behavior and we employ a Lehmann-like representation to determine the spectral behavior. We simulate a Ramsey protocol for a nonequilibrium quantum spin system that consists of a coherent superposition of the ground state and diabatically excited higher-energy states via a temporally ramped transverse magnetic field. We then apply the Ramsey spectroscopy protocol to the final Hamiltonian, which has a constant transverse field. The short-time behavior directly relates to Lieb-Robinson bounds for the transport of many-body correlations, while the long-time behavior relates to the excitation spectra of the Hamiltonian. Compressive sensing is employed in the data analysis to efficiently extract that spectra.

abstract: Several information measures have recently been defined which capture the notion of "recoverability" of a tripartite quantum state. In particular, the fidelity of recovery quantifies how well one can recover a system $A$ of a tripartite state, defined on systems $ABC$, by acting on system $C$ alone. The relative entropy of recovery is an associated measure in which the fidelity is replaced by relative entropy. The fact that state recoverability plays a key role in applications such as quantum key distribution and error correction suggests that we should try to understand the property of recoverability in more detail. In this paper, we provide concrete operational interpretations of the aforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision problem and a hypothesis testing scenario, each of which is connected to the notion of recovery. Specifically, we show that the fidelity of recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally unbounded quantum prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum verifier that a given quantum state is recoverable. This places the associated decision problem in QIP and establishes it as hard for QSZK (a class of problems believed to be difficult to solve even for a quantum computer). We also prove that the regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the optimal Type II error exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a tripartite state from a recovered version of this state, such that the Type I error is constrained to be no larger than a specified constant.

abstract: We show that generalizations of classical and quantum dynamics with two times lead to fundamentally constrained evolution. At the level of classical physics, Newton's second law is extended and exactly integrated in $1+2$ dimensional space, leading to effective single-time evolution for any initial condition. In the domain of quantum mechanics, we follow strictly the hypothesis of probability conservation by extending the Heisenberg picture to unitary evolution with two times. As a result, the observability of two temporal axes is constrained by a generalized uncertainty relation involving level spacings, total duration of the effect and Planck's constant.

A detailed security analysis is performed considering a two-mode coherent attack, that represents the residual eavesdropping once the parties have reduced the general attack by applying symmetric random permutations. In this context we provide a general analytical expression for the keyrate, discussing the impact of the residual two-mode correlations on the security of the scheme. In particular we identify the optimal eavesdropping against two-way quantum communication, which is given by a two-mode coherent attack with symmetric and separable correlations.

abstract: Interfacing a single photon with another quantum system is a key capability in modern quantum information science. It allows quantum states of matter, such as spin states of atoms, atomic ensembles or solids, to be prepared and manipulated by photon counting and, in particular, to be distributed over long distances. Such light-matter interfaces have become crucial for fundamental tests of quantum physics as well as for realizations of quantum networks. Here we report nonclassical correlations between single photons and phonons -- the quanta of mechanical motion -- from a nanomechanical resonator. We implement a full quantum protocol involving initialization of the resonator in its quantum ground state of motion and subsequent generation and readout of correlated photon-phonon pairs. The observed violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is clear evidence for the nonclassical nature of the generated mechanical state. Our results show the availability of on-chip solid-state mechanical resonators as light-matter quantum interfaces. The demonstrated performance enables studies of macroscopic quantum phenomena as well as applications in quantum communication, as quantum memories, and as quantum transducers.

abstract: Contextuality provides a unifying paradigm for nonclassical aspects of quantum probabilities and resources of quantum information. Unfortunately, most forms of quantum contextuality remain experimentally unexplored due to the difficulty of performing sequences of projective measurements on individual quantum systems. Here we show that two-point correlations between dichotomic compatible observables are sufficient to reveal any form of contextuality. This allows us to design simple experiments that are more robust against imperfections and easier to analyze, thus opening the door for observing interesting forms of contextuality, including those requiring quantum systems of high dimensions. In addition, this result allows us to connect contextuality to communication complexity scenarios and reformulate a recent result relating contextuality and quantum computation.

abstract: We propose an analog quantum simulator that uses ion traps to realize the many-body electron-electron Coulomb interaction of an electron gas. This proposal maps a system that is difficult to solve and control to an experimentally-feasible setup that can be realized with current technologies. Using a dilatation transform, we show that ion traps can efficiently simulate electronic Coulomb interactions. No complexity overhead is added if only the energy spectrum is desired, and only a simple unitary transform is needed on the initial state otherwise. The runtime of the simulation is found to be much shorter than the timescale of the corresponding electronic system, minimizing susceptibility of the proposed quantum simulator to external noise and decoherence. This proposal works in any number of dimensions, and could be used to simulate different topological phases of electrons in graphene-like structures, by using ions trapped in honeycomb lattices.

abstract: In our earlier work we posited that simple quantum gates and quantum algorithms can be designed utilizing the diffraction phenomena of a photon within a multiplexed holographic element. The quantum eigenstates we use are the photon's transverse linear momentum (LM) as measured by the number of waves of tilt across the aperture. Two properties of linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) within the circuit model make this approach attractive. First, any conditional measurement can be commuted in time with any unitary quantum gate; and second, photon entanglement can be encoded as a superposition state of a single photon in a higher-dimensional state space afforded by LM. We describe here our experimental results for construction a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate logic within a holographic medium, and present the quantum state tomography for this device. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that OptiGrate's photo-thermal refractive (PTR) glass is an enabling technology. This work has been grounded on coupled-mode theory and numerical simulations, all with parameters consistent with PTR glass. We discuss the strengths (high efficiencies, robustness to environment) and limitations (scalability, crosstalk) of this technology. While not scalable, the utility and robustness of such optical elements for broader quantum information processing applications can be substantial.

abstract: Optical resonance is central to a wide range of optical devices and techniques. In an optical cavity, the round-trip length and mirror reflectivity can be chosen to optimize the circulating optical power, linewidth, and free-spectral range (FSR) for a given application. In this paper we show how an atomic spinwave system, with no physical mirrors, can behave in a manner that is analogous to an optical cavity. We demonstrate this similarity by characterising the build-up and decay of the resonance in the time domain, and measuring the effective optical linewidth and FSR in the frequency domain. Our spinwave is generated in a 20 cm long Rb gas cell, yet it facilitates an effective FSR of 83 kHz, which would require a round-trip path of 3.6 km in a free-space optical cavity. Furthermore, the spinwave coupling is controllable enabling dynamic tuning of the effective cavity parameters.

abstract: We present a detailed security analysis of a d-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol based on two and three mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) both in an asymptotic and finite key length scenario. The finite secret key rates are calculated as a function of the length of the sifted key by (i) generalizing the uncertainly relation-based insight from BB84 to any d-level 2-MUB QKD protocol and (ii) by adopting recent advances in the second-order asymptotics for finite block length quantum coding (for both d-level 2- and 3-MUB QKD protocols). Since the finite and asymptotic secret key rates increase with d and the number of MUBs (together with the tolerable threshold) such QKD schemes could in principle offer an important advantage over BB84. We discuss the possibility of an experimental realization of the 3-MUB QKD protocol with the orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom of photons.

abstract: We consider the quantum-control task of obtaining a target unitary operation via control fields that couple to the quantum system and are chosen to best mitigate errors resulting from time-dependent noise. We allow for two sources of noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the environment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation rooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical statistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms of a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective, noise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error mitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the sought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error mitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e., those that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the control fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in terms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the `forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with respect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation of constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that they feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by considering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$ arbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal error-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is valid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e., $s \to \infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework for addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of arbitrary complexity.

abstract: Single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses are a natural candidate for on-chip control of superconducting qubits. We perform single qubit gates at a constant gate time using trains of single flux quantum pulses with fixed amplitudes. The pulse sequence is optimized by applying genetic algorithms, which decreases the gate error by two orders of magnitude compared to an evenly spaced pulse train. Hereby, we consider leakage transitions into a third energy level as well. Timing jitter of the pulses is taken into account, exploring the robustness of our optimized sequence. This takes us one step further to on-chip qubit controls.

abstract: We propose a single photon source based on a pair of weakly nonlinear optical cavities subject to a one-directional dissipative coupling. When both cavities are driven by mutually coherent fields, sub-poissonian light is generated in the target cavity even when the nonlinear energy per photon is much smaller than the dissipation rate. The sub-poissonian character of the field holds over a delay measured by the inverse photon lifetime, as in the conventional photon blockade, thus allowing single-photon emission under pulsed excitation. We study a possible implementation of the dissipative coupling, compatible with current photonic platforms.

abstract: We study the conditions when mixtures of entangled pure states with maximally mixed one-qudit reduced density matrices remain entangled. We found that the resulting mixed state remains entangled when the number of entangled pure states to be mixed is less than or equal to the dimension of the pure states. For the latter case of mixing a number of pure states equal to their dimension, we found that the mixed state is entangled provided that the entangled pure states to be mixed are not equally weighted. We also found that one can restrict the set of pure states that one can mix from in order to ensure that the resulting mixed state is genuinely entangled.

abstract: We identify a subsystem fluctuation (variance) that measures entanglement in an arbitrary bipartite pure state. This fluctuation is of an observable that generalizes the notion of polarization to an arbitrary N-level subsystem. We express this polarization fluctuation in terms of the order-2 Renyi entanglement entropy and a generalized concurrence. The fluctuation-entanglement relation presented here establishes a framework for experimentally measuring entanglement using Stern-Gerlach-type state selectors.

abstract: A quantum particle evolving by Schr\"{o}dinger's equation contains, from the kinetic energy of the particle, a term in its Hamiltonian proportional to Laplace's operator. In discrete space, this is replaced by the discrete or graph Laplacian, which gives rise to a continuous-time quantum walk. Besides this natural definition, some quantum walk algorithms instead use the adjacency matrix to effect the walk. While this is equivalent to the Laplacian for regular graphs, it is different for non-regular graphs, and is thus an inequivalent quantum walk. We algorithmically explore this distinction by analyzing search on the complete bipartite graph with multiple marked vertices, using both the Laplacian and adjacency matrix. The two walks differ qualitatively and quantitatively in their required jumping rate, runtime, sampling of marked vertices, and in what constitutes a natural initial state. Thus the choice of the Laplacian or adjacency matrix to effect the walk has important algorithmic consequences.

abstract: For a closed system with periodic driving, Floquet theorem tells that the time evolution operator can be written as $ U(t,0)\equiv P(t)e^{\frac{-i}{\hbar}H_F t}$ with $P(t+T)=P(t)$, and $H_F$ is Hermitian and time-independent called Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we extend the Floquet theorem from closed systems to open systems described by a Lindblad master equation that is periodic in time. Lindbladian expansion in powers of $\frac 1 \omega$ is derived, where $\omega$ is the driving frequency. Two examples are presented to illustrate the theory. We find that appropriate trace preserving time-independent Lindbladian of such a periodically driven system can be constructed by the application of open system Floquet theory, and it agrees well with the exact dynamics in the high frequency limit.

abstract: The entanglement convertibility between two quantum pure states is characterized by the R\'enyi entropy of the reduced state of the subsystem. By means of the density matrix renormalization group, we numerically study the entanglement convertibility and the topological edge states in the spin-1/2 XXZ model with bond alternation, $H=\sum_{n=1}^N[1+(-1)^n\delta ](\sigma_n^x\sigma_{n+1}^x+\sigma_n^y\sigma_{n+1}^y+\Delta\sigma_n^z\sigma_{n+1}^z)$, within periodic boundary conditions. It is found that for both cases of varying $\Delta$ and $\delta$, the convertibility regarding a generic subsystem size $L_A$ in the topological Haldane dimer phase is universally negative. The negative convertibility is attributed to the recombination of edge states which occurs for small $L_A$. This hallmark thus provides a convenient method for detecting the topological phase in experiments, as only a small scale of the system need be measured. The finite-size scaling of R\'enyi entropies $S_2$ and $S_\infty$ are used to locate topological critical points, and the quantum phase diagram is obtained.

abstract: The boson sampling problem has triggered a lot of interest in the scientific community because of its potential of demonstrating the computational power of quantum interference without the need of non-linear processes. However, the intractability of such a problem with any classical device relies on the realization of single photons approximately identical in their spectra. In this paper we discuss the physics of boson sampling with non-identical single photon sources, which is strongly relevant in view of scalable experimental realizations and triggers fascinating questions in complexity theory.

The MBCS prob- lem is the task of sampling at the interferometer output from the probability distribution associated with polarization- and time-resolved detections. We discuss the richness of the physics and the complexity of the MBCS problem for nonidentical input photons. We also compare the MBCS problem with the standard bo- son sampling problem, where the input photons are assumed to be identical and the system is "classically" averaging over the detection times and polarizations.

abstract: Bloch vectors provide a very useful geometrical representation of quantum states for characterizing their properties. We establish a new basis of observables constructed by a suitable combination of the non-Hermitian generalization of the Pauli matrices, the Heisenberg-Weyl operators. This allows us to identify a (Hermitian) Bloch representation for an arbitrary density operator of finite, as well as infinite dimensional systems in terms of complete set of \emph{Heisenberg-Weyl observables}. Compared to the canonical basis of Generalized Gell-Mann operators, the Heisenberg-Weyl based observables exhibit a number of advantageous properties which we highlight in the context of entanglement detection.

abstract: In 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer (OT), Alice inputs numbers x_0, x_1, Bob inputs a bit b and outputs x_b. Secure OT requires that Alice and Bob learn nothing about b and x_{\bar{b}}, respectively. We define spacetime constrained oblivious transfer (SCOT) as OT in Minkowski spacetime in which Bob must output x_b within R_b, where R_0 and R_1 are fixed spacelike separated spacetime regions. We show that unconditionally secure SCOT is impossible with classical protocols in Minkowski (or Galilean) spacetime, or with quantum protocols in Galilean spacetime. We describe a quantum SCOT protocol in Minkowski spacetime, and we show it unconditionally secure.

abstract: Long-lived optical quantum memories are of great importance for scalable distribution of entanglement over remote networks (e.g. quantum repeaters). Long-lived storage generally relies on storing the optical states as spin excitations since these often exhibit long coherence times. To extend the storage time beyond the intrinsic spin dephasing time one can use dynamical decoupling techniques. However, it has been shown that dynamical decoupling introduces noise in optical quantum memories based on ensembles of atoms. In this article a simple model is proposed to calculate the resulting signal-to-noise ratio, based on intrinsic quantum memory parameters such as the optical depth of the ensemble. We also characterize several dynamical decoupling sequences that are efficient in reducing this particular noise. Our calculations indicate that it should be feasible to reach storage times well beyond one second under reasonable experimental conditions.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.05669
abstract: This paper describes the effects of a complex scalar scaling field on quantum mechanics. The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis choice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based on the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not determine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of mathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence of separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different space time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each location, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The effect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has been described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one and two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also briefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field connection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that the coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means that the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of cosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on the field gradient.

abstract: Can the properties of the thermodynamic limit of a many-body quantum system be extrapolated by analysing a sequence of finite-size cases? We present a model for which such an approach gives completely misleading results: a translationally invariant local Hamiltonian on a square lattice with constant spectral gap and classical product ground state for system sizes smaller than a threshold, and a ground state with topological degeneracy for larger system sizes. Starting from a minimal case with spins of dimension 5 and threshold lattice size $15 \times 15$, we show that the latter grows faster than any computable function with increasing local dimensions. The resulting effect may be viewed as a new type of quantum phase transition that is driven by the size of the system rather than by a local field or coupling. It also suggests that recently proven undecidability results in quantum many-body systems may affect spin lattices with relatively small local Hilbert space dimension.

The proof is based on an undecidable problem and on the uniqueness of canonical forms of matrix product states. The result also holds for classical states.

abstract: A deterministic photon-photon quantum-logic gate is a long-standing goal. Building such a gate becomes possible if a light pulse containing only one photon imprints a phase shift of pi onto another light field. Here we experimentally demonstrate the generation of such a pi phase shift with a single-photon pulse. A first light pulse containing less than one photon on average is stored in an atomic gas. Rydberg blockade combined with electromagnetically induced transparency creates a pi phase shift for a second light pulse which propagates through the medium. This demonstrates the crucial step towards a photon-photon gate and offers a variety of applications in the field of quantum information processing.

abstract: In many quantum architectures the solid-state qubits, such as quantum dots or color centers, are interfaced via emitted photons. However, the frequency of photons emitted by solid-state systems exhibits slow uncontrollable fluctuations over time (spectral diffusion), creating a serious problem for implementation of the photon-mediated protocols. Here we show that a sequence of optical pulses applied to the solid-state emitter can stabilize the emission line at the desired frequency. We demonstrate efficiency, robustness, and feasibility of the method analytically and numerically. Taking nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as an example, we show that only several pulses, with the width of 1 ns, separated by few ns (which is not difficult to achieve) can suppress spectral diffusion. Our method provides a simple and robust way to greatly improve the efficiency of photon-mediated entanglement and/or coupling to photonic cavities for solid-state qubits.

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has the potential to improve communications security by offering cryptographic keys whose security relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics. The use of a trusted quantum receiver on an orbiting satellite is the most practical near-term solution to the challenge of achieving long-distance (global-scale) QKD, currently limited to a few hundred kilometers on the ground. This scenario presents unique challenges, such as high photon losses and restricted classical data transmission and processing power due to the limitations of a typical satellite platform. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of such a system by implementing a QKD protocol, with optical transmission and full post-processing, in the high-loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver. Employing weak coherent pulses with decoy states, we demonstrate the production of secure key bits at up to 56.5 dB of photon loss. We further illustrate the feasibility of a satellite uplink by generating secure key while experimentally emulating the varying channel losses predicted for realistic low-Earth-orbit satellite passes at 600 km altitude. With a 76 MHz source and including finite-size analysis, we extract 3374 bits of secure key from the best pass. We also illustrate the potential benefit of combining multiple passes together: while one suboptimal "upper-quartile" pass produces no finite-sized key with our source, the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of secure key. Alternatively, we find that by increasing the signal rate to 300 MHz it would be possible to extract 21570 bits of secure finite-sized key in just a single upper-quartile pass.

abstract: While the no-cloning theorem forbids the perfect replication of quantum information, it is sometimes possible to produce large numbers of replicas with vanishingly small error. This phenomenon, known as quantum superreplication, can take place both for quantum states and quantum gates. The aim of this paper is to review the central features of quantum superreplication, providing a unified view on the existing results. The paper also includes new results. In particular, we show that, when quantum superreplication can be achieved, it can be achieved through estimation, up to an error vanishing with a power law. Quantum strategies still offer an advantage for superreplication, in that they allow for an exponentially faster reduction of the error. Using the relation with estimation, we provide i) an alternative proof of the optimality of the Heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology, ii) a strategy to estimate arbitrary unitary gates with Heisenberg scaling, up to a logarithmic overhead, and iii) a protocol that generates M nearly perfect copies of a generic pure state with a number of queries to the corresponding unitary gate scaling as the square root of M. Finally, we point out that superreplication can be achieved using interactions among k systems, provided that k is large compared to square of the ratio between the numbers of input and output copies.

abstract: Complex quantum trajectory approach, which arose from a modified de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, has attracted much attention in recent years. The exact complex trajectories for the Eckart potential barrier and the soft potential step, plotted in a previous work, show that more trajectories link the left and right regions of the barrier, when the energy is increased. In this paper, we evaluate the reflection probability using a new ansatz based on these observations, as the ratio between the total probabilities of reflected and incident trajectories. While doing this, we also put to test the complex-extended probability density previously postulated for these quantum trajectories. The new ansatz is preferred since the evaluation is solely done with the help of the complex-extended probability density along the imaginary direction and the trajectory pattern itself. The calculations are performed for a rectangular potential barrier, symmetric Eckart and Morse barriers, and a soft potential step. The predictions are in perfect agreement with the standard results for potentials such as the rectangular potential barrier. For the other potentials, there is very good agreement with standard results, but it is exact only for low and high energies. For moderate energies, there are slight deviations. These deviations result from the periodicity of the trajectory pattern along the imaginary axis and have a maximum value only as much as $0.1 \%$ of the standard value. Measurement of such deviation shall provide an opportunity to falsify the ansatz.

abstract: We present a Heisenberg operator based formulation of coherent quantum feedback and Pyragas control. This model is easy to implement and allows for an efficient and fast calculation of the dynamics of feedback-driven observables as the number of contributing correlations grows in systems with a fixed number of excitations only linearly in time. Furthermore, our model unravels the quantum kinetics of entanglement growth in the system by explicitly calculating non-Markovian multi-time correlations, e.g., how the emission of a photon is correlated with an absorption process in the past. Therefore, the time-delayed differential equations are expressed in terms of insightful physical quantities. Another considerate advantage of this method is its compatibility to typical approximation schemes, such as factorization techniques and the semi-classical treatment of coherent fields. This allows the application on a variety of setups, ranging from closed quantum systems in the few excitation regimes to open systems and Pyragas control in general.

abstract: The finite element method is used to approximately solve boundary value problems for differential equations. The method discretises the parameter space and finds an approximate solution by solving a large system of linear equations. Here we investigate the extent to which the finite element method can be accelerated using an efficient quantum algorithm for solving linear equations. We consider the representative general question of approximately computing a linear functional of the solution to a boundary value problem, and compare the quantum algorithm's theoretical performance with that of a standard classical algorithm -- the conjugate gradient method. We find that, when scaling of the algorithm's complexity with the desired accuracy is taken into account, the quantum algorithm can achieve a polynomial speedup, the extent of which grows with the dimension of the partial differential equation. In addition, we give evidence that no improvement of the quantum algorithm could lead to a super-polynomial speedup when the dimension is fixed and the solution satisfies certain smoothness properties.

abstract: Thirty years ago a paper appeared in the literature generalizing the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include massive photons. The paper suffers from a flaw though: it assumes that a massive photon travels at the speed of (massless) light. The present work fixes the mistake and presents the correct formula for the radiance.

abstract: Single photon first order interferences of spatially separated regions from the cone structure of spontaneous parametric down conversion allow for analyzing the role of the mode function in quantum optics. In earlier experiments the role of the vacuum fields could be demonstrated in induced coherence experiments as the source of complementarity \cite{Heu14}. Here the spatial coherence properties of these vacuum fields are measured and as the physical reason for complementarity in single photon quantum optics demonstrated.

abstract: An algorithm is proposed in order to calculate an upper bound of a polynomial $SL$ invariant entanglement measure $E$. It iteratively considers the decompositions of the density matrix into two states each, exploiting the knowledge for the rank-two case. Focusing on the threetangle, I show the results the algorithm gives for two states, one of which being the $GHZ$-Werner state, for which the exact convex roof is known. It overestimates the threetangle in the state, thereby giving insight into the optimal decomposition the $GHZ$-Werner state has. As a proof of principle, I have run the algorithm for the threetangle on the transverse quantum Ising model.

abstract: We analyze the entanglement measure $C_4$ for mixed states in general and for the transverse XY model. We come to the conclusion that it cannot serve alone for guaranteeing an entanglement of $GHZ_4$-type. The genuine negativity calculated in Ref.~\cite{Hofmann14} isn't sufficient for that either and some additional measure of entanglement must be considered. In particular we study the transverse XY-model and find a non-zero $C_4$ measure which is of the same order of magnitude than the genuine negativity. Furthermore, we observe a feature in the $C_4$ values that resembles a destructive interference with the underlying concurrence.

abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical Raman spin echo technique, using Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) to create the different pulses of the spin echo sequence: initialization, pi-rotation, and readout. The first pulse of the sequence induces coherence directly from a mixed state, and the technique is used to measure the nuclear spin coherence of an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of rare-earth ions (Pr$^{3+}$). In contrast to previous experiments it does not require any preparatory hole burning pulse sequences, which greatly shortens the total duration of the sequence. The effect of the different pulses is characterized by quantum state tomography and is compared with simulations. We demonstrate two applications of the technique by using the spin echo sequence to accurately compensate a magnetic field across our sample, and to measure the coherence time at high temperatures up to 11 K, where standard preparation techniques are difficult to implement. We explore the potential of the technique and possible applications.

abstract: In biorthogonal quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of a nonhermitian operator and those of its adjoint are biorthogonal and complete and the probability for a transition from a quantum state to one of these eigenvectors is positive definite. We apply this formalism to the long standing problem of the position observable in quantum electrodynamics. The nonhermitian operators are generalized Newton-Wigner position operators whose eigenvectors are the quantum field and its canonically conjugate momentum. Applying the biorthogonal formalism to the case of photons, we find that the probability density for a transition from a one-photon state to a position eigenvector is the Glauber probability density, bridging the gap between photon counting and the sensitivity of light detectors to electromagnetic energy density.

abstract: The main promise of quantum computing is to efficiently solve certain problems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability. Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved classically with a few oracle queries, and the attainable quantum advantage is modest. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with noise, using a five-qubit superconducting processor. Running classical and quantum algorithms on the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal quantum computing, a quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy systems

abstract: We consider entanglement swapping, a key component of quantum network operations and entanglement distribution. Pure entangled states, which are the desired input to the swapping protocol, are typically mixed by environmental interactions causing a reduction in their degree of entanglement. Thus an understanding of entanglement swapping with partially mixed states is of importance. Here we present a general analytical solution for entanglement swapping of arbitrary two-qubit states. We find upper and lower bounds on the concurrence of the state resulting from entanglement swapping for various classes of input states. Our result provides a comprehensive method for analyzing entanglement swapping in quantum networks.

abstract: The introduction of phase coherence in the detection of quantum noise of light yields a pure quantum measurement of spectral modes. We theoretically show that such coherent quantum measurement performed with the technique of resonator detection (RD) is able to access any direction in the two-mode phase space of spectral sidebands under appropriate conditions, thus furnishing a complete measurement of the four-dimensional Wigner function. We obtain a realistic measurement operator for coherent RD by including the effects of imperfect resonator mode matching in our analysis. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the realization of phase coherent RD to characterize a two-mode displaced quantum state.

abstract: We report that the quantum relative entropy decreases monotonically under the application of any positive trace-preserving linear map. Monotonicity had previously only been shown to hold under additional assumptions, such as a Schwarz inequality for the adjoint map. Our statement follows from a proof of the data processing inequality for the sandwiched Renyi divergences by Beigi [J. Math. Phys. 54, 122202 (2013)]. This proof is based on complex interpolation techniques and extends to the case where the map is merely positive and not necessarily completely positive.

abstract: We consider four-dimensional qudits as qubit pairs and their qudit Pauli operators as qubit Clifford operators. This introduces a nesting, $C_1^2 \subset C_2^4 \subset C_3^2$, where $C_n^m$ is the $n$th level of the $m$-dimensional qudit Clifford hierarchy. If we can convert between logical qubits and qudits, then qudit Clifford operators are qubit non-Clifford operators. Conversion is achieved by qubit fusion and qudit fission using stabilizer circuits that consume a resource state. This resource is a fused qubit stabilizer state with a fault-tolerant state preparation using stabilizer circuits.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of correlations between composite systems -- multipartite entanglement (ME) -- that, while puzzling our physical intuition, enable technologies not accessible in a classical world. Notwithstanding, there is still no efficient general method to theoretically quantify and experimentally detect ME. Here we propose a novel paradigm based on the measurement of the statistical response of a quantum systems to a collective parametric evolution. As a major difference with respect to current approaches based on the implementation of entanglement witness operators, we witness ME without relying on measurement efficiencies or tomographic reconstructions of the quantum state. The protocol requires only two settings for any number of parties. To illustrate its user-friendliness we demonstrate ME in different experiments with ions and photons by analyzing published data on fidelity visibilities and averaged observables.

abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and their mixtures exhibit fascinating properties. A complete basis of GHZ-states can be constructed by properly choosing local basis rotations. We demonstrate this experimentally for the Hilbert space C2x4 by entangling two photons in polarisation and orbital angular momentum. Mixing GHZ-states unmasks different entanglement features based on their particular local geometrical connectedness. In particular, a specific GHZ-state in a complete orthonormal basis has a twin GHZ-state for which equally mixing leads to full separability in opposition to any other basis-state. Exploiting these local geometrical relations provides a toolbox for generating specific types of multipartite entanglement, each providing different benefits in outperforming classical devices. Our experiment, based on hybrid entangled entanglement, investigates these GHZs properties showing a good stability and fidelity and allowing a scaling in degrees of freedom and advanced operational manipulations.

Alhaidari and for which they obtained the "potential parameter spectrum". Our results are also independently verified using a direct method of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the J-matrix basis.

Here we apply it to a wider range of quantum protocols and identify circuit structures that allow for efficient calculation of the exact success probability and even the final distribution of output states. As examples, we apply our method to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code and compare the results to Monte Carlo simulations.

abstract: We give an analytical description of the dynamics of the three-qubit Dicke model using the adiabatic approximation in the parameter regime where the qubits transition frequencies are far off-resonance with the field frequency and the interaction strengths reach the ultra-strong coupling regimes. Qualitative differences arise when comparing to the single- and two-qubit systems - simple analytic formulas show that three revival sequences produce a three-frequency beat note in the time evolution of the population. We find an explicit way to estimate the dynamics for the qubit-field and qubit-qubit entanglement inside the three-qubit system in the ultra strong coupling regime, and the resistance to the sudden death proves the robustness of the GHZ state.

abstract: We study the geometric curvature and phase of the Rabi model. Under the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we apply the gauge independent Berry curvature over a surface integral to calculate the Berry phase of the eigenstates for both single and two-qubit systems, which is found to be identical with the system of spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. We extend the idea to define a vacuum-induced geometric curvature when the system starts from an initial state with pure vacuum bosonic field. The induced geometric phase is related to the average photon number in a period which is possible to measure in the qubit-cavity system. We also calculate the geometric phase beyond the RWA and find an anomalous sudden change, which implies the breakdown of the adiabatic theorem and the Berry phases in an adiabatic cyclic evolution are ill-defined near the anti-crossing point in the spectrum.

We formulate general requirements for such walks and illustrate them with examples of single-, two- and three-qubit gates, including Hadamard, Control-NOT, and Toffoli gates. Continuous-time quantum walks on graphs involved in these gates are investigated.

abstract: We propose a device architecture capable of direct quantum electro-optical conversion of microwave to optical photons. The hybrid system consists of a planar superconducting microwave circuit coupled to an integrated whispering-gallery-mode microresonator made from an electro-optical material. We show that electro-optical (vacuum) coupling rates $g_0$ as large as$\sim 2\pi \, \mathcal{O}(10-100)$ kHz are achievable with currently available technology, due to the small mode volume of the planar microwave resonator. Operating at millikelvin temperatures, such a converter would enable high-efficiency conversion of microwave to optical photons. We analyze the added noise, and show that maximum conversion efficiency is achieved for a multi-photon cooperativity of unity which can be reached with optical power as low as $ \mathcal{O}(1)\,\mathrm{mW} $.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a quantum system coupled linearly to Gaussian white noise using functional methods. By performing the integration over the noisy field in the evolution operator, we get an equivalent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which evolves the quantum state with a dissipative dynamics. We also show that if the integration over the noisy field is done for the time evolution of the density matrix, a gain contribution from the fluctuations, can be accessed in addition to the loss one from the non-hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics. We illustrate our study by computing analytically the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which we found to be the complex frequency harmonic oscillator, with a known evolution operator. It leads to space and time localisation, a common feature of noisy quantum systems in general applications.

abstract: Recently, Zhang et al [Phys. Rev. A 92, 012332 (2015)] presented $4d-4$ orthogonal product states that are locally indistinguishable and completable in a $d\otimes d$ quantum system. Later, Zhang et al. [arXiv: 1509.01814v2 (2015)] constructed $2n-1$ orthogonal product states that are locally indistinguishable in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$). In this paper, we construct a locally indistinguishable and completable orthogonal product basis with $4p-4$ members in a general $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$) quantum system, where $p$ is an arbitrary integer from $3$ to $m$, and give a very simple but quite effective proof for its local indistinguishability. Specially, we get a completable orthogonal product basis with $8$ members that cannot be locally distinguished in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$) when $p=3$. It is so far the smallest completable orthogonal product basis that cannot be locally distinguished in a $m\otimes n$ quantum system. On the other hand, we construct a small locally indistinguishable orthogonal product basis with $2p-1$ members, which is maybe uncompletable, in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$ and $p$ is an arbitrary integer from $3$ to $m$). We also prove its local indistinguishability. As a corollary, we give an uncompletable orthogonal product basis with $5$ members that are locally indistinguishable in $m\otimes n$ ($3\leq m \leq n$). All the results can lead us to a better understanding of the structure of a locally indistinguishable product basis in $m \otimes n$.

abstract: We develop a new approach for controllable single-photon transport between two remote one-dimensional coupled-cavity arrays, used as quantum registers, mediated by an additional one-dimensional coupled-cavity array, acting as a quantum channel. A single two-level atom located inside one cavity of the intermediate channel is used to control the long-range coherent quantum coupling between two remote registers, thereby functioning as a quantum switch. With a time-independent perturbative treatment, we find that the leakage of quantum information can in principle be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, our method can be extended to realize a quantum router in multi-register quantum networks, where single-photons can be either stored in one of the registers or transported to another on demand. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in the mean-field dynamics of various atom-interferometry schemes designed for precision sensing. In the field of quantum metrology, the standard tools for evaluating metrological sensitivity are the classical- and quantum-Fisher information. In this letter, we show how these tools can be adapted to evaluate the sensitivity when the behaviour is dominated by mean-field dynamics. As an example, we compare the behaviour of four recent theoretical proposals for gyroscopes based on matterwaves interference in toroidally trapped geometries. We show that while the quantum Fisher information increases at different rates for the various schemes considered, in all cases it is consistent with the well-known Sagnac phase shift after the matterwaves have traversed a closed path. However, we argue that the relevant metric for quantifying interferometric sensitivity is the classical Fisher information, which can vary considerably between the schemes.

abstract: The biased Dicke model describes a system of biased two-level atoms coupled to a bosonic field, and is expected to produce new phenomena that are not present in the original Dicke model. In this paper, we study the critical properties of the biased Dicke model in the classical oscillator limits. For the finite-biased case in this limit, We present analytical results demonstrating that the excitation energy does not vanish for arbitrary coupling. This indicates that the second order phase transition is avoided in the biased Dicke model, which contrasts to the original Dicke model. We also analyze the squeezing and the entanglement in the ground state, and find that a finite bias will strongly modify their behaviors in the vicinity of the critical coupling point.

Here we give a theoretical study of a hybrid atom-optomechanical system in which the steady-state squeezing of the mechanical resonator can be generated via the mechanical nonlinearity and cavity cooling process. The validity of the scheme is assessed by simulating the steady-state variance of the mechanical displacement quadrature numerically. The scheme is robust against dissipation of the optical cavity, and the steady-state squeezing can be effectively generated in a highly dissipative cavity.

abstract: The transport properties of the photons injected into one-dimensional coupled-cavity-arrays (CCAs) are studied. It is found that the number of photons cannot change the evolution cycle of the system and the time points at which W states and NOON state are obtained with a relatively higher probability. Transport dynamics in the CCAs exhibits that entanglement-enhanced state transmission is more effective phenomenon, and we show that for a quantum state with the maximum concurrence, it can be transmitted completely without considering the case of photon loss.

abstract: We propose a simple architecture based on multimode quantum memories for collective readout of classical information keyed using a pair coherent states, exemplified by the well-known binary phase shift keying format. Such a configuration enables demonstration of the superadditivity effect in classical communication over quantum channels, where the transmission rate becomes enhanced through joint detection applied to multiple channel uses. The proposed scheme relies on the recently introduced idea to prepare Hadamard sequences of input symbols that are mapped by a linear optical transformation onto the pulse position modulation format [Guha, S. {\em Phys. Rev. Lett.}\ {\bf 2011}, {\em 106}, 240502]. We analyze two versions of readout based on direct detection and an optional Dolinar receiver which implements the minimum-error measurement for individual detection of a binary coherent state alphabet.

abstract: We propose a quantum simulation of electromagnetism in (2+1) dimensions using an array of superconducting fluxonium devices. The encoding is in the integer (S=1) representation of the quantum link model formulation of compact U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how to engineer the Gauss constraint via an ancilla mediated gadget construction and how to tune between the strongly coupled and intermediately coupled regimes. The witnesses to the existence of the predicted confining phase of the model are provided by non-local order parameters from Wilson loops and disorder parameters from 't Hooft strings and we show how to measure these operators non-destructively via dispersive coupling of the fluxonium islands to a microwave cavity mode. Evidence for existence of the confined phase in the ground state of the simulation Hamiltonian is found by DMRG calculations on a ladder geometry.

abstract: Aiming at efficient numerical treatment of tunneling ionization of atoms and molecules by mid-infrared (IR) lasers, exterior time scaling (ETS) theory is formulated as a generalization of the time-scaled coordinate approach. The key idea of ETS is the division of the spatial volume into a small region around the nucleus and its outside; the radial coordinates are time scaled only in the outer region. The continuum components of photoelectron wave packets are prevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the long-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis functions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the bound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of non-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are less stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in which the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff. For numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms of finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions. Furthermore, the stiffness-free Lanczos time propagator is introduced to remove any persistent stiffness in the treatment of mid-IR lasers due to the involvement of hundreds of angular-momentum states. The test calculations for atomic hydrogen interacting with linearly polarized mid-IR pulses demonstrate the accuracy and numerical efficiency of the new scheme, and exhibit its special capability if there is no recollision with the parent ion. Hence, ETS will show its true potential for the detailed analysis of photoelectron wave packet dynamics in circularly or near-circularly polarized mid-IR fields.

abstract: The concept of coherence is one of cornerstones in physics. The development of quantum information science has lead to renewed interest in properly approaching the coherence at the quantum world. Various measures could be proposed for quantifying the coherence of a quantum state with respect to the prescribed orthonormal basis. To be a proper measure of coherence, each candidate should enjoy certain properties. It seems that the monotonicity property plays a crucial role here. Indeed, there is known an intuitive measure of coherence that does not share this condition. We study coherence measures induced by quantum divergences of the Tsallis type. It is proved that considered measures of coherence satisfy all the required properties. The only point is that monotonicity under incoherent selective measurements has to be reformulated. The proposed formulation can naturally be treated as a parametric extension of its standard form. This extension is reduced to the standard form when the standard relative entropy is dealt. Finally, two coherence measures quadratic in moduli of matrix elements are compared from the monotonicity viewpoint.

abstract: We derive a markovian master equation for the internal dynamics of an ensemble of two-level atoms including all effects related to the quantization of their motion. Our equation provides a unifying picture of the consequences of recoil and indistinguishability of atoms beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime on both their dissipative and conservative dynamics, and applies equally well to distinguishable and indistinguishable atoms. We give general expressions for the decay rates and the dipole-dipole shifts for any motional states, and we find closed-form formulas for a number of relevant states (Gaussian states, Fock states and thermal states). In particular, we show that dipole-dipole interactions and cooperative photon emission can be modulated through the external state of motion.

abstract: Retrocausal models of QM add further weight to the conflict between causality and the possible existence of free will. We analyze a simple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic time arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other. The loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law therefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution is demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF), where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been actually made. To quantify this assertion, "weak information" is described in terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does not exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, particles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and future states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by quantum indeterminism.

The purpose of this study is to review different approaches to the problem and analyze different cases of quantum-state discrimination, most importantly the discrimination of bipartite entangled quantum states under local operations and classical communication. Two partial results on using entanglement as a resource for quantum-state discrimination and discrimination with remaining entanglement is given. The important points are also summarized and the results are discussed.

As a concrete demonstration, we consider quantum state transfer in a Heisenberg spin chain, and we show how to determine the confining potential in order to obtain perfect state transfer.

abstract: Quantum computation can be achieved by preparing an appropriate initial product state of qudits and then letting it evolve under a fixed Hamiltonian. The readout is made by measurement on individual qudits at some later time. This approach is called the Hamiltonian quantum computation and it includes, for example, the continuous-time quantum cellular automata and the universal quantum walk. We consider one spatial dimension and study the compromise between the locality $k$ and the local Hilbert space dimension $d$. For geometrically 2-local (i.e., $k=2$), it is known that $d=8$ is already sufficient for universal quantum computation but the Hamiltonian is not translationally invariant. As the locality $k$ increases, it is expected that the minimum required $d$ should decrease. We provide a construction of Hamiltonian quantum computer for $k=3$ with $d=5$. One implication is that simulating 1D chains of spin-2 particles is BQP-complete. Imposing translation invariance will increase the required $d$. For this we also construct another 3-local ($k=3$) Hamiltonian that is invariant under translation of a unit cell of two sites but that requires $d$ to be 8.

Lett. \textbf{113}, 110501(2014) have proposed a stronger version of monogamy relation for concurrence. We have extended the strong monogamy inequality for another entanglement measure, viz., negativity. In particular, we have concentrated on four-qubit system and provided a detail study on the status of strong monogamy on pure states. Further, we have analytically provided some classes of states for which negativity and squared negativity satisfy strong monogamy. Numerical evidences have also been shown in proper places. Our analysis also provides cases where strong monogamy is violated.

abstract: This paper focuses on a constructive treatment of the mathematical formalism of quantum theory and a possible role of constructivist philosophy in resolving the foundational problems of quantum mechanics, particularly, the controversy over the meaning of the wave function of the universe. As it is demonstrated in the paper, unless the number of the universe's degrees of freedom is fundamentally upper bounded (owing to some unknown physical laws) or hypercomputation is physically realizable, the universal wave function is a non-constructive entity in the sense of constructive recursive mathematics. This means that even if such a function might exist, basic mathematical operations on it would be undefinable and subsequently the only content one would be able to deduce from this function would be pure symbolical.

We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of molecular hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we experimentally execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissociation energy to within chemical accuracy of the numerically exact result. Next, we experimentally demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chemistry, which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estimation. We compare the experimental performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors, inspiring hope that quantum simulation of classically intractable molecules may be viable in the near future.

abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) guarantees unconditional security of secret key without making assumptions about the internal workings of the devices used. The primary challenge in realizing DIQKD in practice is the detection loophole problem that is inherent to photonic tests of Bell's inequalities over lossy channels. We revisit the proposal of Curty and Moroder [Phys. Rev. A 84, 010304(R) (2011)] to use a linear optics-based entanglement-swapping relay (ESR) to counter this problem. We consider realistic models for the entanglement sources and photodetectors; more precisely, (a) polarization-entangled states based on pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) sources with infinitely higher order multi-photon components and multimode spectral structure, and (b) on-off photodetectors with non-unit efficiencies and non-zero dark count probabilities. Our results show that the imperfect ESR-based scheme still enables positive key rates at distances much larger than what is possible without ESR for sufficiently large detector and coupling efficiencies, small dark count probabilities in the detectors and small spectral spread in the sources.

abstract: Coupling a quantum many-body system to a cavity can create bifurcation points in the phase diagram, where the ground state switches between different phases. Here we study the dynamical quantum phase transition at the bifurcation points of a transverse field Ising model coupled to a cavity. We show that an infinitesimal quench of the cavity driving induces gradual evolution of the Ising model to pass across the quantum critical point and generates quasiparticles. Our calculation also shows that when the driving is slowly ramped over the bifurcation points, the adiabaticity of the evolution and the number of excitations are strongly affected by cavity-induced nonlinearity. This effect can hence be exploited to improve the fidelity of adiabatic quantum processes. Our model can be implemented with superconducting quantum circuits.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a task in which a tripartite quantum state is transformed to an approximately recoverable state by a randomizing operation on one of the three subsystems. We consider cases where the initial state is a tensor product of $n$ copies of a tripartite state $\rho^{ABC}$, and is transformed by a random unitary operation on $A^n$ to another state which is approximately recoverable from its reduced state on $A^nB^n$ (Case 1) or $B^nC^n$ (Case 2). We analyze the minimum cost of randomness per copy required for the task in an asymptotic limit of infinite copies and vanishingly small error of recovery, mainly focusing on the case of pure states. We prove that the minimum cost in Case 1 is equal to the Markovianizing cost of the state, for which a single-letter formula is known. With an additional requirement on the convergence speed of the recovery error, we prove that the minimum cost in Case 2 is also equal to the Markovianizing cost. Our results have an application for distributed quantum computation.

We show that the connection of eigenspaces depends on a topological property of the adiabatic paths for given initial and final points. An example in slowly modulated periodically driven systems is shown. These analysis are based on the topological analysis of the exotic quantum holonomy in adiabatic closed paths.

abstract: In this paper the relation between stereographic projection and concurrence measure for bipartite pure states in $2\times n$ and $4\times n$ dimensional Hilbert space is discussed. After reviewing the entanglement of two-qubit pure state by making use of stereographic projection in quaternion projective space, it is shown that the \emph{quaternionic} stereographic projection is related to concurrence measure. Rather, the same relation is established for three-qubit state which shows that this map is entanglement sensitive under \emph{octonionic} stereographic projection in $4\times 2$ dimensional Hilbert space. Finally, we generalize recent consequence to $2 \times n$ and $4\times n$ dimensional Hilbert space.

abstract: For a pair of quantum channels with the same input space, we show that the possibility of approximation of one channel by post-processings of the other can be characterized by comparing the success probabilities for ensembles obtained as outputs for any ensemble on the input space coupled with an ancilla. In particular, this yields the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments, with a clear operational interpretation. The results are obtained using some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of independent interest.

abstract: Time-resolved magnetic sensing is of great importance from fundamental studies to applications in physical and biological sciences. Recently the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect center in diamond has been developed as a promising sensor of magnetic field under ambient conditions. However the methods to reconstruct time-resolved magnetic field with high sensitivity are not yet fully developed. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel sensing method based on spin echo, and Haar wavelet transform. Our method is exponentially faster in reconstructing time-resolved magnetic field with comparable sensitivity over existing methods. Further, the wavelet's unique features enable our method to extract information from the whole signal with only part of the measuring sequences. We then explore this feature for a fast detection of simulated nerve impulses. These results will be useful to time-resolved magnetic sensing with quantum probes at nano-scales.

abstract: The Heisenberg's error-disturbance relation is a cornerstone of quantum physics. It was recently shown to be not universally valid and two different approaches to reformulate it were proposed.The first one focuses on how error and disturbance of two observables, A and B, depend on a particular quantum state. The second one asks how a joint measurement of A and B affects their eigenstates. Previous experiments focused on the first approach. Here, we focus on the second one. Firstly, we propose and implement an extendible method for quantum walk-based joint measurements of noisy Pauli operators to test the error-disturbance relation for qubits. Then, we formulate and experimentally test a new universally valid relation for the three mutually unbiased observables. We therefore establish a fundamentally new method of testing error-disturbance relations.

abstract: In the context of measurement-based quantum computation a way of maintaining the coherence of a graph state is to measure its stabilizer operators. Aside from performing quantum error correction, it is possible to exploit the information gained from these measurements to characterize and then counteract a coherent source of errors; that is, to determine all the parameters of an error channel that applies a fixed - but unknown - unitary operation to the physical qubits. Such a channel is generated, e.g., by local stray fields that act on the qubits. We study the case in which each qubit of a given graph state may see a different error channel and we focus on channels given by a rotation on the Bloch sphere around either the x, y or z axis, for which analytical results can be given in a compact form. The possibility of reconstructing the channels at all qubits depends non-trivially on the topology of the graph state. We prove via perturbation methods that the reconstruction process is robust and supplement the analytic results with numerical evidence.

abstract: A PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein condensate can theoretically be described using a complex optical potential, however, the experimental realization of such an optical potential describing the coherent in- and outcoupling of particles is a nontrivial task. We propose an experiment for a quantum mechanical realization of a PT-symmetric system, where the PT-symmetric currents are implemented by an accelerating Bose-Einstein condensate in a titled optical lattice. A defect consisting of two wells at the same energy level then acts as a PT-symmetric double-well if the tilt in the energy offsets of all further wells in the lattice is varied in time. We map the time-dependence of the amplitudes of a frozen Gaussian variational ansatz to a matrix model and increase the system size step by step starting with a six-well setup. In terms of this simple matrix model we derive conditions under which two wells of the Hermitian multi-well system behave exactly as the two wells of the PT-symmetric system.

abstract: The problem of detecting non-classical correlations of states of many qudits is incomparably more involved than in a case of qubits. The reason is that for qubits we have a convenient description of the system by the means of the well-studied correlation tensor. Simply, the complete information about the state can be encoded in mean values of dichotomic measurements. WE demonstrate that for three-dimensional quantum subsystems we are able to formulate nonlinear entanglement criteria of the state with existing formalisms. We also point out where the idea for constructing these criteria fails for higher-dimensional systems, which poses well-defined open questions.

abstract: Causal modelling provides a powerful set of tools for identifying causal structure from observed correlations. It is well known that such techniques fail for quantum systems, unless one introduces `spooky' hidden mechanisms. Whether one can produce a genuinely quantum framework in order to discover causal structure remains an open question. Here we introduce a new framework for quantum causal modelling that allows for the discovery of causal structure. We define quantum analogues for many of the core features of classical causal modelling techniques, including the Causal Markov Condition and Faithfulness. Based on the process matrix formalism, this framework naturally extends to generalised structures with indefinite causal order.

abstract: In quantum mechanics the position and momentum operators are related to each other via the Fourier transform. In the same way, here we show that the so-called Pegg-Barnett phase operator can be obtained by the application of the discrete Fourier transform to the number operator defined in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Furthermore, we show that the structure of the London-Susskind-Glogower phase operator, whose natural logarithm give rise the Pegg-Barnett phase operator, is contained into the Hamiltonian of circular waveguide arrays. Our results may find applications in the development of new finite-dimensional photonic systems with interesting phase-dependent properties.

abstract: Recent experimental progress in monitoring the dynamics of ultracold gases in optical lattices necessitates a quantitative theoretical description for a significant number of bosons. In the present paper, we investigate if time-dependent semiclassical initial value methodology is suitable to describe interacting bosons, concentrating on a single mode. Despite the nonlinear contribution from the self-interaction, the corresponding classical dynamics permits a largely analytical treatment of the semiclassical propagator. We find that application of the Herman-Kluk (HK) propagator conserves unitarity in the semiclassical limit, but a decay of the norm is seen for low particle numbers $n$. The frozen Gaussian approximation (HK with unit prefactor) is explicitly shown to violate unitarity in the present system for non-vanishing interaction strength, even in the semiclassical limit. Furthermore, we show by evaluating the phase space integral in steepest descent approximation that the HK-SCIVR reproduces the energy spectrum correctly to next-to-leading order in the parameter $1/n$ (large $n$ limit). In fact, due to a subtle cancellation of errors, the HK spectrum obtained thus is in full agreement with the exact quantum mechanical solution. An error is, however, incurred in NNLO, as seen upon numerical evaluation of the integral. The frozen Gaussian approximation, in contrast, is only accurate to LO, and an erroneous NLO term in the energy spectrum was found analytically. Finally, as an example application, we study the dynamics of wave packets by computing the time evolution of the Wigner function. While the often-used truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) cannot capture any interferences present in the exact quantum mechanical solution (known analytically), we find that the HK-SCIVR, despite also using classical information only, reproduces the salient features of the exact solution correctly.

abstract: In this short review I present my personal reflections on QBism. I have no intrinsic sympathy neither to QBism nor to subjective interpretation of probability in general. However, I have been following development of QBism from its very beginning, observing its evolution and success, sometimes with big surprise. Therefore my reflections on QBism can be treated as "external observer" reflections. I hope that my view on this interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) has some degree of objectivity. It may be useful for researchers who are interested in quantum foundations, but do not belong to the QBism-community, because I tried to analyze essentials of QBism critically (i.e., not just emphasizing its advantages, as in a typical QBist publication). QBists, too, may be interested in comments of an external observer who monitored development of this approach to QM during the last 16 years. The second part of the paper is devoted to interpretations of probability, objective versus subjective, and views of Kolmogorov, von Mises, and de Finetti. Finally, de Finetti's approach to methodology of science is presented and compared with QBism.

abstract: Milz and Strunz ( J. Phys. A: 48} [2015] 035306) recently studied the probability that two-qubit and qubit-qutrit states, randomly generated with respect to Hilbert-Schmidt (Euclidean/flat) measure, are separable. They concluded that in both these case these separability probabilities hold constant over the Bloch radii ($r$) of the single-qubit subsystems, jumping to 1 at the pure state boundaries ($r=1$)--their two-qubit analysis being consistent with the strongly-supported---though not yet formally proven---assertion that the associated separability probability is $\frac{8}{33}$. Here, we present evidence that in the qubit-qutrit case the separability probability is uniformly distributed, as well, over the generalized Bloch radius ($R$) of the qutrit subsystem. While the qubit (standard) Bloch vector is positioned in three-dimensional space, the qutrit generalized Bloch vector lives in eight-dimensional space, with the radii variables $r$ and $R$ employed being the lengths/norms of these two vectors. Unlike the two-qubit case, no compelling case has yet been developed as to the exact value of the qubit-qutrit separability probability, though the value $\frac{164}{6075} \approx 0.0269959$ fits the results here well.

abstract: The formation of bound states involving multiple particles underlies many interesting quantum physical phenomena, such as Efimov physics or superconductivity. In this work we show the existence of an infinite number of such states for some boson impurity models. They describe free bosons coupled to an impurity and include some of the most representative models in quantum optics. We also propose a family of wavefunctions to describe the bound states and verify that it accurately characterizes all parameter regimes by comparing its predictions with exact numerical calculations for a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian. For that model, we also analyze the nature of the bound states by studying the scaling relations of physical quantities such as the ground state energy and localization length, and find a non-analytical behavior as a function of the coupling strength. Finally, we discuss how to test our theoretical predictions in experimental platforms such as photonic crystal structures and cold atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: Given an arbitrary $2^\omega \times 2^w$ unitary matrix, a powerful matrix decomposition can be applied, leading to the synthesis of a w-qubit quantum circuit performing the unitary transformation. The demonstration is based on a recent theorem by F\"uhr and Rzeszotnik, generalizing the scaling of single-bit unitary gates $(\omega=1)$ to gates with arbitrary value of $\omega$. The synthesized circuit consists of controlled 1-qubit gates, such as NEGATOR gates and PHASOR gates. We propose a numerical approach to compute the design using a generalization of the Sinkhorn algorithm to scale unitary matrices.

abstract: Non-Markovian master equations describe general open quantum systems when no approximation is made. We provide the exact closed master equation for the class of Gaussian, completely positive, trace preserving, non-Markovian dynamics. This very general result allows to investigate a vast variety of physical systems. We show that the master equation for non-Markovian quantum Brownian motion is a particular case of our general result. Furthermore, we derive the master equation unraveled by a non-Markovian, dissipative stochastic Schr\"odinger equation, paving the way for the analysis of dissipative non-Markovian collapse models.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the probe field transmission in an optomechanical cavity setup with Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), where the standing wave that forms in the cavity results in an one-dimensional optical lattice potential. We report that in the presence of atom-atom interactions, the coupling of the cavity field with condensate (Bogoliubov mode), the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations leads to the emergence of the tunable Fano resonances in the probe absorption spectrum. Within the experimental reach, based on analytical and numerical simulations, we find that the optomechanical system with BEC provides great flexibility to tune the Fano resonances, as the width of the resonance is controllable by the coupling field and additionally, with the atom-atom interaction. Moreover, Fano resonances are analyzed for the fluctuations of the cavity field and the fluctuations of the condensate with finite atomic two-body interaction, which shows an excellent compatibility with the original Fano resonances as discovered by Ugo Fano. Furthermore, the occurrence of slow light in the probe transmission is explained. It is shown that slow light effect can be enhanced by increasing the atom-atom interaction, It is shown that slow light effect can be enhanced by increasing the atom-atom interaction, which offers a road map towards the realization of on-demand quantum optomechanical memories.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of a weak probe field in hybrid optomechanics with a single three-level ($\Lambda$-type) atomic system. We report that, in the presence of optomechanical coupling and two transition coupling parameters of three-level atom (TLA), there occurs three distinct multiple EIT windows in the probe absorption spectrum. Moreover, the switching of multiple windows into double and single EIT windows can be obtained by suitably tuning the system parameters. Furthermore, the probe transmission spectrum have been studied. Based on our analytical and numerical work, we explain the occurrence of slow and fast light (superluminal) regimes, and enhancement of superluminal behaviour in the probe field transmission. This work demonstrates great potential in multi-channel waveguide, fiber optics and classical communication networks, multi-channel quantum information processing, real quality imaging, cloaking devices and delay lines & optical buffers for telecommunication.

abstract: We present a model of discrete quantum evolution based on quantum correlations between the evolving system and a reference quantum clock system. A quantum circuit for the model is provided, which in the case of a constant Hamiltonian is able to represent the evolution over $2^n$ time steps in terms of just $n$ time qubits and $n$ control gates. We then introduce the concept of system-time entanglement as a measure of distinguishable quantum evolution, based on the entanglement between the system and the reference clock. This quantity vanishes for stationary states and is maximum for systems jumping onto a new orthogonal state at each time step. In the case of a constant Hamiltonian it is a measure of the spread over distinct energy eigenstates, satisfying an energy-time uncertainty relation. The evolution of mixed states is also examined. Simple analytical expressions for the basic case of a qubit clock are as well provided.

abstract: Both simulated quantum annealing and physical quantum annealing have shown the emergence of "heavy tails" in their performance as optimizers: The total time needed to solve a set of random input instances is dominated by a small number of very hard instances. Classical simulated annealing, in contrast, does not show such heavy tails. Here we explore the origin of these heavy tails, which appear for inputs with high local degeneracy---large isoenergetic clusters of states in Hamming space. This category includes the low-precision Chimera-structured problems studied in recent benchmarking work comparing the D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor with simulated annealing. On similar inputs designed to suppress local degeneracy, performance of a quantum annealing processor on hard instances improves by orders of magnitude at the 512-qubit scale, while classical performance remains relatively unchanged. Simulations indicate that perturbative crossings are the primary factor contributing to these heavy tails, while sensitivity to Hamiltonian misspecification error plays a less significant role in this particular setting.

abstract: We report on image processing techniques and experimental procedures to determine the lattice-site positions of single atoms in an optical lattice with high reliability, even for limited acquisition time or optical resolution. Determining the positions of atoms beyond the diffraction limit relies on parametric deconvolution in close analogy to methods employed in super-resolution microscopy. We develop a deconvolution method that makes effective use of the prior knowledge of the optical transfer function, noise properties, and discreteness of the optical lattice. We show that accurate knowledge of the image formation process enables a dramatic improvement on the localization reliability. This is especially relevant for closely packed ensembles of atoms where the separation between particles cannot be directly optically resolved. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimental methods to precisely reconstruct the point spread function with sub-pixel resolution from fluorescence images of single atoms, and we give a mathematical foundation thereof. We also discuss discretized image sampling in pixel detectors and provide a quantitative model of noise sources in electron multiplying CCD cameras.

Additionally, the energy spectrum of bound states is obtained and reveals the Schiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect, for specific conditions the potential lodges bound states of particles and antiparticles. Comments about the vector bosons problem subject to square potentials are present.

Our findings enable us to attain complete quantum memory operation for polarization qubits in a warm $^{87}$Rb atomic vapor with an average fidelity of $86.6\pm 0.6\%$, thereby defeating any classical strategy exploiting the non-unitary character of the memory efficiency. Our system significantly decreases the technological overhead required to achieve quantum memory operation and will serve as a building block for scalable and technologically simpler many-memory quantum machines.

The coupling leads to reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and enhancement of the optical depth in microns-long devices, which will enable on-chip quantum memories.

abstract: Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two parties, when measured suitably achieve the maximum non-local correlations allowed by quantum mechanics. Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013) proved the converse. They showed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated measurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor product of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured according to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a high price, it requires a large overhead in the number of entangled pairs and measurements. In this paper we prove an analogous statement for quantum steering correlations, where in this case, the device of one side is trusted. We first demonstrate a practical one-sided device-independent version of self-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of two parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to constant factors leading to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As an application of this result we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable delegated quantum computation, with quadratic overhead, and compare it to other existing protocols. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification protocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.

Each core is capable of performing any quantum instruction. Moreover, we introduce a scalable quantum mapper, called Squash 2, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of quantum modules---each module is divided into k parts such that each part will run on one of k available cores. Experimental results demonstrate that Squash~2 can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.

abstract: Incompatible observables can be approximated by compatible observables in joint measurement or measured sequentially, with constrained accuracy as implied by Heisenberg's original formulation of the uncertainty principle. Recently, Busch, Lahti, and Werner proposed inaccuracy trade-off relations based on statistical distances between probability distributions of measurement outcomes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 160405 (2013); Phys. Rev. A 89, 012129 (2014)]. Here we reform their theoretical framework, derive an improved relation for qubit measurement, and perform an experimental test on a spin system. The relation reveals that the worst-case inaccuracy is tightly bounded from below by the incompatibility of target observables, and is verified by the experiment employing joint measurement in which two compatible but typically non-commutative observables on one qubit are measured simultaneously.

abstract: We study electric quantum walks in two dimensions considering Grover, Alternate, Hadamard, and DFT quantum walks. In the Grover walk the behaviour under an electric field is easy to summarize: when the field direction coincides with the x or y axes, it produces a transient trapping of the probability distribution along the direction of the field, while when it is directed along the diagonals, a perfect 2D trapping is frustrated. The analysis of the alternate walk helps to understand the behaviour of the Grover walk as both walks are partially equivalent; in particular, it helps to understand the role played by the existence of conical intersections in the dispersion relations, as we show that when these are removed a perfect 2D trapping can occur for suitable directions of the field. We complete our study with the electric DFT and Hadamard walks in 2D, showing that the latter can exhibit perfect 2D trapping.

abstract: The implementation and engineering of bright and coherent solid state quantum light sources is key for the realization of both on chip and remote quantum networks. Despite tremendous efforts for more than 15 years, the combination of these two key prerequisites in a single, potentially scalable device is a major challenge. Here, we report on the observation of bright and coherent single photon emission generated via pulsed, resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot (QD) deterministically centered in a micropillar cavity device via cryogenic optical lithography. The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the pillar, leading to an overall device efficiency of $\eta=(74\pm4)~\%$ for a single photon emission as pure as $g^{(2)}(0)=0.0092\pm0.0004$. The combination of large Purcell enhancement and resonant pumping conditions allows us to observe a two-photon wave packet overlap up to $\nu=(88\pm3)~\%$

abstract: We consider the usage of dynamical decoupling in quantum metrology, where the joint evolution of system plus environment is described by a Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that by ultra-fast unitary control operations acting locally only on system qubits, essentially all kinds of noise can be eliminated. This is done in such a way that the desired evolution is reduced by at most a constant factor, leading to Heisenberg scaling. The only exception is noise that is generated by the Hamiltonian to be estimated itself. However, even for such parallel noise, one can achieve an improved scaling as compared to the standard quantum limit for any local noise by means of symmetrization.

abstract: Control at the interface between the classical and the quantum world is fundamental in quantum physics. In particular, how classical control is enhanced by coherence effects is an important question both from a theoretical as well as from a technological point of view. In this work, we establish a resource theory describing this setting and explore relations to the theory of coherence, entanglement and information processing. Specifically, for the coherent control of quantum systems the relevant resources of entanglement and coherence are found to be equivalent and closely related to a measure of discord. The results are then applied to the DQC1 protocol and the precision of the final measurement is expressed in terms of the available resources.

The upper bound of the coupling strength is given by the optomechanical coupling associated with the much shorter inner cavity, consistently with the analysis of A. Xuereb et al., Phys. Rev.

abstract: $ $In its usual form, Grover's quantum search algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries and $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$ other elementary gates to find a solution in an $N$-bit database. Grover in 2002 showed how to reduce the number of other gates to $O(\sqrt{N}\log\log N)$ for the special case where the database has a unique solution, without significantly increasing the number of queries. We show how to reduce this further to $O(\sqrt{N}\log^{(r)} N)$ gates for any constant $r$, and sufficiently large $N$. This means that, on average, the gates between two queries barely touch more than a constant number of the $\log N$ qubits on which the algorithm acts. For a very large $N$ that is a power of 2, we can choose $r$ such that the algorithm uses essentially the minimal number $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ of queries, and only $O(\sqrt{N}\log(\log^{\star} N))$ other gates.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.07605
abstract: The so-called NOON states are quantum optical resources known to be useful especially for quantum lithography and metrology. At the same time, they are known to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce experimentally. Concerning the former, here we present a scheme where NOON states are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes against photon losses, thus demonstrating that such resources can also be useful to suppress the effect of loss. Our NOON-code is an exact code that can be systematically extended from one-photon to higher-number losses. Its loss scaling depending on the codeword photon number is the same as for some existing, exact loss codes such as bosonic and quantum parity codes, but its codeword mode number is intermediate between that of the other codes. Another generalisation of the NOON-code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead of logical qubits. While, in general, the final codewords are always obtainable from multi-mode NOON states through application of beam splitters, both codewords for the one-photon-loss qubit NOON-code can be simply created from single-photon states with beam splitters. We give various examples and also discuss a potential application of our qudit code for quantum communication.

abstract: Quantum superposition in mechanical systems is not only a key evidence of macroscopic quantum coherence, but can also be utilized in modern quantum technology. Here we propose an efficient approach for creating macroscopically distinct mechanical superposition states in a two-mode optomechanical system. Photon hopping between the two cavity modes is modulated sinusoidally. The modulated photon tunneling enables an ultrastrong radiation-pressure force acting on the mechanical resonator, and hence significantly increases the mechanical displacement induced by a single photon. We present systematic studies on the generation of the Yurke-Stoler-like states in the presence of system dissipations. The state generation method is general and it can be implemented with either optomechanical or electromechanical systems.

As a consequence, the edge states get highly populated which can be used to detect them experimentally. We relate the topology to the existence of non-contractible curves in a stability diagram that can be constructed analytically from an effective Hamiltonian.

abstract: We study a tripartite system of coupled spins, where a first set of one or two spins is our central system which is coupled to another set considered, the near environment, in turn coupled to the third set, the far environment. The dynamics considered are those of a generalized kicked spin chain in the regime of quantum chaotic dynamics. This allows to test recent results that suggest that the presence of a far environment, coupled to the near environment, slows decoherence of the central system. After an extensive numerical study, we confirm previous results for extreme values and special cases. In particular, under a wide variety of circumstances an increasingly large coupling between near and far environment, slows decoherence, as measured by purity, and protects internal entanglement.

We also obtain a more general relation which applies to arbitrary $N$-qubit state, and determine a condition for the transformation matrix of the quantum channel supporting permanently freezing of the $l_1$ norm of coherence. These results simplify determination of a general decoherence dynamics to that the investigation of the representative probe state.

We establish connections between the direction of information flow and variation of the geometric quantum discords (GQDs) measured respectively by the trace distance, the Hellinger distance, and the Bures distance for two qubits subjecting to the bosonic structured reservoirs, and unveil their dependence on a factor whose derivative signifies the (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics. By considering the reservoirs with Lorentzian and Ohmic-like spectra, we further demonstrated that the non-Markovianity induced by the backflow of information from the reservoirs to the system enhances the GQDs in most of the parameter regions. This highlights the potential of non-Markovianity as a resource for protecting the GQDs.

abstract: We demonstrate a polarization-entangled photon-pair source obtained via a type-II non-collinear quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion process with a 10-mm periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystal, which is as bright, stable, and wavelength-tunable as the well-known Sagnac configuration scheme. A spectral brightness of 74 kHz/mW/nm is measured and a concurrence of 0.975 is estimated using quantum state tomography. Without loss of entanglement and brightness, the photon-pair wavelengths are tunable through control of the crystal temperature. This improvement is achieved using the non-collinear configuration and a stable interferometric distinguishability compensator.

abstract: In cavity optomechanics, radiation pressure and photothermal forces are widely utilized to cool and control micromechanical motion, with applications ranging from precision sensing and quantum information to fundamental science. Here, we realize an alternative approach to optical forcing based on superfluid flow and evaporation in response to optical heating. We demonstrate optical forcing of the motion of a cryogenic microtoroidal resonator at a level of 1.46 nN, roughly one order of magnitude larger than the radiation pressure force. We use this force to feedback cool the motion of a microtoroid mechanical mode to 137 mK. The photoconvective forces demonstrated here provide a new tool for high bandwidth control of mechanical motion in cryogenic conditions, and have the potential to allow efficient transfer of electromagnetic energy to motional kinetic energy.

abstract: We propose a fast phase-gating of a single nuclear spin, which interacts with the single electronic spin of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Our gate operation is to be called the geometric quantum gate; a geometric phase shift of the electron spin induced by the rotating electric field, is utilized to control the nuclear-spin phase. The gate time is inversely proportional to the frequency of the electric-field rotation; we estimate that the phase-gate time is orders shorter than hitherto reported. We also show the robustness against decoherence and systematic errors.

abstract: Resonant photon modes of a 5mm diameter YIG sphere loaded in a cylindrical cavity in the 10-30GHz frequency range are characterised as a function of applied DC magnetic field at millikelvin temperatures. The photon modes are confined mainly to the sphere, and exhibited large mode filling factors in comparison to previous experiments, allowing ultrastrong coupling with the magnon spin wave resonances. The largest observed coupling between photons and magnons is $2g/2\pi=7.11$ GHz for a 15.5 GHz mode, corresponding to a cooperativity of $C=1.51\pm0.47\times10^7$. Complex modifications beyond a simple multi-oscillator model, of the photon mode frequencies were observed between 0 and 0.1 Tesla. Between 0.4 to 1 Tesla, degenerate resonant photon modes were observed to interact with magnon spin wave resonances with different couplings strengths, indicating time reversal symmetry breaking due to the gyrotropic permeability of YIG. Bare dielectric resonator mode frequencies were determined by detuning magnon modes to significantly higher frequencies with strong magnetic fields. By comparing measured mode frequencies at 7 Tesla with Finite Element modelling, a bare dielectric permittivity of $15.96\pm0.02$ of the YIG crystal has been determined at about $20$ mK.

abstract: Microscopic Hamiltonian models of the composite system "open system + environment" typically do not provide the operator-sum Kraus form but a differential (master equation) form of the open system's dynamical map. Due to the recently developed method [Andersson et al, J. Mod. Opt. \textbf{54}, 1695 (2007)], we derive the novel, generalized Kraus operators starting from the microscopic master equation for the one-qubit depolarizing quantum channel, for high temperature of the thermal bath. The proper choice of the composite system's parameters gives rise to reducing the Kraus operators to the standard counterparts that are widely used in the literature. Comparison of the standard and the here obtained channels is performed via investigating dynamical change of the Bloch sphere volume, entropy production and the open system's state trace distance. We find that the standard channel is more deteriorating than the generalized one. We do not obtain new Kraus operators for the amplitude damping and the phase damping channels.

abstract: We discuss dynamical response theory of driven-dissipative quantum systems described by Markovian Master Equations generating semi-groups of maps. In this setting thermal equilibrium states are replaced by non-equilibrium steady states and dissipative perturbations are considered besides the Hamiltonian ones. We derive explicit expressions for the linear dynamical response functions for generalized dephasing channels and for Davies thermalizing generators. We introduce the notion of maximal harmonic response and compute it exactly for a single qubit channel. Finally, we analyze linear response near dynamical phase transitions in quasi-free open quantum systems. It is found that the effect of the dynamical phase transition shows up in a peak at the edge of the spectrum in the imaginary part of the dynamical response function.

abstract: We introduce an intuitive and semi-analytical polaron master equation approach to model pulse-driven population inversion and emitted single photons from a quantum dot exciton. The master equation theory allows one to identify important phonon-induced scattering rates analytically, and fully includes the role of the time-dependent pump field. As an application of the theory, we first study a quantum dot driven by a time-varying laser pulse on and off resonance, showing the population inversion caused by acoustic phonon emission in direct agreement with recent experiment of Quilter {\em et al.}, Phys Rev Lett {\bf 110}, 053039 (2015). We then model quantum dots in weakly coupled cavities and show the difference in population response between exciton-driven and cavity-driven systems. Finally, we assess the nonresonant phonon-assisted loading scheme with a quantum dot resonantly coupled to a cavity as a deterministic single photon source, and compare and contrast the important figures of merit with direct Rabi oscillation of the population using a resonant $\pi$ pulse, where the latter is shown to be much more efficient.

abstract: We characterize the entropy production and the maximal extractable work from a squeezed thermal reservoir. The nonequilibrium quantum nature of the reservoir induces an entropy transfer with a coherent contribution while modifying its thermal part, allowing work extraction from a single reservoir, as well as great improvements in power and efficiency for quantum heat engines, which are characterized. Introducing a modified quantum Otto cycle, we predict the appearance of operational regimes forbidden in the standard case, such as refrigeration and work extraction at the same time, accompanied by efficiencies equal to unity.

abstract: Extended Clifford circuits straddle the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Whether such circuits are efficiently classically simulable seems to depend delicately on the ingredients of the circuits. While some combinations of ingredients lead to efficiently classically simulable circuits, other combinations that might just be slightly different, lead to circuits which are likely not. We extend the results of Jozsa and Van den Nest (arXiv:1305.6190) by studying two further extensions of Clifford circuits. Firstly, we consider how the classical simulation complexity changes when we allow for more general measurements. Secondly, we investigate different notions of what it means to "classically simulate" a quantum circuit. These further extensions give us 24 new combinations of ingredients compared to Jozsa and Van den Nest, and we give a complete classification of their classical simulation complexities. Our results provide more examples where seemingly modest changes to the ingredients of Clifford circuits lead to large changes in the classical simulation complexity under plausible complexity assumptions.

abstract: Entangled photon pairs generated within integrated devices must often be spatially separated for their subsequent manipulation in quantum circuits. Separation that is both deterministic and universal can in principle be achieved through anti-coalescent two-photon quantum interference. However, such interference-facilitated pair separation (IFPS) has not been extensively studied in the integrated setting, where the strong polarization and wavelength dependencies of integrated couplers -- as opposed to bulk-optics beamsplitters -- can have important implications for performance beyond the identical-photon regime. This paper provides a detailed review of IFPS and examines how these dependencies impact separation fidelity and interference visibility. Focus is given to IFPS mediated by an integrated directional coupler. The analysis applies equally to both on-chip and in-fiber implementations, and can be expanded to other coupler architectures such as multimode interferometers. When coupler dispersion is present, the separation performance can depend on photon bandwidth, spectral entanglement, and the linearity of the dispersion. Under appropriate conditions, reduction in the separation fidelity due to loss of non-classical interference can be perfectly compensated for by classical wavelength demultiplexing effects. This work informs the design as well as the performance assessment of circuits for achieving universal photon pair separation for states with tunable arbitrary properties.

abstract: We show that an adiabatic cycle excites Bose particles confined in a one-dimensional box. During the adiabatic cycle, a wall described by a $\delta$-shaped potential is applied and its strength and position are slowly varied. When the system is initially prepared in the ground state, namely, in the zero-temperature equilibrium state, the adiabatic cycle brings all bosons into the first excited one-particle state, leaving the system in a nonequilibrium state. The absorbed energy during the cycle is proportional to the number of bosons.

abstract: In this short review I present my personal reflections on Zeilinger-Brukner information interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM). In general, this interpretation is very attractive for me. However, its rigid coupling to the notion of irreducible quantum randomness is a very complicated issue which I plan to address in more detail. This note may be useful for general public interested in quantum foundations, especially because I try to analyze essentials of the information interpretation critically (i.e., not just emphasizing its advantages as it is commonly done). This review is written in non-physicist friendly manner. Experts actively exploring this interpretation may be interested in the paper as well, as in the comments of "an external observer" who have been monitoring the development of this approach to QM during the last 18 years. The last part of this review is devoted to the general methodology of science with references to views of de Finetti, Wigner, and Peres.

abstract: With the emergence of an information society, the idea of protecting sensitive data is steadily gaining importance. Conventional encryption methods may not be sufficient to guarantee data protection in the future. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an emerging technology that exploits fundamental physical properties to guarantee perfect security in theory. However, it is not easy to ensure in practice that the implementations of QKD systems are exactly in line with the theoretical specifications. Such theory-practice deviations can open loopholes and compromise the security. Several of such loopholes have been discovered and investigated in the last decade. These activities have motivated the proposal and implementation of appropriate countermeasures, thereby preventing future attacks and enhancing the practical security of QKD. This article introduces the so-called field of quantum hacking by summarizing a variety of attacks and their prevention mechanisms.

abstract: Quantum information brings together theories of physics and computer science. This synthesis challenges the basic intuitions of both fields. In this thesis, we show that adopting a unified and general language for process theories advances foundations and practical applications of quantum information. Our first set of results analyze quantum algorithms with a process theoretic structure. We contribute new constructions of the Fourier transform and Pontryagin duality in dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We then use this setting to study generalized unitary oracles and give a new quantum blackbox algorithm for the identification of group homomorphisms, solving the GROUPHOMID problem. In the remaining section, we construct a novel model of quantum blackbox algorithms in non-deterministic classical computation. Our second set of results concerns quantum foundations. We complete work begun by Coecke et al., definitively connecting the Mermin non-locality of a process theory with a simple algebraic condition on that theory's phase groups. This result allows us to offer new experimental tests for Mermin non-locality and new protocols for quantum secret sharing. In our final chapter, we exploit the shared process theoretic structure of quantum information and distributional compositional linguistics. We propose a quantum algorithm adapted from Weibe et al. to classify sentences by meaning. The clarity of the process theoretic setting allows us to recover a speedup that is lost in the naive application of the algorithm. The main mathematical tools used in this thesis are group theory (esp. Fourier theory on finite groups), monoidal category theory, and categorical algebra.

abstract: This work addresses Lindbladians admitting attractive subspaces in which time evolution is exclusively unitary. Such subspaces can be used to store, protect, and process quantum information. We derive an analytical formula for the left eigenmatrices of such Lindbladians corresponding to pure imaginary eigenvalues. This formula resolves how Lindbladian evolution affects the perturbative response and geometrical features of the attractive subspaces. We show that all Hamiltonian and certain jump operator perturbations induce (to first order) exclusively unitary evolution on the subspaces. Similarly, the holonomy induced on such subspaces after (adiabatic) traversal of a closed path in the parameter space is unitary. We derive a new Riemannian metric tensor in the parameter space induced by a large family of attractive subspaces. The adiabatic curvature (related to holonomies) and the metric tensor (related to the path length) are shown to be parts of a Lindblad quantum geometric tensor, generalizing this structure to Lindbladians possessing one or more mixed steady states. We derive a Kubo formula governing linear response of the attractive subspaces to Hamiltonian perturbations and determine cases in which this formula reduces to a Hamiltonian-based Kubo formula. As an application, we show that (for gapped systems) the zero-frequency Hall conductivity is unaffected by many types of Markovian dissipation. Finally, we show that the energy scale governing leakage out of the attractive subspaces, resulting from either corrections to adiabatic evolution or Hamiltonian perturbations, is different from the conventional Lindbladian dissipative gap. In certain cases, this scale is equivalent to the excitation gap of a related Hamiltonian. We summarize our key results by introducing "four-corners" notation and presenting two properties of generic subspaces, the "no-leak" and "clean-leak" properties.

We study the scaling properties of various quantities which define the scale of superposition and relate them to the well-known exponents of the phase transition.

abstract: We present a new type of phase- and frequency-sensitive amplification and attenuation in a cyclically driven three-level superconducting Josephson system. Different from the previous linear theory of pure phase-sensitive amplification, a new physical mechanism$-$combined action of nonlinear wave mixing and wave interference$-$is developed and leads to not only amplification but also attenuation. This is referred to as interference nonlinear optics. Our results show the sudden output signal transition from large gain to deep suppression by tuning the relative phase and in this case the system can act as a phase-controlled amplitude modulator. We also show the continuous change from output enhancement to attenuation by adjusting the driving-field frequency and in this situation the system behaves as a frequency-controlled amplitude modulator. Our study opens up a new perspective for its widespread applications in quantum information science.

abstract: We generate single-photon catalyzed coherent states (SPCCSs) by means of quantum-optical catalysis based on the beam splitter (BS) or the parametric amplifier (PA). These states are obtained in one of the BS (or PA) output channels if a coherent state and a single-photon Fock state are present in two input ports and a single photon is registered in the other output port. The success probabilities of the detection (also the normalization factors) are discussed, which is different for BS and PA catalysis. In addition, we prove that the generated states catalyzed by BS and PA devices are actually the same quantum states after analyzing photon number distribution of the SPCCSs. The quantum properties of the SPCCSs, such as sub-Poissionian distribution, anti-bunching effect, quadrature squeezing effect, and the negativity of the Wigner function are investigated in detail. The results shows that the SPCCSs are non-Gaussian states with an abundance of nonclassicality, which can provide the quantum advantages for quantum technological tasks.

abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a fundamental optical degree of freedom that has recently motivated much exciting research in diverse fields ranging from optical communication to quantum information. We show for the first time that it is also a unique and valuable resource for quantum simulation, by demonstrating theoretically how \emph{2d} topological physics can be simulated in a \emph{1d} array of optical cavities using OAM-carrying photons. Remarkably, this newly discovered application of OAM states not only reduces required physical resources but also increases feasible scale of simulation. By showing how important topics such as edge-state transport and topological phase transition can be studied in a small simulator with just a few cavities ready for immediate experimental exploration, we demonstrate the prospect of photonic OAM for quantum simulation which can have a significant impact on the research of topological physics.

abstract: One of the simplest methods for implementing quantum key distribution over fiber-optic communication is the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol with phase encoding (PE-BB84 protocol), in which the sender uses phase modulation over double pulses from a laser and the receiver uses a passive delayed interferometer. Using essentially the same setup and by regarding a train of many pulses as a single block, one can carry out the so-called differential quadrature phase shift (DQPS) protocol, which is a variant of differential phase shift (DPS) protocols. Here we prove the security of the DQPS protocol based on an adaptation of proof techniques for the BB84 protocol, which inherits the advantages arising from the simplicity of the protocol, such as accommodating the use of threshold detectors and simple off-line calibration methods for the light source. We show that the secure key rate of the DQPS protocol in the proof is eight thirds as high as the rate of the PE-BB84 protocol.

abstract: Nonlocal correlations arise from measurements on tripartite entangled states can be classified into two types, one genuinely $3-$way nonlocal and other local with respect to some bipartition. Still, whether a genuine tripartite entangled quantum state can exhibit genuine $3-$way nonlocality, remains a challenging problem so far as measurement context is concerned. Here we introduce a novel approach in this regard. We consider three genuine tripartite mixed entangled quantum states none of which is genuinely $3-$way nonlocal in original Bell scenario, but they can exhibit genuine $3-$way nonlocality when distributed in some suitable multiple entanglement swapping network. So, genuine $3-$way nonlocality is a nonadditive resource, which can be activated. Our result implies that genuine $3-$way nonlocality of quantum states strongly depends on the measurement context contrary to the belief that genuine $3-$way nonlocality can be exhibited only in original Bell scenario.

abstract: Nowadays, integrated photonics is a key technology in quantum information processing (QIP) but achieving all-optical buses for quantum networks with efficient integration of single photon emitters remains a challenge. Photonic crystals and cavities are good candidates but do not tackle how to effectively address a nanoscale emitter. Using a nanowire nanowaveguide, we realise an hybrid nanodevice which locally excites a single photon source (SPS). The nanowire acts as a passive or active sub-wavelength waveguide to excite the quantum emitter. Our results show that localised excitation of a SPS is possible and is compared with free-space excitation. Our proof of principle experiment presents an absolute addressing efficiency {\eta}a = 10-4 only 50% lower than the one using free-space optics. This important step demonstrates that sufficient guided light in a nanowaveguide made of a semiconductor nanowire is achievable to excite a single photon source. We accomplish a hybrid system offering great potentials for electrically driven SPSs and efficient single photon collection and detection, opening the way for optimum absorption/emission of nanoscale emitters. We also discuss how to improve the addressing efficiency of a dipolar nanoscale emitter with our system.

In the presence of a rotating magentic field, the neutrino spin can flip from left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino. Smirnov demonstrated that the pure state geometric phase due to the neutrino spin precession may cause resonantg spin conversion inside the Sun. However, in general, the neutrinos may in an ensemble of thermal state. In this article, the corresponding mixed state geometric phases will be formulated, including the off-diagonal casse and diagonal ones. The spefic features towards temperature will be analysized.

abstract: It is shown that phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channels are majorization-preserving over the set of passive states of the harmonic oscillator. This means that comparable passive states under majorization are transformed into equally comparable passive states. The proof relies on a new preorder relation called Fock-majorization, which coincides with regular majorization for passive states but also induces a mean photon number order, thereby connecting the concepts of energy and disorder of a quantum state. As an application, the consequences of majorization preservation are investigated in the context of the broadcast communication capacity of bosonic Gaussian channels. Most of our results being independent of the bosonic nature of the system under investigation, they could be generalized to other quantum systems and Hamiltonians, providing a general tool that could prove useful in quantum information theory and quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: In this job, we will present a theory called Quantum Tomography that is the natural extension of the theory of detection of signals in classical telecommunications to Quantum Mechanics. This theory mainly consists in the reconstruction of a quantum state of a system through a probability distribution measured directly in the laboratory, usually called Tomogram. This Thesis contains five chapters. In the first one, we will show the birth of this theory as an adaptation of homodyne and heterodyne classical detection to Quantum Mechanics. In the second, we will describe a tomographic description of Quantum Mechanics on C*-algebras by splitting the theory in two parts: a Generalized Sampling Theory and a Generalized Positive Transform. In the third, we will present the first numerical algorithm that solves the Clebsh-Gordan decomposition problem for any finite-dimensional unitary representation of any finite or compact Lie group. This algorithm receives the name of SMILY algorithm. In the fourth and fifth chapters, we will discuss tomography of systems parametrized with fields. In the fourth, we will reconstruct states of classical systems and in the fifth, we will do the same with quantum ones, but here in two different ways: the first one will be done by adapting the reconstruction formula of chapter four, and the second one by means of the axiomatic description of Wightamn-Streater of a Quantum Field Theory.

abstract: The internal stability of the electron has been debated for a century at both the classical and the quantum level. Recently, a local force density balance was established for the 1s electron in the H atom, based on the energy-momentum tensor of the classical Dirac field. This methodology is now extended to quantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum polarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any charged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal structure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization induced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point charge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and degeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are balanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The force densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac sea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha, the force densities remain balanced. This result establishes a local force balance for a prototypical manybody system.

abstract: Covariant affine integral quantization of the half-plane is studied and applied to the motion of a particle on the half-line. We examine the consequences of different quantizer operators built from weight functions on the half-plane. To illustrate the procedure, we examine two particular choices of the weight function, yielding thermal density operators and affine inversion respectively. The former gives rise to a temperature-dependent probability distribution on the half-plane whereas the later yields the usual canonical quantization and a quasi-probability distribution (affine Wigner function) which is real, marginal in both momentum p and position q.

abstract: In the EPR experiment, each measurement addresses the question "What spin value has this particle along this orientation?" The outcome then proves that the spin value has been affected by the distant experimenter's choice of spin orientation. We propose a new setting where the question is reversed: "What is the orientation along which this particle has this spin value?" It then turns out that the orientation is similarly subject to nonlocal effects. Each particle's interaction with a beam-splitter at t1 leaves its spin orientation superposed. Later at t2, the experimenter selects an "up" or "down" spin value for this yet-undefined orientation. Only after the two particles undergo this procedure, the two measurements are completed, each particle having a definite spin value along a definite orientation. By Bell's theorem, it is now the choice of orientation that must be nonlocally transmitted between the particles upon completing the measurement. This choice, however, has preceded the experimenter's selection. This lends some support to the time-symmetric interpretations of QM, where retrocausality plays a significant role. We conclude with a brief comparison between these interpretations and their traditional alternatives, Copenhagen, Bohmian mechanics and the Many Worlds Interpretation.

abstract: We study families of positive and completely positive maps acting on a bipartite system $\mathbb{C}^M\otimes \mathbb{C}^N$ (with $M\leq N$). The maps have a property that when applied to any state (of a given entanglement class) they result in a separable state, or more generally a state of another certain entanglement class (e.g., Schmidt number $\leq k$). This allows us to derive useful families of sufficient separability criteria. Explicit examples of such criteria have been constructed for arbitrary $M,N$, with a special emphasis on $M=2$. Our results can be viewed as generalizations of the known facts that in the sufficiently close vicinity of the completely depolarized state (the normalized identity matrix), all states are separable (belong to "weakly" entangled classes). Alternatively, some of our results can be viewed as an entanglement classification for a certain family of states, corresponding to mixtures of the completely polarized state with pure state projectors, partially transposed and locally transformed pure state projectors.

abstract: Quantum walk (QW) provides a versatile tool to study fundamental physics and also to make a variety of practical applications. We here start with the recent idea of {\it nonlinear} QW and show that introducing {\it nonlinearity} to QW can lead to a wealth of remarkable possibilities, e.g., simulating nonlinear quantum dynamics thus enhancing the applicability of QW above the existing level for a universal quantum simulator. As an illustration, we show that the dynamics of a nonlinear Dirac particle can be simulated on an optical nonlinear QW platform implemented with a measurement-based-feedforward scheme. The nonlinear evolution induced by the feed-forward introduces a self-coupling mechanism to (otherwise linear) Dirac particles, which accordingly behave as a \emph{soliton}. We particularly consider two kinds of nonlinear Dirac equations, one with a scalar-type self-coupling (Gross-Neveu model) and the other with a vector-type one (Thirring model), respectively. Using their known stationary solutions, we confirm that our nonlinear QW framework is capable of exhibiting characteristic features of a soliton. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear QW enables us to observe and control an enhancement and suppression of the ballistic diffusion.

abstract: We show that the density-matrix states of noncomposite qudit systems satisfy entropic and information relations like the subadditivity condition, strong subadditivity condition, and Araki--Lieb inequality, which characterize hidden quantum correlations of observables associated with these indivisible systems. We derive these relations employing a specific map of the entropic inequalities known for density matrices of multiqudit systems to the inequalities for density matrices of single-qudit systems. We present the obtained relations in the form of mathematical inequalities for arbitrary Hermitian NxN-matrices. We consider examples of superconducting qubits and qudits. We discuss the hidden correlations in single-qudit states as a new resource for quantum technologies analogous to the known resource in correlations associated with the entanglement in multiqudit systems.

abstract: We study a physical system consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a ring shaped lattice potential interrupted by three weak links. The system is assumed to be driven by an effective flux piercing the ring lattice. By employing path integral techniques, we explore the effective quantum dynamics of the system in a pure quantum phase dynamics regime. Complementarily, the effects of the density's quantum fluctuations are studied through exact diagonalization analysis of the spectroscopy of the Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate that a clear two-level system emerges by tuning the magnetic flux at degeneracy. The lattice confinement, platform for the condensate, is realized experimentally employing a spatial light modulator.

abstract: A robust control over quantum dynamics is of paramount importance for quantum technologies. Many of the existing control techniques are based on smooth Hamiltonian modulations involving repeated calculations of basic unitaries resulting in time complexities scaling rapidly with the length of the control sequence. On the other hand, the bang-bang controls need one-time calculation of basic unitaries and hence scale much more efficiently. By employing a global optimization routine such as the genetic algorithm, it is possible to synthesize not only highly intricate unitaries, but also certain nonunitary operations. Here we demonstrate the unitary control through the first implementation of the optimal fixed-point quantum search algorithm in a three-qubit NMR system. More over, by combining the bang-bang pulses with the twirling process, we also demonstrate a nonunitary transformation of the thermal equilibrium state into an effective pure state in a five-qubit NMR system.

We show how the associated quantum master equation for the center-of-mass can be expressed in terms of the orientationally averaged differential and total scattering cross sections, and we provide approximate analytic expressions for homogeneous dipolar interaction potentials. The master equation is then utilized to quantify collisional decoherence in an interference experiment with polar molecules.

abstract: The founding fathers of the quantum theory already struggled with the different roles of space and time in quantum theory. Position is by default represented by an operator, whereas time is usually treated as a parameter. Time operator models exist, in particular a certain Time Operator model denoted the Temporal Wave Function (T.W.F.). This one extends the Born's rule to the time domain. The statistics of pure exponential decay does not allow to exclude this Born rule for time. However the tiny violation of the combined discrete symmetries $P$ (parity) and $C$ (charge conjugation) observed in the K-meson system allows us, as we prove in this paper, to discriminate between the standard predictions, made in the framework of the so-called mass-decay matrix formalism, and the T.W.F. predictions. We also present experimental data of a particular $CP$ violating decay channel, that is in contrast with the prediction of T.W.F. approach model, resulting in its falsification.

abstract: We experimentally characterize the optical nonlinear response of a cold atomic medium placed inside an optical cavity, and excited to Rydberg states. The excitation to S and D Rydberg levels is carried out via a two-photon transition in an EIT (electromagnetically induced transparency) configuration, with a weak (red) probe beam on the lower transition, and a strong (blue) coupling beam on the upper transition. The observed optical nonlinearities induced by S states for the probe beam can be explained using a semi-classical model with van der Waals' interactions. For the D states, it appears necessary to take into account a dynamical decay of Rydberg excitations into a long-lived dark state. We show that the measured nonlinearities can be explained by using a Rydberg bubble model with a dynamical decay.

abstract: We propose a scheme to generate macroscopic Schr\"{o}dinger's cat states in a quantum oscillator (electromagnetic field or mechanical resonator) coupled to a quantum bit (two-level system) via a conditional displacement mechanism. By driving the qubit monochromatically, the oscillation of the qubit state modifies the effective frequency of the driving force acting on the oscillator, and a resonant or near-resonant driving on the oscillator can be achieved. The displacement of the oscillator is then significantly enhanced due to the small detuning of the driving force and can exceed that of the zero-point fluctuation. This effect can be used to prepare quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct coherent states in the oscillator. We present detailed studies on this state generation scheme in both closed and open system cases. This approach can be implemented in various experimental platforms, such as cavity- or circuit-QED systems, electromechanical systems, and spin-cantilever systems.

abstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) offers robust and flexible strategies for managing diverse network devices and uses. We adapt the principles of SDN to the deployment of quantum networks, which are composed from unique devices that operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum networks must classically exchange complex metadata between devices in order to carry out information for protocols such as teleportation, super-dense coding, and quantum key distribution. We show how quantum metadata can be managed within a software-defined network using the OpenFlow protocol. We begin by defining a quantum physical layer QPHY within the classical network stack to express the quantum communications channel and we then describe how OpenFlow management of classical optical channels is compatible with emerging quantum communication protocols. We next give an example specification of the metadata needed to manage and control QPHY behavior and we extend the OpenFlow interface to accommodate this quantum metadata. We conclude by discussing near-term experimental efforts that can realize SDN's principles for quantum communication.

We employ state tomography to study the performance of this protocol, and we demonstrate fidelities greater than 0.98.

By making use of the tunable phonon-spin interaction and the engineered phonon-phonon tunneling, both the desired excitation transfer process and the optimal two-mode squeezing between spin ensembles can be realized. We investigate the dynamics of the total system under infulences from the mechanical decay using both analytical and numerical methods, where the realistic conditions that leads to optimized squeezing between spin ensembles are analyzed.

abstract: In the weak measurement (WM) scenario involving weak interaction and postselection by projective measurement, the empirical significance of weak values is manifested in terms of shifts in the measurement pointer's mean position and mean momentum, the quantitative formulation of which was given by R. Jozsa [Phys. Rev. A 76, 044103 (2007)]. In this context, a general treatment is presented in this paper by taking into account the hitherto unexplored effect of correlations among the pointer degrees of freedom which pertain to an arbitrary multidimensional preselected pointer state. This leads to an extension of Jozsa's result, showing that, for complex weak values, the correlations among different pointer degrees of freedom can crucially affect the way the imaginary parts of the weak values are related to the observed shifts of the mean pointer position and momentum. The particular relevance of this analysis is discussed in the case of sequential weak interactions, followed by a postselection (called sequential WM) which, in the special case, reduces to the usual WM scheme involving a single weak interaction and postseletion, modified by the effect of pointer state correlations.

We review the basics of these models and focus on the dynamics induced by off-resonant zero-area pulses by using a Sech-Tanh pulse model as an example. We show that the final transition probability for this model is described accurately by the Dykhne-Davis-Pechukas approach for certain parameter regions. Finally, we note the potential of such zero area pulse models in quantum control and quantum information.

abstract: Bath-induced correlations in an infinite dimension Hilbert space has been shown. Quantum correlations between two free spinless dissipative distinguishable particles (initially uncorrelated) are studied analytically using the quantum master equation. We show that for temperature $T>0$ the time-evolution of the reduced density matrix cannot be written as the direct product of two independent particles. We found a time-scale that characterizes the time when the bath-induced correlation is maximum before being wipe out by dissipation (purity, spatial, and mirror correlations are studied). We introduce a Wigner function associated to the Wannier lattice where the dissipative quantum walks move. Thus we discuss the peculiarities of the scenario of enlarging the lattice to the semi-integers in order to fulfilll all the fundamental properties of the Wigner function. We have supported the quantum character of the correlations by analyzing the negativity of the Wigner function.

abstract: The long lasting discussion on the completeness of quantum theory (QT) has not yet come to an end. The discussion is impeded by the lack of a clear understanding of what makes up the contents of a theory of physics in general and of QT specifically. After such an understanding has been developed, a more precise definition of global properties, such as the completeness, computability, and extensibility of a theory, is possible and necessary. This paper addresses these subjects for theories of physics and, in particular, for QT. The basis for the definition of the completeness of a theory is the proposed definition of a "formal causal model of a physical theory". The formal model can be applied to discussions of general attributes, such as completeness, computability, and extensibility.

abstract: We determine the optimal parameters for a simple and efficient scheme of dispersive readout of a qubit. Depending on the qubit state (ground or excited), the resonance of a cavity is shifted either to the red or to the blue side. Qubit state is inferred by detecting the photon number transmitted through the cavity. It turns out that this kind of detection provides better measurement fidelity than the detection of the presence or absence of photons only. We show that radiating the cavity on either of the frequencies it shifts to results in a suboptimal measurement. The optimal frequency of the probe photons is determined, as well as the optimal ratio of the shift to the resonator leakage. It is shown that to maximize the fidelity of a long-lasting measurement, it is sufficient to use the parameters optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio in the photon count. One can reach 99% fidelity for a single-shot measurement in various physical realizations of the scheme.

abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of exciton transfer and decoherence effects in a photosynthetic dimer interacting with collective (correlated) and local (uncorrelated) protein-solvent environments. Our approach is based on the framework of the spin-boson model. We derive explicitly the thermal relaxation and decoherence rates of the exciton transfer process, valid for arbitrary temperatures and for arbitrary (in particular, large) interaction constants between the dimer and the environments. We establish a generalization of the Marcus formula, giving reaction rates for dimer levels possibly individually and asymmetrically coupled to environments. We identify rigorously parameter regimes for the validity of the generalized Marcus formula. The existence of long living quantum coherences at ambient temperatures emerges naturally from our approach.

abstract: We theoretically introduce a new kind of non-Gaussian state-----Laguerre polynomial excited coherent states by using the multiphoton catalysis which actually can be considered as a block comprising photon number operator. It is found that the normalized factor is related to the two-variable Hermite polynomials. We then investigate the nonclassical properties in terms of Mandel's Q parameter, quadrature squeezing, second correlation, and the negativity of Wigner function (WF). It is shown that all these properties are related to the amplitude of coherent state, catalysis number and unbalanced beam splitter (BS). In particular, the maximum degree of squeezing can be enhanced as catalysis number and keeps a constant for single-photon catalysis. In addition, we examine the effect of decoherence by Wigner function, which show that the negative region, characteristic time of decoherence and structure of WF are affected by catalysis number and unbalanced BS. Our work provides a general analysis about how to prepare theoretically polynomials quantum states.

abstract: The problems of genuine multipartite entanglement detection and classification are challenging. We show that a multipartite quantum state is genuine multipartite entangled if the multipartite concurrence is larger than certain quantities given by the number and the dimension of the subsystems. This result also provides a classification of various genuine multipartite entanglement. Then, we present a lower bound of the multipartite concurrence in terms of bipartite concurrences. While various operational approaches are available for providing lower bounds of bipartite concurrences, our results give an effective operational way to detect and classify the genuine multipartite entanglement. As applications, the genuine multipartite entanglement of tripartite systems is analyzed in detail.

abstract: We investigate the nonlocality distributions among multiqubit systems based on the maximal violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality of reduced pairwise qubit systems. We present a trade-off relation satisfied by these maximal violations, which gives rise to restrictions on the distribution of nonlocality among the subqubit systems. For a three-qubit system, it is impossible that all pairs of qubits violate the CHSH inequality, and once a pair of qubits violates the CHSH inequality maximally, the other two pairs of qubits must both obey the CHSH inequality. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the trade-off relations, and the trade-off relations are generalized to arbitrary multiqubit systems.

abstract: Recent tremendous development of quantum information theory led to a number of quantum technological projects, e.g., quantum random generators. This development stimulates a new wave of interest in quantum foundations. One of the most intriguing problems of quantum foundations is elaboration of a consistent and commonly accepted interpretation of quantum state. Closely related problem is clarification of the notion of quantum randomness and its interrelation with classical randomness. In this short review we shall discuss basics of classical theory of randomness (which by itself is very complex and characterized by diversity of approaches) and compare it with irreducible quantum randomness. The second part of this review is devoted to the information interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) in the spirit of Zeilinger and Brukner (and QBism of Fuchs et al.) and physics in general (e.g., Wheeler's "it from bit") as well as digital philosophy of Chaitin (with historical coupling to ideas of Leibnitz). Finally, we continue discussion on interrelation of quantum and classical randomness and information interpretation of QM.

abstract: Interacting one-dimensional quantum systems play a special role among few- and many-body models as exact solutions can be obtained for the homogenous case using the Bethe ansatz and bosonization techniques. Unfortunately, these approaches are not applicable when external confinement is present unless some variation of the local density approximation is employed. Recent theoretical advances beyond the Bethe ansatz and bosonization allow us to predict the behavior of one-dimensional confined quantum systems with strong short-range interactions, and new experiments with cold atomic Fermi gases have already confirmed these theories. Here we demonstrate that a simple linear combination of the strongly interacting solution with the well-known solution in the limit of vanishing interactions provides a simple and accurate description of the system for all values of the interaction strength. This indicates that one can indeed capture the physics of confined one-dimensional systems by knowledge of the limits using wave functions that are much easier to handle than the output of typical numerical approaches. We demonstrate our scheme for experimentally relevant systems with up to six particles. Moreover, we show that our method works also in the case of mixed systems of particles with different masses. This is an important feature because these systems are known to be non-integrable and thus not solvable by the Bethe ansatz technique.

abstract: We {\it analytically} investigate the population and coherence dynamics and relaxations in the vibrational energy transport in molecules. The corresponding two time scales $t_1$ and $t_2$ are explored. Coherence-population entanglement is found to considerably promote the time scale $t_2$ for dephasing and the amplitude of coherence. This is attributed to the suppression of the environment-induced drift force by coherence. Moreover the population imbalance (magnetization) is shown to be significantly amplified with the coherence-population entanglement. Contrary to the previous studies, we exactly elucidate a coherent process by showing $t_1<t_2$. We predict the relaxation of vibrational and orientational dynamics of OH-stretching modes in agreement with the recent experiments, when applied to the water molecules dissolved in D$_2$O. Finally we explore the coherence effect on the heat current at the macroscopic level.

abstract: The subject of optomechanics involves interactions between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom, and is currently of great interest as an enabler of fundamental investigations in quantum mechanics, as well as a platform for ultrasensitive measurement devices. The majority of optomechanical configurations rely on the exchange of linear momentum between light and matter. We will begin this tutorial with a brief description of such systems. Subsequently, we will introduce optomechanical systems based on angular momentum exchange. In this context, optical fields carrying polarization and orbital angular momentum will be considered, while for the mechanics, torsional and free rotational motion will be of relevance. Our overall aims will be to supply basic analyses of some of the existing theoretical proposals, to provide functional descriptions of some of the experiments conducted thus far, and to consider some directions for future research. We hope this tutorial will be useful to both theorists and experimentalists interested in the subject.

abstract: A quantitative analysis of continuity of the quantum mutual information and of the Holevo quantity is presented. First we obtain Fannes type and Winter type tight continuity bounds for the quantum mutual information and their specifications for qc-states. Then we show that the Holevo quantity is continuous on the set of all ensembles of m states if and only if either m or the dimension of underlying Hilbert space is finite and obtain Fannes type tight continuity bounds for the Holevo quantity in this case. In general case we prove conditions for local continuity of the Holevo quantity and consider their corollaries (preserving of local continuity under quantum channels, stability with respect to perturbation of states). Winter's type tight continuity bounds for the Holevo quantity under the energy constraint on the average state of ensembles is obtained and applied to the system of finite number of quantum oscillators.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.09081
abstract: An interferometer - no matter how clever the design - cannot allow the experimenter to see both the wave and particle behavior of a quantum system. This fundamental idea has been captured quantitatively by inequalities, so-called wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs), that upper bound the sum of the path distinguishability (particle behavior) and fringe visibility (wave behavior). Another fundamental quantum concept is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, stating that some pairs of observables cannot be known simultaneously. The distinction between these two concepts has been debated in the literature. Here we provide closure to the debate by showing that WPDRs correspond to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle, namely, the uncertainty relation for the min- and max-entropies, which is used in quantum cryptography. At the technical level, our unification relies on a novel operational meaning for the max-entropy in terms of the guessing probability. Furthermore, our unification provides a framework for solving an outstanding problem of how to rigorously prove WPDRs for interferometers with more than two paths, and we employ this framework to derive some novel WPDRs.

abstract: In the Entropic Dynamics (ED) derivation of the Schroedinger equation the physical input is introduced through constraints that are implemented using Lagrange multipliers. There is one constraint involving a "drift" potential that correlates the motions of different particles and is ultimately responsible for entanglement. The purpose of this work is to deepen our understanding of the corresponding multiplier. Its main effect is to control the strength of the drift relative to the fluctuations. We show that ED exhibits a symmetry: models with different values of the multiplier can lead to the same Schroedinger equation; different "microscopic" or sub-quantum models lead to the same "macroscopic" or quantum behavior. As the multiplier tends to infinity the drift prevails over the fluctuations and the particles tend to move along the smooth probability flow lines. Thus ED includes the causal or Bohmian form of quantum mechanics as a special limiting case.

abstract: Understanding the dynamics of higher-dimensional quantum systems embedded in a complex environment remains a significant theoretical challenge. While several approaches yielding numerically converged solutions exist, these are computationally expensive and often provide only limited physical insight. Here we address the question when more intuitive and simpler to compute weak-coupling approaches still provide adequate accuracy. We develop a simple analytical criterion and verify its validity for the case of the much-studied FMO dynamics as well as the canonical spin-boson model.

abstract: We propose an entanglement purification scheme based on material qubits and ancillary coherent multiphoton states. We consider a typical QED scenario where material qubits implemented by two-level atoms fly sequentially through a cavity and interact resonantly with a single-mode of the radiation field. We explore the theoretical possibilities of realizing a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum operation necessary for the purification protocol with the help of a postselective balanced homodyne photodetection. We demonstrate that the obtained probabilistic quantum operation can be used as a bilateral operation in the proposed purification scheme. It is shown that the probabilistic nature of this quantum operation is counterbalanced in the last step of the scheme where qubits are not discarded after inadequate qubit measurements. As this protocol requires present-day experimental setups and generates high fidelity entangled pairs with high repetition rates, it may offer interesting perspectives for applications in quantum information theory.

abstract: We analyze a coupling scheme for qubits in different cavities of circuit-QED architecture. In contrast to the usual scheme where the cavities are coupled by an interface capacitance we employ a bridge qubit connecting cavities to mediate two-qubit coupling. This active coupling scheme makes it possible to switch on/off and adjust the strength of qubit-qubit coupling, which is essential for scalability of quantum circuit. By transforming the Hamiltonian we obtain an exact expression of two-qubit coupling in the rotating-wave approximation. For the general case of $n$ qubits the Hamiltonian can produce the W state as an eigenstate of the system. We calculate the decay rate of the coupled qubit-resonator system to find that it is viable in real experiments.

abstract: We study the computational complexity of certain integrable quantum theories in 1+1 dimensions. We formalize a model of quantum computation based on these theories. In this model, distinguishable particles start out with known momenta and initial superposition of different configurations. Then the label of these particles are measured at the end. We prove that additive approximation to single amplitudes of these models can be obtained by the one-clean-qubit model, if no initial superpositions are allowed. However, if arbitrary initial states and non-adaptive intermediate measurements are allowed, we show that conditioned on infinite polynomial hierarchy assumption it is hard to sample from the output distribution of these models on a classical randomized computer. A classical analogue of this model is also formalized and its computational power is pinned down within the complexity classes below BPP and NP.

abstract: We comment on the investigation of the connection between chaos and dynamically generated entanglement in Phys. Rev. E, \textbf{83}, 016207, (2011). While, in the referred paper, the authors give an explicit example of a state initially localized in the regular region and still has entanglement properties similar to the states localized in the chaotic region, a few clarifications related to previous works are in order. Firstly, it is crucial to point out that such a behavior can occur for states initially localized near the border between the chaotic region and regular island, which seems to be the case in the example provided in the referred paper. We comment on the time evolution of such states and the extent to which these can be regarded as having "regular dynamics". Secondly, the degree to which entanglement is correlated with the chaos in the system is better understood when we analyze the same initial state and increase the chaoticity in the system gradually. We also discuss in what capacity entanglement can be regarded as a signature of chaos in such studies.

abstract: The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defect in diamond is a unique quantum system that offers precision sensing of nanoscale physical quantities beyond the current state-of-the-art. Here we present a method to controllably encode the interactions in the population of the spin states, thereby introducing a way to control the sensitivity of a single spin as a continuum in contrast to free-evolution based methods. By adopting this feature we demonstrate high-accuracy NV magnetometry without 2pi ambiguities, enhance the dynamic range by a factor of 4*10^3 achieve interaction times exceeding 2 ms in off-the-shelf diamond. We perform nuclear spin-noise spectroscopy in the frequency domain by dynamically controlling the NV spin's sensitivity piecewise and in a smooth manner thereby precluding harmonic artefacts and undesired interactions. On a broader perspective dynamical sensitivity control provides an elegant handle on the inherent dynamics of quantum systems, while offering decisive advantages for NV centre applications notably in quantum controls and single molecule NMR/MRI.

abstract: Quantum coin tossing (QCT) is an important primitive of quantum cryptography and has received continuous interest. However, in practical QCT, Bob's detectors can be subjected to detector-side channel attacks launched by dishonest Alice, which will possibly make the protocol completely insecure. Here, we report a simple strategy of a detector-blinding attack based on a recent experiment. To remove all the detector side channels, we present a solution of measurement-device-independent QCT (MDI-QCT). This method is similar to the idea of MDI quantum key distribution (QKD). MDI-QCT is loss tolerant with single-photon sources and has the same bias as the original loss-tolerant QCT under a coherent attack. Moreover, it provides the potential advantage of doubling the secure distance for some special cases. Finally, MDI-QCT can also be modified to fit the weak coherent-state sources. Thus, based on the rapid development of practical MDI-QKD, our proposal can be implemented easily.

abstract: We report on the first realization of an integrated optical memory for light based on a laser written waveguide in a doped crystal. Using femto-second laser micromachining, we fabricate waveguides in Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. We demonstrate that the waveguide inscription does not affect the coherence properties of the material and that the light confinement in the waveguide increases the interaction with the active ions by a factor 6. We also demonstrate that, analogously to the bulk crystals, we can operate the optical pumping protocols necessary to prepare the population in atomic frequency combs, that we use to demonstrate light storage in excited and spin states of the Praseodymium ions. Our results represent the first realization of laser written waveguides in a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal and the first implementation of an integrated on-demand spin wave optical memory. They open new perspectives for integrated quantum memories.

abstract: We investigate the problem of a decomposition of a dissipative dynamical map, which is used in quantum dynamics of a finite open quantum system, into two distinct types of mapping on a Hilbert-Schmidt space of quantum states represented by density matrices. One type corresponds to reversible behaviours, while the other to irreversible characteristics. For a finite dimensional system, in which one can equip the state-observable system by a complex matrix space, we employ real vectors or Bloch representations and express a map on the state space as a real matrix acting on the representation. It is found that rotation and scaling transformations on the real vector space, obtained from the orthogonal-symmetric or the real-polar decomposition, behave as building blocks for a dynamical map. We introduce an additional parameter of the dynamics together with the time parameter. This assertion is reduced to a scaling parameter in the scaling part of the dynamical matrix as a function in time $t$, making the dynamical map be a one-parameter map. Specifically, for the Lindblad-type dynamical map, in which the dynamical map forms a one-parameter semigroup satisfying the complete positivity condition, normal condition and Makovianity, we interpret the conditions on the Lindblad map in our framework. As results, we find that the change of linear entropy or purity, which we use it as an indicator of dissipative behaviours, is increasing in time and possesses an asymptote expected in thermodynamics. The rate of change of the linear entropy depends on the structure of the scaling part of the dynamical matrix. Moreover, the initial state plays an important role in this change. The issues on initial dependence of dissipative behaviours and the role of eigensubspace partitioning of the dynamical matrix are discussed, and an example on a qubit system is illustrated.

abstract: In this paper we present a quantum annealing algorithm for computation of homology of large point clouds. It is designed to work on resizable cloud computing platforms. The algorithm takes as input a witness complex K approximating the given point cloud. It uses quantum annealing to compute a clique cover of the 1-skeleton of K and then uses this cover to blow up K into a Mayer-Vietoris complex. Finally, it computes the homology of the Mayer-Vietoris complex in parallel. The novelty here is the use of clique covering which, compared to graph partitioning, substantially reduces the computational load assigned to each slave machine in the computing cluster. We describe two different clique covers and their quantum annealing formulation in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO).

abstract: Recent technological advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) are paving the way to utilise multiple quantum emitters confined in a single optical cavity. In such systems it is crucially important to control the quantum mechanical coupling of individual emitters to the cavity mode. In this regard, combining ion trap technologies with CQED provides a particularly promising approach due to the well-established motional control over trapped ions. Here we experimentally demonstrate coupling of up to five trapped ions in a string to a high-finesse optical cavity. By changing the axial position and spacing of the ions in a fully deterministic manner, we systematically characterise their coupling to the cavity mode through visibility measurements of the cavity emission. In good agreement with the theoretical model, the results demonstrate that the geometrical configuration of multiple trapped ions can be manipulated to obtain optimal cavity coupling. Our system presents a new ground to explore CQED with multiple quantum emitters, enabled by the highly controllable collective light-matter interaction.

Further, we examine the functional dependence of the entanglement entropy on the coupling and number of colors in the theory. Our results display non-peturbative behavior. It is shown that the entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing and convex with respect to the coupling. We also show how the behavior of the entanglement entropy under renormalization group transformations is related to the beta function of the Gross-Neveu model, and compare these renormalization group results to our previous work on interacting scalar field theories.

abstract: Contextuality, the impossibility of assigning a single random variable to represent the outcomes of the same measurement procedure under different experimental conditions, is a central aspect of quantum mechanics. Thus defined, it appears in well-known cases in quantum mechanics, such as the double-slit experiment, the Bell-EPR experiment, and the Kochen-Specker theorem. Here we examine contextuality in such cases, and discuss how each of them bring different conceptual issues when applied to quantum cognition. We then focus on the shortcomings of using quantum probabilities to describe social systems, and explain how negative quasi-probability distributions may address such limitations.

abstract: Superoscillatory wave forms, i.e., waves that locally oscillate faster than their highest Fourier component, possess unusual properties that make them of great interest from quantum mechanics to signal processing. However, the more pronounced the desired superoscillatory behavior is to be, the more difficult it becomes to produce, or even only calculate, such highly fine-tuned wave forms in practice. Here, we investigate how this sensitivity to preparation errors scales for a method for constructing superoscillatory functions which is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the energetic expense. We thereby also arrive at very accurate approximations of functions which are so highly superoscillatory that they cannot be calculated numerically. We then investigate to what extent the scaling and sensitivity results for superoscillatory functions on the real line extend to the experimentally important case of superoscillatory functions that are periodic.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.00232
abstract: We study the decay law for a moving unstable particle. The usual time-dilatation formula states that the decay width for an unstable state moving with a momentum $p$ and mass $M$ is $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}=\Gamma M/\sqrt{p^{2}+M^{2}}$ with $\Gamma$ being the decay width in the rest frame. In agreement with previous studies, we show that in the context of QM as well as QFT this equation is \textit{not} correct provided that the quantum measurement is performed in a reference frame in which the unstable particle has momentum $p$ (note, a momentum eigenstate is \textit{not} a velocity eigenstate in QM). We then give, to our knowledge for the first time, an analytic expression of an improved formula and we show that the deviation from $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}$ has a maximum for $p/M=\sqrt{2/3},$ but is typically \textit{very} small. Then, the result can be easily generalized to a momentum wave packet. As a next step, we show that care is needed when one makes a boost of an unstable state with zero momentum/velocity: namely, the resulting state has zero overlap with the elements of the basis of unstable states (it is already decayed!). However, when considering a spread in velocity, one finds again that $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}$ is typically a very good approximation. In the end, it should be stressed that there is no whatsoever breaking of special relativity, but as usual in QM, one should specify which kind of measurement on which kind of state is performed.

abstract: Quantum correlations present in a broadband two-line squeezed microwave state can induce entanglement in a spatially separated bipartite system consisting of either two single qubits or two qubit ensembles. By using an appropriate master equation for a bipartite quantum system in contact with two separate but entangled baths, the generating entanglement process in spatially separated quantum systems is thoroughly characterized. Our results provide evidence that this entanglement transfer by dissipation is feasible yielding to a steady-state amount of entanglement in the bipartite quantum system which can be optimized for a wide range of realistic physical systems that include state-of-the-art experiments with NV centers in diamond, superconducting qubits or even magnetic molecules embedded in a crystalline matrix.

abstract: We realize a single particle microscope by using deterministically extracted laser cooled $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions from a Paul trap as probe particles for transmission imaging. We demonstrate focusing of the ions with a resolution of 5.8$\;\pm\;$1.0$\,$nm and a minimum two-sample deviation of the beam position of 1.5$\,$nm in the focal plane. The deterministic source, even when used in combination with an imperfect detector, gives rise to much higher signal to noise ratios as compared with conventional Poissonian sources. Gating of the detector signal by the extraction event suppresses dark counts by 6 orders of magnitude. We implement a Bayes experimental design approach to microscopy in order to maximize the gain in spatial information. We demonstrate this method by determining the position of a 1$\,\mu$m circular hole structure to an accuracy of 2.7$\,$nm using only 579 probe particles.

In our proof-of-principle experiment a non-linear process of four-wave mixing in an open-loop configuration is used to achieve light emission proportional to independently prepared ground-state atomic coherence. We demonstrate strong correlations between Raman light heralding generation of ground-state coherence and the new four-wave mixing signal. Dependance of the efficiency of the process on laser detunings is studied.

abstract: Hamiltonian Mechanics works for conserved systems and Quantum Mechanics is given in Hamiltonian language. It is considered that complexifying the quantum Hamiltonian, a balanced loss and gain model can be created. The usual mathematics of density operator formalism and entanglement is extrapolated to such systems and the consequences are studied. Namely, a complete formalism using Density operators is created for real eigenvalue regime of these Non- Hermitian systems and correct forms of Von-Neumann and Entanglement Entropy are created. The consequences are studied in this regime and depicted w.r.t recent papers by [9, 20].

abstract: The radical-pair mechanism was introduced in the 1960's to explain anomalously large EPR and NMR signals in chemical reactions of organic molecules. It has evolved to the cornerstone of spin chemistry, the study of the effect electron and nuclear spins have on chemical reactions, with the avian magnetic compass mechanism and the photosynthetic reaction center dynamics being prominent biophysical manifestations of such effects. In recent years the radical-pair mechanism was shown to be an ideal biological system where the conceptual tools of quantum information science can be fruitfully applied. We will here review recent work making the case that the radical-pair mechanism is indeed a major driving force of the emerging field of quantum biology.

abstract: We study novel types of contributions to the partition function of the Maxwell system defined on a small compact manifold. These contributions, often not addressed in the perturbative treatment with physical photons, emerge as a result of tunneling transitions between topologically distinct but physically identical vacuum winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to the Casimir pressure, yet to be measured. We argue that this effect is highly sensitive to a small external electric field, which should be contrasted with the conventional Casimir effect where the vacuum photons are essentially unaffected by any external field. Furthermore, photons will be emitted from the vacuum in response to a time-dependent electric field, similar to the dynamical Casimir effect in which real particles are radiated from the vacuum due to the time-dependent boundary conditions. We also propose an experimental setup using a quantum LC circuit to detect this novel effect. We expect physical electric charges to appear on the capacitor plates when the system dimension is such that coherent Aharonov-Bohm phases can be maintained over macroscopically large distances.

abstract: Photons may have homogeneous polarization and may carry quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Photon entanglement has been realized in various degrees of freedom such as polarization and OAM. Using a pair of orthogonally polarized states carrying opposite-handedness quantized OAMs could create "quantized" vector polarization states with space-variant polarization structures. It is thus possible to extend the polarization degree of freedom from two dimensional space to indefinite dimensional discrete Hilbert space. We present a class of vector-polarization entangled Bell states, which use the spatial modes of the vector fields with space-variant polarization structure. We propose a scheme of creating the vector-polarization entangled Bell states using a Sagnac interferometer. We also design an analyzer for identifying the vector-polarization entangled Bell states. Such a class of entanglement is important for quantum information science and technology, and fundamental issues of quantum theory, due to its advantage of the increase in information capacity.

abstract: The broadening of lines by Stark effect is an important tool for inferring electron density and temperature in plasmas. Stark-effect calculations often rely on atomic data (transition rates, energy levels,...) not always exhaustive and/or valid for isolated atoms. We present a recent development in the detailed opacity code SCO-RCG for K-shell spectroscopy (hydrogen- and helium-like ions). This approach is adapted from the work of Gilles and Peyrusse. Neglecting non-diagonal terms in dipolar and collision operators, the line profile is expressed as a sum of Voigt functions associated to the Stark components. The formalism relies on the use of parabolic coordinates within SO(4) symmetry. The relativistic fine-structure of Lyman lines is included by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix associated to quantum states having the same principal quantum number $n$. The resulting code enables one to investigate plasma environment effects, the impact of the microfield distribution, the decoupling between electron and ion temperatures and the role of satellite lines (such as Li-like $1sn\ell n'\ell' - 1s^2n\ell$, Be-like, etc.). Comparisons with simpler and widely-used semi-empirical models are presented.

abstract: Two identical dipolar atoms moving in a harmonic trap without an external magnetic field are investigated. Using the algebra of angular momentum a semi - analytical solutions are found. We show that the internal spin - spin interactions between the atoms couple to the orbital angular momentum causing an analogue of Einstein - de Haas effect. We show a possibility of adiabatically pumping our system from the s-wave to the d-wave relative motion. The effective spin-orbit coupling occurs at anti-crossings of the energy levels.

abstract: Interacting quantum many-body systems constitute a fascinating playground for researchers since they form quantum liquids with correlated ground states and low-lying excitations, which exhibit universal behaviour. In fermionic systems, such quantum liquids are realized in helium-3 liquid, heavy fermion systems, neutron stars and cold gases. Their properties in the linear-response regime have been successfully described by the theory of Fermi liquids. However, non-equilibrium properties beyond this regime have still to be established and remain a key issue of many-body physics. Here, we show a precise experimental demonstration of Landau Fermi-liquid theory extended to the non-equilibrium regime in a 0-D system. Combining transport and ultra-sensitive current noise measurements, we have unambiguously identified the SU(2) and SU(4) symmetries of quantum liquid in a carbon nanotube tuned in the universal Kondo regime. We find that, while the electronic transport is well described by the free quasi-particle picture around equilibrium, a two-particle scattering process due to residual interaction shows up in the non-equilibrium regime. By using the extended Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain the interaction parameter "Wilson ratio" $R=1.9 \pm 0.1$ for SU(2) and $R=1.35 \pm 0.1$ for SU(4) as well as the corresponding effective charges, characterizing the quantum liquid behaviour. This result, in perfect agreement with theory, provides a strong quantitative experimental background for further developments of the many-body physics. Moreover, we discovered a new scaling law for the effective charge, signalling as-yet-unknown universality in the non-equilibrium regime. Our method to address quantum liquids through their non-equilibrium noise paves a new road to tackle the exotic nature of quantum liquids out-of-equilibrium in various physical systems.

abstract: We consider the interaction of hydrogen-like atoms with a strong laser field and show that the strong field approximation and all its variants may be grouped into a set of families of approximation schemes. This is done by introducing an ansatz describing the electron wave packet as the sum of the initial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the perturbative solution in the Coulomb potential of an inhomogeneous time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. It is the phase factor that characterizes a given family. In each of these families, the velocity and length gauge version of the approximation scheme lead to the same results at each order in the Coulomb potential. By contrast, irrespective of the gauge, approximation schemes belonging to different families give different results. Furthermore, this new formulation of the strong field approximations allows us to gain deeper insight into the validity of the strong field approximation schemes. In particular, we address two important questions: the role of the Coulomb potential in the output channel and the convergence of the perturbative series in the Coulomb potential. In all the physical situations we consider here, our results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: We study nonequilibrium dynamics of the quantum Ising chain at zero temperature when the transverse field is varied stochastically. In the equivalent fermion representation, the equation of motion of Majorana operators is derived in the form of a one-dimensional, continuous-time quantum random walk with stochastic, time-dependent transition amplitudes. This type of external noise gives rise to decoherence in the associated quantum walk and the semiclassical wave-packet generally has a diffusive behavior. As a consequence, in the quantum Ising chain, the average entanglement entropy grows in time as $t^{1/2}$ and the logarithmic average magnetization decays in the same form. In the case of a dichotomous noise, when the transverse-field is changed in discrete time-steps, $\tau$, there can be excitation modes, for which coherence is maintained, provided their energy satisfies $\epsilon_k \tau\approx n\pi$ with a positive integer $n$. If the dispersion of $\epsilon_k$ is quadratic, the long-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic magnetization is dominated by these ballistically traveling coherent modes and both will have a $t^{3/4}$ time-dependence.

abstract: We study the stabilisation of quantum system on a subspace through reservoir engi- neering provided the system is continuously monitored. We show that the target subspace is almost surely invariant if and only if it is invariant for the average evolution. We show the same equivalence for the global asymptotic stabilisation towards the target subspace. We moreover prove a converse Lyapunov theorem for the average evolution. From this theorem we derive sharp bounds on the Lyapunov exponents. We show that taking into account the measurements can lead to a stability rate improvement. We discuss explicit situations where the almost sure stability rate can be made arbitrary large while the average one stays constant.

abstract: We use the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) as an efficient tool to fully characterize the Abelian phase of a Z2 * Z2 spin liquid emerging as the ground state of topological color code (TCC), which is a class of stabilizer states on the honeycomb lattice. We extract the TEE from Renyi entanglement entropy (EE) of the TCC, analytically and numerically by finite size exact diagonalization on the disk shape regions with contractible boundaries. We obtain that the EE has a local contribution, which scales linearly with the boundary length in addition to a topological term, i.e. the TEE, arising from the condensation of closed strings in the ground state. We further show that, in spite of the lack of a local order parameter, TEE and other physical quantities obtained from ground state wave function such as entanglement spectrum (ES) and ground state fidelity are sensitive probes to study the robustness of a topological phase. We find that the topological order in the presence of a magnetic field persists until the vicinity of the transition point, where the TEE and fidelity drops to zero and the ES splits severely, signaling breakdown of the topological phase of the TCC. Eventually, we investigate the ground state dependence of the TEE by cutting the torus to half cylinders, from which we further identify multiple independent minimum entropy states (MES) of the TCC and then extract the U and S modular matrices of the system, which contain the self and mutual statistics of the anyonic QPs and fully characterize the topological phase of the TCC.

abstract: We study the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard model, describing strongly correlated bosons on a lattice. The use of a controlled approximation - the slave-boson approach - allows us to study entanglement in all regimes of the model (and, most importantly, across its superfluid/Mott-insulator transition) at a minimal cost. We find that the area-law scaling of entanglement -- verified in all the phases -- exhibits a sharp singularity at the transition. The singularity is greatly enhanced when the transition is crossed at fixed, integer filling, due to a richer entanglement spectrum containing an additional gapless mode, which descends from the amplitude (Higgs) mode of the global excitation spectrum -- while this mode remains gapped at the generic (commensurate-incommensurate) transition with variable filling. Hence the entanglement properties contain a unique signature of the two different forms of bosonic criticality exhibited by the Bose-Hubbard model.

abstract: Known methods for transverse confinement and guidance of light can be grouped into a few basic mechanisms, the most common being metallic reflection, total internal reflection and photonic-bandgap (or Bragg) reflection. All of them essentially rely on changes of the refractive index, that is on scalar properties of light. Recently, processes based on "geometric Berry phases", such as manipulation of polarization states or deflection of spinning-light rays, have attracted considerable interest in the contexts of singular optics and structured light. Here, we disclose a new approach to light waveguiding, using geometric Berry phases and exploiting polarization states and their handling. This can be realized in structured three-dimensional anisotropic media, in which the optic axis lies orthogonal to the propagation direction and is modulated along it and across the transverse plane, so that the refractive index remains constant but a phase distortion can be imposed on a beam. In addition to a complete theoretical analysis with numerical simulations, we present a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of this effect in a discrete element implementation of a geometric phase waveguide. The mechanism we introduce shows that spin-orbit optical interactions can play an important role in integrated optics and paves the way to an entire new class of photonic systems that exploit the vectorial nature of light.

We use exact diagonalization to study the collective state preservation and the eigenstate entanglement structure as a function of both disorder strength and interaction range. Our numerical results, using the same system sizes as the experiment, verify the observation of many-body localization reported in the recent quantum simulation experiment.

abstract: We consider an implementation of the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb experiment in a DC-biased electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a leakage port on one of its arms playing the role of a "lousy bom". Many-body correlations tend to screen out manifestations of interaction-free measurement. Analyzing the correlations between the current at the interformeter's drains and at the leakage port, we identify the limit where the originally proposed single-particle effect is recovered. Specifically, we find that in the regime of sufficiently diluted injected electron beam and short measurement times, effects of quantum mechanical wave-particle duality emerge in the cross-current correlations.

abstract: High finesse frequency combs (HFC) with large ratio of the frequency spacing to the width of the spectral components have demonstrated remarkable results in many applications such as precision spectroscopy and metrology. We found that low finesse frequency combs having very small ratio of the frequency spacing to the width of the spectral components are more sensitive to the exact resonance with absorber than HFC. Our method is based on time domain measurements reviling oscillations of the radiation intensity after passing through an optically thick absorber. Fourier analysis of the oscillations allows to reconstruct the spectral content of the comb. If the central component of the incident comb is in exact resonance with the single line absorber, the contribution of the first sideband frequency into oscillations is exactly zero. We demonstrate this technique with gamma-photon absorbtion by M\"{o}ssbauer nuclei providing the spectral resolution beyond the natural broadening.

abstract: We present a method of locally inverting the sign of the coupling term in tight-binding systems, by means of inserting a judiciously designed ancillary site and eigenmode matching of the resulting vertex triplet. Our technique can be universally applied to all lattice configurations, as long as the individual sites can be detuned. We experimentally verify this method in laser-written photonic lattices and confirm both the magnitude and the sign of the coupling by interferometric measurements. Based on these findings, we demonstrate how such universal sign-flipped coupling links can be embedded into extended lattice structures to impose a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge transformation. This opens a new avenue for investigations on topological effects arising from magnetic fields with aperiodic flux patterns or in disordered systems.

abstract: We show a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic communication complexity and the logarithm of the partition number, which is essentially optimal. This improves upon a recent power 1.5 separation of G\"o\"os, Pitassi, and Watson (FOCS 2015). In query complexity, we establish a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic (and even randomized) query complexity and subcube partition complexity, which is also essentially optimal. We also establish a nearly power 1.5 separation between quantum query complexity and subcube partition complexity, the first superlinear separation between the two measures. Lastly, we show a quadratic separation between quantum query complexity and one-sided subcube partition complexity. Our query complexity separations use the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson, Ben-David, and the author. Our query functions are built up in stages by alternating function composition with the cheat sheet construction. The communication complexity separation follows from lifting the query separation to communication complexity.

abstract: Following the membrane paradigm, we explore the effect of the gravitational $\Theta$-term on the behavior of the stretched horizon of a black hole in (3+1)-dimensions. We reformulate the membrane paradigm from a quantum path-integral point of view where we interpret the macroscopic properties of the horizon as effects of integrating out the region inside the horizon. The gravitational $\Theta$-term is a total derivative, however, using our framework we show that this term affects the transport properties of the horizon. In particular, the horizon acquires a third order parity violating, dimensionless transport coefficient which affects the way localized perturbations scramble on the horizon. Then we consider a large-N gauge theory in (2+1)-dimensions which is dual to an asymptotically AdS background in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime to show that the $\Theta$-term induces a non-trivial contact term in the energy-momentum tensor of the dual theory. As a consequence, the dual gauge theory in the presence of the $\Theta$-term acquires the same third order parity violating transport coefficient.

abstract: A strongly driven quantum system, coupled to a thermalizing bath, generically evolves into a highly non-thermal state as the external drive competes with the equilibrating force of the bath. We demonstrate a notable exception to this picture for a microwave resonator interacting with a periodically driven double quantum dot (DQD). In the limit of strong driving and long times, we show that the resonator field can be driven into a thermal state with a chemical potential given by a harmonic of the drive frequency. Such tunable chemical potentials are achievable with current devices and would have broad utility for quantum simulation in circuit quantum electrodynamics. As an example, we show how several DQDs embedded in an array of microwave resonators can induce a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate of light.

abstract: We model and simulate the performance of charge-transfer in nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the CP29 light-harvesting antenna-complex associated with photosystem II (PSII). The model consists of five discrete excitonic energy states and two sinks, responsible for the potentially damaging processes and charge-transfer channels, respectively. We demonstrate that by varying (i) the parameters of the chlorophyll-based dimer, (ii) the resonant properties of the protein-solvent environment interaction, and (iii) the energy transfer rates to the sinks, one can significantly improve the performance of the NPQ. Our analysis suggests strategies for improving the performance of the NPQ in response to environmental changes, and may stimulate experimental verification.

It is proven that, in the case of a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the vacuum pressure onto the plates is positive and independent of the boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the plates.

abstract: In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the spontaneous generation of singularities in continue and finite wave functions, is a well understood phenomenon also occurring for free particles. We use the familiar analogy between the two-dimensional Schroedinger equation and the optical paraxial wave equation to define a new class of square-integrable paraxial optical fields which develop a spatial singularity in the focal point of a weakly-focusing thin lens. These fields are characterized by a single real parameter whose value determines the nature of the singularity in the focal point. This novel field enhancement mechanism can be a useful resource for numerous technological and scientific applications.

The switch's measured performance agrees well with simulations for input powers up to -100 dBm. An extension of the demonstrated circuit to implement a single-pole double-throw switch is shown in simulation.

abstract: Silicon chips hosting a single donor can be used to store and manipulate one bit of quantum information. However, a central challenge for realizing quantum logic operations is to couple donors to one another in a controllable way. To achieve this, several proposals rely on using nearby quantum dots (QDs) to mediate an interaction. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent coupling of electron spins between a single 31P donor and an enriched 28Si metal-oxide-semiconductor few-electron QD. We show that the electron-nuclear spin interaction on the donor can drive coherent rotations between singlet and triplet electron spin states of the QD-donor system. Moreover, we are able to tune electrically the exchange interaction between the QD and donor electrons. The combination of single-nucleus-driven rotations and voltage-tunable exchange provides every key element for future all-electrical control of spin qubits, while requiring only a single QD and no additional magnetic field gradients.

abstract: Via Gelfand duality, a unital C*-algebra induces a functor from compact Hausdorff spaces to sets. This encodes standard functional calculus as well as its multivariate generalization. The resulting functor $\mathsf{CHaus}\to\mathsf{Set}$ turns out to satisfy certain sheaf conditions, which generalizes functional calculus further. We prove that the "piecewise C*-algebras" of van den Berg and Heunen are equivalent to a full subcategory of the resulting category of sheaves, where a simple additional constraint characterizes the objects in the subcategory. It is open whether this additional constraint holds automatically, in which case piecewise C*-algebras would be equivalent to sheaves $\mathsf{CHaus}\to\mathsf{Set}$. Intuitively, these structures capture the commutative aspects of C*-algebra theory. In order to find a complete reaxiomatization of unital C*-algebras within this language, we introduce "almost C*-algebras" as piecewise C*-algebras equipped with a notion of inner automorphisms in terms of a self-action. We provide some evidence for the conjecture that the forgetful functor from unital C*-algebras to almost C*-algebras is fully faithful, and ask whether it is an equivalence of categories. We also develop an analogous notion of almost group, and prove that the forgetful functor from groups to almost groups is not full. In terms of quantum physics, our work can be seen as an attempt at a reconstruction of quantum theory from physically meaningful axioms, as realized by Hardy and others in a different framework. Our ideas are inspired by and also provide new input for the topos-theoretic approach to quantum theory.

abstract: In this work we study the behaviour of two weakly coupled quantum systems, described by a separable density operator; one of them is a single oscillator, representing a microscopic system, while the other is a set of oscillators which perform the role of a \emph{reservoir} in thermal equilibrium. From the Liouville-Von Neumann equation for the reduced density operator, we devise the master equation that governs the evolution of the microscopic system, incorporating the effects of temperature via Thermofield Dynamics formalism by suitably redefining the vacuum of the macroscopic system. As applications, we initially investigate the behaviour of a Fermi oscillator in the presence of a heat bath consisting of a set of Fermi oscillators and that of an atomic two-level system interacting with a scalar radiation field, considered as a \emph{reservoir}, by constructing the corresponding master equation which governs the time evolution of both sub-systems at finite temperature. Finally, we calculate the energy variation rates for the atom and the field, as well as the atomic population levels, both in the inertial case and at constant proper acceleration, considering the two-level system as a prototype of an Unruh detector, for admissible couplings of the radiation field.

abstract: We present a gauge-invariant effective action for the Abelian-Higgs model in 1+1 dimensions. It is constructed by integrating out the gauge field and then using the hopping parameter expansion. The latter is tested with Monte Carlo simulations for small values of the scalar self-coupling. In the opposite limit, at infinitely large self-coupling, the Higgs mode is frozen and the partition function can be written in terms of local tensors and the tensor renormalization group blocking can be applied. The numerical implementation requires truncations and the time continuum limit of the blocked transfer matrix can be obtained numerically. At zero gauge coupling and with a spin-1 truncation, the small volume energy spectrum is identical to the low energy spectrum of a two-species Bose-Hubbard model in the limit of large onsite repulsion. The procedure is extended to finite gauge coupling and we derive a spin-1 approximation of the Hamiltonian which involves terms corresponding to transitions among the two species in the Bose-Hubbard model. An optical lattice implementation involving a ladder structure is proposed.

abstract: Blackbody radiation contains (on average) an entropy of $3.9\pm2.5$ bits per photon. This applies not only to the proverbial case of "burning a lump of coal", but also to the Hawking radiation from both analogue black holes and general relativistic black holes. The flip side of this observation is the information budget: If the emission process is unitary, (as it certainly is for normal physical/chemical burning, and also for the Hawking emission from analogue black holes), then this entropy is exactly compensated by the "hidden information" in the correlations. We shall now extend this argument to the Hawking radiation from general relativistic black holes, (where previous discussion is both heated and inconclusive), demonstrating that the assumption of unitarity leads to a perfectly reasonable entropy/information budget without any hint of a "firewall". The assumption of unitarity instead has a different implication --- the horizon (if present) cannot be an *event* horizon, it must be an *apparent/trapping* horizon, or some variant thereof. The key technical aspect of our calculation is the "average subsystem" approach, but applied to a tripartite pure system consisting of the (black hole)+(Hawking radiation)+(rest of universe).

abstract: We give two conditionally exactly solvable inverse power law potentials whose linearly independent solutions include a sum of two confluent hypergeometric functions. We notice that they are partner potentials and multiplicative shape invariant. The method used to find the solutions works with the two Schrodinger equations of the partner potentials. Furthermore we study some of the properties of these potentials.

abstract: In this paper we shall use the algebraic method known as supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) to obtain solutions to the Painlev\'e V (PV) equation, a second-order non-linear ordinary differential equation. For this purpose, we will apply first the SUSY QM treatment to the radial oscillator. In addition, we will revisit the polynomial Heisenberg algebras (PHA) and we will study the general systems ruled by them: for first-order we obtain the radial oscillator and for third-order, the potential will be determined by solutions to the PV equation. This connection allows us to introduce a simple technique for generating solutions of the PV equation expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. Finally, we will classify them into several solution hierarchies.

abstract: We study the effect of dipolar interactions on the level of squeezing in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates by using the single mode approximation. We limit our consideration to the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie subalgebra spanned by spin operators. The biaxial nature of dipolar interactions allows for dynamical generation of spin-squeezed states in the system. We analyze the phase portraits in the reduced mean-filed space in order to determine positions of unstable fixed points. We calculate numerically spin squeezing parameter showing that it is possible to reach the strongest squeezing set by the two-axis countertwisting model. We partially explain scaling with the system size by using the Gaussian approach and the frozen spin approximation.

abstract: We report the direct observation of coupling between a single self-assembled InAs quantum dot and a wetting layer, based on strong diamagnetic shifts of many-body exciton states using magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy. An extremely large positive diamagnetic coefficient is observed when an electron in the wetting layer combines with a hole in the quantum dot; the coefficient is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of the exciton states confined in the quantum dots. Recombination of electrons with holes in a quantum dot of the coupled system leads to an unusual negative diamagnetic effect, which is five times stronger than that in a pure quantum dot system. This effect can be attributed to the expansion of the wavefunction of remaining electrons in the wetting layer or the spread of electrons in the excited states of the quantum dot to the wetting layer after recombination. In this case, the wavefunction extent of the final states in the quantum dot plane is much larger than that of the initial states because of the absence of holes in the quantum dot to attract electrons. The properties of emitted photons that depend on the large electron wavefunction extents in the wetting layer indicate that the coupling occurs between systems of different dimensionality, which is also verified from the results obtained by applying a magnetic field in different configurations. This study paves a new way to observe hybrid states with zero- and two-dimensional structures, which could be useful for investigating the Kondo physics and implementing spin-based solid-state quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum theory dictates that upon weakening the two-body interaction in a three-body system, an infinite number of three-body bound states of a huge spatial extent emerge just before these three-body states become unbound. Three helium atoms have been predicted to form a molecular system that manifests this peculiarity under natural conditions without artificial tuning of the attraction between particles by an external field. Here we report experimental observation of this long predicted but experimentally elusive Efimov state of $^{4}$He$_{3}$ by means of Coulomb explosion imaging. We show spatial images of an Efimov state, confirming the predicted size and a typical structure where two atoms are close to each other while the third is far away.

abstract: We postulate a principle stating that the initial condition of a physical system is typically algorithmically independent of the dynamical law. We argue that this links thermodynamics and causal inference. On the one hand, it entails behaviour that is similar to the usual arrow of time. On the other hand, it motivates a statistical asymmetry between cause and effect that has recently postulated in the field of causal inference, namely, that the probability distribution P(cause) contains no information about the conditional distribution P(effect|cause) and vice versa, while P(effect) may contain information about P(cause|effect).

abstract: The core momentum distribution of a weakly-bound neutron-neutron-core exotic nucleus is computed within a renormalized zero-range three-body model, with interactions in the s-wave channel. The halo wave-function in momentum space is obtained by using as inputs the two-body scattering lengths and the two-neutron separation energy. The core momentum densities are computed for $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C. The model describes the experimental data for $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be and to some extend $^{20}$C. The recoil momentum distribution of the $^{20}$C from the breakup of $^{22}$C nucleus is computed for different two-neutron separation energies, and from the comparison with recent experimental data the two-neutron separation energy is estimated in the range $100\lesssim S_{2n}\lesssim 400$ KeV. The recoil momentum distribution depends weakly on the neutron-$^{20}$C scattering length, while the matter radius is strongly sensitive to it. The expected universality of the momentum distribution width is verified by also considering excited states for the system.

abstract: Several quantum gravity scenarios lead to physics below the Planck scale characterised by nonlocal, Lorentz invariant equations of motion. We show that such non-local effective field theories lead to a modified Schr\"odinger evolution in the nonrelativistic limit. In particular, the nonlocal evolution of opto-mechanical quantum oscillators is characterised by a spontaneous periodic squeezing that cannot be generated by environmental effects. We discuss constraints on the nonlocality obtained by past experiments, and show how future experiments (already under construction) will either see such effects or otherwise cast severe bounds on the non-locality scale (well beyond the current limits set by the Large Hadron Collider). This paves the way for table top, high precision experiments on massive quantum objects as a promising new avenue for testing some quantum gravity phenomenology.

abstract: We discuss the van der Waals (Casimir) free energies and pressures of thin metallic films, consisting from one to fifteen atomic layers, with regard to the anisotropy in their dielectric properties. Both free-standing films and films deposited on a dielectric substrate are considered. The computations are performed for a Au film and a sapphire substrate. According to our results, for free-standing Au films consisting of one and three atomic layers the respective relative error arising from the use of an isotropic (bulk) dielectric permittivity is equal to 73% and 37% for the van der Waals energy, and 70% and 35% for the pressure. We tabulate the energy and pressure van der Waals coefficients of thin Au films computed with account of their anisotropy. It is shown that the bulk permittivity of Au can be used for the films consisting of more than 30 atomic layers, i.e., more than approximately 7 nm thickness. The role of relativistic effects is also investigated and shown to be important even for the films consisting of two or three layers. The obtained results can find applications in the investigation of stability of thin films and development of novel nanoscale devices.

abstract: We demonstrate the creation of entangled or spin-squeezed states using a joint measurement and real-time feedback. The pseudo-spin state of an ensemble of $N= 5\times 10^4$ laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms is deterministically driven to a specified population state with angular resolution that is a factor of 5.5(8) (7.4(6) dB) in variance below the standard quantum limit for unentangled atoms -- comparable to the best enhancements using only unitary evolution. Without feedback, conditioning on the outcome of the joint pre-measurement, we directly observe up to 59(8) times (17.7(6) dB) improvement in quantum phase variance relative to the standard quantum limit for $N=4\times 10^5$ atoms. This is the largest reported entanglement enhancement to date in any system.

abstract: We propose and analyze a simple mesoscopic quantum heat engine that exhibits both high-power and high-efficiency. The system consists of a biased Josephson junction coupled to two microwave cavities, with each cavity coupled to a thermal bath. Resonant Cooper pair tunnelling occurs with the exchange of photons between cavities, and a temperature difference between the baths can naturally lead to a current against the voltage, and hence work. As a consequence of the unique properties of Cooper-pair tunneling, the heat current is completely separated from the charge current. This combined with the strong energy-selectivity of the process leads to an extremely high efficiency.

abstract: In this paper we revisit the question that in what sense empty $AdS_{5}$ black brane geometry can be thought of as RG-flow. We do this by first constructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane geometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases monotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior of the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a thermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the temperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an entanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on infinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity of an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So this is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we expect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon goes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive to the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function should also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that high temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate $c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity. Negativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the theory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only. The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the paradigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact that the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the two facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of geometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature singularity.

We use this covariant expression for the Aharonov-Casher phase to investigate the case of a neutral particle with a non-zero magnetic moment moving in the {\it time dependent} electric and magnetic fields of a plane electromagnetic wave background. We focus on the case where the magnetic moment of the particle is oriented so that both the electric and magnetic field lead to non-zero phases, and we look at the interplay between these electric and magnetic phases.

abstract: Let random vectors $R^c=\{R_p^c:p\in P_c\}$ represent joint measurements of certain subsets $P_c$ of properties $p\in P$ in different contexts $c\in C$. Such a system is traditionally called noncontextual if there exists a jointly distributed set $\{Q_p:p\in P\}$ of random variables such that $R^c$ has the same distribution as $\{Q_p:p\in P_c\}$ for all $c\in C$. A trivial necessary condition for noncontextuality and a precondition for most approaches to measuring contextuality is that the system is consistently connected, i.e., all $R_p^c,R_p^{c'},\dots$ measuring the same property $p$ have the same distribution. The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) approach allows detecting and measuring "true" contextuality on top of inconsistent connectedness, but at the price of a higher computational cost. In this paper we propose a novel approach to measuring contextuality that shares the generality and basic definitions of the CbD approach and the computational benefits of the previously proposed Negative Probability (NP) approach. The present approach differs from CbD in that instead of considering all possible joints of the double-indexed random variables $R_p^c$, it considers all possible approximating single-indexed systems $\{Q_p:p\in P\}$. The degree of contextuality is defined based on the minimum possible probabilistic distance of the actual measurements $R^c$ from $\{Q_p:p\in P_c$}. We show that the defined measure agrees with a certain measure of contextuality of the CbD approach for all systems where each property enters in exactly two contexts and that this measure can be calculated far more efficiently than the CbD measure and even more efficiently than the NP measure for sufficiently large systems. The present approach can be modified so as to agree with the NP measure of contextuality on all consistently connected systems while extending it to inconsistently connected systems.

abstract: The mathematical description of the quantum harmonic oscillator is essentially based on the Gaussian function. In the case of a quantum oscillator with finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the position space consists in a finite number of points, and the ground state can be regarded as a finite version of the Gaussian function. Conversely, each finite Gaussian can be used in order to define some finite oscillators. We investigate certain finite Gaussians as concern their Fourier transform, Wigner function and associated oscillators.

abstract: Einstein's theory of relativity establishes the speed of light in vacuum, c, as a fundamental constant. However, the speed of light pulses can be altered significantly in dispersive materials. While significant control can be exerted over the speed of light in such media, no experimental demonstration of altered light speeds has hitherto been achieved in vacuum for ``twisted'' optical beams. We show that ``twisted'' light pulses exhibit subluminal velocities in vacuum, being slowed by 0.1\% relative to c. This work does not challenge relativity theory, but experimentally supports a body of theoretical work on the counterintuitive vacuum group velocities of twisted pulses. These results are particularly important given recent interest in applications of twisted light to quantum information, communication and quantum key distribution.

abstract: Strong coupling between the electronic states of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, or WSe$_2$, and a two-dimensional (2D) photonic cavity gives rise to several exotic effects. The Dirac type Hamiltonian for a 2D gapped semiconductor with large spin-orbit coupling facilitates pure Jaynes-Cummings type coupling in the presence of a single mode electric field. The presence of an additional circularly polarized beam of light gives rise to valley and spin dependent cavity-QED properties. The cavity causes the TMDC monolayer to act as an on-chip coherent light source and a spontaneous spin-oscillator. In addition, a TMDC monolayer in a cavity is a sensitive magnetic field sensor for an in-plane magnetic field.

We remedy this by investigating the entanglement properties of bosonic critical systems in $d=3$, both numerically and analytically, comparing the free and the interacting critical quench of an $O(N)$ model. We find that the evolution of the entanglement entropy for these two systems is nearly identical, as expected from the "quasi-particle" picture. However, the low-lying entanglement spectrum is controlled by the different critical exponent of the two systems, and therefore these exponents may be extracted by purely entanglement-theoretic calculations. We verify this scaling numerically.

abstract: Binary discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is used to describe dynamics of two-species Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into an optical lattice. Linear inter-species coupling leads to Rabi transitions between the species. In the regime of strong nonlinearity, a wavepacket corresponding to condensate separates into localized and ballistic fractions. Localized fraction is predominantly formed by immiscible solitons consisted of only one species. Initial states without spatial separation of occupied sites expose formation of immiscible solitons after a strongly chaotic transient. We calculate the finite-time Lyapunov exponent as a rate of wavepacket divergence in the Hilbert space. Using the Lyapunov analysis supplemented by Monte-Carlo sampling, it is shown that appearance of immiscible solitons after the chaotic transient corresponds to self-stabilization of the wavepacket. It is found that onset of chaos is accompanied by fast variations of kinetic and interaction energies. Crossover to self-stabilization is accompanied by reduction of condensate density due to emittance of ballistically propagating waves. It turns out that spatial separation of species should be a necessary condition for wavepacket stability in the presence of linear inter-species coupling.

abstract: We have recently extended many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster theory performed on top of a Slater determinant breaking rotational symmetry to allow for the restoration of the angular momentum at any truncation order [T. Duguet, J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 42 (2015) 025107]. Following a similar route, we presently extend Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory and Bogoliubov coupled cluster theory performed on top of a Bogoliubov reference state breaking global gauge symmetry to allow for the restoration of the particle number at any truncation order. Eventually, formalisms can be merged to handle $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ symmetries at the same time. Several further extensions of the newly proposed many-body formalisms can be foreseen in the mid-term future. The long-term goal relates to the ab initio description of near-degenerate finite quantum systems with an open-shell character.

abstract: We study radiative processes of uniformly accelerated entangled atoms, interacting with an electromagnetic field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum state. We discuss the structure of the rate of variation of the atomic energy for two atoms travelling in different hyperbolic world lines. We identify the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the generation of entanglement as well as to the decay of entangled states. Our results resemble the situation in which two inertial atoms are coupled individually to two spatially separated cavities at different temperatures. In addition, for equal accelerations we obtain that the maximally entangled antisymmetric Bell state is a decoherence-free state.

abstract: Long-distance quantum communication through optical fibers is currently limited to a few hundreds of kilometres due to fiber losses. Quantum repeaters could extend this limit to continental distances. Most approaches to quantum repeaters require highly multimode quantum memories in order to reach high communication rates. The atomic frequency comb memory scheme can in principle achieve high temporal multimode storage, without sacrificing memory efficiency. However, previous demonstrations have been hampered by the difficulty of creating high-resolution atomic combs, which reduces the efficiency for multimode storage. In this article we present a comb preparation method that allows one to increase the multimode capacity for a fixed memory bandwidth. We apply the method to a $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$-doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, in which we demonstrate storage of 100 modes for 51 $\mu$s using the AFC echo scheme (a delay-line memory), and storage of 50 modes for 0.541 ms using the AFC spin-wave memory (an on-demand memory). We also briefly discuss the ultimate multimode limit imposed by the optical decoherence rate, for a fixed memory bandwidth.

abstract: We take a central spin model (CSM), consisting of a one dimensional environmental Ising spin chain and a single qubit connected globally to all the spins of the environment, to study numerically the excess energy (EE) of the environment and the logarithm of decoherence factor namely, dynamical fidelity susceptibility per site (DFSS), associated with the qubit under a periodic driving of the transverse field term of environment across its critical point using the Floquet technique. The coupling to the qubit, prepared in a pure state, with the transverse field of the spin chain yields two sets of EE corresponding to the two species of Floquet operators. In the limit of weak coupling, we derive an approximated expression of DFSS after an infinite number of driving period which can successfully estimate the low and intermediate frequency behavior of numerically obtained DFSS. Our main focus is to analytically investigate the effect of system-environment coupling strength on the EEs and DFSS and relate the behavior of DFSS to EEs as a function of frequency by plausible analytical arguments. We explicitly show that the low-frequency beating like pattern of DFSS is an outcome of two frequencies, causing the oscillations in the two branches of EEs, that are dependent on the coupling strength. In the intermediate frequency regime, dip structure observed in DFSS can be justified by the resonance peaks of EEs at those coupling parameter dependent frequencies; high frequency saturation value of EEs and DFSS are also connected to each other by the coupling strength.

abstract: We propose a closed formula of the universal part of supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ for $(2,0)$ superconformal theories in six-dimensions. We show that $S_q$ across a spherical entangling surface is a cubic polynomial of $\gamma:=1/q$, with all coefficients expressed in terms of the newly discovered Weyl anomalies $a$ and $c$. This is equivalent to a similar statement of the supersymmetric free energy on conic (or squashed) six-sphere. We first obtain the closed formula by promoting the free tensor multiplet result and then provide an independent derivation by assuming that $S_q$ can be written as a linear combination of 't Hooft anomaly coefficients. We discuss a possible lower bound ${a\over c}\geq {3\over 7}$ implied by our result.

abstract: We develop new pulse schemes to significantly speed up adiabatic state transfer protocols. Our general strategy involves adding corrections to an initial control Hamiltonian which harness non-adiabatic transitions. These corrections define a set of dressed states that the system follows exactly during the state transfer. We apply this approach to STIRAP protocols and show that a suitable choice of dressed states allows one to design fast protocols that do not require additional couplings, while simultaneously minimizing the occupancy of the "intermediate" level.

abstract: We study first the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM), specially the cases of the harmonic and radial oscillators. Then, we obtain a new Wronskian formula for the confluent SUSY transformation and apply the SUSY QM to the inverted oscillator. After that, we present the polynomial Heisenberg algebras (PHA). We study the general systems described by PHA: for zeroth- and first-order we obtain the harmonic and radial oscillators, respectively; for second- and third-order PHA, the potential is determined in terms of solutions to Painlev\'e IV and V equations ($P_{IV}$ and $P_{V}$), respectively. Later on, we review the six Painlev\'e equations and we study the cases of $P_{IV}$ and $P_V$. We prove a reduction theorem for $2k$th-order PHA to be reduced to second-order algebras. We also prove an analogous theorem for the $(2k+1)$th-order PHA to be reduced to third-order ones. Through these theorems we find solutions to $P_{IV}$ and $P_V$ given in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. For some special cases, those can be classified in several solution hierarchies. In this way, we find real solutions with real parameters and complex solutions with real and complex parameters for both equations. Finally, we study the coherent states (CS) for the SUSY partners of the harmonic oscillator that are connected with $P_{IV}$, which we will call Painlev\'e IV coherent states. Since these systems have third-order ladder operators $l_k^\pm$, we seek first the CS as eigenstates of the annihilation operator $l_k^-$. We also define operators analogous to the displacement operator and we get CS departing from the extremal states in each subspace in which the Hilbert space is decomposed. We conclude our treatment applying a linearization process to the ladder operators in order to define a new displacement operator to obtain CS involving the entire Hilbert space.

abstract: The structure of the set of positivity-preserving maps between matrix algebras is notoriously difficult to describe. The notable exceptions are the results by St{\o}rmer and Woronowicz from 1960s and 1970s settling the low dimensional cases. By duality, these results are equivalent to the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion being able to unambiguously establish whether a state in a 2 x 2 or 2 x 3 quantum system is entangled or separable. However, even in these low dimensional cases, the existing arguments (known to the authors) were based on long and seemingly ad hoc computations. We present a simple proof, based on Brouwer's fixed point theorem, for the 2 x 2 case (St{\o}rmer's theorem). For completeness, we also include another argument (following the classical outline, but highly streamlined) based on a characterization of extreme self-maps of the Lorentz cone and on a link - noticed by R. Hildebrand - to the S-lemma, a well-known fact from control theory and quadratic/semi-definite programming.

abstract: This review focuses on the field of quantum entanglement applied to condensed matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial informations can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated R\'enyi entropies are now well recognized to contains key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in details. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.

abstract: A famous result of Lieb establishes that the map $(A,B) \mapsto \text{tr}\left[K^* A^{1-t} K B^t\right]$ is jointly concave in the pair $(A,B)$ of positive definite matrices, where $K$ is a fixed matrix and $t \in [0,1]$. In this paper we show that Lieb's function admits an explicit semidefinite programming formulation for any rational $t \in [0,1]$. Our construction follows more generally from a semidefinite formulation of weighted matrix geometric means. We make available an implementation of our constructions in Matlab.

abstract: Topological quantum phases cannot be characterized by Ginzburg-Landau type order parameters, and are instead described by non-local topological invariants. Experimental platforms capable of realizing such exotic states now include "synthetic" many-body systems such as ultracold atoms or photons. Unique tools available in these systems enable a new characterization of strongly correlated many-body states. Here we propose a general scheme for detecting topological order using interferometric measurements of elementary excitations. The key ingredient is the use of mobile impurities which bind to quasiparticles of a host many-body system. Specifically we show how fractional charges can be probed in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall systems. We demonstrate that combining Ramsey interference with Bloch oscillations can be used to measure Chern numbers of individual quasiparticles, which gives a direct probe of their fractional charges. We discuss possible extensions of our method to other topological many-body systems, such as spin liquids.

abstract: We discuss the behaviour of holographic entanglement entropy following a local quench in 2+1 dimensional strongly coupled CFTs. The entanglement generated by the quench propagates along an emergent light-cone, reminiscent of the Lieb-Robinson light-cone propagation of correlations in non-relativistic systems. We find the speed of propagation is bounded from below by the entanglement tsunami velocity obtained earlier for global quenches in holographic systems, and from above by the speed of light. The former is realized for sufficiently broad quenches, while the latter pertains for well localized quenches. The non-universal behavior in the intermediate regime appears to stem from finite-size effects. We also note that the entanglement entropy of subsystems reverts to the equilibrium value exponentially fast, in contrast to a much slower equilibration seen in certain spin models.

All components of the $g$-factor tensors are measured, including their spread in the QD ensemble. Surprisingly, the electron $g$ factor shows a large anisotropy changing from $g_{\mathrm{e},x}= -1.63$ to $g_{\mathrm{e},z}= -2.52$ between directions perpendicular and parallel to the dot growth axis, respectively, at an energy of 0.82 eV. The hole $g$-factor anisotropy at this energy is even stronger: $|g_{\text{h},x}|= 0.64$ and $|g_{\text{h},z}|= 2.29$. On the other hand, the in-plane anisotropies of electron and hole $g$ factors are small. The pronounced out-of-plane anisotropy is also observed for the spread of the $g$ factors, determined from the spin dephasing time.

abstract: Nonlinear and nonlocal effects are discussed in the interaction of laser fields with thermal Rydberg atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency configuration. We show that under the crucial approximation that the time variation in the dipole-dipole interactions due to atomic motions can be neglected in an ensemble average, an analytical form can be obtained for the nonlocal nonlinear atomic response of the thermal medium, and study it for different parameter cases. We further propose a generalized model to describe the modulational instability (MI) in absorptive nonlinear media, in order to understand the propagation dynamics in the thermal Rydberg medium. Interestingly, this model predicts that at short propagation distances, each wave component exhibits the MI effect in absorptive nonlinear media, unlike in the purely dispersive case.

abstract: Holographic systems require monogamous mutual information for validity of semiclassical geometry. This is encoded by the sign of the tripartite information ($I3$). We investigate the behaviour of $I3$ for all partitionings of systems in states which are highly entangled in a multipartite or bipartite sense. In the case of multipartite entanglement we propose an algorithmic construction that we conjecture can be used to build local maxima of $I3$ for any partitioning. In case of bipartite entanglement we classify the possible values of $I3$ for perfect states and investigate, in some examples, the effect on its sign definiteness due to deformations of the states. Finally we comment on the proposal of using $I3$ as a parameter of scrambling, arguing that in general its average over qubits permutations could be a more sensible measure.

abstract: The negatively-charged silicon-vacancy ($\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$) center in diamond is a bright source of indistinguishable single photons and a useful resource in quantum information protocols. Until now, $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers with narrow optical linewidths and small inhomogeneous distributions of $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ transition frequencies have only been reported in samples doped with silicon during diamond growth. We present a technique for producing implanted $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers with nearly lifetime-limited optical linewidths and a small inhomogeneous distribution. These properties persist after nanofabrication, paving the way for incorporation of high-quality $\mathrm{SiV}^{-}$ centers into nanophotonic devices.

abstract: We study the hybrid classical-quantum version of the channel coding problem for the famous Gel'fand-Pinsker channel. In the classical setting for this channel the conditional distribution of the channel output given the channel input is a function of a random parameter called the channel state. We study this problem when a rate limited version of the channel state is available at the encoder for the classical-quantum Gel'fand-Pinsker channel. We establish the capacity region for this problem in the information-spectrum setting. The capacity region is quantified in terms of spectral-sup classical mutual information rate and spectral-inf quantum mutual information rate.

abstract: We calculate analytically the R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropy $S_{\alpha}$ of the ground state of $1+1$ dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) after performing projective measurement in a part of the system. Using Cardy's method we show that the entanglement entropy in this setup is dependent on the central charge and the operator content of the system. When due to the measured region the two parts are disconnected, the entanglement entropy decreases like a power-law with respect to the characteristic distance of the two regions with an exponent which is dependent on the rank $\alpha$ of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy and the smallest scaling dimension present in the system. We check our findings by making numerical calculations on the Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators) after fixing the position (partial measurement) of some of the oscillators. We also comment on the post-measurement entanglement entropy in the massive quantum field theories.

abstract: The scattering of identical nuclei at low energies exhibits conspicuous Mott oscillations which can be used to investigate the presence of components in the predominantly Coulomb interaction arising from several physical effects. It is found that at a certain critical value of the Sommerfeld parameter the Mott oscillations disappear and the cross section becomes quite flat. We call this effect Transverse Isotropy (TI). The critical value of the Sommerfeld parameter at which TI sets in is found to be $\eta_{c} = \sqrt{3s +2}$, where $s$ is the spin of the nuclei participating in the scattering. No TI is found in the Mott scattering of identical Fermionic nuclei. The critical center of mass energy corresponding to $\eta_c$ is found to be $E_c$ = 0.40 MeV for $\alpha + \alpha$ (s = 0) , 1.2 MeV for $^{6}$Li + $^{6}$LI (s = 1) and 7.1 MeV for $^{10}$B + $^{10}$B (s = 3). We further found that the inclusion of the nuclear interaction induces a significant modification in the TI. We suggest measurements at these sub-barrier energies for the purpose of extracting useful information about the nuclear interaction between light heavy ions. We also suggest extending the study of the TI to the scattering of identical atomic ions.

abstract: Dynamics of non-interacting ultracold atoms with artificial spin-orbit coupling is considered. Spin-orbit coupling is created using two moving optical lattices with orthogonal polarizations. Lattices experience random phase and amplitude fluctuations modelled by means of the two-dimensional stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, also known as harmonic noise. Our main goal is to study influence of lattice noise on Rabi oscillations. Especial attention is paid to the phenomenon of the Zitterbewegung being trembling motion caused by Rabi transitions between states with different velocities. In the the noiseless case the problem is solved analytically by means of the momentum representation that allows one to split the original Schr\"odinger equation into independent pairs of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that noise significantly extends duration of the Zitterbewegung as compared to the noiseless case. This effect originates from noise-induced decoherence of Rabi oscillations.

One can thus conceive the space-time manifold as a purely theoretical arena, where quantum states are defined, with the additional freedom of changing coordinates like any other symmetry. Observables, including positions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting on such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of Einstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very involved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical variables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum observables acting on the "superspace" of all metrics, regardless of whether they play any role in the description of a specific physical system. On can instead revisit the more humble "minisuperspace" approach and choose the gravitational observables not simply by imposing some symmetry, but motivated by their proven relevance in the (classical) description of a given system. In particular, this review focuses on compact, spherically symmetric, quantum mechanical sources, in order to determine the probability they are black holes rather than regular particles. The gravitational radius is therefore lifted to the status of a quantum mechanical operator acting on the "horizon wave-function", the latter being determined by the quantum state of the source. This formalism is then applied to several sources with a mass around the fundamental scale, which are viewed as natural candidates of quantum black holes.

abstract: Multichannel interference giving rise to Fano-resonant lineshapes has long been utilized for extreme enhancement of signal to noise among widely varied sensing applications. Nevertheless, the engineering of such an effect has yet to provide similar gains for quantum optical applications. For the first time, however, we have harnessed the enhancement of a Fano resonance to interferometrically extract the quantum fluctuations of scattered light from a strongly-driven cavity quantum electrodynamical (cQED) system. Having exploited this interference for an unconventional self-homodyne measurement, we reveal the elusive incoherently-scattered light from a dynamic Mollow triplet in a solid-state environment. This application of interferometric scattering will enable devices that overcome the highly dissipative nature of solid-state systems and thus allow for the creation of high-throughput nonclassical light sources and all-optical single-photon transistors.

abstract: Motivated by the interest in non-relativistic quantum mechanics for determining exact solutions to the Schrodinger equation we give two potentials that are conditionally exactly solvable. The two potentials are partner potentials and we obtain that each linearly independent solution of the Schrodinger equation includes two hypergeometric functions. Furthermore we calculate their reflection and transmission amplitudes. Finally we discuss some additional properties of these potentials.

abstract: A brief summary of the application of coherent states in the examination of quantum dynamics of cosmological models is given. We discuss quantization maps, phase space probability distributions and semiclassical phase spaces. The implementation of coherent states based on the affine group resolves the hardest singularities, renders self-adjoint Hamiltonians without boundary conditions and provides a completely consistent semi-classical description of the involved quantum dynamics. We consider three examples: the closed Friedmann model, the anisotropic Bianchi Type I model and the deep quantum domain of the Bianchi Type IX model.

abstract: Abner Shimony was an exceptional human being and a remarkably lucid and penetrating thinker whose work centered on some of the most significant physical and philosophical questions of his era at their nexus. He approached these questions with an open, agile and critical mind, something quickly evident to anyone who had the privilege of conversing with him. His choice of problems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the relationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly, most of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his enormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both theoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of physical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is his pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the early-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship between knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical concerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se. Indeed, the most well known phrase he coined is "experimental metaphysics." He is also known for the reapplication of the expression "peaceful coexistence" as pertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special relativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the question of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few physicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more philosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation reflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual career, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of his teachers.

abstract: We summarize our investigation of the extent to which the choice of internal clock influences the dynamics in quantum models of gravity. Firstly, at the classical level, we define an extension to the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of contact transformations, which allows for transformations of time coordinates. Secondly, at the quantum level, we employ the extended theory to separate the quantum effects brought by the free choice of internal clock from those originating from inequivalent quantization maps. Next, we show with two examples two kinds of origin of the clock effect in quantum gravitational systems.

abstract: We propose a new quantity called modulus fidelity to measure the closeness of two quantum pure states. Especially, we use it to investigate the closeness of eigenstates of quantum many-body systems. When the system is integrable, the modulus fidelity of neighbor eigenstates displays a large fluctuation. But the modulus fidelity is close to a constant when system becomes non-integrable with fluctuation reduced drastically. Average modulus fidelity of neighbor eigenstates increases with the increase of parameters that destroy the integrability, which also indicates the integrable-chaos transition. In non-integrable case, it is found two eigenstates are closer to each other if their level spacing is small. We also show that the closeness of eigenstates in non-integrable domain is the underlying mechanism of \emph{eigenstate thermalization hypothesis} (ETH) which explains the thermalization in nonintegrable system we studied.

abstract: We report the homonuclear photoassociation (PA) of ultracold ${}^{52}\mathrm{Cr}$ atoms in an optical dipole trap. This constitutes the first measurement of PA in an element with total electron spin $\tilde{S}>1$. Although Cr, with its ${}^{7}\mathrm{S}_{3}$ ground and ${}^{7}\mathrm{P}_{4,3,2}$ excited states, is expected to have a complicated PA spectrum we show that a spin polarized cloud exhibits a remarkably simple PA spectrum when circularly polarized light is applied. Over a scan range of 20 GHz below the ${}^{7}\mathrm{P}_{3}$ asymptote we observe two distinct vibrational series each following a LeRoy-Bernstein law for a $C_3 / R^{3}$ potential with excellent agreement. We determine the $C_3$ coefficients of the Hund's case c) relativistic adiabatic potentials to be -1.83$\pm$0.02 a.u. and -1.46$\pm$0.01a.u.. Theoretical non-rotating Movre-Pichler calculations enable a first assignment of the series to $\Omega=6_u$ and $5_g$ potential energy curves. In a different set of experiments we disturb the selection rules by a transverse magnetic field which leads to additional PA series.

abstract: We study the effects of dephasing noise on a prototypical many-body localized system -- the XXZ spin 1/2 chain with a disordered magnetic field. At times longer than the inverse dephasing strength the dynamics of the system is described by a classical probabilistic Markov process on the space of diagonal density matrices, while all off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay to zero. The generator of the Markovian process is a bond-disordered spin chain. The scaling variable is identified, and independence of relaxation on the interaction strength is demonstrated. We show that purity and von Neumann entropy are extensive, showing no signatures of localization, while the operator space entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic growth with time, suggesting many-body localized dynamics of the effective Markov process.

abstract: We discuss the dissipative preparation of p-wave superconductors in number-conserving one-dimensional fermionic systems. We focus on two setups: the first one entails a single wire coupled to a bath, whereas in the second one the environment is connected to a two-leg ladder. Both settings lead to stationary states which feature the bulk properties of a p-wave superconductor, identified in this number-conserving setting through the long-distance behavior of the proper p-wave correlations. The two schemes differ in the fact that the steady state of the single wire is not characterized by topological order, whereas the two-leg ladder hosts Majorana zero modes, which are decoupled from damping and exponentially localized at the edges. Our analytical results are complemented by an extensive numerical study of the steady-state properties, of the asymptotic decay rate and of the robustness of the protocols.

abstract: A semiclassical formalism is used to investigate the transistor-like behavior of ultracold atoms in a triple-well potential. Atom current flows from the source well, held at fixed chemical potential and temperature, into an empty drain well. In steady-state, the gate well located between the source and drain is shown to acquire a well-defined chemical potential and temperature, which are controlled by the relative height of the barriers separating the three wells. It is shown that the gate chemical potential can exceed that of the source and have a lower temperature. In electronics terminology, the source-gate junction can be reverse-biased. As a result, the device exhibits regimes of negative resistance and transresistance, indicating the presence of gain. Given an external current input to the gate, transistor-like behavior is characterized both in terms of the current gain, which can be greater than unity, and the power output of the device.

abstract: The Loschmidt echo -- also known as fidelity -- is a very useful tool to study irreversibility in quantum mechanics due to perturbations or imperfections. Many different regimes, as a function of time and strength of the perturbation, have been identified. For chaotic systems, there is a range of perturbation strengths where the decay of the Loschmidt echo is perturbation independent, and given by the classical Lyapunov exponent. But observation of the Lyapunov decay depends strongly on the type of initial state upon which an average is done. This dependence can be removed by averaging the fidelity over the Haar measure, and the Lyapunov regime is recovered, as it was shown for quantum maps. In this work we introduce an analogous quantity for systems with infinite dimensional Hilbert space, in particular the quantum stadium billiard, and we show clearly the universality of the Lyapunov regime.

abstract: We propose a simple yet efficient mechanism for passive error correction in topological quantum memories. Our scheme relies on driven-dissipative ancilla systems which couple to local excitations (anyons) and make them "sink" in energy, with no required interaction among ancillae or anyons. Through this process, anyons created by some thermal environment end up trapped in potential "trenches" that they themselves generate, which can be interpreted as a "memory foam" for anyons. This self-trapping mechanism provides an energy barrier for anyon propagation, and removes entropy from the memory by favoring anyon recombination over anyon separation (responsible for memory errors). We demonstrate that our scheme leads to an exponential increase of the memory-coherence time with system size $L$, up to an upper bound $L_\mathrm{max}$ which can increase exponentially with $\Delta/T$, where $T$ is the temperature and $\Delta$ is some energy scale defined by potential trenches. This results in a double exponential increase of the memory time with $\Delta/T$, which greatly improves over the Arrhenius (single-exponential) scaling found in typical quantum memories.

abstract: Despite decades of intense study, the underlying mechanism of the extraordinary dynamics of liquids approaching the glass transition remains, at best, mischaracterized, and at worst, misunderstood. With sufficiently rapid cooling, any liquid can, in principle, be made to form a glass, displaying an immense increase in viscosity upon supercooling. A principle goal of the glass scientist, then, is to understand the incredible increase in viscosity and determine whether a universal nature underlies the glass transition for all classes of liquids. To this end, numerous theories have been proposed that reproduce, to varying degrees of success, the behavior of the viscosity with temperature. Many of these theories are based around the much celebrated Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann form for the viscosity. Despite the successes of this functional form for various supercooled liquids, it is phenomenological in nature, its prediction of a low temperature thermodynamic singularity has been called into question by numerous experimental investigations. In light of these shortcomings, a new theory of the glass transition has recently been proposed which starts from first principles, using elementary quantum mechanical arguments to derive a form for the viscosity which contains only a single fitting parameter in its simplest form. In this Letter, we critically examine this theory and show that the functional form proposed fits the viscosity data of a diverse group of liquids exceptionally well over a wide temperature range. Furthermore, as predicted by the theory, we find that with the aid of a small dimensionless constant that varies in size from $\sim 0.05-0.12$, a universal collapse, of over 16 decades, of the viscosity data as a function of temperature. The discovered collapse appears in all known glass-formers spanning silicates, metallic alloy, and organic systems.

abstract: Classical and quantum properties of scattering of charged particles in ultrathin crystals are considered. A comparison is made of these two ways of study of scattering process. In the classical consideration we remark the appearance of sharp maxima that is referred to the manifestation of the rainbow scattering phenomenon and in quantum case we show the sharp maxima that arise from the interference of single electrons on numerous crystal planes, that can be expressed in the terms of reciprocal lattice vectors. We show that for some parameters quantum predictions substantially differ from the classical ones. Estimated is the influence of the beam divergence on the possibility of experimental observation of the studied effects.

abstract: We present a platform based upon silicon nitride nanomembranes for integrating superconducting microwave circuits with planar acoustic and optical devices such as phononic and photonic crystals. Utilizing tensile stress and lithographic patterning of a silicon nitride nanomembrane we are able to reliably realize planar capacitors with vacuum gap sizes down to $s \approx 80$nm. In combination with spiral inductor coils of micron pitch, this yields microwave ($\approx 8$GHz) resonant circuits of high impedance ($Z_{0} \approx 3.4$k$\Omega$) suitable for efficient electromechanical coupling to nanoscale acoustic structures. We measure an electromechanical vacuum coupling rate of $g_{0}/2\pi = 41.5$~Hz to the low frequency ($4.48$MHz) global beam motion of a patterned phononic crystal nanobeam, and through parametric microwave driving reach a backaction cooled mechanical mode occupancy as low as $n_{m} = 0.58$.

abstract: We report on time-resolved pulsed four-wave mixing (FWM) signals in a thermal Rubidium vapor involving a Rydberg state. We observe FWM signals with dephasing times up to 7 ns, strongly dependent on the excitation bandwidth to the Rydberg state. The excitation to the Rydberg state is driven by a pulsed two-photon transition on ns time scales. Combined with a third cw de-excitation laser, a strongly directional and collective emission is generated according to a combination of the phase matching effect and averaging over Doppler classes. In contrast to a previous report [1] using off-resonant FWM, at a resonant FWM scheme we observe additional revivals of the signal shortly after the incident pulse has ended. We infer that this is a revival of motion-induced constructive interference between the coherent emissions of the thermal atoms. The resonant FWM scheme reveals a richer temporal structure of the signals, compared to similar, but off-resonant excitation schemes. A simple explanation lies in the selectivity of Doppler classes. Our numerical simulations based on a four-level model including a whole Doppler ensemble can qualitatively describe the data.

abstract: Generation of heralded single photons has recently been demonstrated using spontaneous four-wave mixing in integrated microresonators. While the results of coincidence measurements on the generated photon pairs from these systems show promise for their utility in heralding applications, such measurements do not reveal the quantum effects of photon losses within the resonator. These effects, which include a significant degradation of the heralding efficiency, depend strongly on the relative strengths of the coupling of the ring modes to loss modes and channel modes. We show that the common choice of critical coupling does not optimize the rate of successfully heralded photons, and derive the coupling condition needed to do so, as well as the condition needed to maximize the rate of coincidence counts. Optimizing these rates has a considerable negative effect on the heralding efficiency.

abstract: We consider quantum entanglement of three accelerating qubits, each of which is locally coupled with a real scalar field, without causal influence among the qubits or among the fields. The initial state is assumed to be the GHZ or the W state, the two representative three-partite entangled states. For each initial state, we study how various kinds of entanglement depend on the accelerations of the three qubits. All kinds of entanglement eventually suddenly die if at least two of three qubits have large enough accelerations. This result implies eventual sudden death of all kinds of entanglement among field-coupled particles sufficiently close to the horizon of a black hole, which is thus an entanglement shield.

abstract: Currently there is much interest in Hamiltonians that are not Hermitian but instead possess an antilinear $PT$ symmetry, since such Hamiltonians can still lead to the time-independent evolution of scalar products, and can still have an entirely real energy spectrum. However, such theories can also admit of energy spectra in which energies come in complex conjugate pairs, and can even admit of Hamiltonians that cannot be diagonalized at all. Hermiticity is just a particular realization of $PT$ symmetry, with $PT$ symmetry being the more general. In this paper we show that these $PT$ theories are themselves part of an even broader class of theories, theories that can be characterized by possessing some general antilinear symmetry, as that requirement alone is a both necessary and sufficient condition for the time-independent evolution of scalar products, with all the different realizations of the $PT$ symmetry program then being obtained. Use of complex Lorentz invariance allows us to show that the antilinear symmetry is uniquely specified to be $CPT$, with the $CPT$ theorem thus being extended to the non-Hermitian case. For theories that are separately charge conjugation invariant, the results of the $PT$-symmetry program then follow. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed for a path integral quantization one must impose $CPT$ symmetry on each classical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity condition since Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the quantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been constructed. We show that whether or not a $CPT$-invariant Hamiltonian is Hermitian is a property of the solutions to the theory and not of the Hamiltonian itself. Thus Hermiticity never needs to be postulated at all.

Long coherence times are revealed through dark-state spectroscopy as resulting from nuclear spin locking mediated by the exchange interaction between the QDs. Lineshape analysis provides the first measurement of the quieting of the Overhauser field distribution correlating with reduced nuclear spin fluctuations.

abstract: We introduce a tensor renormalization group scheme for coarse-graining a two-dimensional tensor network, which can be successfully applied to both classical and quantum systems on and off criticality. The key idea of our scheme is to deform a 2D tensor network into small loops and then optimize tensors on each loop. In this way we remove short-range entanglement at each iteration step, and significantly improve the accuracy and stability of the renormalization flow. We demonstrate our algorithm in the classical Ising model and a frustrated 2D quantum model.

abstract: We study the onset of eigenstate thermalization in the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model (2D-TFIM) in the square lattice. We consider two non-equivalent Hamiltonians: the ferromagnetic 2D-TFIM and the antiferromagnetic 2D-TFIM in the presence of a uniform longitudinal field. We use full exact diagonalization to examine the behavior of quantum chaos indicators and of the diagonal matrix elements of operators of interest in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. A finite size scaling analysis reveals that quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization occur in those systems whenever the fields are nonvanishing and not too large.

abstract: Generalized quantum statistics, such as paraboson and parafermion statistics, are characterized by triple relations which are related to Lie (super)algebras of type B. The correspondence of the Fock spaces of parabosons, parafermions as well as the Fock space of a system of parafermions and parabosons to irreducible representations of (super)algebras of type B will be pointed out. Example of generalized quantum statistics connected to the basic classical Lie superalgebra B(1|1)=osp(3|2) with interesting physical properties, such as noncommutative coordinates, will be given. Therefore the article focuses on the question, addressed already in 1950 by Wigner: do the equation of motion determine the quantum mechanical commutation relation?

abstract: Interferometric measurements with matter waves are established techniques for sensitive gravimetry, rotation sensing, and measurement of surface interactions, but compact interferometers will require techniques based on trapped geometries. In a step towards the realization of matter wave interferometers in toroidal geometries, we produce a large, smooth ring trap for Bose-Einstein condensates using rapidly scanned time-averaged dipole potentials. The trap potential is smoothed to less than 1% peak-to-peak using the atomic density as input to an optical intensity correction algorithm, with a maximum ring diameter of 300 $\mu$m demonstrated. We experimentally observe and simulate the dispersion of condensed atoms in the resulting potential, with good agreement serving as an indication of trap smoothness. Under time of flight expansion we observe low energy phonon excitations in the ring, which serves to constrain the lower frequency limit of the scanned potential technique. The resulting ring potential will have applications as a waveguide for atom interferometry and studies of superfluidity.

abstract: Gapped quantum spin chains with symmetry PSU(N)=SU(N)/Z(N) are known to possess N distinct symmetry protected topological phases. Besides the trivial phase, there are N-1 Haldane phases which are distinguished by the occurrence of massless boundary spins. Motivated by the potential realization in alkaline-earth atomic Fermi gases, we explicitly construct previously unknown Hamiltonians for two classes of chiral AKLT states and we discuss their physical properties. We also point out a deep connection between symmetry protection in gapped and gapless 1D quantum spin systems and its implications for a potential multicritical nature of topological phase transitions.

abstract: Recent studies on the dynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems have shed light into this largely unexplored domain in physics. A unique possibility revealed by such studies is the dynamical realization of novel quantum states. Prominent examples are prethermal states close to integrability and topological states in periodically driven systems. The former can be understood as steady states of integrable Hamiltonians and the latter via effective Floquet descriptions. Here, we unveil another remarkable outcome of quantum dynamics, the generation of time-evolving states that are eigenstates of emergent local Hamiltonians (not trivially related to the ones driving the dynamics). We study far from equilibrium dynamics of Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models in one-dimensional lattices, and provide examples of physically relevant time-evolving states that are ground states of such emergent Hamiltonians. We further show that these states can display a striking range of spatial correlations, from power law to Gaussian.

abstract: The problem of the "explanation" of recent social explosions, especially in the Middle East, but also in Southern Europe and the USA, have been debated actively in the social and political literature. We can mention the contributions of P. Mason, F. Fukuyama, E. Schmidt and J. Cohen, I. Krastev to this debate. We point out that the diversity of opinions and conclusions is really amazing. At the moment, there is no consistent and commonly acceptable theory of these phenomena. We present a model of social explosions based on a novel approach for the description of social processes, namely, the quantum-like approach. Here quantum theory is treated simply as an operational formalism - without any direct relation to physics. We explore the quantum-like laser model to describe the possibility of Action Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Social Energy (ASE).

abstract: We show that the magnetic component of the photon field produced by dark matter axions via the two-photon coupling mechanism in a Sikivie Haloscope is an important parameter passed over in previous analysis and experiments. The interaction of the produced photons will be resonantly enhanced as long as they couple to the electric or magnetic mode structure of the Haloscope cavity. For typical Haloscope experiments the electric and magnetic coupling is the same and implicitly assumed in past sensitivity calculations. However, for future planned searches such as those at high frequency, which synchronize multiple cavities, the sensitivity will be altered due to different magnetic and electric couplings. We discuss the implications of the full electromagnetic form factor and propose new experiments using lumped 3D LC resonators (or re-entrant cavities) with separated electric and magnetic fields to probe currently unbounded regions of the axion mass parameter space.

abstract: The existence of vacuum fluctuations is one of the most important predictions of modern quantum field theory. In the vacuum state, fluctuations occurring at different frequencies are uncorrelated. However, if a parameter in the Lagrangian of the field is modulated by an external pump, vacuum fluctuations stimulate spontaneous downconversion processes, creating squeezing between modes symmetric with respect to half of the frequency of the pump. Here we show that by double parametric pumping of a superconducting microwave cavity in the ground state, it is possible to generate another fundamental type of correlation, namely coherence between photons in separate frequency modes that are not directly connected through a single downconversion process. The coherence is tunable by the phases of the pumps and it is established by a quantum fluctuation that takes simultaneously part in creation of two photon pairs. Our analysis indicates that the origin of this vacuum-induced coherence is the absence of "which-way" information in the frequency space.

abstract: The rapid generation of indistinguishable photons is of paramount importance for exploring the peculiar properties of quantum optics and utilising them in applications such as secure communication or generation of NOON-states for quantum lithography and metrology. While strongly coupled quantum dot-photonic crystal resonator systems have great potential as non-classical light sources, the generation of indistinguishable photons has been obscured due to the strongly dissipative nature of such systems. Here, we circumvent this quandary through a recently discovered self-homodyne suppression technique in solid-state strongly coupled systems. In particular, we find this system to be capable of robust and high-fidelity generation of indistinguishable photons with unprecedented rates. Surprisingly, we show that our approach can overcome the intrinsic thermal limitations of bulk quantum dots, while benefiting from all advantages of resonant excitation. Thus unlike in bare quantum dot systems, our nanocavity-based platform directly lends itself to scalable on-chip architectures for quantum information.

abstract: An objective definition of pragmatic information and the consideration of recent results about information processing in the human brain can help overcome some traditional difficulties with the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Rather than attempting to define information ab initio, I introduce the concept of interaction between material bodies as a primary concept. Two distinct categories can be identified: 1) Interactions which can always be reduced to a superposition of physical interactions (forces) between elementary constituents; 2) Interactions between complex bodies which cannot be reduced to a superposition of interactions between parts, and in which patterns and forms (in space and/or time) play the determining role. Pragmatic information is then defined as the correspondence between a given pattern and the ensuing pattern-specific change. I will show that pragmatic information is a biological concept that plays no active role in the purely physical domain; it only does so when a living organism intervenes. The consequences for the foundations of both classical and quantum physics are important and will be discussed in detail. Since by its very definition pragmatic information (the one our brain uses to represent, think about and react to the outside world)cannot operate in the quantum domain, it is advisable to refrain from using it in our mental representation of what is happening 'inside' a quantum system. Although the theoretical framework developed for quantum mechanics handles mathematical entities specifically attributed to a quantum system, the only truly pragmatic information it can provide relates to macroscopic effects on the environment (natural, or artificial as in a measurement instrument) with which the system interacts.

abstract: In order to improve the short-term stability of trapped-ion optical clocks, we are developing a frequency standard based on ${}^{115}$In${}^+$ / ${}^{172}$Yb${}^+$ Coulomb crystals. For this purpose, we have developed scalable segmented Paul traps which allow a high level of control for multiple ion ensembles. In this article, we detail on our recent results regarding the reduction of the leading sources of frequency uncertainty introduced by the ion trap: 2nd-order Doppler shifts due to micromotion and the heating of secular motion, as well as the black-body radiation shift due to warming of the trap. We show that the fractional frequency uncertainty due to each of these effects can be reduced to well below $10^{-19}$.

abstract: By generalising concepts from classical stochastic dynamics, we establish the basis for a theory of metastability in Markovian open quantum systems. Partial relaxation into long-lived metastable states - distinct from the asymptotic stationary state - is a manifestation of a separation of timescales due to a splitting in the spectrum of the generator of the dynamics. We show here how to exploit this spectral structure to obtain a low dimensional approximation to the dynamics in terms of motion in a manifold of metastable states constructed from the low-lying eigenmatrices of the generator. We argue that the metastable manifold is in general composed of disjoint states, noiseless subsystems and decoherence-free subspaces.

abstract: In this letter, we explore topological transitions in parameter space in order to enable adiabatic passages between regions not adiabatically connected within this parameter manifold. To this end, we study two coupled qubits interacting with external magnetic fields, and make use of the analogy between the Berry curvature and magnetic fields in parameter space, with degeneracies associated to magnetic charges. Symmetry-breaking terms induce sharp topological transitions on the charge distributions, and we show how one can exploit this effect to bypass crossing degeneracies. We also investigate the curl of the Berry curvature, an interesting but as of yet not fully explored object, which together with its divergence uniquely defines this field. Finally, we suggest a simple method for measuring the Berry connection, thereby showing how one can experimentally verify our results.

abstract: Effectus theory is a new branch of categorical logic that aims to capture the essentials of quantum logic, with probabilistic and Boolean logic as special cases. Predicates in effectus theory are not subobjects having a Heyting algebra structure, like in topos theory, but `characteristic' functions, forming effect algebras. Such effect algebras are algebraic models of quantitative logic, in which double negation holds. Effects in quantum theory and fuzzy predicates in probability theory form examples of effect algebras. This text is an account of the basics of effectus theory. It includes the fundamental duality between states and effects, with the associated Born rule for validity of an effect (predicate) in a particular state. A basic result says that effectuses can be described equivalently in both `total' and `partial' form. So-called `commutative' and `Boolean' effectuses are distinguished, for probabilistic and classical models. It is shown how these Boolean effectuses are essentially extensive categories. A large part of the theory is devoted to the logical notions of comprehension and quotient, which are described abstractly as right adjoint to truth, and as left adjoint to falisity, respectively. It is illustrated how comprehension and quotients are closely related to measurement. The paper closes with a section on `non-commutative' effectus theory, where the appropriate formalisation is not entirely clear yet.

abstract: We apply the quadrature-based perturbation method of Dalgarno and Lewis to the evaluation of the nonlinear optical response of quantum systems. Through this method we derive exact expressions for the first three electronic polarizabilities by way of an operator substitution which requires only a good estimate of the ground state wave function, makes no explicit reference to the underlying Hamiltonian, and avoids complexities arising from excited state degeneracies. We apply this method to the half harmonic oscillator in one dimension and a quasi one-dimensional quantum graph to explore the effectiveness and numerical challenges of this approach. The accuracy and stability of this approach are also discussed.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.05933
abstract: We consider the excitation of Rydberg states through photons carrying an intrinsic orbital angular momentum degree of freedom. Laguerre-Gauss modes, with a helical wave-front structure, correspond to such a set of laser beams, which carry some units of orbital angular momentum in their propagation direction. We demonstrate that, in a proper geometrical setting, this orbital angular momentum can be transferred to the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, thus violating the standard dipolar selection rules. Higher orbital angular momentum states become accessible through a single photon excitation process. We investigate how the spacial structure of the Laguerre-Gauss beam affects the radial coupling strength, assuming the simplest case of hydrogen-like wavefunctions. Finally we discuss a generalization of the angular momentum coupling, in order to include the effects of the fine and hyperfine splitting, in the context of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

abstract: Strongly coupled quantum dot-cavity systems provide a non-linear configuration of hybridized light-matter states with promising quantum-optical applications. Here, we investigate the coherent interaction between strong laser pulses and quantum dot-cavity polaritons. Resonant excitation of polaritonic states and their interaction with phonons allow us to observe coherent Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Furthermore, we demonstrate complete coherent control of a quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity based quantum-bit. By controlling the excitation power and phase in a two-pulse excitation scheme we achieve access to the full Bloch sphere. Quantum-optical simulations are in excellent agreement with our experiments and provide insight into the decoherence mechanisms.

abstract: We examine the dynamical evolution of wave packets in a cubical billiard where three quantum numbers ($n_x,n_y,n_z$) determine its energy spectrum and consequently its dynamical behavior. We have constructed the wave packet in the cubical billiard and have observed its time evolution for various closed orbits. The closed orbits are possible for certain specific values of quantum numbers ($n_x,n_y,n_z$) and initial momenta ($k_x,k_y,k_z$). We observe that a cubical billiard exhibits degenerate energy levels and the path lengths of the closed orbits for these degenerate energy levels are identical. In spite of the identical path lengths, the shapes of the closed orbits for degenerate levels are different and depend upon angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ which we term as the sweep and the elevation angle respectively. These degenerate levels owe their origin to the symmetries prevailing in the cubical billiard and degenerate levels disappear completely or partially for a parallelepiped billiard as the symmetry breaks due to commensurate or incommensurate ratio of sides.

abstract: Experimental and theoretical results are reported for single-photon single ionization of W$^{2+}$ and W$^{3+}$ tungsten ions. Experiments were performed at the photon-ion merged-beam setup of the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. Absolute cross sections and detailed energy scans were measured over an energy range from about 20~eV to 90~eV at a bandwidth of 100~meV. Broad peak features with widths typically around 5~eV have been observed with almost no narrow resonances present in the investigated energy range. Theoretical results were obtained from a Dirac-Coulomb $R$-matrix approach. The calculations were carried out for the lowest-energy terms of the investigated tungsten ions with levels ${\rm 5s^2 5p^6 5d^4 \; {^5}D}_{J}$ $J=0,1,2,3,4$ for W$^{2+}$ and ${\rm 5s^2 5p^6 5d^3 \; {^4}F}_{J^{\prime}}$ $J^{\prime}=3/2, 5/2, 7/2, 9/2$ for W$^{3+}$. Assuming a statistically weighted distribution of ions in the initial ground-term levels there is good agreement of theory and experiment for W$^{3+}$ ions. However, for W$^{2+}$ ions at higher energies there is a factor of approximately two difference between experimental and theoretical cross sections.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.06120
abstract: Density functional theory is currently the most widely applied method in electronic structure theory. The Kohn-Sham method, based on a fictitious system of non-interacting particles, is the work horse of the theory. The particular form of the Kohn-Sham wavefunction admits only idem-potent one electron density matrices whereas wavefunctions of correlated electrons in post-Hartree-Fock methods invariably have fractional occupation numbers. Here we show that by generalizing the orbital concept, and introducing a suitable dot-product as well as a probability density a non-interacting system can be chosen that can represent the one-electron density matrix of any system, even one with fractional occupation numbers. This fictitious system ensures that the exact electron density is accessible within density functional theory. It can also serve as the basis for reduced density matrix functional theory. Moreover, to aid the analysis of the results the orbitals may be assigned energies from a mean-field Hamiltonian. This produces energy levels that are akin to Hartree-Fock orbital energies such that conventional analyses based on Koopmans theorem are available. Finally, this system is convenient in formalisms that depend on creation and annihilation operators as they are trivially applied to single determinant wavefunctions.

This is the highest position sensitivity ever measured for an isolated atom, and opens up the possibility of performing out-of-focus 3D particle tracking, imaging of atoms in 3D optical lattices or sensing forces at the yoctonewton (10$^{-24}$ N) scale.

abstract: Entropy is one of the central quantities in thermodynamics, whose flow between two systems determines the statistics of energy transfers. In quantum systems entropy is non-linear in density matrix whose time evolution is cumbersome. Using recent developments in the Keldysh formalism for the evolution of nonlinear quantum information measures (Phys. Rev. B 91, 174307 (2015)), we study the flow of von Neumann and Renyi entropies in a generic four-level quantum system that is weakly coupled to equilibrium heat engines. We show that noise-induced coherence has significant influence on the entropy flow of the quantum heat engine. We determine analytical optimization of couplings for the purpose of designing optimal artificial energy transfer systems.

Through local operations accessible in an experiment, entanglement is transferred to a qubit register from atoms at the ends of a one-dimensional chain. We compute the operational entanglement, which bounds the entanglement physically transferable from the many-body resource to the register, and discuss a protocol for its experimental measurement. Finally, we explore measures for the amount of entanglement available in the register after transfer, suitable for use in quantum information applications.

abstract: Applying a symmetric bulk bipartition to one-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki valence bond solid (VBS) states for the integer spin-S Haldane gapped phase, we can create an array of fractionalized spin-S/2 edge states with the super unit cell $l$ in the reduced bulk system, and the topological properties encoded in the VBS wave functions can be revealed. The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) with $l=even$ corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-S/2 model. For the even integer spins, the EH still describes the Haldane gapped phase. For the odd integer spins, however, the EH just corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg half-odd integer spin model with spinon excitations, characterizing the critical point separating the topological Haldane phase from the trivial gapped phase. Our results thus demonstrate that the topological bulk property not only determines its fractionalized edge states, but also the quantum criticality associated with the topological phase, where the elementary excitations are precisely those fractionalized edge degrees of freedom confined in the bulk of the topological phase.

abstract: We present a mainly analytical study of the entanglement spectrum of Bernal-stacked graphene bilayers in the presence of trigonal warping in the energy spectrum. Upon tracing out one layer, the entanglement spectrum shows qualitative geometric differences to the energy spectrum of a graphene monolayer. However, topological quantities such as Berry phase type contributions to Chern numbers agree. The latter analysis involves not only the eigenvalues of the entanglement Hamiltonian but also its eigenvectors. We also discuss the entanglement spectra resulting from tracing out other sublattices. As a technical basis of our analysis we provide closed analytical expressions for the full eigensystem of bilayer graphene in the entire Brillouin zone with a trigonally warped spectrum.

abstract: We evaluate the Hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in the region between two co-dimension one branes on the background of locally AdS spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. Along compact dimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the phases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. The latter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. There exists a range in the space of the Robin coefficients for separate branes where the vacuum state becomes unstable. Compared to the case of the standard AdS bulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on the parameters is less restrictive. The current density has nonzero components along compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact dimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that dimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that distinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes. In particular, for Dirichlet boundary condition the current density vanishes on the branes. We show that, depending on the constants in the boundary conditions, the presence of the branes may either increase or decrease the current density compared with that for the brane-free geometry. Applications are given to the Randall--Sundrum 2-brane model with extra compact dimensions.

abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two atoms with a short-ranged pair interaction in a one-dimensional harmonic trap with time-dependent frequency. Our analysis is focused on two representative cases: (i) a sudden change of the trapping frequency from one value to another, and (ii) a periodic trapping frequency. In case (i), the dynamics of the interacting and the corresponding non-interacting systems turn out to be similar. In the second case, however, the interacting system can behave quite differently, especially close to parametric resonance. For instance, in the regions where such resonance occurs we find that the interaction can significantly reduce the rate of energy increase. The implications for applications of our findings to cool or heat the system are also dicussed.

abstract: Chemical reactions at temperatures near absolute zero require a full quantum description of the reaction pathways and enable enhanced control of the products via quantum state selection. Ultracold molecule experiments have provided initial insight into the quantum nature of basic chemical processes involving diatomic molecules, for example from studies of bimolecular reactions, but complete control over the reactants and products has remained elusive. The "half-collision" process of photodissociation is an indispensable tool in molecular physics and offers significantly more control than the reverse process of photoassociation. Here we reach a fully quantum regime with photodissociation of ultracold $^{88}$Sr$_2$ molecules where the initial bound state of the molecule and the target continuum state of the fragments are strictly controlled. Detection of the photodissociation products via optical absorption imaging reveals the hallmarks of ultracold chemistry: resonant and nonresonant barrier tunneling, importance of quantum statistics, presence of forbidden reaction pathways, and matter wave interference of reaction products. In particular, this interference yields fragment angular distributions with a strong breaking of cylindrical symmetry, so far unobserved in photodissociation. We definitively show that the quasiclassical description of photodissociation fails in the ultracold regime. Instead, a quantum model accurately reproduces our results and yields new intuition.

We consider the possibility that gravitation theories which include torsion, and not only curvature, provide better insight into a quantum theory of gravity. We speculate on how the Dirac equation and Einstein gravity could be thought of as limiting cases of a gravitation theory which possesses torsion.

abstract: CSS codes are in one-to-one correspondance with length 3 chain complexes. The latter are naturally endowed with a tensor product $\otimes$ which induces a similar operation on the former. We investigate this operation, and in particular its behavior with regard to minimum distances. Given a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$, we give a criterion which provides a lower bound on the minimum distance of $\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathcal{D}$ for every CSS code $\mathcal D$. We apply this result to study the behaviour of iterated tensor powers of codes. Such sequences of codes are logarithmically LDPC and we prove in particular that their minimum distances tend generically to infinity. Different known results are reinterpretated in terms of tensor products. Three new families of CSS codes are defined, and their iterated tensor powers produce LDPC sequences of codes with length $n$, row weight in $O(\log n)$ and minimum distances larger than $n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ for any $\alpha<1$. One family produces sequences with dimensions larger than $n^\beta$ for any $\beta<1$.

abstract: We compare convergence of isogeometric analysis (IGA), a spline modification of finite element method (FEM), with FEM in the context of our real space code for ab-initio electronic structure calculations of non-periodic systems. The convergence is studied on simple sub-problems that appear within the density functional theory approximation to the Schr\"odinger equation: the Poisson problem and the generalized eigenvalue problem. We also outline the complete iterative algorithm seeking a fixed point of the charge density of a system of atoms or molecules, and study IGA/FEM convergence on a benchmark problem of nitrogen atom.

abstract: Progress in describing thermodynamic phase transitions in quantum systems is obtained by noticing that the Gibbs operator $e^{-\beta H}$ for a two-dimensional (2D) lattice system with a Hamiltonian $H$ can be represented by a three-dimensional tensor network, the third dimension being the imaginary time (inverse temperature) $\beta$. Coarse-graining the network along $\beta$ results in a 2D projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) with a finite bond dimension $D$. The coarse-graining is performed by a tree tensor network of isometries. The isometries are optimized variationally --- taking into account full tensor environment --- to maximize the accuracy of the PEPO. The algorithm is applied to the quantum compass model with the coupling constant $J=1$ on an infinite square lattice near a symmetry-breaking phase transition at finite temperature. From the linear susceptibility in the symmetric phase and the order parameter in the symmetry-broken phase the critical temperature is estimated at ${\cal T}_c=0.0606(4)$.

abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is notorious for the absence of gradient corrections to the two-dimensional (2D) Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy functional; it is widely accepted that the 2D analog of the 3D von Weizs\"acker correction vanishes, together with all higher-order corrections. Contrary to this long-held belief, we show that the leading correction to the kinetic energy does not vanish, is unambiguous, and contributes perturbatively to the total energy. This insight emerges naturally in a simple extension of standard DFT, which has the effective potential energy as a functional variable on equal footing with the single-particle density.

abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) is currently a hot issue of interacting systems, in which quantum mechanics overcomes thermalization of statistical mechanics. Like Anderson localization of non-interacting electrons, disorders are usually crucial in engineering the quantum interference in MBL. For a translation invariant system, however, the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) due to a \emph{pure} many-body quantum effect is still unclear. Here we demonstrate an MBL phenomenon without disorder, which emerges in a lightly doped Hubbard model at very strong interaction. By means of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) numerical calculation on a square lattice two-leg ladder, we show that whereas a single hole can induce a mobile Nagaoka polaron with a very large mass, two holes, three holes, and many holes, will form bound pair/droplets which are all localized excitations with flat bands. We further identify the underlying mechanism for this MBL as due to a novel `Berry phase' of the doped Mott insulator, and show that by turning off this Berry phase either by increasing the anisotropy of the model or by hand, an eigenstate transition from the MBL to a conventional quasiparticle phase can be realized in the charge sector.

abstract: Since its introduction by Hastings in [10], the technique of quasi-adiabatic continuation has become a central tool in the discussion and classification of ground state phases. It connects the ground states of self-adjoint Hamiltonians in the same phase by a unitary quasi-local transformation. This paper takes a step towards extending this result to non- self adjoint perturbations, though, for technical reason, we restrict ourselves here to weak perturbations of non-interacting spins. The extension to non-self adjoint perturbation is important for potential applications to Glauber dynamics (and its quantum analogues). In contrast to the standard quasi-adiabatic transformation, the transformation constructed here is exponentially local. Our scheme is inspired by KAM theory, with frustration-free operators playing the role of integrable Hamiltonians.

abstract: Since general relativity is a consistent low energy effective field theory, it is possible to compute quantum corrections to classical forces. Here we compute a quantum correction to the gravitational potential between a pair of polarizable objects. We study two distant bodies and compute a quantum force from their induced quadrupole moments due to two graviton exchange. The effect is in close analogy to the Casimir-Polder and London-van der Waals forces between a pair of atoms from their induced dipole moments due to two photon exchange. The new effect is computed from the shift in vacuum energy of metric fluctuations due to the polarizability of the objects. We compute the potential energy at arbitrary distances compared to the wavelengths in the system, including the far and near regimes. In the far distance, or retarded, regime, the potential energy takes on a particularly simple form: $V(r)=-3987\,\hbar\,c\,G^2\alpha_{1S}\,\alpha_{2S}/(4\,\pi\,r^{11})$, where $\alpha_{1S},\,\alpha_{2S}$ are the static gravitational quadrupole polarizabilities of each object. We provide estimates of this effect.

abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases exhibit nontrivial order if symmetry is respected but are adiabatically connected to the trivial product phase if symmetry is not respected. However, unlike the symmetry-breaking phase, there is no local order parameter for SPT phases. Here we employ a tensor-network method to compute the topological invariants characterized by the simulated modular $S$ and $T$ matrices to study transitions in a few families of two-dimensional (2D) wavefunctions which are $\mathbb{Z}_N$ ($N=2\, \&3$) symmetric. We find that in addition to the topologically ordered phases, the modular matrices can be used to identify nontrivial SPT phases and detect transitions between different SPT phases as well as between symmetric and symmetry-breaking phases. Therefore, modular matrices can be used to characterize various types of gapped phases in a unifying way.

abstract: Assume that $f$ is a continuous transformation $f:S^1 \to S^1$. We consider here the cases where $f$ is either the transformation $f(z)=z^2$ or $f$ is a smooth diffeomorphism of the circle $S^1$. Consider a fixed continuous potential $\tau:S^1=[0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$, $\nu\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\varphi:S^1 \to \mathbb{C}$ (a quantum state). The transformation $\hat F_{\nu}$ acting on $\varphi:S^1 \to \mathbb{C}$, $\hat F_{\nu}(\varphi) = \phi$, defined by $\displaystyle \phi(z) = \hat F_{\nu} (\varphi(z)) = \varphi(f(z))e^{i\nu\tau(z)}$ describes a discrete time dynamical evolution of the quantum state $\varphi$. Given $S:S^1\to \mathbb{R}$ we define the Lagrangian state $$\varphi_{x}^S(z) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}} e^{\frac{iS (z-k)}{\hbar}} e^{-\frac{(z-k-x)^2}{4\hbar}}.$$ In this case $\hat F_{\nu}(\varphi_{x}^S(z)) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}e^{\frac{iS (f(z)-k)}{\hbar}}e^{-\frac{(f(z)-k-x)^2}{4\hbar}}e^{i\nu\tau(z)}$. Under suitable conditions on $S$ the micro-support of $\varphi^S_x (z)$, when $\hbar \to 0$, is $(x,S'(x))$. One of meanings of the semiclassical limit in Quantum Mechanics is to take $\nu=\frac{1}{\hbar}$ and $\hbar \to 0$. We address the question of finding $S$ such that $\varphi^S_x$ satisfies the property: $ \forall x$, we have that $\hat{F}_\nu(\varphi^S_x)$ has micro-support on the graph of $y\to S'(y)$ (which is the micro-support of $\varphi^S_x$). In other words: which $S$ is such that $\hat{F}_\nu$ leaves the micro-support of $\varphi^S_x$ invariant? This is related to a coboundary equation for $\tau$, twist conditions and the boundary of the fat attractor.

abstract: In this work we consider the time evolution of charged Renyi entanglement entropies after exciting the vacuum with local fermionic operators. In order to explore the infor- mation contained in charged Renyi entropies, we perform computations of their excess due to the operator excitation in 2d CFT, free fermionic field theories in various di- mensions as well as holographically. In the analysis we focus on the dependence on the entanglement charge, the chemical potential and the spacetime dimension. We find that excesses of charged (Renyi) entanglement entropy can be interpreted in terms of charged quasiparticles. Moreover, we show that by appropriately tuning the chemical potential charged Renyi entropies can be used to extract entanglement in a certain charge sector of the excited state.

By calculating the period decay of the system and using the observational data we obtain an upper bound for the DNS parameter {\tau} . We also study quantum interference induced by gravitational potential in usual non-commutative and dynamical non-commutative spaces. The phase difference induced by gravity is calculated on two different paths and then, it is compared with the phase difference induced by gravity in commutative space.

abstract: A novel interferometric method -- SLIVER (Super Localization by Image inVERsion interferometry) -- is proposed for estimating the separation of two incoherent point sources with a mean squared error that does not deteriorate as the sources are brought closer. The essential component of the interferometer is an image inversion device that inverts the field in the transverse plane about the optical axis, assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources. The performance of the device is analyzed using the Cram\'er-Rao bound applied to the statistics of counting using photon-resolving and on-off detectors. The analysis is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation, demonstrating the superlocalization effect. The results are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric point-spread function.

abstract: A critical aspect of quantum mechanics is the nonlocal nature of the wavefunction, a characteristic that may yield unexpected coupling of nominally isolated systems. The capacity to detect this coupling can be vital in many situations, especially those in which its strength is weak. In this work we demonstrate an approach to such detection by making use of one of the most ubiquitous of wave-interference phenomena, namely the Fano resonance. The focus of this joint experimental and theoretical work is on demonstrating a novel form of \textit{nonequilibrium} Fano resonance, that is very different in nature to the usual (quasi-equilibrium) implementations of this phenomenon. The essential idea of our approach is to exploit the strong sensitivity of the Fano resonance to the presence of additional transmission pathways, as a means to identify the coupling of some host system to an \textit{intruder}. Crucially, our nonequilibrium scheme allows us to detect the presence of \textit{hidden} components within some system, even while they remain \textit{invisible} in near-equilibrium transport. For a proof-of-concept demonstration of this phenomenon, we implement an electron-wave interferometer from mesoscopic quantum point contacts. The wave-based origins of the Fano resonance imply, however, that our scheme should be widely realizable across a variety of physical platforms.

abstract: Ultracold atoms provide clues to an important many-body problem regarding the dependence of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition temperature $T_c$ on interactions. However, cold atoms are trapped in harmonic potentials and theoretical evaluations of the $T_c$ shift of trapped interacting Bose gases are challenging. While previous predictions of the leading-order shift have been confirmed, more recent experiments exhibit higher-order corrections beyond available mean-field theories. By implementing two large-N based theories with the local density approximation (LDA), we extract next-order corrections of the $T_c$ shift. The leading-order large-N theory produces results quantitatively different from the latest experimental data. The leading-order auxiliary field (LOAF) theory containing both normal and anomalous density fields captures the $T_c$ shift accurately in the weak interaction regime. However, the LOAF theory shows incompatible behavior with the LDA and forcing the LDA leads to density discontinuities in the trap profiles. We present a phenomenological model based on the LOAF theory, which repairs the incompatibility and provides a prediction of the $T_c$ shift in stronger interaction regime.

In this work we verify the Dunne-Unsal relation for resonance energy levels of one-dimensional polynomial anharmonic oscillators. We show that the relation is applicable to cubic and quartic anharmonic oscillators which are genus one potentials. However for higher order (higher genus) anharmonic potentials the relation is not satisfied and is subject to a certain extension.

abstract: The collapse and revival of quantum states appear in diverse areas of physics. In quantum optics the occurrence of such a phenomena in the evolution of an atomic state, interacting with a light field initially in a coherent state, was predicted by using the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and subsequently demonstrated experimentally. In this paper we revisit the JCM with the Monte-Carlo wave function approach and investigate the time evolution of the photon emission rate of the atom in a cavity. Analytical and numerical quantum trajectory calculations show that the cavity and the initial field statistics strongly influence the photon emission dynamics. A coherent field indeed gives rise to a collapse and revival behavior that mirrors atomic state evolution. However, there are differences between the two. The emission rate for a field in a Fock number state exhibits a sinusoidal oscillation, and there exists a quiescent period for a thermal field. These properties are quite different from those in free space. It is also shown that the fluctuation in photon emission is much less than that of the atomic population.

abstract: Conventional ground-based astronomical observations suffer from image distortion due to atmospheric turbulence. This can be minimized by choosing suitable geographic locations or adaptive optical techniques, and avoided altogether by using orbital platforms outside the atmosphere. One of the promises of optical intensity interferometry is its independence from atmospherically induced phase fluctuations. By performing narrowband spectral filtering on sunlight and conducting temporal intensity interferometry using actively quenched avalanche photon detectors (APDs), the Solar $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ signature was directly measured. We observe an averaged photon bunching signal of $g^{(2)}(\tau) = 1.693 \pm 0.003$ from the Sun, consistently throughout the day despite fluctuating weather conditions, cloud cover and elevation angle. This demonstrates the robustness of the intensity interferometry technique against atmospheric turbulence and opto-mechanical instabilities, and the feasibility to implement measurement schemes with both large baselines and long integration times.

abstract: The propagation of a weak optical pulse through an atomic system in closed $\Lambda$ configuration is investigated in which the hyper fine levels are coupled by a microwave pulse. Under three photon resonance condition, it is observed that the probe pulse shape gets cloned by the shape of the microwave pulse along propagation through the medium. The temporal position of the probe pulse is dragged to that of the microwave pulse. A simple expression for the linear susceptibility of the medium for the corresponding transition is derived in the Fourier domain. From the numerical analysis of dynamics using this expression, it is concluded that the novel effect arises from the ground state coherence of the hyper fine transitions induced by the microwave pulse.

abstract: The scientific community is becoming more and more interested in the research that applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to model human decision-making. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of the quantum approach to cognition that we developed in Brussels. These foundations rest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and operational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The deep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to investigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework for cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models derived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of this validity. However, two situations in the cognitive realm, 'question order effects' and 'response replicability', indicate that even the Hilbert space framework could be insufficient to reproduce the collected data. This does not mean that the mentioned operational-realistic approach would be incorrect, but simply that a larger class of measurements would be in force in human cognition, so that an extended quantum formalism may be needed to deal with all of them. As we will explain, the recently derived 'extended Bloch representation' of quantum theory (and the associated 'general tension-reduction' model) precisely provides such extended formalism, while remaining within the same unitary interpretative framework.

abstract: The Hermitian Hamiltonian of a spin one-half particle with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) confined to a surface that is embedded in a three-dimensional space spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate (OCC) is constructed. A gauge field formalism, where the SOC is expressed as a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field is used. A new practical approach, based on the physical argument that upon confining the particle to the surface by a potential, then it is the physical Hermitian momentum operator transverse to the surface, rather than just the derivative with respect to the transverse coordinate that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian.Doing so, it is shown that the Hermitian Hamiltonian for SOC is obtained with the geometric potential and the geometric kinetic energy terms emerging naturally. The geometric potential is shown to represent a coupling between the transverse component of the gauge field and the mean curvature of the surface that replaces the coupling between the transverse momentum and the gauge field. The most general Hermitian Hamiltonian with linear SOC on a general surface embedded in any 3D OCC system is reported. Explicit plug-and-play formulae for this Hamiltonian on the surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus are given. The formalism is applied to the Rashba SOC in three dimensions (3D RSOC) and the explicit expressions for the surface Hamiltonians on these three geometries are worked out.

abstract: Weyl fermions are massless chiral particles first predicted in 1929 and once thought to describe neutrinos. Although they have never been observed as elementary particles, quasiparticles with Weyl dispersion have recently been experimentally discovered in solid-state systems causing a furore in the research community. Systems with Weyl excitations can display a plethora of fascinating fundamental phenomena, such as non-local electrodynamics and chiral anomaly, topologically protected Fermi arcs on the surfaces, non-Anderson disorder-driven transitions, unusual dependencies of transport properties on doping and temperature, and offer great potential for the design of new generation of electronic devices. Here we show that Weyl excitations generically exist in three-dimensional systems of dipolar particles with weakly broken time-reversal symmetry (e.g., by magnetic field). They emerge as a result of dipolar-interaction-induced transfer of angular momentum between the $J=0$ and $J=1$ internal particle levels. We also discuss momentum-resolved Ramsey spectroscopy methods for observing Weyl quasiparticles in realistic cold-atom systems.

abstract: All-electron configuration interaction theory in the framework of the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian has been applied to the TaN molecule, a promising candidate in the search for Beyond-Standard-Model physics in both the hadron and the lepton sector of matter. We obtain in the first excited {$^3\Delta_1$} state a ${\cal{P,T}}$-odd effective electric field of $36.0 \left[\frac{\rm GV}{\rm cm}\right]$, a scalar-pseudoscalar ${\cal{P,T}}$-odd interaction constant of $32.8$ [kHz], and a nuclear magnetic-quadrupole moment interaction constant of $0.74$ [$\frac{10^{33} {\text{Hz}}}{e\, {\text{cm}}^2}$]. The latter interaction constant has been obtained with a new approach which we describe in detail. Using the same highly correlated all-electron wavefunctions with up to $2.5$ billion expansion terms, we obtain a parallel magnetic hyperfine interaction constant of $-2954$ [MHz] for the $\rm {^{181}{T}a}$ nucleus, a very large molecule-frame electric dipole moment of $-4.91$ [Debye], and spectroscopic constants for the four lowest-lying electronic states of the molecule.

abstract: This paper considers open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by external bosonic fields. The dependence of the Hamiltonian and the system-field coupling operators on the system variables is represented using the Weyl functional calculus. This leads to an integro-differential equation (IDE) for the evolution of the quasi-characteristic function (QCF) which encodes the dynamics of mixed moments of the system variables. Unlike quantum master equations for reduced density operators, this IDE involves only complex-valued functions on finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and extends the Wigner-Moyal phase-space approach for quantum stochastic systems. The dynamics of the QCF and the related Wigner quasi-probability density function (QPDF) are discussed in more detail for the case when the coupling operators depend linearly on the system variables and the Hamiltonian has a nonquadratic part represented in the Weyl quantization form. For this class of quantum stochastic systems, we also consider an approximate computation of invariant states and discuss the deviation from Gaussian quantum states in terms of the $\chi^2$-divergence (or the second-order Renyi relative entropy) applied to the QPDF. The results of the paper may find applications to investigating different aspects of the moment stability, relaxation dynamics and invariant states in open quantum systems.

abstract: We established a theoretical framework in terms of the curl flux, population landscape, and coherence for non-equilibrium quantum systems at steady state, through exploring the energy and charge transport in molecular processes. The curl quantum flux plays the key role in determining transport properties and the system reaches equilibrium when flux vanishes. The novel curl quantum flux reflects the degree of non-equilibriumness and the time-irreversibility. We found an analytical expression for the quantum flux and its relationship to the environmental pumping (non-equilibriumness quantified by the voltage away from the equilibrium) and the quantum tunneling. Furthermore, we investigated another quantum signature, the coherence, quantitatively measured by the non-zero off diagonal element of the density matrix. Besides the environment-assistance which can give dramatic enhancement of coherence and quantum flux with high voltage at a fixed tunneling strength, the quantum flux is promoted by the coherence in the regime of small tunneling while reduced by the coherence in the regime of large tunneling, due to the non-monotonic relationship between the coherence and tunneling. In view of the system as a quantum heat engine, we studied the non-equilibrium thermodynamics and established the analytical connections of curl quantum flux to the transport quantities such as energy (charge) transfer efficiency, chemical reaction efficiency, energy dissipation, heat and electric currents observed in the experiments. We observed a perfect transfer efficiency in chemical reactions at high voltage (chemical potential difference). Our theoretical predicted behavior of the electric current with respect to the voltage is in good agreements with the recent experiments on electron transfer in single molecules.

abstract: We uncover the mechanism of long-lived coherence that the discrete vibrational modes effectively weaken the exciton-environment interaction. This subsequently demonstrates the role of vibrational coherence which greatly contributes to long-lived feature of the excitonic coherence that has been observed in femtosecond experiments. To test the validity of our effective theory, we study the pigment-protein complex in details by exploring the energy transfer and coherence dynamics. The ground-state coherence generated by incoherent radiations is demonstrated to be significant to promote the excitation energy transfer. This on the other hand, seems to be natural from the point of view of nonequilibriumness, which funnels the downhill immigration of excitons. Moreover we also confirm that the considerable improvement of energy transfer is always accompanied by the long-lived oscillation of coherence.

abstract: We provide a quantitative description of the nonequilibriumness based on the model of coupled oscillators interacting with multiple energy sources. This can be applied to the study of vibrational energy transport in molecules. The curl quantum flux quantifying the nonequilibriumness and time-irreversibility is quantified in the coherent representation and we find the geometric description of the shape and polarization of the flux which provides the connection between the microscopic description of quantum nonequilibriumness and the macroscopic observables, i.e., correlation function. We use the Wilson loop integral to quantify the magnitude of curl flux, which is shown to be correlated to the correlation function as well. Coherence contribution is explicitly demonstrated to be non-trivial and to considerably promote the heat transport quantified by heat current and efficiency. This comes from the fact that coherence effect is microscopically reflected by the geometric description of the flux. To uncover the effect of vibron-phonon coupling between the vibrational modes of molecular stretching (vibron) and the molecular chain (phonon), we further explore the influences of localization, which leads to the coherent and incoherent regimes that are characterised by the current-current correlations.

We focus our study on the two-player games: prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and stag-hunt games. The obtained result show the benefits of quantum strategies for the prisoner's dilemma game. For the other two games, we obtain regions of parameters where the quantum strategies dominate, as well as regions where the classical strategies coexist.

abstract: Perfectly conducting boundaries, and their Dirichlet counterparts for quantum scalar fields, predict nonintegrable energy densities. A more realistic model with a finite ultraviolet cutoff yields two inconsistent values for the force on a curved or edged boundary (the "pressure anomaly"). A still more realistic, but still easily calculable, model replaces the hard wall by a power-law potential; because it involves no a posteriori modification of the formulas calculated from the theory, this model should be anomaly-free. Here we first set up the formalism and notation for the quantization of a scalar field in the background of a planar soft wall, and we approximate the reduced Green function in perturbative and WKB limits (the latter being appropriate when either the mode frequency or the depth into the wall is sufficiently large). Then we display numerical calculations of energy density and pressure for the region outside the wall, which show that the pressure anomaly does not occur there. Calculations inside the wall are postponed to later papers, which must tackle regularization and renormalization of divergences induced by the potential in the bulk region.

abstract: We report a measurement of the local acceleration $g$ with ultracold neutrons based on quantum states in the gravity potential of the Earth. The new method uses resonant transitions between the states $|1> -> |3>$ and for the first time between $|1> -> |4>$. The measurements demonstrate that Newton's Inverse Square Law of Gravity is understood at micron distances at an energy level of $10^{-14}$ eV with $\frac{\Delta g}{g}=4\times10^{-3}$. The results provide constraints on any possible gravity-like interaction at a micrometer interaction range. In particular, a dark energy candidate, the chameleon field is restricted to $\beta<6.9\times10^{6}$ for $n=2$ (95\% C.L.).

abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated superconducting transmon qubits with semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions. These hybrid gatemon qubits utilize field effect tunability characteristic for semiconductors to allow complete qubit control using gate voltages, potentially a technological advantage over conventional flux-controlled transmons. Here, we present experiments with a two-qubit gatemon circuit. We characterize qubit coherence and stability and use randomized benchmarking to demonstrate single-qubit gate errors below 0.7% for all gates, including voltage-controlled $Z$ rotations. We show coherent capacitive coupling between two gatemons and coherent swap operations. Finally, we perform a two-qubit controlled-phase gate with an estimated fidelity of 91%, demonstrating the potential of gatemon qubits for building scalable quantum processors.

We describe the dynamics of the impurities by a bosonic Hubbard model containing occupation-dependent parameters to capture the effects of strong impurity-impurity interactions. These include both a repulsive direct interaction and an attractive effective interaction mediated by the BEC. The occupation dependence of these two competing interactions drastically affects the Hubbard model phase diagram, including causing the disappearance of some Mott lobes

abstract: Kubo formula gives a linear response of a quantum system to external fields, which are classical and weak with respect to the energy of the system. In this work, we take the quantum nature of the external field into account, and define a Hall conductance to characterize the linear response of a two-band system to the quantized field. The theory is then applied to topological insulators. Comparisons with the traditional Hall conductance are presented and discussed.
