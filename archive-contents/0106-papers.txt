abstract: The commitment of bits between two mutually distrustful parties is a powerful cryptographic primitive with which many cryptographic objectives can be achieved. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is codified in a general impossibility theorem. Gaps in the proof of this impossibility theorem are found. An unconditionally secure bit commitment protocol utilizing anonymous quantum states and the no-clone theorem is presented below with a full security proof.

abstract: Starting from a general relativistic kinetic equation, a self-consistent mean-field equation for fermions is derived within a covariant density matrix approach of QED plasmas in strong external fields. A Schr\"odinger picture formulation on space-like hyperplanes is applied. The evolution of the distribution function is described by the one-particle gauge-invariant 4x4 Wigner matrix, which is decomposed in spinor space. A coupled system of equations for the corresponding Wigner components is obtained. The polarization current is expressed in terms of the Wigner function. Charge conservation is obeyed. In the quasi-classical limit for the Wigner components a relativistic Vlasov equation is obtained, which is presented in an invariant, i.e. hyperplane independent, form.

abstract: We study the limitations to the relative number squeezing between photons and atoms coupled out from a homogeneous Bose-Einstein-Condensate. We consider the coupling between the translational atomic states by two photon Bragg processes, with one of the photon modes involved in the Bragg process in a coherent state, and the other initially unpopulated. We start with an interacting Bose- condensate at zero temperature and compute the time evolution for the system. We study the squeezing, i.e. the variance of the occupation number difference between the second photon and the atomic c.m. mode. We discuss how collisions between the atoms and photon rescattering affect the degree of squeezing which may be reached in such experiments.

abstract: The performance of three types of InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes is investigated for photon counting at 1550 nm in the temperature range of thermoelectric cooling. The best one yields a dark count probability of $% 2.8\cdot 10^{-5}$ per gate (2.4 ns) at a detection efficiency of 10% and a temperature of -60C. The afterpulse probability and the timing jitter are also studied. The results obtained are compared with those of other papers and applied to the simulation of a quantum key distribution system. An error rate of 10% would be obtained after 54 kilometers.

abstract: By making the second quantization for the Cini Model of quantum measurement without wave function collapse [M. Cini, Nuovo Cimento, B73 27(1983)], the second order quantum decoherence (SOQD) is studied with a two mode boson system interacting with an idealized apparatus composed by two quantum oscillators. In the classical limit that the apparatus is prepared in a Fock state with a very large quantum number, or in a coherent state with average quantum numbers large enough, the SOQD phenomenon appears similar to the first order case of quantum decoherence.

Our result shows that, thought the characteristic time of decoherence does not depend on the external field, the phase of the decoherence factor can be well controlled by adjusting the external parameters.

This inequality is violated by a maximally entangled state of two qutrits observed via symmetric three input and three output port beamsplitter only if the amount of noise in the system equals ${11-6\sqrt3 \over 2}\approx 0.308$.

abstract: Many beautiful experiments have been addressed to test standard quantum mechanics against local realistic models. Even if a strong evidence favouring standard quantum mechanics is emerged, a conclusive experiment is still lacking, because of low detection efficiencies. Recently, experiments based on pseudoscalar mesons have been proposed as a way for obtaining a conclusive experiment. In this paper, we investigate if this result can effectively be obtained. Our conclusions, based on a careful analysis of the proposed set ups, are that this will not be possible due to intrinsic limitations of these kind of experiments.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Relaxation of a two-level system (TLS) into a resonant infinite-temperature reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum is studied. The reservoir is described by a complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the TLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in microwave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results are obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\Omega_0\gg\nu$, where $\Omega_0$ is the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\nu$ is the width of the reservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the initial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the decay occurs at $t\sim\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for $t\ll(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\gg(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$ the relaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the coherence decays with the rate on the order of $\nu$, which may be slower by orders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above features are explained by the fact that at $t\ll\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir temporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic). Moreover, we identify the pointer basis, in which the reduction of the state vector occurs. The pointer states are correlated with the reservoir, being dependent on the reservoir phase.

abstract: We generalize the concept of the Wehrl entropy of quantum states which gives a basis-independent measure of their localization in phase space. We discuss the minimal values and the typical values of these R{enyi-Wehrl entropies for pure states for spin systems. According to Lieb's conjecture the minimal values are provided by the spin coherent states. Though Lieb's conjecture remains unproven, we give new proofs of partial results that may be generalized for other systems. We also investigate random pure states and calculate the mean Renyi-Wehrl entropies averaged over the natural measure in the space of pure quantum states.

abstract: We propose definitions of $\QAC^0$, the quantum analog of the classical class $\AC^0$ of constant-depth circuits with AND and OR gates of arbitrary fan-in, and $\QACC[q]$, the analog of the class $\ACC[q]$ where $\Mod_q$ gates are also allowed. We prove that parity or fanout allows us to construct quantum $\MOD_q$ gates in constant depth for any $q$, so $\QACC[2] = \QACC$. More generally, we show that for any $q,p > 1$, $\MOD_q$ is equivalent to $\MOD_p$ (up to constant depth). This implies that $\QAC^0$ with unbounded fanout gates, denoted $\QACwf^0$, is the same as $\QACC[q]$ and $\QACC$ for all $q$. Since $\ACC[p] \ne \ACC[q]$ whenever $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, $\QACC[q]$ is strictly more powerful than its classical counterpart, as is $\QAC^0$ when fanout is allowed. This adds to the growing list of quantum complexity classes which are provably more powerful than their classical counterparts. We also develop techniques for proving upper bounds for $\QACC^0$ in terms of related language classes. We define classes of languages $\EQACC$, $\NQACC$ and $\BQACC_{\rats}$. We define a notion of $\log$-planar $\QACC$ operators and show the appropriately restricted versions of $\EQACC$ and $\NQACC$ are contained in $\P/\poly$. We also define a notion of $\log$-gate restricted $\QACC$ operators and show the appropriately restricted versions of $\EQACC$ and $\NQACC$ are contained in $\TC^0$.

abstract: Although it is impossible for a bit commitment protocol to be both arbitrarily concealing and arbitrarily binding, it is possible for it to be both partially concealing and partially binding. This means that Bob cannot, prior to the beginning of the unveiling phase, find out everything about the bit committed, and Alice cannot, through actions taken after the end of the commitment phase, unveil whatever bit she desires. We determine upper bounds on the degrees of concealment and bindingness that can be achieved simultaneously in any bit commitment protocol, although it is unknown whether these can be saturated. We do, however, determine the maxima of these quantities in a restricted class of bit commitment protocols, namely those wherein all the systems that play a role in the commitment phase are supplied by Alice. We show that these maxima can be achieved using a protocol that requires Alice to prepare a pair of systems in an entangled state, submit one of the pair to Bob at the commitment phase, and the other at the unveiling phase. Finally, we determine the form of the trade-off that exists between the degree of concealment and the degree of bindingness given various assumptions about the purity and dimensionality of the states used in the protocol.

abstract: We showed that in Lamb-Dicke regime and under rotating wave approximation, the dynamical behavior of two trapped ions interacting with a laser beam resonant to the first red side-band of center-of-mass mode can be described by Jaynes-Cummings Model. An exact analytic solution for this kind of Jaynes-Cummings model is presented. The results showed that quantum collapses and revivals for the occupation of two atoms, and squeezing for vibratic motion of center-of-mass mode existed in both two different types of initial conditions. The maximum momentum squeezing for center-of-mass mode in these two types of conditions are found to be 42.4% and 43.8% respectively. The coherence, in the first type of initial conditions can keeps long times, and in the second type of initial conditions, a concrete form of coherent state is obtained, when the initial average number is very small.

abstract: The ultimate limits of continuous-variable single-mode quantum teleportation due to absorption are studied, with special emphasis on (quasi-)monochromatic optical fields propagating through fibers. It is shown that even if an infinitely squeezed two-mode squeezed vacuum were used, the amount of information that would be transferred quantum mechanically over a finite distance is limited and effectively approaches to zero on a length scale that is much shorter than the (classical) absorption length. Only for short distances the state-dependent teleportation fidelity can be close to unity. To realize the largest possibly fidelity, an asymmetrical equipment must be used, where the source of the two-mode squeezed vacuum is nearer to Alice than to Bob and in consequence the coherent displacement performed by Bob cannot be chosen independently of the transmission lengths.

abstract: Quantum entanglement and its paradoxical properties hold the key to an information processing revolution. Much attention has focused recently on the challenging problem of characterizing entanglement. Entanglement for a two qubit system is reasonably well understood, however, the nature and properties of multiple qubit systems are largely unexplored. Motivated by the importance of such systems in quantum computing, we show that typical pure states of N qubits are highly entangled but have decreasing amounts of pairwise entanglement (measured using the Wootter's concurrence formula) as N increases. Above six qubits very few states have any pairwise entanglement, and generally, for a typical pure state of N qubits there is a sharp cut-off where its subsystems of size m become PPT (positive partial transpose i.e., separable or only bound entangled) around N >~ 2m + 3, based on numerical analysis up to N=13.

abstract: The cause of decoherence in a quantum system can be traced back to the interaction with the environment. As it has been pointed out first by Dicke, in a system of N two-level atoms where each of the atoms is individually dipole coupled to the environment, there are collective, subradiant states, that have no dipole coupling to photon modes, and therefore they are expected to decay slower. This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1 dimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a scheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a strongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is excited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an appropriately entangled state of the atoms. By applying subsequent laser pulses at a well defined time instant, it is possible to drive the atomic state into the subradiant, i. e., decoherence free subspace. Up to a certain average number of the photons, the result is independent of the state of the cavity. The analysis of the conditions shows that this scheme is feasible with present day techniques achieved in atom cavity interaction experiments.

One might naively expect that a particle ensemble suffers a greater loss of quantum coherence by interacting with an increasingly randomized distribution of shifts. As we shall see, this is not always true.

abstract: An important measure of bipartite entanglement is the entanglement of formation, which is defined as the minimum average pure state entanglement of all decompositions realizing a given state. A decomposition which achieves this minimum is called an optimal decomposition. However, as for the entanglement of formation, there is not much known about the structure of such optimal decompositions, except for some special cases, like states of two qubits or isotropic states. Here we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of pure states of a finite dimensional bipartite system to form an optimal decomposition. This condition is well suited to treat the question, whether the entanglement of formation is additive or not.

abstract: We study one-dimensional sideband cooling of Cesium atoms strongly confined in a far-detuned optical lattice. The Lamb-Dicke regime is achieved in the lattice direction whereas the transverse confinement is much weaker. The employed sideband cooling method, first studied by Vuletic et al.\cite{Vule98}, uses Raman transitions between Zeeman levels and produces a spin-polarized sample. We present a detailed study of this cooling method and investigate the role of elastic collisions in the system. We accumulate $83(5)%$ of the atoms in the vibrational ground state of the strongly confined motion, and elastic collisions cool the transverse motion to a temperature of $2.8 \mu $K=$0.7 \hbar\omega_{\rm osc}/k_{\rm B}$, where $\omega_{\rm osc}$ is the oscillation frequency in the strongly confined direction. The sample then approaches the regime of a quasi-2D cold gas. We analyze the limits of this cooling method and propose a dynamical change of the trapping potential as a mean of cooling the atomic sample to still lower temperatures. Measurements of the rate of thermalization between the weakly and strongly confined degrees of freedom are compatible with the zero energy scattering resonance observed previously in weak 3D traps. For the explored temperature range the measurements agree with recent calculations of quasi-2D collisions\cite{Petr01}. Transparent analytical models reproduce the expected behavior for $k_{\rm B}T \gg \hbar \omega_{\rm osc}$ and also for $k_{\rm B}T \ll \hbar \omega_{\rm osc}$ where the 2D features are prominent.

abstract: Quantum cryptography has attracted much recent attention due to its potential for providing secret communications that cannot be decrypted by any amount of computational effort. This is the first analysis of the secrecy of a practical implementation of the BB84 protocol that simultaneously takes into account and presents the {\it full} set of complete analytical expressions for effects due to the presence of pulses containing multiple photons in the attenuated output of the laser, the finite length of individual blocks of key material, losses due to error correction, privacy amplification, continuous authentication, errors in polarization detection, the efficiency of the detectors, and attenuation processes in the transmission medium. The analysis addresses eavesdropping attacks on individual photons rather than collective attacks in general. Of particular importance is the first derivation of the necessary and sufficient amount of privacy amplification compression to ensure secrecy against the loss of key material which occurs when an eavesdropper makes optimized individual attacks on pulses containing multiple photons. It is shown that only a fraction of the information in the multiple photon pulses is actually lost to the eavesdropper.

abstract: An undetected eavesdropping attack must produce count rate statistics that are indistinguishable from those that would arise in the absence of such an attack. In principle this constraint should force a reduction in the amount of information available to the eavesdropper. In this paper we illustrate, by considering a particular class of eavesdropping attacks, how the general analysis of this problem may proceed.

abstract: The physically allowed quantum evolutions on a single qubit can be described in terms of their geometry. From a simple parameterisation of unital single-qubit channels, the canonical form of all such channels can be given. The related geometry can be used to understand how to approximate positive maps by completely-positive maps, such as in the case of optimal eavesdropping strategies. These quantum channels can be generated by the appropriate network or through dynamical means. The Str{\o}mer-Woronowisc result can also be understood in terms of this geometry.

abstract: Many observers can simultaneously measure different parts of an environment of a quantum system in order to find out its state. To study this problem we generalize the formalism of conditional master equations to the multiple observer case. To settle some issues of principle which arise in this context (as the state of the system and of the environment are ultimately correlated), we consider an example of a system qubit interacting through controlled nots (CNOTs) with environmental qubits. The state of the system is the easiest to find out for observers who measure in a basis of the environment which is most correlated with the pointer basis of the system. In this case the observers agree the most. Furthermore, the more predictable the pointers are, the easier it is to find the state of the system, and the better is the agreement between different observers.

abstract: We report general properties of N-fold supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. N-fold supersymmetry is characterized by supercharges which are N-th polynomials of momentum. Relations between the anti-commutator of the supercharges and the Hamiltonian, the spectra, the Witten index, the non-renormalization theorems and the quasi-solvability are examined. We also present further investigation about a particular class of N-fold supersymmetric models which we dubbed type A. Algebraic equations which determine a part of spectra of type A models are presented, and the non-renormalization theorem are generalized. Finally, we present a possible generalization of N-fold supersymmetry in multi-dimensional quantum mechanics.

authors: F. Herbut

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106038
abstract: It is pointed out that every mixed state statistical operator is, up to a normalization constant, a super state vector in the Hilbert space of linear Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting in the state space of the quantum system. Hence, the well understood Schmidt canonical expansion of ordinary state vectors can be carried over to mixed states. In particular, it can be utilized for evaluating all the twins, i. e., the opposite-subsystem observables the measurement of one of which is, on account of entanglement, ipso facto also a measurement of the other. This is illustrated in full detail in the case of the Horodecki two spin-one-half-particle states with maximally disordered subsystems.

abstract: Various parameterizations for the orbits under local unitary transformations of three-qubit pure states are analyzed. The interconvertibility, symmetry properties, parameter ranges, calculability and behavior under measurement are looked at. It is shown that the entanglement monotones of any multipartite pure state uniquely determine the orbit of that state under local unitary transformations. It follows that there must be an entanglement monotone for three-qubit pure states which depends on the Kempe invariant defined in [Phys. Rev. A 60, 910 (1999)]. A form for such an entanglement monotone is proposed. A theorem is proved that significantly reduces the number of entanglement monotones that must be looked at to find the maximal probability of transforming one multipartite state to another.

abstract: A number of questions associated with practical implementations of quantum cryptography systems having to do with unconditional secrecy, computational loads and effective secrecy rates in the presence of perfect and imperfect sources are discussed. The different types of unconditional secrecy, and their relationship to general communications security, are discussed in the context of quantum cryptography. In order to actually carry out a quantum cryptography protocol it is necessary that sufficient computational resources be available to perform the various processing steps, such as sifting, error correction, privacy amplification and authentication. We display the full computer machine instruction requirements needed to support a practical quantum cryptography implementation. We carry out a numerical comparison of system performance characteristics for implementations that make use of either weak coherent sources of light or perfect single photon sources, for eavesdroppers making individual attacks on the quantum channel characterized by different levels of technological capability. We find that, while in some circumstances it is best to employ perfect single photon sources, in other situations it is preferable to utilize weak coherent sources. In either case the secrecy level of the final shared cipher is identical, with the relevant distinguishing figure-of-merit being the effective throughput rate.

abstract: A model is presented to describe the recently proposed experiment (J. Raimond, M. Brune and S. Haroche Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 79}, 1964 (1997)) where a mesoscopic superposition of radiation states is prepared in a high-Q cavity which is coupled to a similar resonator. The dynamical coherence loss of such state in the absence of dissipation is reversible and can in principle be observed. We show how this picture is modified due to the presence of the environmental couplings. Analytical expressions for the experimental conditional probabilities and the linear entropy are given. We conclude that the phenomenon can still be observed provided the ratio between the damping constant and the inter-cavities coupling does not exceed about a few percent. This observation is favored for superpositions of states with large overlap.

abstract: We provide a review of both new experimental and theoretical developments in the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect results from the alteration by the boundaries of the zero-point electromagnetic energy. Unique to the Casimir force is its strong dependence on shape, switching from attractive to repulsive as function of the size, geometry and topology of the boundary. Thus the Casimir force is a direct manifestation of the boundary dependence of quantum vacuum. We discuss in depth the general structure of the infinities in the field theory which are removed by a combination of zeta-functional regularization and heat kernel expansion. Different representations for the regularized vacuum energy are given. The Casimir energies and forces in a number of configurations of interest to applications are calculated. We stress the development of the Casimir force for real media including effects of nonzero temperature, finite conductivity of the boundary metal and surface roughness. Also the combined effect of these important factors is investigated in detail on the basis of condensed matter physics and quantum field theory at nonzero temperature. The experiments on measuring the Casimir force are also reviewed, starting first with the older measurements and finishing with a detailed presentation of modern precision experiments. The latter are accurately compared with the theoretical results for real media. At the end of the review we provide the most recent constraints on the corrections to Newtonian gravitational law and other hypothetical long-range interactions at submillimeter range obtained from the Casimir force measurements.

comments: 9 pages

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106046
abstract: The problem of unconditional security of quantum cryptography (i.e. the security which is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of nature rather than by technical limitations) is one of the central points in quantum information theory. We propose a relativistic quantum cryptosystem and prove its unconditional security against any eavesdropping attempts. Relativistic causality arguments allow to demonstrate the security of the system in a simple way. Since the proposed protocol does not employ collective measurements and quantum codes, the cryptosystem can be experimentally realized with the present state-of-art in fiber optics technologies. The proposed cryptosystem employs only the individual measurements and classical codes and, in addition, the key distribution problem allows to postpone the choice of the state encoding scheme until after the states are already received instead of choosing it before sending the states into the communication channel (i.e. to employ a sort of ``antedate'' coding).

abstract: We discuss the discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian describing a two-dimensional quantum particle interacting with an infinite family of point interactions. We suppose that the latter are arranged into a star-shaped graph with N arms and a fixed spacing between the interaction sites. We prove that the essential spectrum of this system is the same as that of the infinite straight "polymer", but in addition there are isolated eigenvalues unless N=2 and the graph is a straight line. We also show that the system has many strongly bound states if at least one of the angles between the star arms is small enough. Examples of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are computed numerically.

abstract: The quantum-mechanical and thermodynamic properties of a 3-level molecular cooling cycle are derived. An inadequacy of earlier models is rectified in accounting for the spontaneous emission and absorption associated with the coupling to the coherent driving field via an environmental reservoir. This additional coupling need not be dissipative, and can provide a thermal driving force - the quantum analog of classical absorption chillers. The dependence of the maximum attainable cooling rate on temperature, at ultra-low temperatures, is determined and shown to respect the recently-established fundamental bound based on the second and third laws of thermodynamics.

abstract: We present security proofs for a protocol for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) based on encoding in finite high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This protocol is an extension of Bennett's and Brassard's basic protocol from two bases, two state encoding to a multi bases, multi state encoding. We analyze the mutual information between the legitimate parties and the eavesdropper, and the error rate, as function of the dimension of the Hilbert space, while considering optimal incoherent and coherent eavesdropping attacks. We obtain the upper limit for the legitimate party error rate to ensure unconditional security when the eavesdropper uses incoherent and coherent eavesdropping strategies. We have also consider realistic noise caused by detector's noise.

After a brief review of the Lindblad theory of quantum dissipative systems and the idea of quantum entanglement in composite quantum systems illustrated by describing the three particle systems, the behavior of entanglement under the influence of dissipative processes is discussed. These issues are of importance in the discussion of quantum nanometric systems of current research.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The well known interpretational difficulties with nonlinear Schr\"odinger and von Neumann equations can be reduced to the problem of computing multiple-time correlation functions in the absence of Heisenberg picture. Having no Heisenberg picture one often resorts to Zeno-type reasoning which explicitly involves the projection postulate as a means of computing conditional and joint probabilities. Although the method works well in linear quantum mechanics, it completely fails for nonlinear evolutions. We propose an alternative way of performing the same task in linear quantum mechanics and show that the method smoothly extends to the nonlinear domain. The trick is to use appropriate time-dependent Hamiltonians which involve "switching-off functions". We apply the technique to the EPR problem in nonlinear quantum mechanics and show that paradoxes of Gisin and Polchinski disappear.

abstract: The entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel is the amount of information per channel use that can be sent over the channel in the limit of many uses of the channel, assuming that the sender and receiver have access to the resource of shared quantum entanglement, which may be used up by the communication protocol. We show that this capacity is given by an expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel: i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs $\rho$, of the entropy of the channel input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of $\rho$ after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement assisted communication--communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information--we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMC's of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.

abstract: We study localization of atomic position when a three-level atom interacts with a quantized standing-wave field in the Ramsey interferometer setup. Both the field quadrature amplitude and the atomic internal state are measured to obtain the atomic position information. It is found that this dual measurement scheme produces an interference pattern superimposed on a diffraction-like pattern in the atomic position distribution, where the former pattern originates from the state-selective measurement and the latter from the field measurement. The present scheme results in a better resolution in the position localization than the field-alone measurement schemes. We also discuss the measurement-correlated mechanical action of the standing-wave field on the atom in the light of Popper's test.

abstract: When two or more subsystems of a quantum system interact with each other they can become entangled. In this case the individual subsystems can no longer be described as pure quantum states. For systems with only 2 subsystems this entanglement can be described using the Schmidt decomposition. This selects a preferred orthonormal basis for expressing the wavefunction and gives a measure of the degree of entanglement present in the system. The extension of this to the more general case of n subsystems is not yet known. We present a review of this process using the standard representation and apply this method to the geometric algebra representation. This latter form has the advantage of suggesting a generalisation to n subsystems.

abstract: Entanglement is considered to be one of the most profound features of quantum mechanics. An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this sense the entangled system is considered inseparable and nonlocal. It is generally believed that entanglement manifests itself mostly in systems consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate experimentally the entanglement of two objects, each consisting of about 10^12 atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the two objects - more precisely, two gas samples of cesium atoms - with a pulse of light, which performs a non-local Bell measurement on collective spins of the samples. The entangled spin state can be maintained for 0.5 millisecond. Besides being of fundamental interest, the robust, long-lived entanglement of material objects demonstrated here is expected to be useful in quantum information processing, including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.

abstract: Consider a system consisting of n d-dimensional quantum particles (qudits), and suppose that we want to optimize the entanglement between each pair. One can ask the following basic question regarding the sharing of entanglement: what is the largest possible value Emax(n,d) of the minimum entanglement between any two particles in the system? (Here we take the entanglement of formation as our measure of entanglement.) For n=3 and d=2, that is, for a system of three qubits, the answer is known: Emax(3,2) = 0.550. In this paper we consider first a system of d qudits and show that Emax(d,d) is greater than or equal to 1. We then consider a system of three particles, with three different values of d. Our results for the three-particle case suggest that as the dimension d increases, the particles can share a greater fraction of their entanglement capacity.

abstract: By using a two-mode description, we show that there exist the multistability, phase transition and associated critical fluctuations in the macroscopic tunneling process between the halves of a double-well trap containing a Bose-Einstein condenstate. The phase transition that two of the triple stable states and a unstable state merge into one stable state or a reverse process takes place whenever the ratio of the mean field energy per particle to the tunneling energy goes across a critical value of order one. The critical fluctuation phenomenon corresponds to squeezed states for the phase difference between the two wells accompanying with large fluctuations of atom numbers.

abstract: We investigate the relative particle number squeezing produced in the excited states of a weakly interacting condensate at zero temperature by stimulated light scattering using a pair of lasers. We shall show that a modest number of relative number squeezed particles can be achieved when atoms with momentum $k$, produced in pairs through collisions in the condensate, are scattered out by their interaction with the lasers. This squeezing is optimal when the momentum $k$ is larger than the inverse healing length, $k>k_0$. This modest number of relative number squeezed particles has the potential to be amplified in four-wave-mixing experiments.

abstract: We study the quantal motion of electrons emitted by a pointlike monochromatic isotropic source into parallel uniform electric and magnetic fields. The two-path interference pattern in the emerging electron wave due to the electric force is modified by the magnetic lens effect which periodically focuses the beam into narrow filaments along the symmetry axis. There, four classical paths interfere. With increasing electron energy, the current distribution changes from a quantum regime governed by the uncertainty principle, to an intricate spatial pattern that yields to a semiclassical analysis.

abstract: Although quantum Monte Carlo is, in principal, an exact method for solving the Schroedinger equation, it is well-known that systems of Fermions still pose a challenge. Thus far all solutions to the "sign problem" remain inefficient (or wrong). The fixed-node approach, however, is efficient, and in many situations remains the best approach. If only we could find the exact nodes, or at least a systematic way to improve the nodes, we would, in effect, bypass the sign problem. Unfortunately, very little is known about wave function nodes, and a systematic study has never been attempted, despite the obvious consequences for improving quantum simulations that such knowledge might generate. In this paper we study the nodal surfaces of simple atomic systems.

abstract: The multiparticle spacetime algebra (MSTA) is an extension of Dirac theory to a multiparticle setting, which was first studied by Doran, Gull and Lasenby. The geometric interpretation of this algebra, which it inherits from its one-particle factors, possesses a number of physically compelling features, including simple derivations of the Pauli exclusion principle and other nonlocal effects in quantum physics. Of particular importance here is the fact that all the operations needed in the quantum (statistical) mechanics of spin 1/2 particles can be carried out in the ``even subalgebra'' of the MSTA. This enables us to ``lift'' existing results in quantum information theory regarding entanglement, decoherence and the quantum/classical transition to space-time. The full power of the MSTA and its geometric interpretation can then be used to obtain new insights into these foundational issues in quantum theory. A system of spin 1/2 particles located at fixed positions in space, and interacting with an external magnetic field and/or with one another via their intrinsic magnetic dipoles provides a simple paradigm for the study of these issues. This paradigm can further be easily realized and studied in the laboratory by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

abstract: What interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a composite quantum system? We provide an efficient algorithm to simulate any desired two-body Hamiltonian evolution using any fixed two-body entangling n-qubit Hamiltonian and local unitaries. It follows that universal quantum computation can be performed using any entangling interaction and local unitary operations.

abstract: We analyze the collective spin noise in interacting spin systems. General expressions are derived for the short time behaviour of spin systems with general spin-spin interactions, and we suggest optimum experimental conditions for the detection of spin squeezing. For Ising models with site dependent nearest neighbour interactions general expressions are presented for the spin squeezing parameter for all times. The reduction of collective spin noise can be used to verify the entangling powers of quantum computer architectures based on interacting spins.

The method is based on the control of photon propagation in coherently driven 3-level atomic media, in which the group velocity is adiabatically reduced to zero. Form-stable coupled excitations of light and matter (``dark-state polaritons'') associated with the propagation of quantum fields in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency are identified, their basic properties discussed and their application for quantum memories for light analyzed.

abstract: Quantum information processing is the use of inherently quantum mechanical phenomena to perform information processing tasks that cannot be achieved using conventional classical information technologies. One famous example is quantum computing, which would permit calculations to be performed that are beyond the reach of any conceivable conventional computer. Initially it appeared that actually building a quantum computer would be extremely difficult, but in the last few years there has been an explosion of interest in the use of techniques adapted from conventional liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to build small quantum computers. After a brief introduction to quantum computing I will review the current state of the art, describe some of the topics of current interest, and assess the long term contribution of NMR studies to the eventual implementation of practical quantum computers capable of solving real computational problems.

abstract: Tight frames and rank-one quantum measurements are shown to be intimately related. In fact, the family of normalized tight frames for the space in which a quantum mechanical system lies is precisely the family of rank-one generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) on that space. Using this relationship, frame-theoretical analogues of various quantum-mechanical concepts and results are developed. The analogue of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is specified (constrained least-squares frame (CLSF)) and the case in which the scaling is free (unconstrained least-squares frame (ULSF)). The well-known canonical frame is shown to be proportional to the ULSF and to coincide with the CLSF with a certain scaling. Finally, the canonical frame vectors corresponding to a geometrically uniform vector set are shown to be geometrically uniform and to have the same symmetries as the original vector set.

abstract: In standard Grover's algorithm for quantum searching, the probability of finding the marked item is not exactly 1. In this Letter we present a modified version of Grover's algorithm that searches a marked state with full successful rate. The modification is done by replacing the phase inversion by two phase rotation through angle $\phi$. The rotation angle is given analytically to be $\phi=2 \arcsin(\sin{\pi\over (4J+6)}\over \sin\beta)$, where $\sin\beta={1\over \sqrt{N}}$, $N$ the number of items in the database, and $J$ an integer equal to or greater than the integer part of $({\pi\over 2}-\beta)/(2\beta)$. Upon measurement at $(J+1)$-th iteration, the marked state is obtained with certainty.

Thus the appearance, in quantum mechanics, of incompatibility and these associated phenomena requires neither explanation nor interpretation.

abstract: We study transformations of conventional (`classical') probabilities induced by context transitions. It is demonstrated that the transition from one complex of conditions to another induces a perturbation of the classical rule for the addition of probabilistic alternatives. We classify such perturbations. It is shown that there are two classes of perturbations: (a) trigonometric interference; (b) hyperbolic interference. In particular, the well known `quantum interference of probabilistic alternatives' can be obtained in classical (but contextual) probabilistic framework. Therefore we need not apply to wave arguments (or consider superposition principle) to get Quantum Statistics. In particular, interference could be a feature of experiments with purely corpuscular objects.

abstract: We study the fermionic vacuum energy of vacua with and without being applied an external magnetic field. The energetic difference of two vacua leads to the vacuum decaying and the vacuum-energy releasing. In the context of quantum field theories, we discuss why and how the vacuum energy can be released by spontaneous photon emissions and/or paramagnetically screening the external magnetic field. In addition, we quantitatively compute the vacuum energy released, the paramagnetic screening effect and the rate and spectrum of spontaneous photon emissions. The possibilities of experimentally detecting such an effect of vacuum-energy releasing and this effect accounting for the anormalous X-ray pulsar are discussed.

The calculation of the required time overhead is mathematically equivalent to a separability problem of n-qubit density matrices. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of chromatic index and the spectrum of the interaction graph. The complexity measure defined by such a computational model is related to gate complexity and a continuous complexity measure introduced in a former paper. We use majorization of graph spectra for classifying Hamiltonians with respect to their computational power.

abstract: We report a quantum eraser experiment which actually uses a Young double-slit to create interference. The experiment can be considered an optical analogy of an experiment proposed by Scully, Englert and Walther. One photon of an entangled pair is incident on a Young double-slit of appropriate dimensions to create an interference pattern in a distant detection region. Quarter-wave plates, oriented so that their fast axes are orthogonal, are placed in front of each slit to serve as which-path markers. The quarter-wave plates mark the polarization of the interfering photon and thus destroy the interference pattern. To recover interference, we measure the polarization of the other entangled photon. In addition, we perform the experiment under delayed erasure circumstances.

Under these circumstances, no relativistic transformation law exists that relates the descriptions of the physical system by observers in relative motion. Still, physical laws are the same in all Lorentz frames.

abstract: We derive the general formula for the capacity of a noiseless quantum channel assisted by an arbitrary amount of noisy entanglement. In this capacity formula, the ratio of the quantum mutual information and the von Neumann entropy of the sender's share of the noisy entanglement plays the role of mutual information in the completely classical case. A consequence of our results is that bound entangled states cannot increase the capacity of a noiseless quantum channel.

abstract: We consider the dynamics of a system coupled to a thermal bath, going beyond the standard two-level system through the addition of an energy excitation degree of freedom. Further extensions are to systems containing many fermions, with the master equations modified to take Fermi-Dirac statistics into account, and to potentials with a time-dependent bias that induce resonant avoided crossing transitions. The limit $Q \to \infty$, where the interaction rate with the bath is much greater than all free oscillation rates for the system, is interrogated. Two behaviors are possible: freezing (quantum Zeno effect) or synchronization (motional narrowing). We clarify the conditions that give rise to each possibility, making an explicit connection with quantum measurement theory. We compare the evolution of quantal coherence for the two cases as a function of $Q$, noting that full coherence is restored as $Q \to \infty$. Using an extended master equation, the effect of system-bath interactions on entanglement in bipartite system states is computed. In particular, we show that the sychronization case sees bipartite system entanglement fully preserved in the large $Q$ limit.

abstract: Well-known Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments show that the time evolution according to (truncated) dipole-dipole interactions between n spins can be inverted by simple pulse sequences. Independent of n, the reversed evolution is only two times slower than the original one. Here we consider more general spin-spin couplings with long range. We prove that some are considerably more complex to invert since the number of required time steps and the slow-down of the reversed evolutions are necessarily of the order n. Furthermore, the spins have to be addressed separately. We show for which values of the coupling parameters the phase transition between simple and complex time-reversal schemes occurs.

A feedback mechanism then decouples the system from the environment as soon as the first photon is absorbed. We propose a possible scheme to implement this process and provide the theoretical tools to describe it.

In the program register the set of instructions (program) is encoded. This program is applied to the data register. The processor can perform any operation on a single qudit of the dimension N with a certain probability. If the operation is unitary, the probability is in general 1/N^2, but for more restricted sets of operators the probability can be higher. In fact, this probability can be independent of the dimension of the qudit Hilbert space of the qudit under some conditions.

We analyze the time dependence of the rate of entropy production showing that it has two relevant regimes: For short times it is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (fixed by the system--environment coupling strength). For longer times (but before equilibration) it is fixed by dynamical properties of the system (and is related to the Lyapunov exponent). The nature of the transition time between both regimes is investigated and the issue of quantum to classical correspondence is addressed. Finally, the impact of the interaction with the environment on coherent tunneling is analyzed.

We compute such Wigner function for states which are relevant for quantum computation. Finally, we discuss properties of quantum algorithms in phase space and present the phase space representation of Grover's quantum search algorithm.

abstract: The amplitude-phase formulation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is investigated within the context of uncoupled Ermakov systems, whereby the amplitude function is given by the auxiliary nonlinear equation. The classical limit of the amplitude and phase functions is analyzed by setting up a semiclassical Ermakov system. In this limit, it is shown that classical quantities, such as the classical probability amplitude and the reduced action, are obtained only when the semiclassical amplitude and the accumulated phase are non-oscillating functions respectively of the space and energy variables. Conversely, among the infinitely many arbitrary exact quantum amplitude and phase functions corresponding to a given wavefunction, only the non-oscillating ones yield classical quantities in the limit $\hbar \to 0$.

abstract: We present here algorithmic cooling (via polarization-heat-bath)- a powerful method for obtaining a large number of highly polarized spins in liquid nuclear-spin systems at finite temperature. Given that spin-half states represent (quantum) bits, algorithmic cooling cleans dirty bits beyond the Shannon's bound on data compression, by employing a set of rapidly thermal-relaxing bits. Such auxiliary bits could be implemented using spins that rapidly get into thermal equilibrium with the environment, e.g., electron spins. Cooling spins to a very low temperature without cooling the environment could lead to a breakthrough in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and our ``spin-refrigerating'' method suggests that this is possible. The scaling of NMR ensemble computers is probably the main obstacle to building useful quantum computing devices, and our spin-refrigerating method suggests that this problem can be resolved.

abstract: Conditions sufficient for a quantum dynamical semigroup (QDS) to be unital are proved for a class of problems in quantum optics with Hamiltonians which are self-adjoint polynomials of any finite order in creation and annihilation operators. The order of the Hamiltonian may be higher than the order of completely positive part of the formal generator of a QDS. The unital property of a minimal quantum dynamical semigroup implies the uniqueness of the solution of the corresponding Markov master equation in the class of quantum dynamical semigroups and, in the corresponding representation, it ensures preservation of the trace or unit operator. We recall that only in the unital case the formal generator of MME determines uniquely the corresponding QDS.

abstract: A classical electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) analogue of the vacuum of quantum field theory has formed the basis for theoretical investigations in the discipline known as random or stochastic electrodynamics (SED) wherein quantum measurements are imitated by the introduction of a stochastic classical background EM field. Random EM fluctuations are assumed to provide perturbations which can mimic some quantum phenomena while retaining a purely classical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the Van-der-Waals force, the Lamb shift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of the harmonic oscillator, and the radius of the Bohr atom. This classical ZPF is represented as a homogeneous, isotropic ensemble of plane waves with fixed amplitudes and random phases. Averaging over the random phases is assumed to be equivalent to taking the ground-state expectation values of the corresponding quantum operator. We demonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics of the classical ZPF in contrast to that of the EM quantum vacuum. We derive the distribution for the individual mode amplitudes in the ground-state as predicted by quantum field theory (QFT) and then carry out the same calculation for the classical ZPF analogue, showing that the distributions are only in approximate agreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We introduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic character, and demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce the statistics of the EM vacuum of QED. Incorporated into SED, this new field is shown to give the correct (QM) distribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator, suggesting the possibility of developing further successful correspondences between SED and QED.

abstract: We prove that all deterministic hidden-variables theories, that reproduce quantum theory for a 'quantum equilibrium' distribution of hidden variables, predict the existence of instantaneous signals at the statistical level for hypothetical 'nonequilibrium ensembles'. This signal-locality theorem generalises yet another property of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and Bohm. The theorem supports the hypothesis that in the remote past the universe relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium (at the hidden-variable level) in which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.

abstract: Many coherence transfer experiments in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, involving network of coupled spins, use temporary spin-decoupling to produce desired effective Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that significant time can be saved in producing an effective Hamiltonian, if spin-decoupling is avoided. We provide time optimal pulse sequences for producing an important class of effective Hamiltonians in three spin networks. These effective Hamiltonians are useful for coherence transfer experiments and implementation of quantum logic gates in NMR quantum computing. It is demonstrated that computing these time optimal pulse sequences can be reduced to geometric problems that involve computing sub-Riemannian geodesics on Homogeneous spaces.

abstract: Continuing the study of mixed-state entanglement in terms of opposite-subsystem observables the measurement of one of which amounts to the same as that of the other (so-called twins), begun in a recent article, so-called strong twin events, which imply biorthogonal mixing of states, are defined and studied. It is shown that for each mixed state there exists a Schmidt canonical (super state vector) expansion in terms of Hermitian operators, and that it can be the continuation of the mentioned biorthogonal mixing due to strong twins. The case of weak twins and nonhermitian Schmidt canonical expansion is also investigated. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of nontrivial twins for separable states is derived.

However, I believe that this idea is flawed, and I suggest the following experiments as a way of demonstrating the influence of consciousness on physical systems.

Background arguments are given, where it is claimed that 'pain' consciousness is correlated in a certain way with the binding of opiates to receptors in the brain. Key Words: state reduction, state collapse, macroscopic superpositions, PET scan, autoradiography.

abstract: This paper is an investigation of the class of real classical Markov processes without a birth process that will generate the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions. The Markov process is assumed to evolve in an extra (ordinal) time dimension. The derivation requires that occupation by the Dirac particle of a space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector. Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time (including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of observation.

abstract: A new concept of the constitution of Nature is proposed. The constructed submicroscopic quantum mechanics is deterministic and is characterised by elementary excitations of the space net that is treated as the tessellation of balls, or superparticles. Said excitations called "inertons" accompany any canonical particle when it moves. It is shown theoretically that the introduction of inertons obviates all conceptual difficulties of orthodox quantum mechanics. The theory has been verified experimentally. It is argued that just inertons play the role of real carriers in the gravitational interaction.

abstract: The problem is considered of describing the dynamics of quantum systems generated by a nonlocal in time interaction. It is shown that the use of the Feynman approach to quantum theory in combination with the canonical approach allows one to extend quantum dynamics to describe the time evolution in the case of such interactions. In this way, using only the current concepts of quantum theory, a generalized equation of motion for state vectors is derived. In the case, where the fundamental interaction generating the dynamics in a system is local in time, this equation is equivalent to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Explicit examples are given for an exactly solvable model. The proposed formalism is shown to provide a new insight into the problem of the description of nonlocal interactions in quantum field theory. It is shown that such a property of the equation of motion as nonlocality in time may be important for describing hadron-hadron interactions at low and intermediate energies.

abstract: A representation of the Dirac algebra, derived from first principles, can be related to the combinations of unit charges which determine particle structures. The algebraic structure derives from a broken symmetry between 4-vectors and quaternions which can be applied to the broken symmetry between the three nongravitational interactions. The significance of this relation for Grand Unification is derived by explicit calculation of the running values of the fine structure constants, with suggestions for the calculation of particle masses.

We show that an enlargement of the phase space and of its motion group and an account for the diffusion motions of microsystems in the enlarged space, the motions which act by small random translations along the enlarged group, lead to observable quantum effects. This approach enables one to recover probability distributions in the phase space for wave functions. The parameters of the model considered here are estimated on the base of Lamb's shift in the spectrum of the hydrogen's atom.

abstract: In this paper, we study the controllability properties and the Lie algebra structure of networks of particles with spin immersed in an electro-magnetic field. We relate the Lie algebra structure to the properties of a graph whose nodes represent the particles and an edge connects two nodes if and only if the interaction between the two corresponding particles is active. For networks with different gyromagnetic ratios, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition of controllability in terms of the properties of the above mentioned graph and describe the Lie algebra structure in every case. For these systems all the controllability notions, including the possibility of driving the evolution operator and/or the state, are equivalent. For general networks (with possibly equal gyromagnetic ratios), we give a sufficient condition of controllability. A general form of interaction among the particles is assumed which includes both Ising and Heisenberg models as special cases. Assuming Heisenberg interaction we provide an analysis of low dimensional cases (number of particles less then or equal to three) which include necessary and sufficient controllability conditions as well as a study of their Lie algebra structure. This also, provides an example of quantum mechanical systems where controllability of the state is verified while controllability of the evolution operator is not.

It can be easily stated as follows: Once a quantum stochastic evolution scheme is assumed, the incompatibility between the Markov property and the notion of quantum jump is rapidly established.

abstract: The rise in linear entropy of a subsystem in the N-atom Jaynes-Cummings model is shown to be strongly influenced by the shape of the classical orbits of the underlying classical phase space: we find a one-to-one correspondence between maxima (minima) of the linear entropy and maxima (minima) of the expectation value of atomic excitation J_z. Since the expectation value of this operator can be viewed as related to the orbit radius in the classical phase space projection associated to the atomic degree of freedom, the proximity of the quantum wave packet to this atomic phase space borderline produces a maximum rate of entanglement. The consequence of this fact for initial conditions centered at periodic orbits in regular regions is a clear periodic recoherence. For chaotic situations the same phenomenon (proximity of the atomic phase space borderline) is in general responsible for oscillations in the entanglement properties.

abstract: Entanglement, according to Erwin Schroedinger the essence of quantum mechanics, is at the heart of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and of the so called quantum-nonlocality - the fact that a local realistic explanation of quantum mechanics is not possible as quantitatively expressed by violation of Bell's inequalities. Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most quantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still widely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of quantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local realism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing Schroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a natural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that the amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the information in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in properties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to a rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending Bell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that summarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the correlations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell inequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum entanglement. Most importantly, the two criteria agree in essence, though the two approaches are conceptually very different. This concurrence strongly supports the information-theoretic interpretation of quantum entanglement and of quantum physics in general.

In all experiments of this kind the relation between visibility, efficiency, and Bell violation is generally unknown. In this paper we show that simulations based on a local hidden variables models for entangled photons provide this information. It is established that these properties are closely related by the way, in which photons are detected after a polarizer beam splitter. On this basis we suggest controlled experiments which, for the first time, subject the superposition principle to experimental tests.

abstract: A new ultra bright pulsed source of polarization entangled photons has been realized using type-II phase matching in spontaneous parametric down conversion process in two cascaded crystals. The optical axes of the crystals are aligned in such a way that the extraordinarily (ordinarily) polarized cone from one crystal overlaps with the ordinarily (extraordinarily) polarized cone from the second crystal. This spatial overlapping removes the association between the polarization and the output angle of the photons that exist in a single type-II down conversion process. Hence, entanglement of photons originating from any point on the output cones is possible if a suitable optical delay line is used. This delay line is particularly simple and easy to implement.

In this approach we show that there is a kind of dual one-to-one correspondence between the candidates of the two concepts. We emphasis that Fisher informations are obtained from relative entropies as contrast functions on the state space and argue that the scalar curvature might be interpreted as an uncertainty density on a statistical manifold.

abstract: We consider the problem of steering control for the systems of one spin 1/2 particle and two interacting homonuclear spin 1/2 particles in an electro-magnetic field. The describing models are bilinear systems whose state varies on the Lie group of special unitary matrices of dimensions two and four, respectively. By performing decompositions of Lie groups, taking into account the describing equations at hand, we derive control laws to steer the state of the system to any desired final configuration. Explicit formulas are given for the parameters involved in the control algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithms allow for arbitrary bounds on the magnitude of the controls and for some flexibility in the specification of the final time which must be greater than a given value but otherwise arbitrary.

These notions involve the possibility of driving the evolution operator as well as the state of the system. We establish the connections among these different notions as well as methods to verify controllability. The paper also contains results on the relation between the controllability in arbitrary small time of a system varying on a compact transformation Lie group and the corresponding system on the associated homogeneous space. As an application, we prove that, for the system of two interacting spin 1/2 particles, not every state transfer can be obtained in arbitrary small time.

abstract: We develop a new variant of the wave-packet analysis and solve the tunneling time problem for one particle. Our approach suggests an individual asymptotic description of the quantum subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles both at the final and initial stage of tunneling. We find the initial states of both subensembles, which are non-orthogonal. The latter reflects ultimately the fact that at the initial stage of tunneling it is impossible to predict whether a particle will be transmitted through or reflected off the barrier. At the same time, in this case, one can say about the to-be-transmitted and to-be-reflected subensembles of particles. We show that before the interaction of the incident packet with the barrier both the number of particles and the expectation value of the particle's momentum are constant for each subensemble. Besides, these asymptotic quantities coincide with those of the corresponding scattered subensemble. On the basis of this formalism we define individual delay times for both scattering channels. Taking into account the spreading of wave packets, we define the low bound of the scattering time to describe the whole quantum ensemble of particles. All three characteristic times are derived in terms of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators. The condition which must be fulfilled for completed scattering events is derived. We propose also the scheme of a {\it gedanken} experiment that allows one to verify our approach.

abstract: We use the quantum action to study quantum chaos at finite temperature. We present a numerical study of a classically chaotic 2-D Hamiltonian system - harmonic oscillators with anharmonic coupling. We construct the quantum action non-perturbatively and find temperature dependent quantum corrections in the action parameters. We compare Poincar\'{e} sections of the quantum action at finite temperature with those of the classical action.

abstract: In this article we propose an approach that models the truth behavior of cognitive entities (i.e. sets of connected propositions) by taking into account in a very explicit way the possible influence of the cognitive person (the one that interacts with the considered cognitive entity). Hereby we specifically apply the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics because of the fact that this formalism allows the description of real contextual influences, i.e. the influence of the measuring apparatus on the physical entity. We concentrated on the typical situation of the liar paradox and have shown that (1) the truth-false state of this liar paradox can be represented by a quantum vector of the non-product type in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space and the different cognitive interactions by the actions of the corresponding quantum projections, (2) the typical oscillations between false and truth - the paradox -is now quantum dynamically described by a Schrodinger equation. We analyse possible philosophical implications of this result.

abstract: We present an analysis of quantum mechanics and its problems and paradoxes taking into account the results that have been obtained during the last two decades by investigations in the field of `quantum structures research'. We concentrate mostly on the results of our group FUND at Brussels Free University. By means of a spin 1/2 model where the quantum probability is generated by the presence of fluctuations on the interactions between measuring apparatus and physical system, we show that the quantum structure can find its origin in the presence of these fluctuations. This appraoch, that we have called the 'hidden measurement approach', makes it possible to construct systems that are in between quantum and classical. We show that two of the traditional axioms of quantum axiomatics are not satisfied for these 'in between quantum and classical' situations, and how this structural shortcoming of standard quantum mechanics is at the origin of most of the quantum paradoxes. We show that in this approach the EPR paradox identifies a genuine incompleteness of standard quantum mechanics, however not an incompleteness that means the lacking of hidden variables, but an incompleteness pointing at the impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum systems. We indicate in which way, by redefining the meaning of density states, standard quantum mechanics can be completed. We put forward in which way the axiomatic approach to quantum mechanics can be compared to the traditional axiomatic approach to relativity theory, and how this might lead to studying another road to unification of both theories.

abstract: In the Bayesian approach to probability theory, probability quantifies a degree of belief for a single trial, without any a priori connection to limiting frequencies. In this paper we show that, despite being prescribed by a fundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of the information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world, maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment, and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.

abstract: We consider Hamiltonians, which are even polynomials of the forth order with the respect to Bose operators. We find subspaces, preserved by the action of Hamiltonian These subspaces, being finite-dimensional, include, nonetheless, states with an \QTR{it}{infinite} number of quasi-particles, corresponding to the original Bose operators. The basis functions look rather simple in the coherent state representation and are expressed in terms of the degenerate hypergeometric function with respect to the complex variable labeling the representation. In some particular degenerate cases they turn (up to the power factor) into the trigonometric or hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions or combinations of the exponent and Hermit polynomials. We find explicitly the relationship between coefficients at different powers of Bose operators that ensure quasi-exact solvability of Hamiltonian.

abstract: An evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) was originally defined as a static concept but later given a dynamic characterization. A well known theorem in evolutionary game theory says that an ESS is an attractor of replicator dynamics but not every attractor is an ESS. We search for a dynamic characterization of ESSs in quantum games and find that in certain asymmetric bi-matrix games evolutionary stability of attractors can change as the game switches between its two forms, one classical and the other quantum.

abstract: A beam splitter is a simple, readily available device which can act to entangle the output optical fields. We show that a necessary condition for the fields at the output of the beam splitter to be entangled is that the pure input states exhibit nonclassical behavior. We generalize this proof for arbitrary (pure or impure) Gaussian input states. Specifically, nonclassicality of the input Gaussian fields is a necessary condition for entanglement of the field modes with the help of the beam splitter. We conjecture that this is a general property of the beam splitter: Nonclassicality of the inputs is a necessary condition for entangling fields in the beam splitter.

abstract: The quantum mechanical equivalent of parametric resonance is studied. A simple model of a periodically kicked harmonic oscillator is introduced which can be solved exactly. Classically stable and unstable regions in parameter space are shown to correspond to Floquet operators with qualitatively different properties. Their eigenfunctions, which are calculated exactly, exhibit a transition: for parameter values with classically stable solutions the eigenstates are normalizable while they cannot be normalized for parameter values with classically instable solutions. Similarly, the spectrum of quasi energies undergoes a specific transition. These observations remain valid qualitatively for arbitrary linear systems exhibiting classically parametric resonance such as the paradigm example of a frequency modulated pendulum described by Mathieu's equation.

abstract: A classical statistical field theory hidden variable model for the quantized Klein-Gordon model is constructed that preserves relativistic signal locality and is relativistically covariant, but is at the same time relativistically nonlocal, paralleling the Hegerfeldt nonlocality of quantum theory. It is argued that the relativistic nonlocality of this model is acceptable to classical physics, but in any case the approach taken here characterizes the nonlocality of the quantized Klein-Gordon model in terms of concepts from classical statistical field theory.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106149
abstract: General relation is derived which expresses the fidelity of quantum dynamics, measuring the stability of time evolution to small static variation in the hamiltonian, in terms of ergodicity of an observable generating the perturbation as defined by its time correlation function. Fidelity for ergodic dynamics is predicted to decay exponentially on time-scale proportional to delta^(-2) where delta is the strength of perturbation, whereas faster, typically gaussian decay on shorter time scale proportional to delta^(-1) is predicted for integrable, or generally non-ergodic dynamics. This surprising result is demonstrated in quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain periodically kicked with a tilted magnetic field where we find finite parameter-space regions of non-ergodic and non-integrable motion in thermodynamic limit.

Our thinking is applied to the quantum Fourier transformation where an alternative 'less regular' quantum algorithm is devised which is qualitatively more robust against static random residual n-qubit interaction.

abstract: We consider the simple hypothesis of letting quantum systems have an inherent random nature. Using well-known stochastic methods we thus derive a stochastic evolution operator which let us define a stochastic density operator whose expectation value under certain conditions satisfies a Lindblad equation. As natural consequences of the former assumption decoherence and spontaneous emission processes are obtained under the same conceptual scheme. A temptative solution for the preferred basis problem is suggested. All this is illustrated with a comprehensive study of a two-level quantum system evolution.

This can be used to study quantum systems that generate text that has meaning. A simple example of such a system, based on an example described by Smullyan, is studied here. Based on a path interpretation for some word states, definitions of truth, validity, consistency and completeness are given and their properties studied. It is also shown that the relation between the meaning, if any, of word states and the algorithmic complexity of the process generating the states must be quite complex or nonexistent.

We show that, restated in quantum field theoretic language, the experiment submits to a simple explanation: that wave- or particle-nature is imposed not at the slit plane but at the detector system. The intepretational difficulty conventionally encountered is due to the assumption of enforcement of complementarity at the former.

abstract: Results obtained in two recent papers, \cite{Kaszlikowski} and \cite{Durt}, seem to indicate that the nonlocal character of the correlations between the outcomes of measurements performed on entangled systems separated in space is not robust in the presence of noise. This is surprising, since entanglement itself is robust. Here we revisit this problem and argue that the class of gedanken-experiments considered in \cite{Kaszlikowski} and \cite{Durt} is too restrictive. By considering a more general class, involving sequences of measurements, we prove that the nonlocal correlations are in fact robust.

abstract: In this Paper we present an approach to Quantum Mechanical Canonical Transformations. Our main result is that Time Dependent Quantum Canonical Transformations can always be cast in the form of Squeezing Operators. We revise the main properties of these operators in regard to its Lie group properties, how two of them can be combined to yield another operator of the same class and how can also be decomposed and fragmented. In the second part of the paper we show how this procedure works extremely well for the Time Dependent Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. The issue of the systematic construction of Quantum Canonical Transformations is also discussed along the lines of Dirac, Wigner and Schwinger ideas and to the more recent work by Lee. The main conclusion is that the Classical Phase Space Transformation can be maintained in the operator formalism but the construction of the Quantum Canonical Transformation is not clearly related to the Classical Generating Function of a Classical Canonical Transformation. We propose the road of Squeezing Operators rather than the old one attached to Quantum Operators constructed under the guideline of the exponential of the Classical Generating Function.

We show that the recently proposed quantum action is well suited to answer those questions. As an example we study chaotic behavior of the 2-D anharmonic oscillator and compare classical with quantum chaos. Moreover, we study quantum chaos as function of temperature (the classical system can be considered as the limit where temperature goes to infinity).

abstract: We prove new lower bounds for bounded error quantum communication complexity. Our methods are based on the Fourier transform of the considered functions. First we generalize a method for proving classical communication complexity lower bounds developed by Raz to the quantum case. Applying this method we give an exponential separation between bounded error quantum communication complexity and nondeterministic quantum communication complexity. We develop several other lower bound methods based on the Fourier transform, notably showing that \sqrt{\bar{s}(f)/\log n}, for the average sensitivity \bar{s}(f) of a function f, yields a lower bound on the bounded error quantum communication complexity of f(x AND y XOR z), where x is a Boolean word held by Alice and y,z are Boolean words held by Bob. We then prove the first large lower bounds on the bounded error quantum communication complexity of functions, for which a polynomial quantum speedup is possible. For all the functions we investigate, the only previously applied general lower bound method based on discrepancy yields bounds that are O(\log n).

Our procedure involves tailoring the time dependence of the coupling between neighboring spins. We derive an effective Hamiltonian which permits a systematic analysis of this tailoring. Time-symmetric pulsing of the coupling automatically eliminates several undesirable terms in this Hamiltonian. Well chosen pulse shapes can produce an effectively isotropic exchange gate, which can be used in universal quantum computation with appropriate coding.

The interferometer is realized via a dynamic splitting potential that transforms from a single well into two separate wells and back. The ports of the interferometer are neighboring vibrational states in the single well potential. We present a one-dimensional model of this interferometer and compute the probability of unwanted vibrational excitations for a realistic magnetic potential. We optimize the speed of the splitting process in order suppress these excitations and conclude that such interferometer device should be feasible with currently available microtrap technique.

Their invariant subspaces correspond to even and odd numbers of particle-hole excitations.

abstract: We demonstrate a class of optimum detection strategies for extracting the maximum information from sets of equiprobable real symmetric qubit states of a single photon. These optimum strategies have been predicted by Sasaki et al. [Phys. Rev. A{\bf 59}, 3325 (1999)]. The peculiar aspect is that the detections with at least three outputs suffice for optimum extraction of information regardless of the number of signal elements. The cases of ternary (or trine), quinary, and septenary polarization signals are studied where a standard von Neumann detection (a projection onto a binary orthogonal basis) fails to access the maximum information. Our experiments demonstrate that it is possible with present technologies to attain about 96% of the theoretical limit.

abstract: We propose a wave packet basis for storing and processing several qubits of quantum information in a single multilevel atom. Using radially localized wave packet states in the Rydberg atom, we construct an orthogonal basis that is related to the usual energy level basis by a quantum Fourier transform. A transform-limited laser pulse that is short compared with the classical Kepler period of the system interacts mainly with the wave packet state localized near the atomic core, allowing selective control in this basis. We argue that wave packet control in this regime is useful for multilevel quantum information processing.

abstract: This paper reports three almost trivial theorems that nevertheless appear to have significant import for quantum foundations studies. 1) A Gleason-like derivation of the quantum probability law, but based on the positive operator-valued measures as the basic notion of measurement (see also Busch, quant-ph/9909073). Of note, this theorem also works for 2-dimensional vector spaces and for vector spaces over the rational numbers, where the standard Gleason theorem fails. 2) A way of rewriting the quantum collapse rule so that it looks almost precisely identical to Bayes rule for updating probabilities in classical probability theory. And 3) a derivation of the tensor-product rule for combining quantum systems (and with it the very notion of quantum entanglement) from Gleason-like considerations for local measurements on bipartite systems along with classical communication.

For the first time, we give a complete analytical result for the deformation induced change in Casimir energy \delta\cal E in an experimentally testable, nontrivial geometry, consisting of a flat and a corrugated plate. Our results show an interesting crossover for \delta\cal E as a function of the ratio of the mean plate distance H, to the corrugation length \lambda: For \lambda \ll H we find a {\em slower} decay \sim H^{-4}, compared to the H^{-5} behavior predicted by the commonly used pairwise summation of van der Waals forces, which is valid only for \lambda \gg H.

abstract: Using a Boltzmann equation, we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of nonperturbative fluctuations within the context of Ginzburg-Landau models. As an illustration, we examine how a two-phase system initially prepared in a homogeneous, low-temperature phase becomes populated by precursors of the opposite phase as the temperature is increased. We compute the critical value of the order parameter for the onset of percolation, which signals the breakdown of the conventional dilute gas approximation.

abstract: The silicon-based quantum computer proposal has been one of the intensely pursued ideas during the past three years. Here we calculate the donor electron exchange in silicon and germanium, and demonstrate an atomic-scale challenge for quantum computing in Si (and Ge), as the six (four) conduction band minima in Si (Ge) lead to inter-valley electronic interferences, generating strong oscillations in the exchange splitting of two-donor two-electron states. Donor positioning with atomic scale precision within the unit cell thus becomes a decisive factor in determining the strength of the exchange coupling--a fundamental ingredient for two-qubit operations in a silicon-based quantum computer.

abstract: We demonstrate theoretically the use of genetic learning algorithms to coherently control the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We consider specifically the situation of a condensate in an optical lattice formed by two counterpropagating laser beams. The frequency detuning between the lasers acts as a control parameter that can be used to precisely manipulate the condensate even in the presence of a significant mean-field energy. We illustrate this procedure in the coherent acceleration of a condensate and in the preparation of a superposition of prescribed relative phase.

abstract: We provide a semiclassical theory of tunneling decay in a magnetic field and a three-dimensional potential of a general form. Because of broken time-reversal symmetry, the standard WKB technique has to be modified. The decay rate is found from the analysis of the set of the particle Hamiltonian trajectories in complex phase space and time. In a magnetic field, the tunneling particle comes out from the barrier with a finite velocity and behind the boundary of the classically allowed region. The exit location is obtained by matching the decaying and outgoing WKB waves at a caustic in complex configuration space. Different branches of the WKB wave function match on the switching surface in real space, where the slope of the wave function sharply changes. The theory is not limited to tunneling from potential wells which are parabolic near the minimum. For parabolic wells, we provide a bounce-type formulation in a magnetic field. The theory is applied to specific models which are relevant to tunneling from correlated two-dimensional electron systems in a magnetic field parallel to the electron layer.

abstract: Let us abandon for a moment the strict epistemological standpoint of quantum field theory, that eventually comes to declare nonsensical any question about the photon posed outside the quantum theoretical framework. We can then avail of the works by Whittaker et al. and by Synge about the particle and the wave model of the photon in the vacuum of general relativity. We can also rely on important results found by Gordon and by Pham Mau Quan: thanks to Gordon's discovery of an effective metric these authors have been able to reduce to the vacuum case several problems of the electromagnetic theory of dielectrics. The joint use of these old findings allows one to conclude that a quantum theoretical photon in an isotropic dielectric has a classical simile only if the dielectric is also homogeneous.

abstract: We consider quantum mechanics on the noncommutative plane in the presence of magnetic field $B$. We show, that the model has two essentially different phases separated by the point $B\theta=c\hbar^2/e$, where $\theta$ is a parameter of noncommutativity. In this point the system reduces to exactly-solvable one-dimensional system. When $\kappa=1-eB\theta/c\hbar^2<0$ there is a finite number of states corresponding to the given value of the angular momentum. In another phase, i.e. when $\kappa>0$ the number of states is infinite. The perturbative spectrum near the critical point $\kappa=0$ is computed.

abstract: The interaction of an electron with a polar molecule is shown to be the simplest realization of a quantum anomaly in a physical system. The existence of a critical dipole moment for electron capture and formation of anions, which has been confirmed experimentally and numerically, is derived. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the anomaly associated with quantum symmetry breaking of the classical scale invariance exhibited by the point-dipole interaction. Finally, analysis of symmetry breaking for this system is implemented within two different models: point dipole subject to an anomaly and finite dipole subject to explicit symmetry breaking.

abstract: In modern fundamental theories there is consideration of higher dimensions, often in the context of what can be written as a Schr\"odinger equation. Thus, the energetics of bound states in different dimensions is of interest. By considering the quantum square well in continuous $D$ dimensions, it is shown that there is always a bound state for $0<D \le 2$. This binding is complete for D \to 0 and exponentially small for D \to 2_-. For D>2, a finite-sized well is always needed for there to be a bound state. This size grows like D^2 as D gets large. By adding the proper angular momentum tail a volcano, zero-energy, bound state can be obtained.

abstract: Recent developments in local quantum physics have led to revolutionary conceptual changes in the thinking about a more intrinsic formulation and in particular about unexpected aspects of localized degrees of freedom. This paradigmatic change is most spectacular in a new rigorous form of ``holography'' and ``transplantation'' as generic properties in QFT beyond the rather special geometric black hole setting in which the geometric manifestations of these properties were first noted. This new setting is also the natural arena for understanding the rich world of ``black hole analogs'' (``dumb holes'' for phonons). The mathematical basis for all this is the extremely powerful Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in operator algebras. The rich consequences of the impressive blend of this theory with physical localization entails among other things the presence of ``fuzzy'' acting infinite dimensional symmetry groups, a spacetime interpretation and derivation of the d=1+1 Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra (i.e. a better understanding of the bootstrap-formfactor approach) and the noncommutative multiparticle structure of ``free'' anyons based on the use of Wigner representation theory.

We obtain the asymptotic form of the band spectrum of $H_{\beta}$ as $\beta$ tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove the existence of the band gap of $\sigma(H_{\beta})$ for sufficiently large $\beta>0$. Finally, we also derive the spectral behaviour for $\beta\to\infty$ in the case when $\Gamma$ is non-periodic and asymptotically straight.

abstract: This paper surveys some recent developments towards a dynamic quantum logic and outlines its explicite construction -- some analogies and contrasts with other logics of dynamics are indicated. Abstract: The development of ``(static) operational quantum logic" points out that classical boolean structures are too rigid to describe the actual and potential properties of quantum systems. On the other hand, an intuitionistic perspective on operational quantum logic, guides us in the direction of incorporating dynamics logically by reconsidering the primitive propositions required to describe the behavior of a quantum system, in particular in view of the emergent disjunctivity due to the non-determinism of quantum measurements. A further elaboration on "intuitionistic quantum logic" emerges into a "dynamic operational quantum logic", which allows us to express dynamic reasoning in the sense that we can capture how actual properties propagate, including their temporal causal structure, and provides a unified logical description of systems which evolve or which are submitted to measurements. This setting reveals that even static operational quantum logic bears a hidden dynamic ingredient in terms of what is called "the orthomodularity" of the lattice-structure. Focusing on the quantale semantics for dynamic operational quantum logic, we delineate some points of difference with the existing quantale semantics for (non)-commutative linear logic.

abstract: The classical and quantum dynamics of a particle trapped in a one-dimensional infinite square well with a time periodic pulsed field is investigated. This is a two-parameter non-KAM generalization of the kicked rotor, which can be seen as the standard map of particles subjected to both smooth and hard potentials. The virtue of the generalization lies in the introduction of an extra parameter R which is the ratio of two length scales, namely the well width and the field wavelength. If R is a non-integer the dynamics is discontinuous and non-KAM. We have explored the role of R in controlling the localization properties of the eigenstates. In particular the connection between classical diffusion and localization is found to generalize reasonably well. In unbounded chaotic systems such as these, while the nearest neighbour spacing distribution of the eigenvalues is less sensitive to the nature of the classical dynamics, the distribution of participation ratios of the eigenstates proves to be a sensitive measure; in the chaotic regimes the latter being lognormal. We find that the tails of the well converged localized states are exponentially localized despite the discontinuous dynamics while the bulk part shows fluctuations that tend to be closer to Random Matrix Theory predictions. Time evolving states show considerable R dependence and tuning R to enhance classical diffusion can lead to significantly larger quantum diffusion for the same field strengths, an effect that is potentially observable in present day experiments.

abstract: We propose the second moment of the Husimi distribution as a measure of complexity of quantum states. The inverse of this quantity represents the effective volume in phase space occupied by the Husimi distribution, and has a good correspondence with chaoticity of classical system. Its properties are similar to the classical entropy proposed by Wehrl, but it is much easier to calculate numerically. We calculate this quantity in the quartic oscillator model, and show that it works well as a measure of chaoticity of quantum states.

abstract: A novel approach is suggested for the statistical description of quantum systems of interacting particles. The key point of this approach is that a typical eigenstate in the energy representation (shape of eigenstates, SE) has a well defined classical analog which can be easily obtained from the classical equations of motion. Therefore, the occupation numbers for single-particle states can be represented as a convolution of the classical SE with the quantum occupation number operator for non-interacting particles. The latter takes into account the wavefunctions symmetry and depends on the unperturbed energy spectrum only. As a result, the distribution of occupation numbers $n_s$ can be numerically found for a very large number of interacting particles. Using the model of interacting spins we demonstrate that this approach gives a correct description of $n_s$ even in a deep quantum region with few single-particle orbitals.

We construct represention via exact nonlinear high-localized periodic eigenmodes expansions, which allows to control contribution to motion from each scale of underlying multiscale structure and consider qualitative approach to the problem.

abstract: An inequality in quantum mechanics, which does not appear to be well known, is derived by elementary means and shown to be quite useful. The inequality applies to 'all' operators and 'all' pairs of quantum states, including mixed states. It generalizes the rule of the orthogonality of eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues and is shown to imply all the Robertson generalized uncertainty relations. It severely constrains the difference between probabilities obtained from 'close' quantum states and the different responses they can have to unitary transformations. Thus, it is dubbed a master inequality. With appropriate definitions the inequality also holds throughout general probability theory and appears not to be well known there either. That classical inequality is obtained here in an appendix. The quantum inequality can be obtained from the classical version but a more direct quantum approach is employed here. A similar but weaker classical inequality has been reported by Uffink and van Lith.
