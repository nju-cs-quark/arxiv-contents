abstract: Although the initial proposal for ion trap quantum computation made use of an auxiliary internal level to perform logic between ions, this resource is not necessary in principle. Instead, one may perform such operations directly using sideband laser pulses, operating with an arbitrary (sufficiently small) Lamb-Dicke parameter. We explore the potential of this technique, showing how to perform logical operations between the internal state of an ion and the collective motional state and giving explicit constructions for a controlled-not gate between ions.

abstract: Although the conditions for performing arbitrary unitary operations to simulate the dynamics of a closed quantum system are well understood, the same is not true of the more general class of quantum operations (also known as superoperators) corresponding to the dynamics of open quantum systems. We propose a framework for the generation of Markovian quantum dynamics and study the resources needed for universality. For the case of a single qubit, we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general. We also obtain preliminary results for the unital case in higher dimensions.
