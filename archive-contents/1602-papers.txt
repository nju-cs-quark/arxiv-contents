abstract: We construct a new class of quantum error-correcting codes for a bosonic mode which are advantageous for applications in quantum memories, communication, and scalable computation. These `binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to `cat codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and down-conversion.

abstract: We study the functioning of a three-level thermal machine when acting on a many-qubit system, the entire system being placed in an electromagnetic field in a stationary out-of-thermal-equilibrium configuration. This realistic setup stands in between the two so-far explored cases of single-qubit and macroscopic object targets, providing information on the scaling with system size of purely quantum properties in thermodynamic contexts. We show that, thanks to the presence of robust correlations among the qubits induced by the field, thermodynamic tasks can be delivered by the machine both locally to each qubit and collectively to the many-qubit system: this allows a task to be delivered also on systems much bigger than the machine size.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality, an analogue of Bell's inequality involving correlations of measurements on a system at different times, stands as one of the hallmark tests of quantum mechanics against classical predictions. Neutrinos, and in particular the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, should adhere to quantum-mechanical predictions and provide an observable violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality. We demonstrate how oscillation phenomena can be used to test for violations of the classical bound. A study of the MINOS experiment's data shows a greater than 6{\sigma} violation over a distance of 735 km, representing the longest distance over which either the Leggett-Garg inequality or Bell's inequality has been tested. By exploiting stationarity and the prepared-ensemble condition, rather than weak measurements, our results provide strong evidence against "hidden-variable theories," which are deterministic alternatives to quantum mechanics. Several alternative tests of the Leggett-Garg inequality with neutrino oscillations are also discussed.

abstract: Three-level quantum systems, which possess some unique characteristics beyond two-level ones, such as electromagnetically induced transparency, coherent trapping, and Raman scatting, play important roles in solid-state quantum information processing. Here, we introduce a new approach to implement the physically feasible three-level superadiabatic quantum driving with multiple Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics (MSDs). It can be used to control accurately fast population transfer and entanglement generation for three-level quantum systems in a superadiabatic way. Moreover, we propose an experimentally realizable hybrid architecture, based on two nitrogen-vacancy-center ensembles coupled to a transmission line resonator, to realize our superadiabatic scheme which requires less physical resources and simple procedures, and it is more robust against environmental noises and control parameter variations than conventional adiabatic passage techniques. All these features inspire the further application of MSDs on robust quantum information processing in experiment.

abstract: We propose a heralded quantum repeater based on the scattering of photons off single emitters in one-dimensional waveguides. We show the details by implementing nonlocal entanglement generation, entanglement swapping, and entanglement purification modules with atoms in waveguides, and discuss the feasibility of the repeater with currently achievable technology. The scheme features a filtering mechanism that the faulty events can be discarded by detecting the polarization of the photons. That is, our protocols either succeed with 100% fidelity or fail in a heralded way, which is advantageous for implementing realistic long-distance quantum communication. Moreover, additional atomic qubits are not required, but only a single-photon medium. Our scheme is scalable and attractive since it can be realized in solid-state quantum systems. With the great progress on controlling atom-waveguide systems, this repeater may be very useful in quantum information processing in the future.

abstract: The study of open quantum systems is important for fundamental issues of quantum physics as well as for technological applications such as quantum information processing. The interaction of a quantum system with it's environment is usually detrimental for the quantum properties of the system and leads to decoherence. However, sometimes a coherent partial exchange of information takes place between the system and the environment and the dynamics of the open system becomes non-Markovian. In this article we study discrete open quantum system dynamics where single evolution step consist of local unitary transformation on the open system followed by a coupling unitary between the system and the environment. We implement experimentally a local control protocol for controlling the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics.

abstract: The single excitation subspace (SES) method for universal quantum simulation is investigated for a number of diatomic molecular collision complexes. Assuming a system of $n$ tunably-coupled, and fully-connected superconducting qubits, computations are performed in the $n$-dimensional SES which maps directly to an $n$-channel collision problem within a diabatic molecular wave function representation. Here we outline the approach on a classical computer to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in an $n$-dimensional molecular basis - the so-called semiclassical molecular-orbital close-coupling (SCMOCC) method - and extend the treatment beyond the straight-line, constant-velocity approximation which is restricted to large kinetic energies ($\gtrsim 0.1$ keV/u). We explore various multichannel potential averaging schemes and an Ehrenfest symmetrization approach to allow for the application of the SCMOCC method to much lower collision energies (approaching 1 eV/u). In addition, a computational efficiency study for various propagators is performed to speed-up the calculations on classical computers. These computations are repeated for the simulation of the SES approach assuming typical parameters for realistic pretheshold superconducting quantum computing hardware. The feasibility of applying future SES processors to the quantum dynamics of large molecular collision systems is briefly discussed.

In addition to the similarity with the typical three-junction flux qubit, we demonstrate the difference of the four-junction circuit from its three-junction analogue, especially its distinct advantages over the latter. Moreover, the four-junction circuit in the phase regime is also investigated. Our theory provides a tool to explore the physical properties of this four-junction superconducting circuit.

abstract: The Casimir effect is a physical manifestation of zero point energy of quantum vacuum. In a relativistic quantum field theory, Poincar\'e symmetry of the theory seems, at first sight, to imply that non-zero vacuum energy is inconsistent with translational invariance of the vacuum. In the setting of two uniform boundary plate at rest, quantum fields outside the plates have (1+2)-dimensional Poincar\'e symmtry. Taking a massless scalar field as an example, we have examined the consistency between the Poincar\'e symmetry and the existence of the vacuum enegy. We note that, in quantum theory, symmetries are represented projectively in general and show that the Casimir energy is connected to central charges appearing in the algebra of generators in the projective representations.

abstract: Two-dimensional Scarf~II quantum model is considered in the framework of Supersymmetrical Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM). Previously obtained results for this integrable system are systematized, and some new properties are derived. In particular, it is shown that the model is exactly or quasi-exactly solvable in different regions of parameter of the system. The degeneracy of the spectrum is detected for some specific values of parameters. The action of the symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta is calculated for the arbitrary wave functions, obtained by means of double shape invariance.

abstract: Entangled physical systems are an important resource in quantum information. Some authors claim that in fact all quantum states are entangled. In this paper we show that this claim is incorrect and we discuss in operational way differences existing between separable and entangled states. A sufficient condition for entanglement is the violation of Bell- CHSH-CH inequalities and/or steering inequalities. Since there exist experiments outside the domain of quantum physics violating these inequalities therefore in the operational approach one cannot say that the entanglement is an exclusive quantum phenomenon. We also explain that an unambiguous experimental certification of the entanglement is a difficult task because classical statistical significance tests may not be trusted if sample homogeneity cannot be tested or is not tested carefully enough.

abstract: Dissipation tends to wash out dynamical features observed at early evolution times. In this paper we analyze a resonant single--atom two--photon quantum optical amplifier both dynamically and thermodynamically. A detailed thermodynamic balance shows that the non--linear amplifier is thermodynamically equivalent to the linear amplifier discussed in (Phys. Rev. A, 74 (2006), 063822). However, by calculating the Wigner quasi--probability distribution for various initial field states, we show that unique quantum features in optical phase space, absent from the linear amplifier, are maintained for extended times. These features are related to the discrete nature of the two--photon matter--field interaction, and fingerprint the initial field state at thermodynamic times.

abstract: Whenever we consider any relativistic quantum wave equation we are confronted with the Klein paradox, which asserts that incident particles will suffer a surplus of reflection when dispersed by a discontinuous potential. Following recent results on the Dirac equation, we propose a solution to this paradox for the Klein-Gordon case by introducing virtual beams in a natural well-posed generalization of the method of images in the theory of partial differential equations. Thus, our solution considers a global reflection coefficient obtained from the two contributions, the reflected particles plus the incident virtual particles. Despite its simplicity, this method allows a reasonable understanding of the paradox within the context of the quantum relativistic theory of particles (according to the original setup for the Klein paradox) and without resorting to any quantum field theoretic issues.

The formula we appear at is numerically close to the upper-bounds found in literature.

abstract: The distribution of coherence in multipartite systems in examined. We use a new coherence measure with entropic nature and metric properties, based on the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. The metric property allows for the coherence to be decomposed into various contributions, which arise from local and intrinsic coherences. We find that there are trade-off relations between the various contributions of coherence, as a function of parameters of the quantum state. In bipartite systems the coherence resides on individual sites or distributed among the sites, which contribute in a complementary way. In more complex systems, the characteristics of the coherence can display more subtle changes with respect to the parameters of the quantum state. In the case of the XXZ Heisenberg model, the coherence changes from a monogamous to a polygamous nature. This allows us to define the shareability of coherence, leading to monogamy relations for coherence.

abstract: We find that existing multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) protocols designed for fairness of the key are, in fact, unfair. Our analysis shows that these protocols are sensitive to collusive attacks; that is, dishonest participants can collaborate to predetermine the key without being detected. In fact, the transmission structures of the quantum particles in those unfair MQKA protocols, three of which have already been analyzed, have much in common. We call these unfair MQKA protocols circle-type MQKA protocols. Likewise, the transmission structures of the quantum particles in MQKA protocols that can resist collusive attacks are also similar. We call such protocols complete-graph-type MQKA protocols. A MQKA protocol also exists that can resist the above attacks but is still not fair, and we call it the tree-type MQKA protocol. We first point out a common, easily missed loophole that severely compromises the fairness of present circle-type MQKA protocols. Then we show that two dishonest participants at special positions can totally predetermine the key generated by circle-type MQKA protocols. We anticipate that our observations will contribute to secure and fair MQKA protocols, especially circle-type protocols.

abstract: We discuss quantum capacities for two types of entanglement networks: $\mathcal{Q}$ for the quantum repeater network with free classical communication, and $\mathcal{R}$ for the tensor network as the rank of the linear operation represented by the tensor network. We find that $\mathcal{Q}$ always equals $\mathcal{R}$ in the regularized case for the samenetwork graph. However, the relationships between the corresponding one-shot capacities $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_1$ are more complicated, and the min-cut upper bound is in general not achievable. We show that the tensor network can be viewed as a stochastic protocol with the quantum repeater network, such that $\mathcal{R}_1$ is a natural upper bound of $\mathcal{Q}_1$. We analyze the possible gap between $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_1$ for certain networks, and compare them with the one-shot classical capacity of the corresponding classical network.

abstract: To control light-matter interaction at the single-quantum level in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) or circuit-QED, strong coupling between the light and matter components is indispensable. Specifically, the coupling rate $g$ must be larger than the decay rates. If $g$ is increased further and becomes as large as the frequencies of light and matter excitations, the energy eigenstates including the ground state are predicted to be highly entangled. This qualitatively new coupling regime can be called the deep strong-coupling regime. One approach toward the deep strong-coupling regime is to use huge numbers of identical systems to take advantage of ensemble enhancement. With the emergence of so-called macroscopic artificial atoms, superconducting qubits for example, it has become possible for a single artificial atom to realize ultrastrong coupling, where $\hbar g$ exceeds ~10% of the energies of the qubit $\hbar \omega_q$ and the harmonic oscillator $\hbar \omega_o$. By making use of the macroscopic magnetic dipole moment of a flux qubit, large zero-point-fluctuation current of an LC oscillator, and large Josephson inductance of a coupler junction, we have realized circuits in the deep strong-coupling regime, where $g/\omega_o$ ranges from 0.72 to 1.34 and $g/\omega_q$ >> 1. Using energy spectroscopy measurements, we have observed unconventional transition spectra between Schrodinger cat-like energy eigenstates. These states involve quantum superpositions of Fock states with phase-space displacements of $\pm g/\omega_o$ and remarkably survive with environmental noise. Our results provide a basis for ground-state-based entangled-pair generation and open a new direction in circuit-QED.

abstract: The study of the interaction of light and matter has led to many fundamental discoveries as well as numerous important technologies. Over the last decades, great strides have been made in increasing the strength of this interaction at the single-photon level, leading to a continual exploration of new physics and applications. In recent years, a major achievement has been the demonstration of the so-called strong coupling regime, a key advancement enabling great progress in quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate light-matter interaction over an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported, reaching a new regime of ultrastrong coupling (USC). We achieve this using a superconducting artificial atom tunably coupled to the electromagnetic continuum of a one-dimensional waveguide. For the largest values of the coupling, the spontaneous emission rate of the atom is comparable to its transition frequency. In this USC regime, the conventional quantum description of the atom and light as distinct entities breaks down, and a new description in terms of hybrid states is required. Our results open the door to a wealth of new physics and applications. Beyond light-matter interaction itself, the tunability of our system makes it promising as a tool to study a number of important physical systems such as the well-known spin-boson and Kondo models.

abstract: A Brownian harmonic oscillator, which dissipates energy either by friction or via emission of electromagnetic radiation, is considered. This Brownian emitter is driven by the surrounding thermo-quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically described by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is shown how the Abraham-Lorentz force leads to dependence of the half-width on the peak frequency of the oscillator amplitude spectral density. It is also found that for the case of a charged particle moving in vacuum at zero temperature, its root-mean-square velocity fluctuation is a universal constant, equal to roughly 5.5 % of the speed of light. The relevant Klein-Kramers and Smoluchowski equations are derived as well.

abstract: Quantum physics cannot be reconciled with the classical philosophy of noncontextual realism. Realism demands that system properties exist independently of whether they are measured, while noncontextuality demands that the results of measurements do not depend on what other measurements are performed in conjunction with them. The Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that noncontextual realism cannot reproduce the measurement statistics of a single three-level quantum system (qutrit). Noncontextual realistic models may thus be tested using a single qutrit without relying on the notion of quantum entanglement in contrast to Bell inequality tests. It is challenging to refute such models experimentally, since imperfections may introduce loopholes that enable a realist interpretation. Using a superconducting qutrit with deterministic, binary-outcome readouts, we violate a noncontextuality inequality while addressing the detection, individual-existence and compatibility loopholes. Noncontextuality tests have been carried out in a range of different physical systems and dimensionalities, including neutrons, trapped ions and single photons, but no experiment addressing all three loopholes has been performed in the qutrit scenario where entanglement cannot play a role. Demonstrating state-dependent contextuality of a solid-state system is also an important conceptual ingredient for universal quantum computation in surface-code architectures, currently the most promising route to scalable quantum computing.

abstract: Quantum memories for optical and microwave photons provide key functionalities in quantum processing and communications. Here we propose a protocol well adapted to solid state ensemble based memories coupled to cavities. It is called Stark Echo Modulation Memory (SEMM), and allows large storage bandwidths and low noise. This is achieved in a echo like sequence combined with phase shifts induced by small electric fields through the linear Stark effect. We investigated the protocol for rare earth nuclear spins and found a high suppression of unwanted collective emissions that is compatible with single photon level operation. Broadband storage together with high fidelity for the Stark retrieval process is also demonstrated. SEMM could be used to store optical or microwave photons in ions and/or spins. This includes NV centers in diamond and rare earth doped crystals, which are among the most promising solid-state quantum memories.

The topological phases of the model can be identified by degeneracy of the largest eigenvalues of entanglement spectrum. The study of the periodic boundary condition is enough to obtain the phase diagram of the model. Physical interpretation about the bulk-edge correspondence of the entanglement spectrum method in the model is presented. This method of the entanglement spectrum can be applicable in studying other topological phases of matter.

abstract: We introduce a scheme for the parallel storage of frequency separated signals in an optical memory and demonstrate that this dual-rail storage is a suitable memory for high fidelity frequency qubits. The two signals are stored simultaneously in the Zeeman-split Raman absorption lines of a cold atom ensemble using gradient echo memory techniques. Analysis of the split-Zeeman storage shows that the memory can be configured to preserve the relative amplitude and phase of the frequency separated signals. In an experimental demonstration dual-frequency pulses are recalled with 35% efficiency, 82% interference fringe visibility, and 6 degrees phase stability. The fidelity of the frequency-qubit memory is limited by frequency-dependent polarisation rotation and ambient magnetic field fluctuations, our analysis describes how these can be addressed in an alternative configuration.

abstract: Nowadays the experimental techniques in nanoscience have evolved to a stage where various examples of nanostructures with non-trivial shapes have been synthesized and analyzed, turning the study of the quantum dynamics of a constrained particle and the relation with geometry into a realistic and important topic of research. Some decades ago, a formalism capable of giving a meaningful Hamiltonian for the confined dynamics was devised. These results showed that a quantum scalar potential, which depends explicitly on the geometry of the curved region, acts upon the particle. In this work, we study the confinement on curves and the problem of prescribed geometric potential, i.e., finding a curve or a surface with a quantum geometric potential given {\it a priori}. For the confinement on curves we show that in an intrinsic scheme, i.e., in the absence of the quantum geometric potential, the spectrum of a curve on any manifold only depends on the fixed length and imposed boundary conditions. After, we investigate the one-dimensional confinement in a surface (then, in a non-euclidean ambient space), where we show that the geometric potential can give rise to both negative and positive potentials, a result which is not possible if the ambient surface is flat. In addition, we solve the problem of prescribed geometric potential for planar curves with an emphasis on the case of power-law curvature functions, which allows us to model the Hydrogen atom through a confinement in a curve. In the two-dimensional case, we solve the prescribed geometric potential problem for surfaces with rotation and translation symmetry, where in the last case we also show that the problem for curves is equivalent to the problem for cylindrical surfaces. Finally, we discuss on the nature of the quantum geometric potential and the influence that different embeddings may have on the constrained dynamics.

abstract: The Hilbert space for three fermions in six orbitals, lately dubbed the "Borland-Dennis setting," is a proving ground for insights into electronic structure. Borland and Dennis discovered that, when referred to coordinate systems defined in terms of its natural orbitals, a wave function in the Borland-Dennis setting has the same structure as a 3-qubit state. By dint of the Borland-Dennis Theorem, canonical forms for 3-qubit states have analogs in the Borland-Dennis setting. One of these canonical forms is based upon "max-overlap Slater determinant approximations." Any max-overlap Slater determinant approximation of a given wave function is the leading term in a 5-term configuration interaction (CI) expansion of that wave function. Our main result is that "max-overlap CIS approximations" also lead to 5-term CI expansions, distinct from those based on max-overlap Slater determinant approximations, though of the same symmetric shape. We also prove the analog of this result for 3-qubit setting.

abstract: One of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a classical efficient simulation is not available. In such a situation one cannot simply classically keep track of the dynamics of the device. In this note, we discuss weak-membership notions of the certification for ground state preparations of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. These considerations have applications to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: for example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can realise universal quantum computers. Our certification approach is non-interactive and thus avoids challenges arising from interactive proof systems. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to recent results on so-called IQP circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum supremacy.

abstract: In this work, we propose a quantum neural network named quantum perceptron over a field (QPF). Quantum computers are not yet a reality and the models and algorithms proposed in this work cannot be simulated in actual (or classical) computers. QPF is a direct generalization of a classical perceptron and solves some drawbacks found in previous models of quantum perceptrons. We also present a learning algorithm named Superposition based Architecture Learning algorithm (SAL) that optimizes the neural network weights and architectures. SAL searches for the best architecture in a finite set of neural network architectures with linear time over the number of patterns in the training set. SAL is the first learning algorithm to determine neural network architectures in polynomial time. This speedup is obtained by the use of quantum parallelism and a non-linear quantum operator.

abstract: We propose a scheme for the creation of robust entanglement between a movable mirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical system. In experimentally accessible parameter regimes, we show that critical temperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement in our scheme can be raised from previous 24 K [Vitali {\it et al.}, Phys.

The scheme can be used for the realization of quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and quantum-limited displacement measurements.

abstract: Recently Tian, Zhang and Li (TZL) have proposed a protocol for voting based on controlled quantum teleportation (Int. J. Theor. Phys. DOI 10.1007/s10773-015-2868-8). We have critically analyzed the protocol and have shown that it's neither efficient nor secure. Further, it is shown that in the TZL protocol, the scrutineer Charlie does not have the required control over the voting process. Apart from showing the limitations of TZL protocol, two improved protocols for quantum voting along the line of TZL protocol are proposed here. One of the proposed protocols is designed using a standard scheme of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication, and the other one is designed using the idea of quantum cryptographic switch which uses a technique known as permutation of particles (PoP). A few possible alternative approaches to accomplish the same task have also been discussed. Further, the efficiencies of the proposed protocols are reported, and it is shown that the proposed protocols are free from the limitations of the TZL protocol, and they are more efficient than the TZL protocol.

abstract: Quantum Key Agreement (QKA) signifies that two or more participants together generate a key and QKA has to satisfy the following conditions: 1 Every participant can change the key and the key is not decided by any participant individually. 2 Only participants can know the key; nonparticipants cannot get the key through illegal means. Because of the condition 1 of participating together, it makes transport inefficient in the current mainstream protocols. They use unicast to exchange messages one by one, so it will considerably limit transmission efficiency and increase cost time spent. This study proposes a protocol based on Multiparty Quantum Secret Direct Communication (MQSDC) with multicast. In addition to satisfying the above conditions, it uses multicast to not only achieve the effect and purpose of QKA, but also to defend against internal and external attacks at the same time. In regard to resource consumption, this study involves linear growth and is more efficient than other mainstream protocols which employ exponential growth.

abstract: We study the Fermi-Hubbard model in the strongly correlated Mott phase under the influence of a harmonically oscillating electric field, e.g., a pump laser. In the Peierls representation, this pump field can be represented as an oscillating phase of the hopping rate $J(t)$, such that the effective time-averaged rate $\bar J$ is reduced, i.e., switching the pump laser suddenly is analogous to a quantum quench. Apart from this time-averaged rate $\bar J$, it is well known that the oscillating component of $J(t)$ can resonantly create particle-hole pairs if the pump frequency $\omega_{\rm pump}$ equals (or a little exceeds) the Mott gap. In addition, we find that it is possible to create multiple pairs if $\omega_{\rm pump}$ is near an integer multiple of the gap. These findings should be relevant for pump-probe experiments.

abstract: Exceptional points are special parameter points in spectra of open quantum systems, at which resonance energies degenerate and the associated eigenvectors coalesce. Typical examples are Rydberg systems in parallel electric and magnetic fields, for which we solve the Schr\"odinger equation in a complete basis to calculate the resonances and eigenvectors. Starting from an avoided crossing within the parameter-dependent spectra and using a two-dimensional matrix model, we develop an iterative algorithm to calculate the field strengths and resonance energies of exceptional points and to verify their basic properties. Additionally, we are able to visualise the wave functions of the degenerate states. We report the existence of various exceptional points. For the hydrogen atom these points are in an experimentally inaccessible regime of field strengths. However, excitons in cuprous oxide in parallel electric and magnetic fields, i. e., the corresponding hydrogen analogue in a solid state body, provide a suitable system, where the high-field regime can be reached at much smaller external fields and for which we propose an experiment to detect exceptional points.

abstract: We derive fractional Brownian motion and stochastic processes with multifractal properties using a framework of network of Gaussian conditional probabilities. This leads to the derivation of new representations of fractional Brownian motion. These constructions are inspired from renormalization. The main result of this paper consists of constructing each increment of the process from two-dimensional gaussian noise inside the light-cone of each seperate increment. Not only does this allows us to derive fractional Brownian motion, we can introduce extensions with multifractal flavour. In another part of this paper, we discuss the use of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), introduced in the study critical systems in quantum spin lattices, as a method for sampling integrals with respect to such multifractal processes. After proper calibration, a MERA promises the generation of a sample of size $N$ of a multifractal process in the order of $O(N\log(N))$, an improvement over the known methods, such as the Cholesky decomposition and the circulant methods, which scale between $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$.

abstract: We study the dynamics of chiral quantum networks consisting of nodes coupled by unidirectional or asymmetric bidirectional quantum channels. In contrast to the familiar photonic networks consisting of driven two-level atoms exchanging photons via 1D photonic nanostructures, we propose and study a setup where interactions between the atoms are mediated by spin excitations (magnons) in 1D XX-spin chains representing a spin waveguide. While Markovian quantum network theory eliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov approximation to obtain a master equation for the nodes, we are interested in non-Markovian dynamics. This arises from the nonlinear character of the dispersion with band-edge effects, and from finite spin propagation velocities leading to time delays in interactions. To account for the non-Markovian dynamics we treat the quantum degrees of freedom of the nodes and connecting channel as a composite spin system with the surrounding of the quantum network as a Markovian bath, allowing for an efficient solution with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group techniques. We illustrate our approach showing non-Markovian effects in the driven-dissipative formation of quantum dimers, and we present examples for quantum information protocols involving quantum state transfer with engineered elements as basic building blocks of quantum spintronic circuits.

This process is mediated by a quantum dot embedded on-chip in an opto-mechanical circuit, which allows for the simultaneous control of the relevant photonic and phononic frequencies. We devise new opto-mechanical circuit elements that constitute the necessary building blocks for the proposed scheme and are readily implementable within the current state-of-the-art of nano-fabrication. This will open new avenues for implementing quantum functionalities based on phonons as an on-chip quantum bus.

abstract: A key challenge for neuroscience is noninvasive, label-free sensing of action potential (AP) dynamics in whole organisms with single-neuron resolution. Here, we present a new approach to this problem: using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in diamond to measure the time-dependent magnetic fields produced by single-neuron APs. Our technique has a unique combination of features: (i) it is noninvasive, as the light that probes the NV sensors stays within the biocompatible diamond chip and does not enter the organism, enabling activity monitoring over extended periods; (ii) it is label-free and should be widely applicable to most organisms; (iii) it provides high spatial and temporal resolution, allowing precise measurement of the AP waveforms and conduction velocities of individual neurons; (iv) it directly determines AP propagation direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic field vector; (v) it is applicable to neurons located within optically opaque tissue or whole organisms, through which magnetic fields pass largely unperturbed; and (vi) it is easy-to-use, scalable, and can be integrated with existing techniques such as wide-field and superresolution imaging. We demonstrate our method using excised single neurons from two invertebrate species, marine worm and squid; and then by single-neuron AP magnetic sensing exterior to whole, live, opaque marine worms for extended periods with no adverse effect. The results lay the groundwork for real-time, noninvasive 3D magnetic mapping of functional neuronal networks, ultimately with synapse-scale (~10 nm) resolution and circuit-scale (~1 cm) field-of-view.

abstract: A cornerstone of the theory of phase transitions is the observation that many-body systems exhibiting a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit generally show extensive fluctuations of an order parameter in large but finite systems. In this work, we introduce the dynamical analogue of such a theory. Specifically, we consider local dissipative dynamics preparing a steady-state of quantum spins on a lattice exhibiting a discrete or continuous symmetry but with extensive fluctuations in a local order parameter. We show that for all such processes satisfying detailed balance, there exist metastable symmetry-breaking states, i.e., states that become stationary in the thermodynamic limit and give a finite value to the order parameter. We give results both for discrete and continuous symmetries and explicitly show how to construct the symmetry-breaking states. Our results show in a simple way that, in large systems, local dissipative dynamics satisfying detailed balance cannot uniquely and efficiently prepare states with extensive fluctuations with respect to local operators. We discuss the implications of our results for quantum simulators and dissipative state preparation.

abstract: It seems that non-local correlations stronger than quantum correlations between two non-signaling systems cannot exist for the simple reason that the property of non-signaling implies that the CHSH correlation factor must satisfy the Tsirelson bound. This result is obtained after translating the fashionable language of boxes into the language of observables, which is used to compute the CHSH correlation factor. A recently proposed toy-model of such non-signaling, super-quantum correlations is then considered and it is shown that it suffers from logical inconsistency.

abstract: The detectability lemma is a useful tool for probing the structure of gapped ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians of lattice spin models. The lemma provides an estimate on the error incurred by approximating the ground space projector with a product of local projectors. We provide a new, simpler proof for the detectability lemma, which applies to an arbitrary ordering of the local projectors, and show that it is tight up to a constant factor. As an application we show how the lemma can be combined with a strong converse by Gao to obtain local spectral gap amplification: we show that by coarse-graining a local frustration-free Hamiltonian with a spectral gap $\gamma>0$ to a length scale $O(\gamma^{-1/2})$, one gets an Hamiltonian with an $\Omega(1)$ spectral gap.

abstract: We study the coexistence of the quantum Zeno effect and non-Markovianity for a system decaying in a structured bosonic environment and subject to a control field. The interaction with the environment induces decay from the excited to the ground level, which, in turn, is coherently coupled to another meta-stable state. The control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable levels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory effects, without modifying neither the system-reservoir interaction, nor environmental properties. We use this framework in two different parameter regimes corresponding to fast (bad cavity limit) and slow dissipation (good cavity limit) in the original, un-controlled qubit system. Our results show a non-monotonic behavior of memory effects when increasing the effectiveness of the Zeno-like freezing. Moreover, we identify a new source of memory effects which allows the persistence of non-Markovianity for long times while the excited state has already been depleted.

abstract: Optomechanics of nanoparticles purports to reach the quantum regime, but experimental evidence suggests otherwise. We believe that the discrepancy is due to the omission of the deleterious effects of the EM field levitating the particle. This letter focuses on quantum fluctuations in the levitating field. In a cavity-assisted system, they lead to fluctuations in the gradient force, and encourage escape of the particle. In a feedback system, they lead to the detector shot noise besides fluctuations in the gradient force and radiation pressure, and render the system very vulnerable to the thermal noise of the feedback circuit.

abstract: Single organic molecules offer great promise as bright, reliable sources of identical single photons on demand, capable of integration into solid-state devices. It has been proposed that such molecules in a crystalline organic matrix might be placed close to an optical waveguide for this purpose, but so far there have been no demonstrations of sufficiently thin crystals, with a controlled concentration of suitable dopant molecules. Here we present a method for growing very thin anthracene crystals from super-saturated vapour, which produces crystals of extreme flatness and controlled thickness. We show how this crystal can be doped with a widely adjustable concentration of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules and we examine the optical properties of these molecules to demonstrate their suitability as quantum emitters in nanophotonic devices. Our measurements show that the molecules are available in the crystal as single quantum emitters, with a well-defined polarisation relative to the crystal axes, making them amenable to alignment with optical nanostructures. We find that the radiative lifetime and saturation intensity vary little within the crystal and are not in any way compromised by the unusual matrix environment. We show that a large fraction of these emitters are able to deliver more than $10^{12}$ photons without photo-bleaching, making them suitable for real applications.

abstract: We introduce quantum optical dipole radiation fields defined in terms of photon creation and annihilation operators. These fields are identified through their spatial dependence, as the components of the total fields that survive infinitely far from the dipole source. We use these radiation fields to perturbatively evaluate the electromagnetic radiated energy-flux of the excited dipole. Our results indicate that the standard interpretation of a bare atom surrounded by a localised virtual photon cloud, is difficult to sustain, because the radiated energy-flux surviving infinitely far from the source contains virtual contributions. It follows that there is a clear distinction to be made between a radiative photon defined in terms of the radiation fields, and a real photon, whose identification depends on whether or not a given process conserves the free energy. This free energy is represented by the difference between the total dipole-field Hamiltonian and its interaction component.

abstract: In the presence of strong dephasing noise the dynamics of Rydberg gases becomes effectively classical, due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions between atomic levels. Recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to the stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several interesting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour, self-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics of these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative processes contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To explore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master equation. We find indications that the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when the dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the dynamically relevant time scales. These features include a power law growth of the density of excitations and the existence of a time-dependent Rydberg blockade radius. Our results indicate that the power-law growth of density of excitations is characterised by an exponent which decreases as the dissipation becomes weaker.

abstract: We propose a method to study the thermodynamic behaviour of small systems beyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation. This method -- based on a reaction coordinate mapping -- is general in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. This supersystem is then treated within the weak coupling and Markovian approximations, ensuring that we obtain a consistent thermodynamic picture. We demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can significantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show for a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows one to justify the widely used polaron transformation.

In particular, in the proposed protocol the public key is given by a quantum state generated by performing a quantum walk. We show that the protocol is secure and analyze the complexity of public-key generation and encryption/decryption procedures.

abstract: We present a bidirectional modification of the standard one-qubit teleportation protocol, where both Alice and Bob try to transfer their quantum states to each other using single Bell state and auxiliary (trigger) qubits. Three schemes are under consideration: the first, where action of parties are governed by two independent quantum random triggers, the second with single random trigger, and the third one as a mixture of these schemes. We calculate the fidelity of teleportation for all schemes and find the minimal amount of correlation between trigger qubits to overcome the critical value. An amount of symmetrically transmitted entanglement between parties is also analysed. The suggested scheme of bidirectional teleportation can be realized using current experimental tools.

These transformations are implemented using quantum circuits consisting of basic quantum gates, which are constructed with polynomial numbers of single-qubit and two-qubit gates. Complexity analysis shows that the global operators (symmetric flips, local flips, orthogonal rotations) can be implemented with $O(n)$ gates. The proposed geometric transformations are used to facilitate applications of quantum images with low complexity.

abstract: Quantum-mechanical devices have the potential to transform cryptography. Most research in this area has focused either on the information-theoretic advantages of quantum protocols or on the security of classical cryptographic schemes against quantum attacks. In this work, we initiate the study of another relevant topic: the encryption of quantum data in the computational setting. In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental classical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and public-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical work of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent. Finally, we construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In particular, we show that quantum-secure one-way functions imply IND-CCA1-secure symmetric-key quantum encryption, and that quantum-secure trapdoor one-way permutations imply semantically-secure public-key quantum encryption.

abstract: We present a local non-iterative method for the implementation of Procrustean entanglement distillation on a pair of entangled qubits using a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM). We show that this POVM can be applied equally to massless and massive qubits in hybrid quantum systems. For massless particles we consider single photons, for which the POVM can be implemented using standard linear optics components. For massive particles, we consider spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles. Numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation show how the POVM can be applied to these qubits using gaussian wavepackets. Our non-iterative method can be applied, not only to pure ensembles with particle pairs of known identical entanglement, but also to ensembles of particle pairs with a distribution of different entanglement entropies. The outlined protocol eases the requirement for the creation of $m$-particle cluster states for measurement based quantum computing, such that the resource states can have entanglement entropies approaching zero as $\mathcal{O}(1 / poly(m))$.

abstract: We propose an approach to detect individual Rydberg molecules with each molecule consisting of two atoms in different Rydberg states. The scheme exploits the movement of atoms in the presence of an external force that exerts only on atoms in one Rydberg state. Since the movement of atoms in the other Rydberg state depends on whether they are bound with atoms directly driven by the applied force, bound atoms can be distinguished from unbound atoms. By utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency, it is possible to non-destructively image the positions of molecules. The scheme is sensitive to a weak force, which is suited to optically detect spatial positions and bond structure of Rydberg molecules.

abstract: We represent a two qubit density matrix in the basis of Pauli matrix tensor products, with the coefficients constituting a Bloch matrix, analogous to the single qubit Bloch vector. We find the quantum state positivity requirements on the Bloch matrix components, leading to three important inequalities, allowing us to parameterize and visualize the two qubit state space. Applying the singular value decomposition naturally separates the degrees of freedom to local and nonlocal, and simplifies the positivity inequalities. It also allows us to geometrically represent a state as two entangled Bloch spheres with superimposed correlation axes. It is shown that unitary transformations, local or nonlocal, have simple interpretations as axis rotations or mixing of certain degrees of freedom. The nonlocal unitary invariants of the state are then derived in terms of local unitary invariants. The positive partial transpose criterion for entanglement is generalized, and interpreted as a reflection, or a change of a single sign. The formalism is used to characterize maximally entangled states, and generalize two qubit isotropic and Werner states.

abstract: Cavity electro-(opto-)mechanics allows us to access not only single isolated but also multiple mechanical modes in a massive object. Here we develop a multi-mode electromechanical system in which a several membrane vibrational modes are coupled to a three-dimensional loop-gap superconducting microwave cavity. The tight confinement of the electric field across a mechanically-compliant narrow-gap capacitor brings the system into the quantum strong coupling regime under a red-sideband pump field. We demonstrate strong coupling between two mechanical modes, which is induced by two-tone parametric drives and mediated by a virtual photon in the cavity. The tunable inter-mechanical-mode coupling can be used to generate entanglement between the mechanical modes.

abstract: Ultrastrong coupling in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems not only provides a platform to study the quantum Rabi model, but it can also facilitate the implementation of quantum logic operations via high-lying resonator states. In this regime, quantum manifolds with different excitation numbers are intrinsically connected via the counter-rotating interactions, which can result in multi-photon processes. Recent experiments have demonstrated ultrastrong coupling in superconducting qubits electromagnetically coupled to superconducting resonators. Here we report the experimental observation of multiphoton sideband transitions of a superconducting flux qubit coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator in the ultrastrong coupling regime. With a coupling strength reaching about 10% of the fundamental frequency of the resonator, we obtain clear signatures of higher-order red-sideband transitions and the first-order blue-sideband transition in a transmission spectroscopic measurement. This study advances the understanding of driven ultrastrongly-coupled systems.

abstract: We show that the modular value is expressed by the average of the dynamic phase factors using the complex conditional probabilities. In relation to this expression, the chain rule of the conditional probabilities is also derived, which relates the initial-final-state modular value with the initial- transitional-state modular values and the transitional-final-state weak values. Then, we express the modular value with the relative change and the total phase shift (the geometric phases and the intrinsic phase), which is another aspect of the modular value. The modulus of modular value is found to play a significant role in the relative change of the quantum system under the dynamic evolution, and also, the argument of modular value is found to have connection with the total phase shift. By analyzing these two relations, we can apply to calibrate the value of coupling constant, which was used in modular value and the geometric phase, which has many implications. In contrast, one can fully determine the modular value (modulus and argument) by examining the relative change and the corresponding total phase shift.

abstract: In standard quantum mechanics, complex numbers are used to describe the wavefunction. Although complex numbers have proven sufficient to predict the results of existing experiments, there is no apparent theoretical reason to choose them over real numbers or generalizations of complex numbers, i.e. hyper-complex numbers. Experiments performed to date have proven that real numbers are insufficient, but whether or not hyper-complex numbers are required remains an open question. Quantum theories based on hyper-complex numbers are one example of a post-quantum theory, which must be put on a firm experimental foundation. Here we experimentally probe hyper-complex quantum theories, by studying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the non-commutativity of phases. We do so by passing single photons through a Sagnac interferometer containing two physically different phases, having refractive indices of opposite sign. By showing that the phases commute with high precision, we place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex quantum theories.

abstract: In quantum parameter estimation, the ultimate precision limit is given by the so-called Cramer-Rao bound. The calculation of this bound, which is expressed in terms of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and determination of the optimal probe state, in the presence of the inevitable impact of decoherence is still a challenging problem. In this article, this challenge is circumvented by introducing a lower bound on the QFI to estimate the ultimate precision limit. The calculation of this bound (which is mostly close to the exact value of the QFI) requires only the matrix representation of the parameter encoding map. This property allows us to use the bound in open quantum systems which are governed by general (semigroup and non-semigroup) dynamical maps. Reliability and efficiency of the method to predict the ultimate precision limit is demonstrated by several main examples.

abstract: Encryption of data is fundamental to secure communication in the modern world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating classical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible [Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have numerous applications. In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box, indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money. We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions exist [Alagic et al '16].

abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement is drawing attention because it enables us to perform quantum information tasks that are robust against noises. To test the nonlocality of entangled qudits, the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality has been proposed and demonstrated using qudits based on orbital angular momentum, time-energy uncertainty, and frequency bins. Here, we report the generation and observation of time-bin entangled ququarts. We implemented a measurement for the CGLMP inequality test using cascaded delay Mach-Zehnder interferometers fabricated by using planar lightwave circuit technology, with which we achieved a precise and stable measurement for time-bin-entangled ququarts. In addition, we generated an optimized entangled state by modulating the pump pulse intensities, with which we can observe the theoretical maximum violation for the CGLMP inequality test. As a result, we successfully observed a Bell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.774 \pm 0.025$ violating the CGLMP inequality for the maximally entangled state and an enhanced Bell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.913 \pm 0.023$ for the optimized entangled state.

As an example, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a fluxonium qubit inductively coupled to a readout resonator. Our method treats both the anharmonicity of the Hamiltonian and the coupling between qubit and readout modes exactly. Calculated spectra are compared to measured spectroscopy data for this fluxonium-resonator system. We observe excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment that is not possible with a purely perturbative approach.

Our approach is ideally suited for implementation in light-matter systems such as quantum optomechanics and atomic spin ensembles, and offers considerable robustness to initial thermal occupation. The performance of each measurement permutation is quantified and compared using several different non-classicality criteria.

abstract: Which quantum states minimise the unavoidable uncertainty arising from the non-commutativity of two observables? The immediate answer to such a question is: it depends. Due to the plethora of uncertainty measures there are many answers. Here, instead of restricting our study to a particular measure, we present plausible axioms for the set $\mathcal{F}$ of bona-fide information-theoretic uncertainty functions. Then, we discuss the existence of states minimising uncertainty with respect to all members of $\mathcal{F}$, i.e., universal minimum uncertainty states (MUS). We prove that such states do not exist within the full state space and study the effect of classical noise on the structure of minimum uncertainty states. We present an explicit example of a qubit universal MUS that arises when purity is constrained by introducing a threshold amount of noise. For higher dimensional systems we derive several no-go results limiting the existence of noisy universal MUS. However, we conjecture that universality may emerge in an approximate sense. We conclude by discussing connections with thermodynamics, and highlight the privileged role that non-equilibrium free energy $F_2$ plays close to equilibrium.

abstract: Calculating molecular energies is likely to be one of the first useful applications to achieve quantum supremacy, performing faster on a quantum than a classical computer. However, if future quantum devices are to produce accurate calculations, errors due to environmental noise and algorithmic approximations need to be characterized and reduced. In this study, we use the high performance qHiPSTER software to investigate the effects of environmental noise on the preparation of quantum chemistry states. We simulate nineteen 16-qubit quantum circuits under environmental noise, each corresponding to a unitary coupled cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular configuration. Additionally, we analyze the nature of simple gate errors in noise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find that the Jordan-Wigner (JW) encoding produces consistently smaller errors under a noisy environment as compared to the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding, pure-dephasing noise is shown to produce substantially smaller errors than pure relaxation noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends in both molecular energy and electron particle number within a unitary coupled cluster state preparation scheme, against changes in nuclear charge, bond length, number of electrons, noise types, and noise magnitude. These trends may prove to be useful in making algorithmic and hardware-related choices for quantum simulation of molecular energies.

abstract: In a recent article Giustina et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 250401 (2015)] report on an advanced Bell experiment, simultaneously closing loopholes for local hidden-variable theories. The authors claim that 'local realism' has been refuted, unless 'truly exotic hypotheses' are made. Here I argue that a particularly wide and natural class of local hidden-variable theories survives, for instance when the hidden variables describe a background field. Such background-based theories exploit the freedom-of-choice loophole, which cannot be closed for this type of hidden variables. The dynamics of such models can be illustrated by existing systems, e.g. from fluid mechanics.

abstract: Tremendous progress has been realized in quantum optics for engineering and detecting the quantum properties of light. Today, photon pairs are routinely created in entangled states. Entanglement is revealed using single-photon detectors in which a single photon triggers an avalanche current. The resulting signal is then processed and stored in a computer. Here, we propose an approach to get rid of all the electronic devices between the photons and the experimentalist i.e. to use the experimentalist's eye to detect entanglement. We show in particular, that the micro entanglement that is produced by sending a single photon into a beam-splitter can be detected with the eye using the magnifying glass of a displacement in phase space. The feasibility study convincingly demonstrates the possibility to realize the first experiment where entanglement is observed with the eye.

abstract: Here we demonstrate generating and storing entanglement in a solid state spin-wave quantum memory with on-demand read out using the process of rephased amplified spontaneous emission (RASE). Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), resulting from an inverted ensemble of Pr$^{3+}$ ions doped into a Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, generates entanglement between collective states of the praseodymium ensemble and the output light. The ensemble is then rephased using a four-level photon echo technique. Entanglement between the ASE and its echo is confirmed and the inseparability violation preserved when the RASE is stored as a spin-wave for up to 5 $\mu$s. RASE is shown to be temporally multimode with almost perfect distinguishability between two temporal modes demonstrated. These results pave the way for the use of multimode solid state quantum memories in scalable quantum networks.

abstract: This paper investigates the fast Hamiltonian control of $n=2$ density operators by continuously varying the flag as one moves away from the completely mixed state. In general, the critical points and zeros of the purity derivative can only be solved analytically in the limit of minimal purity. We derive differential equations that maintain these features as the purity increases. In particular, there is a thread of points in the Bloch ball that locally maximizes the purity derivative, and a corresponding thread that minimizes it. Additionally, we show there is a closed surface of points inside of which the purity derivative is positive, and inside of which is negative. We argue that this approach may be useful in studying higher-dimensional systems.

We study the conditions under which, at least in principle, it becomes the dominant decoherence effect in a typical matter-wave or optomechanical experiment aiming at testing quantum coherence for massive systems. The following competing sources of decoherence are considered: spontaneous emission of light, absorption, scattering with the thermal photons and collisions with the residual gas. The conclusion is that the gravitational decoherence cannot be observed using the present experimental technology.

abstract: We present the theory for connecting quantum Markov components into a network with quantum input processes in a Gaussian state (including thermal and squeezed), not necessarily vacuum fields.One would expect on physical grounds that the connection rules should be independent of the state of the input to the network. To compute statistical properties, we use a version of Wicks' Theorem involving fictitious vacuum fields (Fock space based representation of the fields) and while this aids computation, and gives a rigorous formulation, the various representations need not be unitarily equivalent. In particular, a naive application of the connection rules would lead to the wrong answer. We establish the correct interconnection rules, and show that while the quantum stochastic differential equations of motion display explicitly the covariances (thermal and squeezing parameters) of the Gaussian input fields We introduce the Wick-Stratonovich form which leads to a way of writing these equations that does not depend on these covariances and so corresponds to the universal equations written in terms of formal quantum input processes. We show that a wholly consistent theory of quantum open systems in series can be developed in this way, and as required physically, is universal and in particular representation-free.

abstract: Based on the quantum technique of weak measurement, we propose a scheme to protect the entanglement from correlated amplitude damping decoherence. In contrast to the results of memoryless amplitude damping channel, we show that the memory effects play a significant role in the suppression of entanglement sudden death and protection of entanglement under severe decoherence. Moreover, we find that the initial entanglement could be drastically amplified by the combination of weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal even under the correlated amplitude damping channel. The underlying mechanism can be attributed to the probabilistic nature of weak measurements.

abstract: A quantum channel physically is a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment, which is initialized in a pure state before the interaction. Conventionally, this state, as also the parameters of the interaction, is assumed to be fixed and known to the sender and receiver. Here, following the model introduced by us earlier [Karumanchi et al., arXiv[quant-ph]:1407.8160], we consider a benevolent third party, i.e. a helper, controlling the environment state, and how the helper's presence changes the communication game. In particular, we define and study the classical capacity of a unitary interaction with helper, indeed two variants, one where the helper can only prepare separable states across many channel uses, and one without this restriction. Furthermore, the two even more powerful scenarios of pre-shared entanglement between helper and receiver, and of classical communication between sender and helper (making them conferencing encoders) are considered.

abstract: A scheme for the deterministic joint remote preparation of a four- qubit cluster-type state using only two Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as quantum channels is presented. In this scheme, the ?rst sender per- forms a two-qubit projective measurement according to the real coe?cient of the desired state. Then, the other sender utilizes the measurement result and the complex coe?cient to perform another projective measurement. To obtain the desired state, the receiver applies appropriate unitary operations to his/her own two qubits and two CNOT operations to the two ancillary ones. Most interestingly, our scheme can achieve unit success probability, i.e., Psuc=1. Furthermore, comparison reveals that the efficiency is higher than that of most other analogous schemes.

abstract: Weak value measurements have recently given rise to a large interest for both the possibility of measurement ampli?cation and the chance of further quantum mechanics foundations investigation. In particular, a question emerged about weak values being proof of the incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and Non-Contextual Hidden Variables Theories (NCHVT). A test to provide a conclusive answer to this question was given in [M. Pusey, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 200401 (2014)], where a theorem was derived showing the NCHVT incompatibility with the observation of anomalous weak values under speci?c conditions. In this paper we realize this proposal, clearly pointing out the strict connection between weak values and the contextual nature of Quantum Mechanics.

We call the algorithm the "stream algorithm" due to its origin in the computer science construct of a stream. Our method is an improvement over the decision tree algorithm presented by Laskowski et al. Unlike the decision tree algorithm, the streaming algorithm does not require a large expectation to be known in advance and avoids expensive construction costs. Numerical simulations show that the streaming algorithm performs better for three to six qubits.

abstract: Selfcomplementary quantum channels are characterized by such an interaction between the principal quantum system and the environment that leads to the same output states of both interacting systems. These maps can describe approximate quantum copy machines, as perfect copying of an unknown quantum state is not possible due to the celebrated no-cloning theorem. We provide here a parametrization of a large class of selfcomplementary channels and analyze their properties. Selfcomplementary channels preserve some residual coherences and residual entanglement. Investigating some measures of non-Markovianity we show that time evolution under selfcomplementary channels is highly non-Markovian.

abstract: A continuous quantum field, such as a propagating beam of light, may be characterized by a squeezing spectrum that is inhomogeneous in frequency. We point out that homodyne detectors, which are commonly employed to detect quantum squeezing, are blind to squeezing spectra in which the correlation between amplitude and phase fluctuations is complex. We find theoretically that such complex squeezing is a component of ponderomotive squeezing of light through cavity optomechanics. We propose a detection scheme, called synodyne detection, which reveals complex squeezing and allows its use to improve force detection beyond the standard quantum limit.

abstract: We report a very efficient mechanism to generate a squeezed state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system. We use especially tuned parametric amplifier (PA) inside the cavity and the parametric photon phonon processes to transfer quantum squeezing from photons to phonons with almost 100\% efficiency. We get 50\% squeezing of the mechanical mirror which is limited by the PA. We present analytical results for the mechanical squeezing thus enabling one to understand the dependence of squeezing on system parameters like gain of PA, cooperativity, temperature. As in cooling experiments the detrimental effects of mirror's Browninan and zero point noises are strongly suppressed by the pumping power. By judicious choice of the phases, the cavity output is squeezed only if the mirror is squeezed thus providing us a direct measure of the mirror's squeezing.

abstract: The entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism provides a useful framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes (QECC), which can transform arbitrary classical linear codes into entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) by using pre-shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver. In this paper, we construct five classes of entanglement-assisted quantum MDS (EAQMDS) codes based on classical MDS codes by exploiting one or more pre-shared maximally entangled states. We show that these EAQMDS codes have much larger minimum distance than the standard quantum MDS (QMDS) codes of the same length, and three classes of these EAQMDS codes consume only one pair of maximally entangled states.

abstract: In our former contribution [Ann. Phys. 360 (2015) 44], we have shown the sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions in the evolution of Gaussian wave packets via the nonlinear Riccati equation. The formalism developed in the previous work is extended to effective approaches for the description of dissipative quantum systems. By means of simple examples we show the effects of the environment on the quantum uncertainties, correlation function, quantum energy contribution and tunneling currents. We prove that the environmental parameter $\gamma$ is strongly related with the sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions.

abstract: We suggest an all-optical scheme for the storage, retrieval and processing of a single-photon wave packet through its off-resonant Raman interaction with a series of coherent control beams. These control beams, each with distinct carrier frequency, are distributed along the way of single-photon propagation, thus effectively forming a gradient absorption structure which can be controlled in various ways to achieve different single-photon processing functionalities. Such a controllable frequency comb is a hybrid of Raman, gradient echo memory (GEM) and atomic frequency comb (AFC) methods, therefore demonstrates many of their advantages all together in one.

abstract: The concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeiglinger (C-GHZ) state which is a new type of logic-qubit entanglement has attracted a lot of attentions recently. We present a feasible entanglement concentration protocol (ECP) for logic-qubit entanglement. This ECP is based on the linear optics, and it does not know the initial coefficients of the less-entangled C-GHZ state. This protocol can be extended to arbitrary C-GHZ state. This protocol may be useful in future quantum information processing tasks.

abstract: We study how an arbitrary Gaussian state of two localized wave packets, prepared in an inertial frame of reference, is described by a pair of uniformly accelerated observers. We explicitly compute the resulting state for arbitrarily chosen proper accelerations of the observers and independently tuned distance between them. To do so, we introduce a generalized Rindler frame of reference and analytically derive the corresponding state transformation as a Gaussian channel. Our approach provides several new insights into the phenomenon of vacuum entanglement such as the highly non-trivial effect of spatial separation between the observers including sudden death of entanglement. We also calculate the fidelity of the two-mode channel for non-vacuum Gaussian states and obtain bounds on classical and quantum capacities of a single-mode channel. Our framework can be directly applied to any continuous variable quantum information protocol in which the effects of acceleration or gravity cannot be neglected.

abstract: We have considered theoretically the feasibility of the broadband quantum memory based on the resonant tripod-type atomic configuration. In this case, the writing of a signal field is carried out simultaneously into two channels, and characterized by an excitation of two spin waves of the atomic ensemble. With simultaneous read out from both channels quantum properties of the original signal are mapped on the retrieval pulse no worse than in the case of memory based on Lambda-type atomic configuration. At the same time new possibilities are opened up for manipulation of quantum states associated with sequential reading out (and/or sequential writing) of signal pulses. For example, the pulse in squeezed state is converted into two partially entangled pulses with partially squeezed quadratures. Alternatively, two independent signal pulses with orthogonal squeezed quadratures can be converted into two entangled pulses.

We also show graph types for which such equivalence does not exist. Several instructive examples are discussed, and a general approach to analyze more complex branching graphs is formulated. It is further illustrated with a return quantum walk solution for a cube graph with adjustable complex hopping amplitudes.

abstract: Quantum mechanics provides a statistical description about nature, and thus would be incomplete if its statistical predictions could not be accounted for some realistic models with hidden variables. There are, however, two powerful theorems against the hidden-variable theories showing that certain quantum features cannot be reproduced based on two rationale premises of classicality, the Bell theorem, and noncontextuality, due to Bell, Kochen and Specker (BKS) . Tests of the Bell inequality and the BKS theorem are both of fundamental interests and of great significance . The Bell theorem has already been experimentally verified extensively on many different systems , while the quantum contextuality, which is independent of nonlocality and manifests itself even in a single object, is experimentally more demanding. Moreover, the contextuality has been shown to play a critical role to supply the `magic' for quantum computation, making more extensive experimental verifications in potential systems for quantum computing even more stringent. Here we report an experimental verification of quantum contextuality on an individual atomic nuclear spin-1 system in solids under ambient condition. Such a three-level system is indivisible and thus the compatibility loophole, which exists in the experiments performed on bipartite systems, is closed. Our experimental results confirm that the quantum contextuality cannot be explained by nonlocal entanglement, revealing the fundamental quantumness other than locality/nonlocality within the intrinsic spin freedom of a concrete natural atomic solid-state system at room temperature.

abstract: There is no fundamental limit to the precision of a classical measurement. The position of a meter's needle can be determined with an arbitrarily small uncertainty. In the quantum realm, however, fundamental quantum fluctuations due to the Heisenberg principle limit the measurement precision. The simplest measurement procedures, involving semi-classical states of the meter, lead to a fluctuation-limited imprecision at the standard quantum limit. By engineering the quantum state of the meter system, the measurement imprecision can be reduced down to the fundamental Heisenberg Limit (HL). Quantum-enabled metrology techniques are thus in high demand and the focus of an intense activity. We report here a quantum-enabled measurement of an electric field based on this approach. We cast Rydberg atoms in Schr\"odinger cat states, superpositions of atomic levels with radically different polarizabilites. We use a quantum interference process to perform a measurement close to the HL, reaching a single-shot sensitivity of 1.2 mV/cm for a 100 ns interaction time, corresponding to 30 $\mu$V/cm/Hz^(1/2) at our 3 kHz repetition rate. This highly sensitive, non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement extends the realm of electrometric techniques and could have important practical applications. Detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices at a ~100 $\mu$m distance, with a MegaHertz bandwith is within reach.

abstract: A methodology is introduced that enables an absolute, quantum-limited measurement of sub-wavelength interferometric displacements. The technique utilizes a high-frequency optical path modulation within an interferometer operated in a homodyne configuration. All of the information necessary to fully characterize the resultant path displacement is contained within the relative strengths of the various harmonics of the phase modulation. The method, which is straightforward and readily implementable, allows a direct measurement of the theoretical Cram\'er-Rao limit of detection without any assumptions on the nature of the light source.

abstract: Mermin's inequality is the generalization of the Bell-CHSH inequality for three qubit states. The violation of the Mermin inequality guarantees the fact that there exists quantum non-locality either between two or three qubits in a three qubit system. In the absence of an analytical result to this effect, in order to check for the violation of Mermin's inequality one has to perform a numerical optimization procedure for even three qubit pure states. Here we derive an analytical formula for the maximum value of the expectation of the Mermin operator in terms of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, that gives the maximal violation of the Mermin inequality for all three qubit pure and mixed states.

abstract: A number of papers have suggested that it is inappropriate to combine data from different experiments when undertaking experimental tests of Bell's inequalities. It has been suggested that a correct analysis, using a single probability space, leads to inequalities which are not violated by experiment. If correct, this would be contrary to the normal interpretation of such experimental data. However, in this note, a generalised Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is derived for a system of four experiments constructed on a single probability space which combines the data from the four experiments. It is shown that this leads to the standard CHSH inequality which is normally used to interpret experimental data. Thus the commonly accepted conclusion that experimental violations of Bell's inequality imply that local realistic models are inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics has not been challenged.

abstract: We explore a general diagrammatic framework to understand qudits and their braiding, especially in its relation to entanglement. This involves understanding the role of isotopy in interpreting diagrams that implement entangling gates as well as some standard quantum information protocols. We give qudit Pauli operators $X,Y,Z$ and comment on their structure, both from an algebraic and from a diagrammatic point of view. We explain alternative models for diagrammatic interpretations of qudits and their transformations. We use our diagrammatic approach to define an entanglement-relay protocol for long-distance entanglement. Our approach rests on algebraic and topological relations discovered in the study of planar para algebras. In summary, this work provides bridges between the new theory of planar para algebras and quantum information, especially in questions involving entanglement.

abstract: The use of superposition of states in quantum computation, known as quantum parallelism, has significant advantage in terms of speed over the classical computation. It can be understood from the early invented quantum algorithms such as Deutsch's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and its variation as Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, Simon algorithm, Shor's algorithms etc. Quantum parallelism also significantly speeds up the database search algorithm, which is important in computer science because it comes as a subroutine in many important algorithms. Quantum database search of Grover achieves the task of finding the target element in an unsorted database in a time quadratically faster than the classical computer. We review the Grover quantum search algorithms for a singe and multiple target elements in a database. The partial search algorithm of Grover and Radhakrishnan and its optimization by Korepin, called GRK algorithm are also discussed.

abstract: Explaining observations in terms of causes and effects is central to all of empirical science. Correlations between entangled quantum particles, however, seem to defy such an explanation. To recover a causal picture in this case, some of the fundamental assumptions of causal explanations have to give way. Here we consider a broad class of models where one of these assumptions, Bell's local causality, is relaxed by allowing a direct influence from one measurement outcome to the other. We use interventional and observational data from a photonic experiment to bound the strength of this causal influence in a two-party Bell scenario and test a novel Bell-type inequality for the considered models. Our results demonstrate the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with an important class of nonlocal causal models, which includes Bell's original model as a special case. Recovering a classical causal picture of quantum correlations thus requires an even more counter-intuitive modification of our classical notion of cause and effect.

abstract: A ferromagnetic needle is predicted to precess about the magnetic field axis at a Larmor frequency $\Omega$ when $I\Omega \ll N\hbar$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the needle about the precession axis and $N$ is the number of polarized spins in the needle. In this regime the needle behaves as a gyroscope with spin $N\hbar$ maintained along the easy axis of the needle by the crystalline and shape anisotropy. A precessing ferromagnetic needle is a correlated system of $N$ spins which can be used to measure magnetic fields for long times. In principle, the sensitivity of a precessing needle magnetometer can far surpass that of magnetometers based on spin precession of atoms in the gas phase. The phenomenon of ferromagnetic needle precession may be of particular interest for precision measurements testing fundamental physics.

abstract: The first generation of quantum computers are on the horizon, fabricated from quantum hardware platforms that may soon be able to tackle certain tasks that cannot be performed or modelled with conventional computers. These quantum devices will not likely be universal or fully programmable, but special-purpose processors whose hardware will be tightly co-designed with particular target applications. Trapped atomic ions are a leading platform for first generation quantum computers, but are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general purpose devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are atomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 10^15, and their quantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use of external fields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of the qubits themselves. In this article we show how a modular quantum computer of any size can be engineered from ion crystals, and how the wiring between ion trap qubits can be tailored to a variety of applications and quantum computing protocols.

abstract: We develop a quantum circuit model describing unitary interactions between quantum fields and a uniformly accelerated object, and apply it to a semi-transparent mirror which uniformly accelerates in the Minkowski vacuum. The reflection coefficient $R_{\omega}$ of the mirror varies between 0 and 1, representing a generalization of the perfect mirror ($R_{\omega}=1$) discussed extensively in the literature. Our method is non-perturbative, not requiring $R_{\omega} \sim 0$. We use the circuit model to calculate the radiation from an eternally accelerated mirror and obtain a finite particle flux along the past horizon provided an appropriate low frequency regularization is introduced. More importantly, it is straightforward to see from our formalism that the radiation is squeezed. The squeezing is closely related to cutting the correlation across the horizon, which therefore may have important implications to the formation of a black hole firewall.

abstract: It is well known that the interaction of quantum systems with the environment reduces the inherent quantum correlations. Under special circumstances the effect of decoherence can be reversed, for example, the interaction modeled by an amplitude damping channel can boost the teleportation fidelity from the classical to the quantum region for a bipartite quantum state. Here, we first show that this phenomena fails in the case of a quantum key distribution protocol. We further show that the technique of weak measurement can be used to slow down the process of decoherence, thereby helping to preserve the quantum key rate when one or both systems are interacting with the environment via an amplitude damping channel. Most interestingly, in certain cases weak measurement with post-selection where one considers both success and failure of the technique is shown to be more useful than without it when both systems interact with the environment.

abstract: Although quantum key distribution (QKD) is theoretically secure, there is a gap between the theory and practice. In fact, real-life QKD may not be secure because component devices in QKD systems may deviate from the theoretical models assumed in security proofs. To solve this problem, it is necessary to construct the security proof under realistic assumptions on the source and measurement unit. In this paper, we prove the security of a QKD protocol under practical assumptions on the source that accommodate fluctuation of the phase and intensity modulations. As long as our assumptions hold, it does not matter at all how the phase and intensity distribute nor whether or not their distributions over different pulses are independently and identically distributed (I.I.D.). Our work shows that practical sources can be safely employed in QKD experiments.

abstract: Once in its non-equilibrium steady state, a nanoscale system coupled to several heat baths may be thought-of as a quantum heat pump. Depending on the direction of its stationary heat flows it may function as e.g. a refrigerator or a heat transformer. These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex multipartite systems, and yet their working principle is always the same: They are made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As a result, it is possible to devise external black-box testing strategies to learn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal details. In particular, one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a two-level spin to one of its contact transitions. The steady state of this external probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and internal dissipation in the device, and also, about the direction of its steady-state heat currents. Provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump is low, one can further estimate its coefficient of performance. These techniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal engineering, as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of complex thermodynamic cycles.

abstract: Eighty years ago Einstein demonstrated that a particular interpretation of the reduction of wave function led to a paradox and that this paradox disappeared if statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics was adopted. According to the statistical interpretation a wave function describes only an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems. Searching for an intuitive explanation of long range correlations between outcomes of distant measurements, performed on pairs of physical systems prepared in a spin singlet state, John Bell analysed local realistic hidden variable models and proved that correlations consistent with these models satisfy Bell inequalities which are violated by some predictions of quantum mechanics. Several different local models were constructed, various inequalities proven and shown to be violated by experimental data. Some physicists concluded that Nature is definitely not local. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we critically analyze some influential finite sample proofs of various inequalities and so called quantum Randi challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell game.The violation of inequalities does not prove that local and causal explanation of correlations is impossible. The violation of inequalities gives only a strong argument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view according to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random way. We also explain the meaning of sample homogeneity loophole and show how it can invalidate statistical significance tests. We point out that this loophole was not closed in several recent experiments testing local realism.

abstract: In this work, two experimentally feasible methods of decoherence engineering-one based on the application of stochastic classical kicks and the other based on temporally randomized pulse sequences are combined. A different coupling interaction is proposed, which leads to amplitude damping as compared to existing methods which model phase damping, utilizing the $zz$ coupling interaction. The decoherence process on combining the stochastic kick method and the randomized pulse sequence method and the effectiveness of dynamical decoupling under these coupling interactions are analyzed. Finally, a counter-intuitive result where decoherence is suppressed in the presence of two noise sources under certain resonant conditions is presented.

abstract: We study the robustness of quantum key distribution protocols based on discrete and continuous variables to the channel noise. We introduce the model of such noise based on coupling of the signal to a thermal bath, typical for continuous-variable quantum key distribution, to the discrete-variable case. Then we perform a comparison of the bounds on the tolerable channel noise between these two kinds of protocols using the same noise parametrization, in the case of implementation which is perfect otherwise. Obtained results show that continuous-variable protocols can exhibit similar robustness to the channel noise when the transmittance of the channel is relatively high. However, for strong loss discrete-variable protocols are superior and can overcome even the infinite-squeezing continuous-variable protocol while using limited nonclassical resources. The requirement on the probability of a single-photon production which would have to be fulfilled by a practical source of photons in order to demonstrate such superiority is feasible thanks to the recent rapid development in this field.

abstract: We study certain non-linear generalisations of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation which admit static solitonic 2 solutions in absence of external potential acting on the particle. We consider a class of solutions that can be written as a product of a solution of the linear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a peaked quantum soliton, in a regime where the size of the soliton is quite smaller than the typical scale of variation of the linear wave. In the non-relativistic limit, the solitons obey a generalized de Broglie-Bohm (dB-B) guidance equation. In first approximation, this guidance equation reduces to the dB-B guidance equation according to which they move at the so-called de Broglie-Bohm velocity along the hydrodynamical flow lines of the linear Schr{\"o}dinger wave. If we consider a spinorial electronic wave function a la Dirac, its barycentre is predicted to move exactly in accordance with the dB-B guidance equation.

abstract: We determine the ultimate classical information capacity of a linear time-invariant bosonic channel with additive phase-insensitive Gaussian noise. This channel can model fiber-optic communication at power levels below the threshold for significant nonlinear effects. We provide a general continuous-time result that gives the ultimate capacity for such a channel operating in the quasimonochromatic regime under an average power constraint. This ultimate capacity is compared with corresponding results for heterodyne and homodyne detection over the same channel.

abstract: It is still an outstanding challenge to characterize and understand the topological features of strongly correlated states such as bound-states in interacting multi-particle quantum systems. Recently, bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in quantum magnets have been experimentally observed in quantum Heisenberg chains comprising ultracold Bose atoms in optical lattices. Here, we explore an unprecedented topological state called topological magnon bound-state in the quantum Heisenberg chain under cotranslational symmetry. We find that the cotranslational symmetry allows us to formulate a direct topological invariant for the multi-particle quantum states, which can be used to characterize the topological features of multi-magnon excitations. We calculate energy spectra, density distributions, correlations and topological invariants of the two-magnon bound-states and show the existence of topological magnon bound-states. Our study not only opens a new prospect to pursue topological bound-states, but also gives insights into the characterization and understanding of strongly interacting topological states.

abstract: We introduce an alternative approach to the polarization theory of light. This is based on a set of quantum operators, constructed from two independent bosons, being three of them the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators, and the other one, the Casimir operator of this algebra. By taking the expectation value of these generators in a two-mode coherent state, their classical limit is obtained. We use these classical quantities to define the new Stokes-like parameters. We show that the light polarization ellipse can be written in terms of the Stokes-like parameters. Also, we write these parameters in terms of other two quantities, and show that they define a one-sheet (Poincar\'e hyperboloid) of a two-sheet hyperboloid. Our study is restricted to the case of a monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave which propagates along the $z$ axis.

abstract: We present an experimental realization of resonance fluorescence in squeezed vacuum. We strongly couple microwave-frequency squeezed light to a superconducting artificial atom and detect the resulting fluorescence with high resolution enabled by a broadband traveling-wave parametric amplifier. We investigate the fluorescence spectra in the weak and strong driving regimes, observing up to 3.1 dB of reduction of the fluorescence linewidth below the ordinary vacuum level and a dramatic dependence of the Mollow triplet spectrum on the relative phase of the driving and squeezed vacuum fields. Our results are in excellent agreement with predictions for spectra produced by a two-level atom in squeezed vacuum [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{58}, 2539-2542 (1987)], demonstrating that resonance fluorescence offers a resource-efficient means to characterize squeezing in cryogenic environments.

abstract: Coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy techniques are broadly applied across the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from NMR to the UV. These reveal properties of matter through correlation plots of signal fields generated in response to sequences of short pulses with variable delays. Here we discuss a new class of multidimensional techniques obtained by time-and-frequency resolved photon coincidence counting measurements of N photons which constitutes a 2N dimensional spectrum. A compact description of these signals is developed based on time ordered superoperators rather than the normally ordered ordinary operators used in Glauber's photon counting formalism. The independent control of the time and frequency gate parameters reveals details of matter dynamics not available otherwise. Application to an anharmonic oscillator model with fluctuating energy and anharmonicity demonstrates the power of these signals.

abstract: One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.

abstract: We introduce and theoretically demonstrate a quantum metamaterial made of dense ultracold neutral atoms loaded into an inherently defect-free artificial crystal of light, immune to well-known critical chal- lenges inevitable in conventional solid-state platforms. We demonstrate an all-optical control on ultrafast time scales over the photonic topological transition of the isofrequency contour from an open to close topology at the same frequency. This atomic lattice quantum metamaterial enables a dynamic manipula- tion of the decay rate of a probe quantum emitter by more than an order of magnitude. This proposal may lead to practically lossless, tunable and topologically-reconfigurable quantum metamaterials, for single- or few-photon-level applications as varied as quantum sensing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulations using metamaterials.

abstract: The auxiliary function of a classical channel appears in two fundamental quantities that upper and lower bound the error probability, respectively. A crucial property of the auxiliary function is its concavity, which leads to several important results in finite block length analysis. In this paper, we prove that the auxiliary function of a classical-quantum channel also enjoys the same concave property, extending an earlier partial result to its full generality. The key component in our proof is a beautiful result of geometric means of operators.

Moreover, we verify that this enhancement is increased for stronger coupling between the two fields.

abstract: We analyze in detail an open cavity array using mean-field description, where each cavity field is coupled to a number of three-level atoms. Such system is highly tunable and can be described by a Jaynes-Cummings like Hamiltonian with additional non-linear terms. In the single cavity case we provide simple analytic solutions and show, that the system features a bistable region. The extra non-linear term gives rise to a rich dynamical behaviour including occurrence of limit cycles through Hopf bifurcations. In the limit of large non-linearity, the system exhibits an Ising like phase transition as the coupling between light and matter is varied. We then discuss how these results extend to the two-dimensional case.

abstract: A new quantum ontology of quantum mechanics has been proposed recently. This ontology is based on impossible to realize measurements which need to be performed repeatedly on the same single physical system or on the same pair of physical systems. We agree that quantum mechanics is a contextual theory and that the experimental contexts have to be a part of any description of quantum phenomena but in our opinion this new ontology is neither convincing nor useful. In particular the authors claim that their ontology explains the peaceful coexistence between quantum mechanics and relativity in spin polarization correlation experiments. We show that, contrary to their claim, the authors are unable to explain why strong correlations, between the outcomes of distant local measurements, do exist and why they preserve a condition of parameter independence (non-signaling). Strangely enough the authors ignore that these strong but imperfect correlations can be explained in a local and causal way using statistical contextual interpretation of quantum mechanics what was demonstrated in several articles.

abstract: We present a way of measuring the anharmonicity of a quantum oscillator coupled to an optical field via radiation pressure. Through a sequence of pulsed interactions we perform a loop in the phase space of the mechanical oscillator initially prepared in a thermal state and we show how the optical field acquires a phase depending on the anharmonicity that can be measured with high precision. Remarkably, one only needs small initial cooling of the mechanical motion to probe even small anharmonicities. Finally, by applying tools from quantum estimation theory, we calculate the ultimate bound on the estimation precision posed by quantum mechanics and compare it with the precision obtainable with feasible measurements such as homodyne and heterodyne detection on the cavity field. In particular we demonstrate that homodyne detection is nearly optimal in the limit of a large number of photons of the field, and we discuss the estimation precision of small anharmonicities in terms of its signal-to-noise ratio.

authors: Daniel J. Brod
comments: 11 pages, 2 figures

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.03539
abstract: Matchgates are a restricted set of two-qubit gates known to be classically simulable under particular conditions. Specifically, if a circuit consists only of nearest-neighbour matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible if either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation requires computing probabilities of multi-qubit outcomes (including also adaptive measurements), or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the most general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary input states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits, and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary single-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical simulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other restricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear optics, where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar modifications.

abstract: We introduce an accurate non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger-type approximation of Bloch optical equations for two-level systems. This approximation provides a complete description of the excitation, relaxation and decoherence dynamics in both weak and strong laser fields. In this approach, it is sufficient to propagate the wave function of the quantum system instead of the density matrix, providing that relaxation and dephasing are taken into account via automatically-adjusted time-dependent gain and decay rates. The developed formalism is applied to the problem of scattering and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by a thin layer comprised of interacting two-level emitters.

abstract: We explore quantum and classical correlations along with coherence in the ground states of spin-1 Heisenberg chains, namely the one-dimensional XXZ model and the one-dimensional bilinear biquadratic model, with the techniques of density matrix renormalization group theory. Exploiting the tools of quantum information theory, that is, by studying quantum discord, quantum mutual information and three recently introduced coherence measures in the reduced density matrix of two nearest neighbor spins in the bulk, we investigate the quantum phase transitions and special symmetry points in these models. We point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of correlation and coherence measures as figures of merit to witness the quantum phase transitions and symmetry points in the considered spin-1 Heisenberg chains. In particular, we demonstrate that as none of the studied measures can detect the infinite order Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XXZ model, they appear to be able to signal the existence of the same type of transition in the biliear biquadratic model. However, we argue that what is actually detected by the measures here is the SU(3) symmetry point of the model rather than the infinite order quantum phase transition. Moreover, we show in the XXZ model that examining even single site coherence can be sufficient to spotlight the second-order phase transition and the SU(2) symmetry point.

abstract: Encoding many qubits in different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons is one of the routes towards enlarging the Hilbert space spanned by a photonic quantum state. Hyperentangled photon states (i.e. states showing entanglement in multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both fundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing the number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and integration of the basic elements and functions to guarantee the set-up stability. This motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise control of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use of path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum circuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on both DOFs. Our results pave the way towards the full integration on a chip of hybrid multiqubit multiphoton states.

abstract: Fundamental modifications of the standard Schr\"odinger equation by additional nonlinear terms have been considered for various purposes over the recent decades. It came as a surprise when, inverting Abner Shimony's observation of "peaceful coexistence" between standard quantum mechanics and relativity, N. Gisin proved in 1990 that any (deterministic) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation would allow for superluminal communication. This is by now the most spectacular and best known anomaly. We discuss further anomalies, simple but foundational, less spectacular but not less dramatic.

abstract: Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a trademark of quantum mechanics. In its original form it states that one cannot gain information about a system without disturbing it, which is a core of novel cryptographic techniques based on quantum effects. The principle can be derived from mathematical formalism of quantum theory. However the formalism itself is very abstract - unlike in classical mechanics, it does not directly refer to what we perceive. The question arises: can we derive the principle from more comprehensible assumptions? Here we derive Heisenberg trade-off from two assumptions: impossibility of instantaneous messaging at a distance (no-signaling), and violation of Bell inequalities (non-locality). The former is a natural and simple assumption, while the latter is an observable phenomenon implied by quantum mechanics. That the trade-off is a consequence of the above two assumptions is indirectly implied by existing schemes of secure cryptography based on the above two assumptions. Surprisingly, despite of vast literature on such crypto-systems, no direct connection between no-signaling, non-locality and Heisenberg principle was ever proposed. We also analyze a Bayesian trade-off, and note that there exists a range of parameters, where assumptions of no-signaling precisely reconstruct quantum predictions.

Then, we apply the empty state to an elementary example state and find its three different representations. We apply the empty state to Fock states and find an undetermined state. Then, we apply the empty state to the coherent state to produce the empty state of the coherent state (the EC state), and determine some of its mathematical, statistical and nonclassical properties.

abstract: A general and in principle exact approach for the continuous variable entanglement in a system of coupled harmonic oscillators in contact with a thermal bath is formulated. This allows a generalization to describe entanglement's existence between two sites in any system of this kind. It is employed a method of simultaneous diagonalization of two quadratic forms to obtain the uncoupled quantum Hamiltonian. Making use of the transformations that uncouple the system, the covariance matrix for two positions is constructed, and through a modification of the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT-criterion), the condition that determines the existence or not of quantum correlation between the sites is obtained.

abstract: In this paper we consider a situation in which several quantum particles are located relatively far away from each other. We assume that each particle remains in a sharply localised state throughout time, a peaked soliton, due to the existence of some confinement mechanism, for instance a self-focusing non-linear interaction. In a previous work we showed that in this case there exist a class of solutions of the quantum dynamics such that at the zero order of perturbation the peaked quantum solitons (solitary waves) obey a generalized de Broglie-Bohm (dB-B) guidance equation. Here we show that, at the first order of perturbation, our model predicts the appearance of an effective gravitational field.

abstract: The entangled "Schrodinger's cat" state of a quantum and its measurement apparatus is not a superposition of quantum states but is instead a non-paradoxical superposition of nonlocal correlations between quantum states. This elucidation of entanglement is demonstrated by experiments conducted in 1990 using entangled photon pairs. Thus the Schrodinger's cat state does not predict a dead-and-alive cat. Instead of indefinite superpositions, it predicts indeterminate but definite outcomes. When a superposed quantum entangles with a measurement apparatus, the composite system instantly collapses locally to incoherent mixtures of definite outcomes of the quantum and of the apparatus, while the global superposition of correlations maintains its unitary evolution. This transfer of coherence from the quantum system to correlations between the system and its measuring apparatus is the reason instantaneous local collapse can occur upon measurement without interrupting the smooth global evolution that follows Schrodinger's equation. Objections to this resolution (namely improper density operators, and basis ambiguity) are rebutted.

abstract: To date, both quantum theory, and Einstein's theory of general relativity have passed every experimental test in their respective regimes. Nevertheless, almost since their inception, there has been debate surrounding whether they should be unified and by now there exists strong theoretical arguments pointing to the necessity of quantising the gravitational field. In recent years, a number of experiments have been proposed which, if successful, should give insight into features at the Planck scale. Here we review some of the motivations, from the perspective of semi-classical arguments, to expect new physical effects at the overlap of quantum theory and general relativity. We conclude with a short introduction to some of the proposals being made to facilitate empirical verification.

abstract: We systematically study several classical-quantum correspondence properties of the dissipative modified kicked rotator, a paradigmatic ratchet model. We explore the behavior of the asymptotic currents for finite $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ values in a wide range of the parameter space. We find that the correspondence between the classical currents with thermal noise providing uctuations of size $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ and the quantum ones without it, is very good in general with the exception of specific regions. We systematically consider the spectra of the corresponding classical Perron-Frobenius operators and quantum superoperators. By means of an average distance between the classical and quantum sets of eigenvalues we find that the correspondence is unexpectedly quite uniform. This apparent contradiction is solved with the help of the Weyl-Wigner distributions of the equilibrium eigenvectors, which reveal the key role of quantum effects by showing surviving coherences in the asymptotic states.

This result can also be interpreted as a single-experiment generalization of the well-known multiple-experiment Ehrenfest theorem. We also demonstrate the pure quantum origin of the (non-linear) wave equation for classical mechanics, providing clear evidence for a quantum-classical inter-theory unification and a deeper understanding of decoherence.

The success probability gains up to ~1.85% with respect to the optimized Kennedy receiver and, when employed in an adaptive strategy, approaches the Helstrom bound appreciably faster than the Dolinar receiver. An optical cavity implementation of the partial dephaser is proposed and its performances are analyzed.

abstract: There are many ways to decompose the Hilbert space of a composite quantum system into tensor product subspaces. Different subsystem decompositions generally imply different interaction Hamiltonians V, and therefore different expectation values for subsystem observables. This means that the uniqueness of physical predictions is not guaranteed, despite the uniqueness of the total Hamiltonian H and the total Hilbert space. Here we use Clausius' version of the second law of thermodynamics (CSL) and standard identifications of thermodynamic quantities to identify possible subsystem decompositions. It is shown that agreement with the CSL is obtained, whenever the total Hamiltonian and the subsystem-dependent interaction Hamiltonian commute (i.e. [H, V ] = 0). Not imposing this constraint can result in the transfer of heat from a cooler to a hotter subsystem, in conflict with thermodynamics. We also investigate the status of the CSL with respect to non- standard definitions of thermodynamic quantities and quantum subsystems.

abstract: We introduce quantum sensing schemes for measuring very weak forces with a single trapped ion. They use the spin-motional coupling induced by the laser-ion interaction to transfer the relevant force information to the spin-degree of freedom. Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the force with a sensitivity beyond the yN $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ range, i.e. in the xN$ /\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ (xennonewton, $10^{-27}$). The Jahn-Teller protocol, in particular, can be used to implement a two-channel vector spectrum analyzer for measuring ultra-low voltages.

With the simple example of a qubit is evidenced the relationship between weak values, measured probabilities and the separation between non-orthogonal bases.

abstract: We consider the transversal modes of ions in a linear radio frequency (rf) trap where we control the time dependent axial confinement to show that we can excite quanta of motion via a two-mode squeezing process. This effect is analogous to phenomena predicted to occur during the evaporation of black holes and cosmological particle creation, in general out of reach for experimental investigation. As substantial advantage of this proposal in comparison to previous ones we propose to exploit radial and axial modes simultaneously to permit experimental access of these effects based on state-of-the-art technology. In addition, we propose to create and explore entanglement, starting with two ions, and relate the results to fundamental aspects of the entropy of black holes.

abstract: Electromagnetic vector potential has physical significance in quantum mechanics as revealed by the Aharonov-Bohm effect for charged particles. However, till date it is thought that we cannot measure the vector potential directly as this is not a gauge invariant quantity. Contrary to this belief, here we show that one can indeed measure the electromagnetic vector potential using the notion of weak value. We show that it is simply the difference between the weak value of the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the presence and absence of magnetic field. This suggests that the vector potential is not only a physical entity but can be measured directly in the experiment.

abstract: We classify two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians in terms of their computational complexity. Suppose one has a two-qubit commuting Hamiltonian H which one can apply to any pair of qubits, starting in a computational basis state. We prove a dichotomy theorem: either this model is efficiently classically simulable or it allows one to sample from probability distributions which cannot be sampled from classically unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, the only simulable Hamiltonians are those which fail to generate entanglement. This shows that generic two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians can be used to perform computational tasks which are intractable for classical computers under plausible assumptions. Our proof makes use of new postselection gadgets and Lie theory.

The phase function describes symmetries of the resource state of the MBQC, specifies the computational output, and acts as a contextuality witness. It is also a topological object, namely a 1-cocycle in group cohomology. Non-triviality of the cocycles reveals the presence of contextuality, and is a precondition for quantum speedup.

abstract: In large quantum systems multipartite entanglement can be found in many inequivalent classes under local operations and classical communication. Preparing states of arbitrary size in different classes is important for performing a wide range of quantum protocols. W states, in particular, constitute a class with a variety of quantum networking protocols. However, all known schemes for preparing W states are probabilistic, with resource requirements increasing at least sub-exponentially. We propose a deterministic scheme for preparing W states that requires no prior entanglement and can be performed locally. We introduce an all-optical setup that can efficiently prepare W states of arbitrary size. Our scheme advances the use of W states in real-world quantum networks and could be extended to other physical systems.

abstract: We study the effects of external magnetic fields on the precision of parameter estimation with thermal entanglement of two spins in XX model, in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Calculating the quantum Fisher information, we show that homogeneous magnetic field B, inhomogeneous magnetic field b or DM interaction D increases the precision of parameter estimation, overwhelming the destructive effects of thermalization. We also show that for the model in consideration, the effects of b and D are the same. However, the existence of both b and B (or both D and B) decreases the precision. We find that in order to increase the precision in parameter estimation tasks, applying b in the ferromagnetic case and B in the antiferromagnetic case should be preferred.

abstract: We demonstrate that a thermal transistor can be made up with a quantum system of 3 interacting subsystems , coupled to a thermal reservoir each. This thermal transistor is analogous to an electronic bipolar one with the ability to control the thermal currents at the collector and at the emitter with the imposed thermal current at the base. This is achieved determining the heat fluxes by means of the strong-coupling formalism. For the case of 3 interacting spins, in which one of them is coupled to the other 2, that are not directly coupled, it is shown that high amplification can be obtained in a wide range of energy parameters and temperatures. The proposed quantum transistor could, in principle, be used to develop devices such as a thermal modulator and a thermal amplifier in nano systems.

abstract: Robust, accurate and efficient quantum tomography is key for future quantum technologies. Traditional methods are impractical for even medium sized systems and are not robust against noise and errors. Here we report on an experimental demonstration of self-guided quantum tomography; an autonomous, fast, robust and precise technique for measuring quantum states with significantly less computational resources than standard techniques. The quantum state is iteratively learned by treating tomography as a projection measurement optimization problem. We experimentally demonstrate robustness against both statistical noise and experimental errors on both single qubit and entangled two-qubit states. Our demonstration provides a method of full quantum state characterization in current and near-future experiments where standard techniques are unfeasible.

abstract: Entanglement between different regions in momentum space is studied for ground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in a transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases, entanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an anisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In the ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy between left- and right-moving modes which is independent on the external field. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space. In the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between energy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size, with a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth of the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size provides an explanation for the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum space.

abstract: The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum entanglement experiments is at best incomplete, since the intermediate state induced by collapse of the wave function apparently depends upon the inertial rest frame in which the experiment is observed. While the Many Worlds Interpretation of Everett, MWI, avoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the special theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past, present and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules out Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by postulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are identical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they diverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event then emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens divided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of such universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking of it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis proposed by Tegmark. However, while Tegmark wished to avoid contamination from Goedelian self referential knots, not only does such contamination appear to be inevitable, it brings an unexpected benefit. The mathematical hierarchy required by the enigmatic footnote 48a in the paper by Goedel leads to an explanation for a unitary evolution of deterministic quantum rules across the multiverse while accounting for quantum uncertainty within an individual universe. Other aspects of this structure, called here the Plexus, are discussed, including awareness of existence and other questions raised by the hypothesis.

abstract: The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum physics. It implies that the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables can not be predicted simultaneously. In quantum information theory, this principle can be expressed in terms of entropic measures. Berta \emph{et al}. [\{this http URL}{ Nature Phys. 6, 659 (2010) }] have indicated that uncertainty bound can be altered by considering a particle as a quantum memory correlating with the primary particle. In this article, we obtain a new lower bound for entropic uncertainty in the presence of a quantum memory by adding an additional term depending to Holevo quantity and mutual information. We conclude that the Berta's uncertainty lower bound will be tighten when the accessible information about measurements outcomes is less than the mutual information of the joint state. We investigate some examples for which our lower bound is tighter than the Berta's et al. lower bound. Using our lower bound, we also obtain a lower bound for the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states and an upper bound for the regularized distillable common randomness.

abstract: A quantum flywheel is studied with the purpose of storing useful work in quantum levels, while additional power is extracted continuously from the device. The flywheel gains its energy form a quantum heat engine. Generally, when a work repository is quantized the work exchange with the engine is accompanied with heat exchange, which may degrade the charging efficiency. In the particular realization of a quantum harmonic oscillator work repository, quantum and thermal fluctuations dominates the dynamics. Quantum monitoring and feedback control are applied to the flywheel, as it is shown to be an essential part of stabilizing and regulating its state of operation, and bringing the system to a steady state. A particular balance between information gained by measuring the system and the information fed back to the system is found to maximize the charging efficiency. The dynamics of the flywheel are described by a stochastic master equation that accounts for the engine, the external driving, the measurement, and the feedback operations.

We selectively couple the optical transitions associated with different qubit basis states to the cavity, and utilize the change in cavity transmissivity to generate a qubit readout signal composed of many photons. We show that this approach enables single-shot optical readout even when the qubit does not have a good cycling transition required for standard resonance fluorescence measurements. We calculate the probability that the measurement detects the correct spin state using the example of a quantum dot spin under various experimental conditions and demonstrate that it can exceed 0.99.

abstract: We investigate the bias-modulated dynamics of a strongly driven two-level system using the counter-rotating-hybridized rotating-wave (CHRW) method. This CHRW method treats the driving field and the bias on equal footing by a unitary transformation with two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, and is nonperturbative in driving strength, tunneling amplitude or bias. In addition, this CHRW method is beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA) and yet by properly choosing the two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, the transformed Hamiltonian takes the RWA form with a renormalized energy splitting and a renormalized driving strength. The reformulated CHRW method possesses the same mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA approach and thus allows us to calculate analytically the dynamics and explore explicitly the effect of the bias. We show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics for a wide range of parameters as compared to the numerically exact results. When energy scales of the driving are comparable to the intrinsic energy scale of the two-level systems, the counter-rotating interactions and static bias profoundly influence the generalized Rabi frequency. In this regime, where ordinary perturbation approaches fail, the CHRW works very well and efficiently. We also demonstrate the dynamics of the system in the strong-driving and off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks down but the CHRW method remains valid. We obtain analytical expressions for the generalized Rabi frequency and bias-modulated Bloch-Siegert shift as functions of the bias, tunneling and driving field parameters. The CHRW approach is a mathematically simple and physically clear method. It can be applied to treat some complicated problems for which a numerical study is difficult to perform.

abstract: We show that any bipartite quantum state of rank four is distillable, when the partial transpose of the state has at least one negative eigenvalue, i.e., the state is NPT. For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a two-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues, then the state is distillable. We further construct a parametrized two-qutrit NPT entangled state of rank five which is not 1-distillable, and show that it is not $n$-distillable for any given $n$ when the parameter is sufficiently small. This state has the smallest rank among all 1-undistillable NPT states. We conjecture that the state is not distillable.

abstract: We investigate the preparation of a target initial state for a two-level (qubit) system from a system-environment equilibrium or correlated state by an external field. The system-environment equilibrium or correlated state results from the inevitable interaction of the system with its environment. An efficient method in an extended auxiliary Liouville space is introduced to describe the dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system in the presence of a strong field and an initial system-environment correlation. By using the time evolutions of the population difference, the state trajectory in the Bloch sphere representation and the trace distance between two reduced system states of the open quantum system, the effect of initial system-environment correlations on the preparation of a system state is studied. We introduce an upper bound and a lower bound for the trace distance within our perturbation formalism to describe the diverse behaviors of the dynamics of the trace distance between various correlated states after the system state preparation. These bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the literature give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the increase of the trace distance and are related to the witnesses of non-Markovianity and initial system-bath correlation.

abstract: Experimentalists seeking to improve the coherent lifetimes of quantum bits have generally focused on improvements to qubit designs, materials, and system isolation from environmental perturbations. In the case of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be preserved is ultimately that of the qubit relative to the system clock, rather than that of the qubit in isolation. In this manuscript we clarify the impact of clock instability on qubit dephasing and provide quantitative estimates of fidelity upper-bounds set by noisy phase fluctuations in the clock. We first indicate analytically that such phase fluctuations in the clock - typically referred to as the "local oscillator" (LO) - are indistinguishable from a pure dephasing field arising from other environmental mechanisms. Using these results, we apply commonly quoted LO phase-noise specifications to calculate the resultant performance bounds on qubit operational fidelities. We find that laboratory grade LOs contribute error probabilities beyond $10^{-4}$ for operation times $<1\;\mu$s, while the use of precision LOs can suppress error rates by $10^{4}$. We find that in either case phase fluctuations at frequencies far from the carrier dominate operational error rates, and due to their high-frequency spectral content, are difficult to mitigate using dynamic error suppression strategies. Further, we consider the importance of LO noise bandwidth and its impact on the degree to which thermal phase fluctuations in the LO contribute an effective error floor. These observations and analysis of the flow-down effects of such errors on the implementation of benchmarking and quantum error correction protocols highlight challenges and advantages that particular qubit technologies possess in the context of phase-noise-induced errors and motivate enhanced research in precision frequency metrology.

abstract: We propose some protocols to implement various classes of bipartite unitary operations on two remote parties with the help of repeater nodes in between. We also present a protocol to implement a single-qubit unitary with parameters determined by a remote party with the help of up to three repeater nodes. It is assumed that the neighboring nodes are connected by noisy photonic channels, and the local gates can be performed quite accurately, while the decoherence of memories is significant. A unitary is often a part of a larger computation or communication task in a quantum network, and to reduce the amount of decoherence in other systems of the network, we focus on the goal of saving the total time for implementing a unitary including the time for entanglement preparation. We review some previously studied protocols that implements bipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and prior shared entanglement, and apply them to the situation with repeater nodes. We find that the protocols using piecewise entanglement between neighboring nodes often require less total time compared to preparing entanglement between the two end nodes first and then performing the previously known protocols. Some of the protocols work for an arbitrary bipartite unitary, hence the time needed by these protocols provide upper bounds for the total time needed to implement an arbitrary bipartite unitary as a function of the number of repeater nodes. We also prove the corresponding lower bounds when there is a small number of repeater nodes. The application to position-based cryptography is discussed.

abstract: We theoretically investigate trapped ions interacting with atoms that are coupled to Rydberg states. The strong polarizabilities of the Rydberg levels increases the interaction strength between atoms and ions by many orders of magnitude, as compared to the case of ground state atoms, and may be mediated over micrometers. We calculate that such interactions can be used to generate entanglement between an atom and the motion or internal state of an ion. Furthermore, the ion could be used as a bus for mediating spin-spin interactions between atomic spins in analogy to much employed techniques in ion trap quantum simulation. The proposed scheme comes with attractive features as it maps the benefits of the trapped ion quantum system onto the atomic one without obviously impeding its intrinsic scalability. No ground state cooling of the ion or atom is required and the setup allows for full dynamical control. Moreover, the scheme is to a large extent immune to the micromotion of the ion. Our findings are of interest for developing hybrid quantum information platforms and for implementing quantum simulations of solid state physics.

This new upper bound not only improves for all N, S and d the corresponding results available for general Bell inequalities in the literature but also, for the N-qubit case with two observables per site, reduces exactly to the attainable upper bound known for quantum violations of correlation 2x...x2-setting Bell inequalities in a dichotomic case.

In this model, charged particle trajectories are affected by the interaction with quantized electromagnetic fields, and this quantum-classical interaction induces a displacement current. We further investigate a geometric phase in the wave functional of the gauge field configuration, which is induced by adiabatic motions of the charged particles. This phase contains the quantum-classical backreaction effect and usual Berry's phase is reproduced in the vanishing limit of the fluctuation of the charged particle trajectories.

abstract: Coherent transport of excitations along chains of coupled quantum systems represents an interesting problem with a number of applications ranging from quantum optics to solar cell technology. A convenient tool for studying such processes are quantum walks. They allow to determine in a quantitative way all the process features. We study the survival probability and the transport efficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The propagation of excitation is modeled by a discrete-time (coined) quantum walk. For a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its actual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays exponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the survival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the evolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its present position, i.e. the propagation is modeled by a lazy quantum walk, then part of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never reaches the sink. In such a case, the survival probability does not vanish and the excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport efficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for some lazy quantum walks dynamical percolations of the ring eliminate the trapping effect and efficient excitation transport can be achieved.

abstract: The interplay between the singlet ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the experimentally measured N\'eel state of antiferromagnets is studied. To verify the hypothesis [M. I. Katsnelson et al., Phys. Rev. B 63, 212404 (2001)] that the latter can be considered to be a result of local measurements destroying the entanglement of the quantum ground state, we have performed systematic simulations of the effects of von Neumannmeasurements for the case of a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 system for various types and degrees of magnetic anisotropies. It is found that in the ground state, a magnetization measurement can create decoherence waves [M. I. Katsnelson et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 022118 (2000)] in the magnetic sublattices, and that a symmetry breaking anisotropy does not lead to alignment of the spins in a particular direction. However, for an easy-axis anisotropy of the same order magnitude as the exchange constant, a measurement on the singlet ground state can create N\'eel-ordering in finite systems of experimentally accessible size.

abstract: The stabilizer ZX-calculus is a rigorous graphical language for reasoning about stabilizer quantum mechanics. This language has been proved to be complete in two steps: first in a setting where scalars (diagrams with no inputs or outputs) are ignored and then in a more general setting where a new symbol and three additional rules have been added to keep track of scalars. Here, we introduce a simplified version of the stabilizer ZX-calculus: we give a smaller set of axioms and prove that meta-rules like `only the topology matters', `colour symmetry' and `upside-down symmetry', which were considered as axioms in previous versions of the stabilizer ZX-calculus, can in fact be derived. In particular, we show that the additional symbol and one of the rules introduced for proving the completeness of the scalar stabilizer ZX-calculus are not necessary. We furthermore show that the remaining two rules dedicated to scalars cannot be derived from the other rules, i.e. they are necessary.

abstract: We present an experimental method for creating and verifying photon-number states created by non-degenerate, third-order nonlinear-optical photon-pair sources. By using spatially multiplexed, thresholding single-photon detectors and inverting a conditional probability matrix, we determine the photon-number probabilities created through heralded spontaneous four-wave-mixing. The deleterious effects of noise photons on reliable heralding are investigated and shown to degrade the conditional preparation of two-photon number states more than they degrade conditional single-photon states. We derive the equivalence between the presence of unwanted noise in the herald channel and loss in the signal channel of heralded experiments. A procedure for characterizing the noise-photon contributions, and a means of estimating the herald noise-free photon-number distribution is demonstrated.

abstract: The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a "break-even" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.

abstract: In this article for the first time in the context of TOP trap the necessary and sufficient conditions for the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeking states is quantitatively examined. It has been well accepted since decades that adiabaticity has to be obeyed by the atoms for successful magnetic trapping. We argue in the contrary that atoms can also be confined even beyond the adiabatic limit. Hence, our findings open new possibilities to relax the restrictions of atom trapping in the laboratories.

abstract: We demonstrate how quantum computation can provide non-trivial improvements in the computational and statistical complexity of the perceptron model. We develop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm exploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane using a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$, namely $O(\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound of $O(\frac{1}{\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}})$ through quantum means, where $\gamma$ denotes the margin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model.

abstract: In an interferometer, no interference happens if the quanta's path information is available in an ancillary system. One can erase this information by an appropriate measurement and recognize subensembles of the interferometry data showing interference. We consider symmetric Mach-Zehnder or Michelson interferometers in which a qudit, initially prepared in a pure state, provides the path information. We set measures of which-path information and which-phase information (knowledge about the phase difference between the interferometer's arms) by use of Shannon entropy and show that by erasing the which-path information, one can obtain the same amount of which-phase information. As an example, we propose a new modified Michelson interferometer, feasible by today's technology, in which a qubit (an atom trapped in a cavity) gathers the photon's path information. Erasing is done by measuring the atom's energy.

abstract: In the present work the Rabi Problem, involving the response of a spin 1/2 particle subjected to a magnetic field, is considered in a field theory approach. In this concrete physical scenario, we show that the second quantization procedure can be applied directly in a non-covariant theory. The proposed development explicits not only the relation between the full quantum treatment of the problem and the semiclassical Rabi model, but also the connection of these approaches with the Jaynes-Cummings model. The treatment is then extended to the matter component of the Rabi problem so that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is directly quantized. The generalized theory is consistent, strictly quantum and non-relativistic.

abstract: We present a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the measurement of the collectibility, a nonlinear entanglement witness proposed by Rudnicki et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 150502 (2011)]. This entanglement witness works for both mixed and pure two-qubit states. In the later case it can be used to measure entanglement in terms of the negativity. We measured the collectibility for three distinct classes of photonic polarization-encoded two-qubit states, i.e., maximally entangled, separable and maximally mixed states. We demonstrate that the measurement procedure is feasible and robust against typical experimental shortcomings such as imperfect two-photon indistinguishability.

abstract: In this paper, the following scenario is considered: there are two qubits possessed by two parties at different locations. Qubits have been prepared in one of a maximum of four, mutually-orthogonal, entangled states and the parties wish to distinguish between the states by using local operations and classical communication. Although in general it is not possible to distinguish between four arbitrary states, the parties can spend some pre-shared entanglement to achieve perfect discrimination between four qubit states and can also preserve the entanglement of the states after discrimination. This is shown by employing the theory of majorization and the connections between entanglement transformations and state discrimination protocols.

abstract: Various engine types are thermodynamically equivalent in the quantum limit of small 'engine action'. Our previous derivation of the equivalence is restricted to Markovian heat baths and to implicit classical work repository (e.g., laser light in the semi-classical approximation). In this paper all the components, baths, batteries, and engine, are explicitly taken into account. To neatly treat non-Markovian dynamics we use mediating particles that function as a heat exchanger. We find that on top of the previously observed equivalence there is a higher degree of equivalence that cannot be achieved in the Markovian regime. Next we focus on the energy transfer to the work repository. A condition for zero entropy increase in the work repository is given. Moreover, it is shown that in the strong coupling regime it is possible to charge a battery with energy while reducing its entropy at the same time.

abstract: We present our model of an Emergent Quantum Mechanics which can be characterized by "realism without pre-determination". This is illustrated by our analytic description and corresponding computer simulations of Bohmian-like "surreal" trajectories, which are obtained classically, i.e. without the use of any quantum mechanical tool such as wave functions. However, these trajectories do not necessarily represent ontological paths of particles but rather mappings of the probability density flux in a hydrodynamical sense. Modelling emergent quantum mechanics in a high-low intesity double slit scenario gives rise to the "quantum sweeper effect" with a characteristic intensity pattern. This phenomenon should be experimentally testable via weak measurement techniques.

abstract: Compact silicon integrated devices, such as micro-ring resonators, have recently been demonstrated as efficient sources of quantum correlated photon pairs. The mass production of integrated devices demands the implementation of fast and reliable techniques to monitor the device performances. In the case of time-energy correlations, this is particularly challenging, as it requires high spectral resolution that is not currently achievable in coincidence measurements. Here we reconstruct the joint spectral density of photons pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon ring resonator by studying the corresponding stimulated process, namely stimulated four wave mixing. We show that this approach, featuring high spectral resolution and short measurement times, allows one to discriminate between nearly-uncorrelated and highly-correlated photon pairs.

abstract: Inspired by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), which adds gravitational effects to the standard description of quantum uncertainty, we extend the exact uncertainty principle (EUP) approach by Hall and Reginatto [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. (2002) 35 3289], and obtain a (quasi)nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. This quantum evolution equation of unusual form, enjoys several desired properties like separation of non-interacting subsystems or planewave solutions for free particles. We show that the Gaussian solution for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator respects the gravitationally-induced minimal position uncertainty proportional to the Planck length. Quite surprisingly, our result successfully merges the core of classical physics with non-relativistic quantum mechanics in its extremal form.

abstract: We demonstrate the excitation of ions to the Rydberg state $22F$ by vacuum ultraviolet radiation at a wavelength of $123\,\text{nm}$ combined with the coherent manipulation of the optical qubit transition in $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$. With a tightly focused beam at $729\,\text{nm}$ wavelength we coherently excite a single ion from a linear string into the metastable $3D_{5/2}$ state before a VUV pulse excites it to the Rydberg state. In combination with ion shuttling in the trap, we extend this approach to the addressed excitation of multiple ions. The coherent initialization as well as the addressed Rydberg excitation are key prerequisites for more complex applications of Rydberg ions in quantum simulation or quantum information processing.

abstract: W state is a key resource in quantum communication. Fusion technology has been proven to be a good candidate for preparing a large-size W state from two or more small-size W states in linear optical system. It is of great importance to study how to fuse W states via light-matter interface. Here we show that it is possible to prepare large-size W-state networks using a fusion mechanism in cavity QED system. The detuned interaction between three atoms and a vacuum cavity mode constitute the main fusion mechanism, based on which two or three small-size atomic W states can be fused into a larger-size W state. If no excitation is detected from those three atoms, the remaining atoms are still in the product of two or three new W states, which can be re-fused. The complicated Fredkin gate used in the previous fusion schemes is avoided here. W states of size 2 can be fused as well. The feasibility analysis shows that our fusion processes maybe implementable with the current technology. Our results demonstrate how the light-matter interaction based fusion mechanism can be realized, and may become the starting point for the fusion of multipartite entanglement in cavity QED system.

abstract: Long-distance quantum channels capable of transferring quantum states faithfully for unconditionally secure quantum communication have been so far confirmed feasible in both fiber and free-space air. However, it remains unclear whether seawater, which covers more than 70% of the earth, can also be utilized, leaving global quantum communication incomplete. Here we experimentally demonstrate that polarization quantum states including general qubits and entangled states can well survive after travelling through seawater. We performed experiments in a 3.3-meter-long tube filled with seawater samples collected in a range of 36 kilometers in Yellow sea, which conforms to Jerlov water type I. For single photons at 405 nm in blue-green window, we obtained average process fidelity above 98%. For entangled photons at 810 nm, even with high loss, we observe violation of Bell inequality with 33 standard deviations. This work confirms feasibility of seawater quantum channel, representing the first step towards underwater quantum communication.

abstract: An interesting aspect of multipartite entanglement is that for perfect teleportation and superdense coding, not the maximally entangled W states but a special class of non-maximally entangled W-like states are required. Therefore, efficient preparation of such W-like states is of great importance in quantum communications, which has not been studied as much as the preparation of W states. In this letter, we propose a simple optical scheme for efficient preparation of large-scale polarization based entangled W-like states by fusing two W-like states or expanding a W-like state with an ancilla photon. Our scheme can also generate large-scale W states by fusing or expanding W or even W-like states. The cost analysis show that in generating large scale W states, the fusion mechanism achieves a higher efficiency with non-maximally entangled W-like states than maximally entangled W states. Our scheme can also start fusion or expansion with Bell states, and it is composed of a polarization dependent beam splitter, two polarizing beam splitters and photon detectors. Requiring no ancilla photons or controlled gates to operate, our scheme can be realized with the current photonics technology and we believe it enables advances in quantum teleportation and superdense coding in multipartite settings.

abstract: This work will incorporate a few related tools for addressing the conceptual difficulties arising from sewing together classical and quantum mechanics: deterministic operators, weak measurements and post-selection. Weak Measurement, based on a very weak von Neumann coupling, is a unique kind of quantum measurement with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In contrast to other measurement techniques, it allows to gather a small amount of information regarding the quantum system, with only a negligible probability of collapsing it. A single weak measurement yields an almost random outcome, but when performed repeatedly over a large ensemble, the averaged outcome becomes increasingly robust and accurate. Importantly, a long sequence of weak measurements can be thought of as a single projective measurement. I claim in this work that classical variables appearing in the macro-world, such as centre of mass, moment of inertia, pressure and average forces, result from a multitude of quantum weak measurements performed in the micro-world. Here again, the quantum outcomes are highly uncertain, but the law of large numbers obliges their convergence to the definite quantities we know from our everyday lives. By augmenting this description with a final boundary condition and employing the notion of "classical robustness under time-reversal" I will draw a quantitative borderline between the classical and quantum regimes. I will conclude by analyzing the role of macroscopic systems in amplifying and recording quantum outcomes.

abstract: Quantum state transfer into a memory, state shuttling over long distances via a quantum bus, and high-fidelity readout are important tasks for quantum technology. Realizing these tasks is challenging in the presence of realistic couplings to an environment. Here, we introduce and assess protocols that can be used in cavity QED to perform high-fidelity quantum state transfer and fast quantum nondemolition qubit readout through Hamiltonian engineering. We show that high-fidelity state transfer between a cavity and a single qubit or between a cavity and the collective mode of a qubit ensemble can be performed, even in the limit of strong dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening. Moreover, we show that large signal-to-noise and high single-shot fidelity can be achieved in a cavity-based qubit readout, even in the weak-coupling limit. These ideas may be important for novel systems coupling single spins to a microwave cavity.

abstract: We present the detailed quantum electrodynamical description of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic twisted electron in the transparent medium. Simple expressions for the spectral and spectral-angular distributions as well as for the polarization properties of the emitted radiation are obtained. Unlike the plane-wave case, the twisted electron produces radiation within the annular angular region, with enhancement towards its boundaries. Additionally, the emitted photons can have linear polarization not only in the scattering plane but also in the orthogonal direction. We find that the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by an electron in a superposition of two vortex states exhibits a strong azimuthal asymmetry. Thus, the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation offers itself as a convenient diagnostic tool of such electrons and complements the traditional microscopic imaging.

abstract: Gradient echo memory (GEM) stores and retrieves photon wave packet in forward direction with high efficiency and fidelity using photon-echo mechanism. It is an important technique for quantum memory applications. By breaking the continuity of the gradient absorption structure, the scheme becomes gradient frequency comb (GFC), which is a hybrid of GEM and atomic frequency comb (AFC). To elucidate the non-trivial field-atom evolution of gradient echo, we derive its exact analytical solution in a medium of arbitrary optical thickness subjecting to any linear gradient of transition frequency, and discuss its physical processes. Based on this solution, we further suggest and analysis two types of GFC, one with stepwise gradient and the other with discontinuous gradient.

abstract: Open quantum system theory is fundamental for a proper description of quantum systems in different contexts such as chemistry, condensed matter physics, bio-physics and opto-mechamics. Quantum brownian motion which is analytically described by the Hu-Paz-Zhang (HPZ) model represents one of the most important examples of an open quantum system. In this paper we propose a novel derivation of its master equation, based on the Heisenberg picture. We provide an exact and analytic equation both for the operators as well as for the states. The result, equivalent to the one derived originally by HPZ, is expressed in terms of the spectral density, regardless the strength of the coupling between the system and the environment and allows to compute the time evolution of physically relevant quantities in a much easier way. An example, of particular interest in bio-physics, is explicitly studied.

abstract: Isolation of a system from its environment is often desirable; however, dissipation can also be a useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the preparation and stabilization of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics the control over mechanical oscillators utilizes the inherently cold dissipative nature of the electromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of the mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold dissipative reservoir to the electromagnetic mode. Here we report the experimental realization of this reversed dissipation regime in a microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous, cold reservoir for microwave light. We evidence this regime by decreasing or increasing the damping rate of the cavity on demand, that corresponds to amplification and de-amplification of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe the onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves (masing). Moreover, we employ the engineered cold reservoir to implement a low-noise, large-gain phase-preserving amplifier. Beyond offering the manipulation of microwave fields, such a dissipative reservoir for microwave light, when coupled to multiple cavity modes, forms the basis of microwave entanglement schemes, electromechanical amplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and dissipative quantum phase transitions. Equally important, combining such reservoir-mediated interaction with coherent dynamics allows for the realization of non-reciprocal devices, which would extend the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave manipulation techniques.

abstract: Analytical evidence for the physical relevance of generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) has recently been provided in [PRL 110, 040404]: Natural occupation numbers $\vec{\lambda}\equiv (\lambda_i)$ of the ground state of a model system in the regime of weak couplings $\kappa$ of three spinless fermions in one spatial dimension were found extremely close, in a distance $D_{min}\sim \kappa^8$ to the boundary of the allowed region. We provide a self-contained and complete study of this quasipinning phenomenon. In particular, we develop tools for its systematic exploration and quantification. We confirm that quasipinning in one dimension occurs also for larger particle numbers and extends to intermediate coupling strengths, but vanishes for very strong couplings. We further explore the non-triviality of our findings by comparing quasipinning by GPCs to potential quasipinning by the less restrictive Pauli exclusion principle constraints. This allows us to eventually confirm the significance of GPCs beyond Pauli's exclusion principle.

abstract: We investigate the separable states $\r$ of an arbitrary multipartite quantum system with Hilbert space $\cH$ of dimensionin $d$. The length $L(\r)$ of $\r$ is defined as the smallest number of pure product states having $\r$ as their mixture. The length filtration of the set of separable states, $\cS$, is the increasing chain $\emptyset\subset\cS'_1\subseteq\cS'_2\subseteq\cdots$, where $\cS'_i=\{\r\in\cS:L(\r)\le i\}$. We define the maximum length, $L_{\rm max}=\max_{\r\in\cS} L(\r)$, critical length, $L_{\rm crit}$, and yet another special length, $L_c$, which was defined by a simple formula in one of our previous papers. The critical length indicates the first term in the length filtrartion whose dimension is equal to $\dim\cS$. We show that in general $d\le L_c\le L_{\rm crit}\le L_{\rm max}\le d^2$. We conjecture that the equality $L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ holds for all finite-dimensional multipartite quantum systems. Our main result is that $L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ for the bipartite systems having a single qubit as one of the parties. This is accomplished by computing the rank of the Jacobian matrix of a suitable map having $\cS$ as its range.

abstract: We study the gain-assisted light transmissions in optomechanical systems, especially the nonlinear higher-order sideband process. We find that: (i) in a single active cavity, the efficiency of the second-order process is considerably enhanced, and the accompanying group delay can surpass that of the probe field, which is unattainable for a lossy cavity (i.e. without any gain); (ii) in an active-passive compound system, the second-order process can be further enhanced by approaching to the gain-loss balance, and hundreds of microsecond of relative delay or advance are achievable between the probe and the second-order signal, indicating an active optomechanical modulator both in frequency and time domains.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of the phase noise, intensity and quadrature squeezing power spectra of the transmitted field of a driven optical cavity containing an interacting one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. We show how the pattern of the output power spectrum of the cavity changes due to the nonlinear effect of atomic collisions. Furthermore, it is shown that due to a one-to-one correspondence between the splitting of the peaks in the phase noise power spectrum of the cavity output field and the \textit{s}-wave scattering frequency of the atom-atom interaction, one can measure the strength of interatomic interaction. Besides, we show how the atomic collisions affect the squeezing behavior of the output field.

abstract: Compared to the quantum noise in the measurement of the translational motion of a suspended mirror using laser light, the quantum noise in the measurement of the angular motion of a suspended mirror has not been investigated intensively despite its potential importance. In this letter, an expression for the quantum noise in the angular motion measurement is explicitly derived. The expression indicates that one quadrature of the vacuum field of the first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode of light causes quantum sensing noise and the other causes quantum backaction noise, or in other words the first-order vacuum field is ponderomotively squeezed. It is also shown that the Gouy phase shift the light acquires between the mirror and the position of detection of the light corresponds to the homodyne angle. Therefore, the quantum backaction noise can be cancelled and the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by choosing the appropriate position of detection analogously to the cancellation of quantum radiation pressure noise by choosing an appropriate homodyne angle.

abstract: We present a construction of new bound entangled states from given bound entangled states for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems. One way to construct bound entangled states is to show that these states are PPT (positive partial transpose) and violate the range criterion at the same time. By applying certain operators to given bound entangled states or to one of the subsystems of the given bound entangled states, we obtain a set of new states which are both PPT and violate the range criterion. We show that the derived bound entangled states are not local unitary equivalent to the original bound entangled states by detail examples.

abstract: In this paper we discuss the representational realist stance as a pluralist ontic approach to inter-theoretic relationships. Our stance stresses the fact that physical theories require the necessary consideration of a conceptual level of discourse which determines and configures the specific field of phenomena discussed by each particular theory. We will criticize the orthodox line of research which has grounded the analysis about QM in two (Bohrian) metaphysical presuppositions -accepted in the present as dogmas that all interpretations must follow. We will also examine how the orthodox project of "bridging the gap" between the quantum and the classical domains has constrained the possibilities of research, producing only a limited set of interpretational problems which only focus in the justification of "classical reality" and exclude the possibility of analyzing the possibilities of non-classical conceptual representations of QM. The representational realist stance introduces two new problems, namely, the superposition problem and the contextuality problem, which consider explicitly the conceptual representation of orthodox QM beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and measurement outcomes. In the final part of the paper, we revisit, from a representational realist perspective, the quantum to classical limit and the orthodox claim that this inter-theoretic relation can be explained through the principle of decoherence.

abstract: We study how useful random states are for quantum metrology, i.e., surpass the classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase estimation scenario. First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space of distinguishable particles typically do not lead to super-classical scaling of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we show that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization. Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low purity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for such states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to typically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from three types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation.

abstract: A problem in quantum information theory is to find the experimental setup that maximizes the nonlocality of correlations with respect to some suitable measure such as the violation of Bell inequalities. The latter has however some drawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of Bell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find the experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation suffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the Bell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct information-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical communication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per instance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a convex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number of measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental setup. In this paper, we present a simple method for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space and, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the corresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional relationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is illustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the violation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit as well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed by qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed as a measure of nonlocality.

abstract: Persistent control of a transmon qubit is performed by a feedback protocol based on continuous weak measurement of its fluorescence. By driving the qubit and cavity with microwave signals whose amplitudes depend linearly on the instantaneous values of the quadratures of the measured fluorescence field, we demonstrate the permanent stabilization of the qubit in any direction of the Bloch sphere. Using a Josephson mixer as a phase-preserving amplifier, it was possible to reach a total measurement efficiency $\eta$=35%, leading to a maximum of 59% of excitation and 44% of coherence for the stabilized states. The experiment demonstrates multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) analog markovian feedback in the quantum regime.

abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation maps a one-dimensional spin-1/2 system onto a fermionic model without spin degree of freedom. A double chain of quantum bits with XX and ZZ couplings of neighboring qubits along and between the chains, respectively, can be mapped on a spin-full 1D Fermi-Hubbard model. The qubit system can thus be used to emulate the quantum properties of this model. We analyze physical implementations of such analog quantum simulators, including one based on transmon qubits, where the ZZ interaction arises due to an inductive coupling and the XX interaction due to a capacitive interaction. We propose protocols to gain confidence in the results of the simulation through measurements of local operators.

abstract: We present a self-consistent mean-field model based on a two-component Pauli-like equation that incorporates quantum and relativistic effects (up to second-order in 1/c) for both external and internal electromagnetic fields. By taking the semi-relativistic limit of the Dirac-Maxwell equations in the presence of an external electromagnetic field we obtain an analytical expression of a coherent light-induced mean-field Hamiltonian. The latter exhibits several mechanisms that involve the internal mean fields created by all the electrons and the external electromagnetic field (laser). The role played by the light-induced current density and the light-induced second-order charge density acting as sources in Maxwell's equations are clarified. In particular, we identify clearly four different mechanisms involving the spins that may play an important role in coherent ultrafast spin dynamics.

abstract: The Yang-Baxter equation is an important tool in theoretical physics, with many applications in different domains that span from condensed matter to string theory. Recently, the interest on the equation has increased due to its connection to quantum information processing. It has been shown that the Yang-Baxter equation is closely related to quantum entanglement and quantum computation. Therefore, owing to the broad relevance of this equation, besides theoretical studies, it also became significant to pursue its experimental implementation. Here, we show an experimental realization of the Yang-Baxter equation and verify its validity through a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) interferometric setup. Our experiment was performed on a liquid state Iodotrifluoroethylene sample which contains molecules with three qubits. We use Controlled-transfer gates that allow us to build a pseudo-pure state from which we are able to apply a quantum information protocol that implements the Yang-Baxter equation.

abstract: Computer simulation of observable phenomena is an indispensable tool for engineering new technology, understanding the natural world, and studying human society. Yet the most interesting systems are often complex, such that simulating their future behaviour demands storing immense amounts of information regarding how they have behaved in the past. For increasingly complex systems, simulation becomes increasingly difficult and is ultimately constrained by resources such as computer memory. Recent theoretical work shows quantum theory can reduce this memory requirement beyond ultimate classical limits (as measured by a process' statistical complexity, C). Here we experimentally demonstrate this quantum advantage in simulating stochastic processes. Our quantum implementation observes a memory requirement of C_q = 0.05 $\pm$ 0.01, far below the ultimate classical limit of C = 1. Scaling up this technique would substantially reduce the memory required in simulation of more complex systems.

abstract: Coherent wave splitting is crucial in interferometers. Normally, the waves after this splitting are of the same type. But recent progress in interaction between atom and light has led to the coherent conversion of photon to atomic excitation. This makes it possible to split an incoming light wave into a coherent superposition state of atom and light and paves the way for an interferometer made of di?erent types of waves. Here we report on a Rabi-like coherent-superposition oscillation observed between atom and light and a coherent mixing of light wave with excited atomic spin wave in a Raman process. We construct a new kind of hybrid interferometer based on the atom-light coherent superposition state. Interference fringes are observed in both optical output intensity and atomic output in terms of the atomic spin wave strength when we scan either or both of the optical and atomic phases. Such a hybrid interferometer can be used to interrogate atomic states by optical detection and will ?nd its applications in precision measurement and quantum control of atoms and light.

abstract: We propose a generic mechanism for the emergence of a gravitational potential that acts on all classical objects in a quantum system. Our conjecture is based on the analysis of mutual information in many-body quantum systems. Since measurements in quantum systems affect the surroundings through entanglement, a measurement at one position reduces the entropy in its neighbourhood. This reduction in entropy can be described by a local temperature, that is directly related to the gravitational potential. A crucial ingredient in our argument is that ideal classical mechanical motion occurs at constant probability. This definition is motivated by the analysis of entropic forces in classical systems, which can be formally rewritten in terms of a gravitational potential.

abstract: We study effective light-matter interactions in a circuit QED system consisting of a single $LC$ resonator, which is coupled symmetrically to multiple superconducting qubits. Starting from a minimal circuit model, we demonstrate that in addition to the usual collective qubit-photon coupling the resulting Hamiltonian contains direct qubit-qubit interactions, which prevent the otherwise expected superradiant phase transition in the ground state of this system. Moreover, these qubit-qubit interactions are responsible for an opposite mechanism, which at very strong couplings completely decouples the photon mode and projects the qubits into a highly entangled ground state. These findings shed new light on the controversy over the existence of superradiant phase transitions in cavity and circuit QED systems, and show that the physics of ultrastrong light-matter interactions in two- or multi-qubit settings differ drastically from the more familiar one qubit case.

abstract: Quantum state estimation aims at determining the quantum state from the observed data as precisely as possible, which usually requires a considerable effort. One is, however, often not interested in all the details of the fully estimated state. Rather, one needs to know one or a few properties of the state such as, for example, its fidelity with a target state or the degree of correlation for a specific bipartite structure. Since the best guess for a particular property is, typically, not equal to its value in the best-guess state, it is preferable to directly estimate the properties of interest from the recorded data-and, in fact, this is possible. As a natural and meaningful way of stating the accuracy of the estimated property values, we propose the use of optimal error intervals, which are immediate analogs of the optimal error regions for quantum state estimation [see New J. Phys. 15, 123026 (2013)]. The optimal error intervals are easily characterized by the likelihood for the data conditioned on the values of the properties of interest. We report an iterative algorithm for the computation of this likelihood. The step that is most costly (in CPU time) is the sampling, for the purpose of Monte Carlo integration, of the quantum state space in accordance with a sequence of prior densities. We illustrate the concepts and methods by identifying the optimal error intervals for the fidelity and purity of single-qubit states, as well as the CHSH quantity for two-qubit states, both for pre-chosen observables and for a state-dependent optimized choice of observables.

abstract: Recently, the nonlocal optimal probabilistic cloning (NLOPC) of two non-orthogonal qubit states has been proposed [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052332 (2012)] by means of an experimental setup based on a pair of twin photons in a maximally entangled state. Here we study the performance of the NLOPC protocol when implemented via a partially entangled state. We show that the errors introduced by the use of partial entanglement can be undone by applying a quantum state discrimination process. Since quantum state discrimination is a probabilistic process the correction succeeds with a certain probability but produces perfect clones. We also studied how to modifi?ed the setup to produce local copies.

The considered states are relevant for the description of spin pair states in interacting spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. We derive clean analytical expressions for the conditional local purity and other correlation measures obtained as a result of a remote local projective measurement, which are fully verified by the experimental results. A simple exact expression for the quantum discord of these states in terms of the maximum conditional purity is also derived.

abstract: The production of a Bose-Einstein condensate made of positronium may be feasible in the near future. Below the condensation temperature, the positronium collision process is modified by the presence of the condensate. This makes the theoretical description of the positronium kinetics at low temperature challenging. Based on the quasi-particle Bogoliubov theory, we describe the many-body particle-particle collision in a simple manner. We find that, in a good approximation, the full positronium-positronium interaction can be described by an effective scattering length. Our results are general and apply to different species of bosons. The correction to the bare scattering length is expressed in terms of a single dimensionless parameter that completely characterizes the condensate.

abstract: Quantitative analysis of discontinuity of basic characteristics of quantum states and channels is presented. First we consider general estimates for discontinuity jump (loss) of the von Neumann entropy for a given converging sequence of states. It is shown, in particular, that for any sequence the loss of entropy is upper bounded by the loss of mean energy (with the coefficient characterizing Hamiltonian of a system). Then we prove that discontinuity jumps of several correlation and entanglement measures in composite quantum systems are upper bounded by loss of one of the marginal entropies (with a corresponding coefficient). We also analyse discontinuity of the output entropy of a quantum operation and of basic information charateristics of a quantum channel with respect to simultaneous variations of an input state and of a channel.

abstract: Perfect single-crystal neutron interferometers are adversely sensitive to environmental disturbances, particularly mechanical vibrations. The sensitivity to vibrations results from the slow velocity of thermal neutrons and the long measurement time that are encountered in a typical experiment. Consequently, to achieve a good interference solutions for reducing vibration other than those normally used in optical experiments must be explored. Here we introduce a geometry for a neutron interferometer that is less sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. This design may be compared with both dynamical decoupling methods and decoherence-free subspaces that are described in quantum information processing. By removing the need for bulky vibration isolation setups, this design will make it easier to adopt neutron interferometry to a wide range of applications and increase its sensitivity.

abstract: Quantum correlations between imprecision and back-action are a hallmark of continuous linear measurements. The ability to discern these correlations is typically obscured by environmental noise. Here we show how measurement-based feedback can be used to improve the visibility of quantum correlations in the interferometric position measurement of a mechanical oscillator. The oscillator is formed by a radio-frequency nanostring and the "meter" is an optical field in a microcavity-based interferometer. Back-action imparted by the meter, due to radiation pressure quantum noise, gives rise to correlations between its phase and amplitude quadratures. We probe these correlations as motional sideband asymmetry at the output of a heterodyne detector operating with an imprecision far below that at the standard quantum limit. The challenge is to discern a phonon-equivalent asymmetry of $1$ --- arising from imprecision-back-action correlations --- atop a thermal occupation of $\sim 10^4$. Towards this end, we use derivative feedback of an auxiliary homodyne measurement to cool the oscillator to a thermal occupation of 15, thereby increasing the visibility of the asymmetry to $6\%$. At higher feedback gains, the homodyne signal is `squashed' and the visibility of sideband asymmetry is reduced. This is due to the feedback of vacuum noise from the homodyne detector.

abstract: The exploration of wave phenomena and quantum properties of massive systems offers an intriguing pathway to study the foundations of physics and to develop a suite of quantum enhanced technologies. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optomechanical scheme for the preparation of non-Gaussian states of motion of a mechanical resonator using photonic quantum measurements. Our scheme is capable of generating non-classical mechanical states without the need for strong single-photon coupling and independent of initial thermal occupation. We experimentally observe interference fringes in the mechanical position distribution, which for a two-photon measurement show phase super-resolution. Our approach can be readily generalized to generate larger mechanical superposition states using multi-port interferometry. This opens a feasible avenue to explore and exploit quantum phenomena at a macroscopic scale.

abstract: In bosonic quantum metrology, the estimate of a loss parameter is typically performed by means of pure states, such as coherent, squeezed or entangled states, while mixed thermal probes are discarded for their inferior performance. Here we show that thermal sources with suitable correlations can be engineered in such a way to approach, or even surpass, the error scaling of coherent states in the presence of general Gaussian decoherence. Our findings pave the way for practical quantum metrology with thermal sources in optical instruments (e.g., photometers) or at different wavelengths (e.g., far infrared, microwave or X-ray) where the generation of quantum features, such as coherence, number states, squeezing or entanglement, may be extremely challenging.

abstract: Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it. We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the quantum model. We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption (e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure when using a quantum-secure PRF. Second, we show that slide attacks can also be sped up using Simon's algorithm. This is the first exponential speed up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model.

abstract: As normally used, no commercially available camera has a low-enough dark noise to directly produce video recordings of double-slit interference at the photon-by-photon level, because readout noise significantly contaminates or overwhelms the signal. In this work, noise levels are significantly reduced by turning on the camera only when the presence of a photon has been heralded by the arrival, at an independent detector, of a time-correlated photon produced via parametric down-conversion. This triggering scheme provides the improvement required for direct video imaging of Young's double-slit experiment with single photons, allowing clarified versions of this foundational demonstration. Further, we introduce variations on this experiment aimed at promoting discussion of the role spatial coherence plays in such a measurement. We also emphasize complementary aspects of single-photon measurement, where imaging yields (transverse) position information, while diffraction yields the transverse momentum, and highlight the roles of transverse position and momentum correlations between down-converted photons, including examples of "ghost" imaging and diffraction.

abstract: The grand canonical formalism is employed to study the thermodynamic structure of a model displaying a quantum phase transition when studied with respect to the canonical formalism. A numerical survey shows that the grand partition function diverges following a power law when the interaction parameter approaches a limiting constant. The power-law exponent takes a distinctive value when such limiting constant coincides with the critical point of the subjacent quantum phase transition. An approximated expression for the grand partition function is derived analytically implementing a mean field scheme and a number of thermodynamic observables are obtained. The system observables show signatures that can be used to track the critical point of the underlying transition. This result provides a simple fact that can be exploited to verify the existence of a quantum phase transition avoiding the zero temperature regime.

abstract: Quantum mechanical effects induced by the miniaturization of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology hamper the performance and scalability prospects of field-effect transistors. However, those quantum effects, such as tunnelling and coherence, can be harnessed to use existing CMOS technology for quantum information processing. Here, we report the observation of coherent charge oscillations in a double quantum dot formed in a silicon nanowire transistor detected via its dispersive interaction with a radio-frequency resonant circuit coupled via the gate. Differential capacitance changes at the inter-dot charge transitions allow us to monitor the state of the system in the strong-driving regime where we observe the emergence of Landau-Zener-St{\"u}ckelberg-Majorana interference on the phase response of the resonator. A theoretical analysis of the dispersive signal demonstrates that quantum and tunnelling capacitance changes must be included to describe the qubit-resonator interaction. Furthermore, a Fourier analysis of the interference pattern reveals a charge coherence time, $T_2\approx 100$~ps. Our results demonstrate charge coherent control and readout in a simple silicon transistor and open up the possibility to implement charge and spin qubits in existing CMOS technology.

We show that the squeezing in the collective su(2J+1) system can be classified into unitary equivalence classes, each of which is characterized by a set of squeezed and anti-squeezed observables forming an su(2) subalgebra in the su(2J+1) algebra. The dimensionality of the unitary equivalence class is fundamentally related to its squeezing limit. We also demonstrate the classification of the squeezing among the spin and multipolar observables in a collective su(4) system.

abstract: The boundary between classical and quantum correlations is well characterised by linear constraints called Bell inequalities. It is much harder to characterise the boundary of the quantum set itself in the space of no-signaling correlations. By looking at the question from the perspective of non-local games based on steering, Oppenheim and Wehner [Science 330, 1072 (2010)] found an intriguing property of specific points of the quantum boundary: the local state of Bob is steered to one that saturates a local fine-grained uncertainty relation. In this paper, we extend this observation to a much larger set of points, and show that recently reported counterexamples can be circumvented by exploiting the arbitrariness in the definition of a game. These results hint to the possibility that the Oppenheim-Wehner observation holds for the whole of the quantum boundary.

abstract: In this paper we examine in detail the non-commutative symplectic algebra underlying quantum dynamics. We show that this algebra contains both the Weyl-von Neumann algebra and the Moyal algebra. The latter contains the Wigner distribution as the kernel of the density matrix. The underlying non-commutative geometry can be projected into either of two Abelian spaces, so-called `shadow phase spaces'. One of these is the phase space of Bohmian mechanics, showing that it is a fragment of the basic underlying algebra. The algebraic approach is much richer, giving rise to two fundamental dynamical time development equations which reduce to the Liouville equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the classical limit. They also include the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and its wave function, showing that these features are a partial aspect of the more general non-commutative structure. We discuss briefly the properties of this more general mathematical background from which the non-commutative symplectic algebra emerges.

abstract: Condition for distinguishability of countably infinite number of pure states by a single measurement is given. Distinguishability is to be understood as possibility of an unambiguous measurement. For finite number of states, it is known that the necessary and sufficient condition of distinguishability is that the states are linearly independent. For infinite number of states, several natural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable. It turns out that each level of distinguishability naturally corresponds to one of the generalizations of linear independence to families of infinite vectors. As an important example, we apply the general theory to von Neumann's lattice, a subsystem of coherent states which corresponds to a lattice in the classical phase space. We prove that the condition for distinguishability is that the area of the fundamental region of the lattice is greater than the Planck constant, and also find subtle behavior on the threshold. These facts reveal the measurement theoretical meaning of the Planck constant and give a justification for the interpretation that it is the smallest unit of area in the phase space. The cases of uncountably many states and of mixed states are also discussed.

abstract: The delayed choice experiments of the type introduced by Wheeler and extended by Englert, Scully, S\"ussmann and Walther [ESSW], and others, have formed a rich area for investigating the puzzling behaviour of particles undergoing quantum interference. The surprise provided by the original delayed choice experiment, led Wheeler to the conclusion that "no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon", a radical explanation which implied that "the past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present". However Bohm, Dewdney and Hiley have shown that the Bohm interpretation gives a straightforward account of the behaviour of the particle without resorting to such a radical explanation. The subsequent modifications of this experiment led both Aharonov and Vaidman and [ESSW] to conclude that the resulting Bohm-type trajectories in these new situations produce unacceptable properties. For example, if a cavity is placed in one arm of the interferometer, it will be excited by a particle travelling down the {\em other} arm. In other words it is the particle that does {\em not} go through the cavity that gives up its energy! If this analysis is correct, this behaviour would be truly bizarre and could only be explained by an extreme non-local transfer of energy that is even stronger than that required in an EPR-type processes. In this paper we show that this conclusion is not correct and that if the Bohm interpretation is used correctly, it gives a {\em local} explanation, which actually corresponds exactly to the standard quantum mechanics explanation offered by Englert, Scully, S\"ussmann and Walther [ESSW].

abstract: We explore the photon population dynamics in two coupled circuit QED systems. For a sufficiently weak inter-cavity photon hopping, as the photon-cavity coupling increases, the dynamics undergoes double transitions first from a delocalized to a localized phase and then from the localized to another delocalized phase. The latter delocalized phase is distinguished from the former one; instead of oscillating between the two cavities, the photons rapidly quasi-equilibrate over the two cavities. These intrigues are attributed to an interplay between two qualitatively distinctive nonlinear behaviors of the circuit QED systems in the utrastrong coupling regime, whose distinction has been widely overlooked.

abstract: Quantum communication demands efficient distribution of quantum entanglement across a network of connected partners. The search for efficient strategies for the entanglement distribution may be based on percolation theory, which describes evolution of network connectivity with respect to some network parameters. In this framework, the probability to establish perfect entanglement between two remote partners decays exponentially with the distance between them before the percolation transition point, which unambiguously defines percolation properties of any classical network or lattice. Here we introduce quantum networks created with local operations and classical communication, which exhibit non-classical percolation transition points leading to the striking communication advantages over those offered by the corresponding classical networks. We show, in particular, how to establish perfect entanglement between any two nodes in the simplest possible network -- the 1D chain -- using imperfect entangled pairs of qubits.

Classical structural complexity of a quantum network may be defined through its physical structure, i.e. mutual position of nodes and channels connecting them. We show here that the classical structural complexity of a quantum network does not restrict the structural complexity of entanglement graphs, which may be created in the quantum network with local operations and classical communication. We show, in particular, that 1D quantum network can simulate both simple entanglement graphs such as lattices and random graphs and complex small-world graphs.

abstract: The concept of internal friction, a fully quantum mechanical phenomena, is investigated in a simple, experimentally accessible quantum system in which a spin-1/2 is driven by a transverse magnetic field in a quantum adiabatic process. The irreversible production of the waste energy due to the quantum friction is quantitatively analyzed in a forward-backward unitary transform of the system Hamiltonian by using the quantum relative entropy between the actual density matrix obtained in a parametric transformation and the one in a reversible adiabatic process. Analyzing the role of total transformation time and the different pulse control schemes on the internal friction reveal the non-monotone character of the internal friction as a function of the total protocol time and the possibility for almost frictionless solutions in finite-time transformations.

In this way, we show that the quantum dynamics of an enhanced variety of spin models could be implemented with substantially less number of gates than a fully digital approach. Typically, analog blocks are built of multipartite dynamics providing the complexity of the simulated model, while the digital steps are local operations bringing versatility to it. Finally, we describe a possible experimental implementation in trapped-ion technologies.

abstract: We investigate the control landscapes of closed, finite level quantum systems beyond the dipole approximation by including a polarizability term in the Hamiltonian. Theoretical analysis is presented for the $n$ level case and formulas for singular controls, which are candidates for landscape traps, are compared to their analogues in the dipole approximation. A numerical analysis of the existence of traps in control landscapes beyond the dipole approximation is made in the four level case. A numerical exploration of these control landscapes is achieved by generating many random Hamiltonians which include a term quadratic in a single control field. The landscapes of such systems are found numerically to be trap free in general. This extends a great body of recent work on typical landscapes of quantum systems where the dipole approximation is made. We further investigate the relationship between the magnitude of the polarizability and the magnitude of the controls resulting from optimization. It is shown numerically that including a polarizability term in an otherwise uncontrollable system removes traps from the landscapes of a specific family of systems by restoring controllability. We numerically assess the effect of a random polarizability term on the know example of a three level system with a second order trap in its control landscape. It is found that the addition of polarizability removes the trap from the landscape. The implications for laboratory control are discussed.

abstract: We consider a class of multi-qubit dephasing models that combine classical noise sources and linear coupling to a bosonic environment, and are controlled by arbitrary sequences of dynamical decoupling pulses. Building on a general transfer filter-function framework for open-loop control, we provide an exact representation of the controlled dynamics for arbitrary stationary non-Gaussian classical and quantum noise statistics, with analytical expressions emerging when all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exact characterization is used to establish two main results. First, we construct multi-qubit sequences that ensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time and frequency domain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms of total pulse number. Next, we show how long-time multi-qubit storage may be achieved by meeting appropriate conditions for the emergence of a fidelity plateau under sequence repetition, thereby generalizing recent results for single-qubit memory under Gaussian dephasing. In both scenarios, the key step is to endow multi-qubit sequences with a suitable displacement anti-symmetry property, which is of independent interest for applications ranging from environment-assisted entanglement generation to multi-qubit noise spectroscopy protocols.

These correlation functions are of theoretical interest for diagnosing the scrambling of quantum information in black holes and strongly interacting quantum systems generally. Measuring them requires an echo-type sequence in which the sign of a many-body Hamiltonian is reversed. We detail an implementation employing cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics to realize the chaotic kicked top model, and we analyze effects of dissipation to verify its feasibility with current technology. Finally, we propose in broad strokes a number of other experimental platforms where similar out-of-time-order correlation functions can be measured.

abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamics of an $n$-dimensional Lindblad control system can be separated into its inter- and intra-orbit dynamics when there is fast controllability. This can be viewed as a control system on the simplex of density operator spectra, where the flag representing the eigenspaces is viewed as a control variable. The local controllability properties of this control system can be analyzed when the control-set of flags is limited to a finite subset. In particular, there is a natural finite subset of $n!$ flags that are effective for low-purity orbits.

abstract: We improve a scheme of static quantum circuits \cite{shor} for performing universal quantum computation, by replacing non-local interactions of XY Heisenberg spin chains with local interactions. The idea is borrowed from quantum electrodynamics where the photon mediates long-range interaction between charged particles. In our scheme, an additional XY chain mediates an interaction between the chains (qubits) which leads to a two-qubit entangling gate, making universal quantum computation with no external control, possible on these circuits. In this way quantum circuits become completely analogous to classical circuits.

abstract: Based on the second-order quantum interference between frequency entangled photons that are generated by parametric down conversion, a quantum strategic algorithm for synchronizing two spatially separated clocks has been recently presented. In the reference frame of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, photon correlations are used to define simultaneous events. Once the HOM interferometer is balanced by use of an adjustable optical delay in one arm, arrival times of simultaneously generated photons are recorded by each clock. The clock offset is determined by correlation measurement of the recorded arrival times. Utilizing this algorithm, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment for synchronizing two clocks separated by 4km fiber link. A minimum timing stability of 0.4 ps at averaging time of 16000 s is achieved with an absolute time accuracy of 59.4 ps. The timing stability is verified to be limited by the correlation measurement device and ideally can be better than 10 fs. Such results shine a light to the application of quantum clock synchronization in the real high-accuracy timing system.

abstract: We propose a scheme of the exact fast-forwarding of standard quantum dynamics for a charged particle. The present idea allows the acceleration of both the amplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fast-forward time range and is distinct from that of Masuda-Nakamura (e.g., Proc. R. Soc. A {\bf 466}, 1135 (2010)) which enabled acceleration of only the amplitude of the wave function on the way. We shall apply the proposed method to the quantum tunneling phenomena and obtain the electro-magnetic field to ensure the rapid penetration of wave functions through a tunneling barrier. Typical examples described here are: 1) an exponential wave packet passing through the delta-function barrier; 2) the opened Moshinsky shutter with a delta-function barrier just behind the shutter. We elucidate the tunneling current in the vicinity of the barrier and find the remarkable enhancement of the tunneling rate (: tunneling power) due to the fast-forwarding. In the case of a very high barrier, in particular, we present the asymptotic analysis and exhibit a suitable driving force to recover a recognizable tunneling current. The analysis is also carried out on the exact acceleration of macroscopic quantum tunneling with use of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which accommodates a tunneling barrier.

abstract: From a quantum point of view, it is mandatory to include the measurement process when predicting the time-evolution of a quantum system. In this paper, a model to treat the measurement of the (TeraHertz) THz electrical current in quantum devices is presented. The explicit interaction of a quantum system with an external measuring apparatus is analyzed through the unambiguous notion of the Bohmian conditional wave function, the wave function of a subsystem. It it shown that such THz quantum measurement process can be modeled as a weak measurement: The systems suffers a small perturbation due to the apparatus, but the current is measured with a great uncertainty. This uncertainty implies that a new source of noise appears at THz frequencies. Numerical (quantum Monte Carlo) experiments are performed confirming the weak character of this measurement. This work also indicates that at low frequencies this noise is negligible and it can be ignored. From a classical point of view, the origin of this noise due to the measurement at THz frequencies can be attributed to the plasmonic effect of those electrons at the contacts (by interpreting the contacts themselves as part of the measuring apparatus).

abstract: We calculate transition amplitudes and cross sections for excitation of hydrogen-like atoms by the twisted photon states, or photon states with angular momentum projection on the direction of propagation exceeding $\hbar$. If the target atom is located at distances of the order of atomic size near the phase singularity in the vortex center, the transitions rates into the states with orbital angular momentum $l_f>1$ become comparable with the rates for electric dipole transitions. It is shown that when the transition rates are normalized to the local photon flux, the resulting cross sections for $l_f>1$ are singular near the optical vortex center. Relation to the "quantum core" concept introduced by Berry and Dennis is discussed.

This spin-orbit state is created by passing neutrons through the center of a quadrupole magnetic field, which provides a coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. A Ramsey fringe type measurement is suggested as a means of verifying the spin-orbit correlations.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, two particles are said to be entangled if the composite wavefunction is non-separable. Separating the two particles and measuring their coincidences as was done in the Aspect experiment leads to a modulated correlation between the polarization states of the two particles. In this article we demonstrate a similar experiment to look at a system whose two degrees of freedom (DoF)- polarization and mode - are entangled, ie the system can be modelled as a non-separable function in the Hilbert space. We propose an interferometric method to perform projective measurements that leads to correlations as seen for entangled quantum particles.

abstract: Adiabatic techniques are known to allow for engineering quantum states with high fidelity. This requirement is currently of large interest, as applications in quantum information require the preparation and manipulation of quantum states with minimal errors. Here we review recent progress on developing techniques for the preparation of spatial states through adiabatic passage, particularly focusing on three state systems. These techniques can be applied to matter waves in external potentials, such as cold atoms or electrons, and to classical waves in waveguides, such as light or sound.

abstract: We study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) per particle of an open (parti- cles can enter and leave the system) and dissipative (far from thermodynamical equilibrium) steady state system of two qubits in a noise which is decoherence. We show the behavior of QFI per particle of the system due to changes of re- set and decoherence parameters r and {\gamma} respectively. The parameter r is the strength of the reset mechanism, {\gamma} is the strength of decoherence and in our case it is dephasing channel. The parameters {\gamma} and r are real numbers. We observe that the reset parameter must be bigger than decoherence parameter. We have found that by choosing coupling parameter g as 5{\gamma} the QFI per particle is 1.00226 which is greater than shot noise limit at {\gamma} = 0.5 and r = 14 . Also the concurrence and negativity of the such state have been calculated and they are found as 0.0992486 and 0.0496243 respectively. We have shown that when the concurrence and negativity of some specific states different than zero, which means the state is entangled, the QFI of the system is greater than 1. The QFI per particle, concurrence and negativity shows that the chosen case is weakly entangled. We discovered that the optimal direction depends on the parameters r and {\gamma} and a change in the direction effects the behavior of the QFI of the system.

abstract: We discuss the role that intuitive theories of physics play in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. We compare and contrast na\"ive physics with quantum mechanics and argue that quantum mechanics is not just hard to understand but that it is difficult to believe, often appearing magical in nature. Quantum mechanics is often discussed in the context of "quantum weirdness" and quantum entanglement is known as "spooky action at a distance." This spookiness is more than just because quantum mechanics doesn't match everyday experience; it ruffles the feathers of our na\"ive physics cognitive module. In Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, we preserve a form of deterministic thinking that can alleviate some of the perceived weirdness inherent in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, at the cost of having the universe split into parallel worlds at every quantum measurement. By examining the role cognitive modules play in interpreting quantum mechanics, we conclude that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics involves a cognitive bias not seen in the Copenhagen interpretation.

abstract: Selective control of qubits in a quantum register for the purposes of quantum information processing represents a critical challenge for dense spin ensembles in solid state systems. Here we present a protocol that achieves a complete set of selective single and two-qubit gates on nuclear spins in such an ensemble in diamond facilitated by a nearby NV center. The protocol suppresses internuclear interactions as well as unwanted coupling between the NV center and other spins of the ensemble to achieve quantum gate fidelities well exceeding 99% . Notably, our method can be applied to weakly coupled, distant, spins and therefore represents a scalable procedure that exploits the exceptional properties of nuclear spins in diamond as robust quantum memories.

abstract: In a recent article Hensen et al. [Nature 526, 682 (2015)] report on a sophisticated Bell experiment, simultaneously closing, for the first time, loopholes for local hidden-variable theories (HVTs). The authors claim that 'local realism' has been refuted, under certain natural assumptions. The aim of the present Comment is twofold. First, it is urged that the class of local HVTs that is eliminated by the reported experiment should be specified in greater detail than is done by the authors. Second, it is argued that the class of local HVTs that still survives is wide and natural. For instance, hidden variables describing a 'background' field can exploit the freedom-of-choice loophole, which cannot be closed for this type of hidden variables. The dynamics of such background-based theories can be illustrated by existing systems, e.g. from fluid mechanics.

abstract: We study the transmission of light through a one-dimensional waveguide that confines strongly coupled classical or quantum degenerate fermionic atomic ensembles. The emergence of light-induced correlation effects between the atoms is analyzed by using stochastic Monte-Carlo simulations and transfer matrix methods of transport theory. The conditions of the correlated collective response are identified in terms of the atom density, thermal broadening, and photon losses. We also calculate the "cooperative Lamb shift" for the waveguide transmission resonance, and discuss line shifts that are specific to effectively one-dimensional waveguide systems.

abstract: Every finite-time transformation results in some production of entropy, which signals the occurrence of irreversibility. Quantifying the amount of irreversible entropy produced is a goal of paramount importance: it is a key quantity for the characterisation of non-equilibrium processes, and its minimisation improves the efficiency of thermal machines. So far, nanoscale systems have been used for the experimental study of classical out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, irreversible entropy production arising from quantum dynamics in mesoscopic quantum systems has not been experimentally investigated yet. In this work we measure the rate of entropy produced by an open quantum system in a non-equilibrium steady state for two different experimental setups: a micro-mechanical resonator and a Bose-Einstein condensate. Each of them is coupled to a high finesse cavity and hence subject also to optical losses. We find excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions of a framework that we develop for the open dynamics of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. Key features of our setups, such as the cooling of the mechanical resonator and signatures of a structural quantum phase transition in the condensate are reflected in the entropy production rates. Our work demonstrates the possibility to explore non-equilibrium thermodynamics in driven mesoscopic quantum systems, and paves the way to a systematic experimental assessment of the implications of out-of-equilibrium processes on such systems.

abstract: Considerable work has recently been directed toward developing resource theories of quantum coherence. In most approaches, a state is said to possess quantum coherence if it is not diagonal in some specified basis. In this letter we establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory in terms of physical implementation of the free operations, and we show that all currently proposed basis-dependent theories of coherence fail to satisfy this criterion. We further characterize the physically consistent resource theory of coherence and find its operational power to be quite limited. After relaxing the condition of physical consistency, we introduce the class of dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, present a number of new coherent monotones based on relative R\'{e}nyi entropies, and study incoherent state transformations under different operational classes. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for qubit state transformations and show these conditions hold for all classes of incoherent operations.

abstract: The difficulty of explaining non-local correlations in a fixed causal structure sheds new light on the old debate on whether space and time are to be seen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has a number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on a causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic, physically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length minus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov complexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing machine generate this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for the example of non-local correlations: We end up with a reasoning that leads to similar conclusions but is more direct than in the probabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually all be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same context-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Refining this, we end up with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings in terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical consistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a constraint than the latter in the multi-party case.

abstract: We design and analyze a simple on-chip photonic circuit that can form a universal building block of a quantum network. The circuit consists of a single-photon source, and two quantum emitters positioned in two arms of an on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer composed of waveguides with chiral light--matter interfaces. The efficient chiral light--matter interaction allows the emitters to act as photon sources to herald internode entanglement, and to perform high-fidelity intranode two-qubit gates within a single chip without any need for reconfiguration. We show that by connecting multiple circuits of this kind into a quantum network, it is possible to perform universal quantum computation with heralded two-qubit gate fidelities ${\cal F} \sim 0.998$ achievable in state-of-the-art quantum dot systems.

abstract: Quantum teleportation faithfully transfers a quantum state between distant nodes in a network, enabling revolutionary information processing applications. Here we report teleporting quantum states over a 30 km optical fiber network with the input single photon state and the EPR state prepared independently. By buffering photons in 10 km coiled optical fiber, we perform Bell state measurement after entanglement distribution. With active feed-forward operation, the average quantum state fidelity and quantum process fidelity are measured to be 0.85 and 0.77, exceeding classical limits of 0.67 and 0.5, respectively. The statistical hypothesis test shows that the probability of a classical process to predict an average state fidelity no less than the one observed in our experiment is less than 2.4E-14, confirming the quantum nature of our quantum teleportation experiment. Our experiment marks a critical step towards the realization of quantum internet in the future.

abstract: Sextic polynomial oscillator is probably the best known quantum system which is partially exactly {\it alias} quasi-exactly solvable (QES), i.e., which possesses closed-form, elementary-function bound states $\psi(x)$ at certain couplings and energies. In contrast, the apparently simpler and phenomenologically more important quartic polynomial oscillator is {\em not\,} QES. A resolution of the paradox is proposed: The one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation is shown QES after the analyticity-violating symmetrization $V(x)=A|x|+B x^2+C|x|^3+x^4$ of the quartic polynomial potential.

abstract: Quantum estimation theory can be divided into state estimation, noiseless channel estimation and noisy channel estimation. Furthermore, estimation strategies can be classified as either one-step or two-step strategies. The quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has often been used as a figure of merit for quantum metrological schemes, is not attainable for noiseless channel estimation problems by two-step strategy. Hence the figures of merit for noiseless channel estimation problems and the optimal strategy to attain the minimum error are yet to be investigated thoroughly. In this manuscript, we investigate noiseless channel estimation using a periodic error function, and present optimal states. We propose the experimental generation of the optimal states for enhanced metrology using squeezing transformations.

abstract: Thermodynamics of trajectories promises a path to thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of an open quantum system, a sought-after goal in modern physics. Unfortunately, calculation of the relevant quantities presents severe challenges. Determining the large-deviation function that gives access to the full counting statistics associated with a dynamical order parameter is challenging, if not impossible, even for systems evolving in a restricted Liouville space. Acting on the realizaion that the salient features of most dynamical systems are encoded in the first few moments of the counting statistics, in this article we present a method that gives sequential access to these moments. Our method allows for obtaining analytical result in several cases, as we illustrate, and allows using large deviation theory to reinterpret certain well-known results.

abstract: Quantum steering enables one party to communicate with another remote party even if the sender is untrusted. Such characteristics of quantum systems not only provide direct applications to quantum information science, but are also conceptually important for distinguishing between quantum and classical resources. While concrete illustrations of steering have been shown in several experiments, how steering effects vary with the system dimensionality (d) has never been experimentally investigated. Here, we introduce a simple method to experimentally certify two different kinds of quantum steering: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and single-system (SS) steering, for dimensionality up to d=16. The former reveals the steerability among bipartite systems, whereas the latter manifests itself in single quantum objects. We use multidimensional steering witnesses to verify EPR steering of polarization-entangled pairs and SS steering of single photons. The ratios between the measured witnesses and the maximum values achieved by classical mimicries are observed to increase with d for both EPR and SS steering. The designed scenario offers a new method to study further the genuine multipartite steering of large dimensionality and potential uses in quantum information processing.

abstract: The accumulation of quantum phase in response to a signal is the central mechanism of quantum sensing, as such, loss of phase information presents a fundamental limitation. For this reason approaches to extend quantum coherence in the presence of noise are actively being explored. Here we experimentally protect a room-temperature hybrid spin register against environmental decoherence by performing repeated quantum error correction whilst maintaining sensitivity to signal fields. We use a long-lived nuclear spin to correct multiple phase errors on a sensitive electron spin in diamond and realize magnetic field sensing beyond the timescales set by natural decoherence. The universal extension of sensing time, robust to noise at any frequency, demonstrates the definitive advantage entangled multi-qubit systems provide for quantum sensing and offers an important complement to quantum control techniques. In particular, our work opens the door for detecting minute signals in the presence of high frequency noise, where standard protocols reach their limits.

abstract: Despite the impressive amount of literature on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the relevance of symmetry in interpretation is not properly acknowledged. In fact, although it is usually said that quantum mechanics is invariant under the Galilean group, the invariance is usually not discussed in the case of the interpretation of the theory. This situation is particularly pressing for realist positions, which want to know how reality would be if quantum mechanics were true. From a realist perspective, it seems reasonable to require that an interpretation of quantum mechanics, to be admissible, preserves the same symmetries of the theory. In this paper we will take a realist standpoint in order to study what physical constraints the Galilean group imposes on interpretation, and we will extrapolate the conclusions drawn for quantum mechanics to the case of quantum field theory.

abstract: The occurrence of entanglement sudden death in the evolution of a bipartite system depends on both the initial state and the channel responsible for the evolution. An extreme case is that of entanglement braking channels, which are channels that acting on only one of the subsystems drives them to full disentanglement regardless of the initial state. In general, one can find certain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both subsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the channel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this effect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when entanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an effective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our results allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death or not for a given evolution. An experiment with polarization entangled photons demonstrates the utility of this result in a variety of cases.

abstract: Experiments involving single or few elementary particles are completely described by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that quantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and the statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart from the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the microscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of uncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal variable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a symmetric role in the wave-function \Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built and analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \Psi (x,t) |^2, where the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is equivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of the discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \Psi (x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then we discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal wavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving single and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the spread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in two-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and temporal wavepackets.

abstract: The Gibbs canonical state, as a maximum entropy density matrix, represents a quantum system in equilibrium with a thermostat. This state plays an essential role in thermodynamics and serves as the initial condition for non-equilibrium dynamical simulations. We solve a long standing problem for computing the Gibbs state Wigner function with nearly machine accuracy by solving the Bloch equation directly in the phase space. Furthermore, the algorithm is provided yielding high quality Wigner distributions of pure stationary states. The developed numerical methods furnish a long-sought efficient computation framework for non-equilibrium quantum simulations directly in the Wigner representation.

We implement three methods of construction of quantum angle. The first one is based on operator theory. The second one pertains to Weyl-Heisenberg integral quantization of the plane viewed as the phase space of the motion on the line. It depends on a family of "weight" functions on the plane. The third method rests upon coherent state quantization of the cylinder viewed as the phase space of the motion on the circle. The construction of these coherent states depends on a family of probability distributions on the line.

abstract: We suggest a multiatom cavity quantum electrodynamics system for the weak magnetic field detection based on Faraday rotation with intracavity electromagnetically induced transparency. The collective coupling between the cavity modes and the atomic ensemble can be used to improve the sensitivity. With single probe photon input, the sensitivity is inversely proportional to the number of atoms, and the sensitivity with 0.7(5)~nT/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ could be attained. With multiphoton measurement, the sensitivity can be approved to 4.7(9)~fT/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$.

abstract: The round-robin differential phase-shift quantum key distribution protocol provides a secure way to exchange private information without monitoring conventional disturbances and still maintains a high tolerance of noise, making it desirable for practical implementations of quantum key distribution. However, photon number resolving detectors are required to ensure that the detected signals are single photons in the original protocol. Here, we adopt the detector-decoy method and give the bounds to the fraction of detected events from single photons. Utilizing the advantages of the protocol, we provide a practical method of performing the protocol with desirable performances requiring only threshold single-photon detectors.

abstract: By pulsed s-shell resonant excitation of a single quantum dot-micropillar system, we generate long streams of a thousand of near transform-limited single photons with high mutual indistinguishability. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two photons are measured as a function of their emission time separation varying from 13 ns to 14.7 {\mu}s, where the visibility slightly drops from 95.9(2)% to a plateau of 92.1(5)% through a slow dephasing process occurring at time scale of 0.7 {\mu}s. Temporal and spectral analysis reveal the pulsed resonance fluorescence single photons are close to transform limit, which are readily useful for multi-photon entanglement and interferometry experiments.

abstract: In light of a recent reformulation of Bell's theorem from causal principles by Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum theory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision of our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a quantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but highlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have satisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly) agent-centric notions such as "controllables" and "uncontrollables", or "observed" and "unobserved". Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's theorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep conceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than rejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem to be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between quantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus causal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a resolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a solution to the measurement problem.

abstract: Stimulated emission is the process fundamental to laser operation, thereby producing coherent photon output. Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's, there have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from ensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the short excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the neutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both theoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$ states using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave pump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the phononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated in the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the transition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser wavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon line is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamond lasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadens the applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to a new generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit the contrast and signal amplification of a lasing system.

abstract: The transfer of quantum entanglement (or quantum coherence) is not only fundamental in quantum mechanics but also important in quantum information processing. We here propose a way to achieve the coherent transfer of $W$-class entangled states of qubits among different cavities. Because no photon is excited in each cavity, decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed during the transfer. In addition, only one coupler qubit and one operational step are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal, thus the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified. We further give a numerical analysis, showing that high-fidelity transfer of a three-qubit $W$ state is feasible within the present circuit QED technique. The proposal can be applied to a wide range of physical implementation with various qubits such as quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers, atoms, and superconducting qubits.

abstract: Some critical open problems of epistemic logics can be investigated in the framework of a quantum computational approach. The basic idea is to interpret sentences - like Alice knows that Bob does not understand that Pi is irrational - as pieces of quantum information (generally represented by density operators of convenient Hilbert spaces). Logical epistemic operators (to understand, to know ...) are dealt with as (generally irreversible) quantum operations, which are, in a sense, similar to measurement-procedures. This approach permits us to model some characteristic epistemic processes, that concern both human and artificial intelligence. For instance, the operation of \memorizing and retrieving information" can be formally represented, in this framework, by using a quantum teleportation phenomenon.

abstract: Quantum information has suggested new forms of quantum logic, called quantum computational logics, where meanings of sentences are represented by pieces of quantum information (generally, density operators of some Hilbert spaces), which can be stored and transmitted by means of quantum particles. This approach can be applied to a semantic characterization of epistemic logical operations, which may occur in sentences like "At time t0 Bob knows that at time t Alice knows that the spin-value is up". Each epistemic agent (say, Alice, Bob,...) has a characteristic truth-perspective, corresponding to a particular orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C^2. From a physical point of view, a truth-perspective can be associated to an apparatus that allows one to measure a given observable. An important feature that characterizes the knowledge of any agent is the amount of information that is accessible to him/her (technically, a special set of density operators, which also represents the internal memory of the agent in question). One can prove that interesting epistemic operations are special examples of quantum channels, which generally are not unitary. The act of knowing may involve some intrinsic irreversibility due to possible measurement procedures or to a loss of information about the environment. We also illustrate some relativistic-like effects that arise in the behavior of epistemic agents.

abstract: Quantum computational logics represent a logical abstraction from the circuit-theory in quantum computation. In these logics formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information (qubits, quregisters or mixtures of quregisters), while logical connectives correspond to (quantum logical) gates that transform quantum information in a reversible way. The characteristic holistic features of the quantum theoretic formalism (which play an essential role in entanglement-phenomena) can be used in order to develop a holistic version of the quantum computational semantics. In contrast with the compositional character of most standard semantic approaches, meanings of formulas are here dealt with as global abstract objects that determine the contextual meanings of the formulas' components (from the whole to the parts). We present a survey of the most significant logical arguments that are valid or that are possibly violated in the framework of this semantics. Some logical features that may appear prima facie strange seem to reflect pretty well informal arguments that are currently used in our rational activity.

abstract: By using the abstract structures investigated in the first Part of this article, we develop a semantics for an epistemic language, which expresses sentences like "Alice knows that Bob does not understand that PI is irrational". One is dealing with a holistic form of quantum computational semantics, where entanglement plays a fundamental role, thus, the meaning of a global expression determines the contextual meanings of its parts, but generally not the other way around. The epistemic situations represented in this semantics seem to reflect some characteristic limitations of the real processes of acquiring information. Since knowledge is not generally closed under logical consequence, the unpleasant phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided.

abstract: Understanding the fundamental limits on precision measurements of optical phase is of key interest for many investigative techniques utilized within science and technology. We compare measurement strategies using classical and non-classical optical input states, where the number of passes through the unknown phase can be freely controlled. We find that, for a given number of incident photons upon the unknown phase, non-classical techniques provide less than a 20% reduction in root-mean-square-error (RMSE) in comparison with classical techniques in multi-pass optical setups. Using classical techniques in a new optical setup we devise, the achievable reduction in RMSE afforded by non-classical techniques falls to only ~4%.

abstract: Matter-wave interferometry has become an essential tool in studies on the foundations of quantum physics and for precision measurements. Mechanical gratings have played an important role as coherent beamsplitters for atoms, molecules and clusters since the basic diffraction mechanism is the same for all particles. However, polarizable objects may experience van der Waals shifts when they pass the grating walls and the undesired dephasing may prevent interferometry with massive objects. Here we explore how to minimize this perturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate physical limit, i.e. the thickness of a single atom. We have fabricated diffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in 1 nm thin carbonaceous biphenyl membrane. We identify conditions to transform an array of single layer graphene nanoribbons into a grating of carbon nanoscrolls. We show that all these ultra-thin nanomasks can be used for high-contrast quantum diffraction of massive molecules. They can be seen as a nanomechanical answer to the question debated by Bohr and Einstein whether a softly suspended double slit would destroy quantum interference. In agreement with Bohr's reasoning we show that quantum coherence prevails even in the limit of atomically thin gratings.

abstract: We explore the coherent control of nonlinear absorption of intense laser fields in a four-level ladder system. In the absence of control field, a coupling field creates electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with Aulter-Townes doublet for the probe field. A large absorption peak appears at resonance as the control field is switched on. We show how such a large absorption leads to photon switching. Further, this large absorption gets diminished and complete transparency appear due to saturation effects as the strength of the probe field is increased. The effect of the control field on saturable absorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA) are also highlighted in the context of nonlinear absorption of the probe field. We achieve RSA and SA in a simple atomic system just by applying a control field. We further demonstrate that the threshold of the optical bistability can be modified by suitable choices of the coupling and the control fields.

abstract: The security issues facing quantum key distribution (QKD) are explained, herein focusing on those issues that are cryptographic and information theoretic in nature and not those based on physics. The problem of security criteria is addressed. It is demonstrated that an attacker's success probabilities are the fundamental criteria of security that any theoretic security criterion must relate to in order to have operational significance. The errors committed in the prevalent interpretation of the trace distance criterion are analyzed. The security proofs of QKD protocols are discussed and assessed in regard to three main features: their validity, completeness, and adequacy of the achieved numerical security level. Problems are identified in all these features. It appears that the QKD security situation is quite different from the common perception that a QKD-generated key is nearly perfectly secure. Built into our discussion is a simple but complete quantitative description of the information theoretic security of classical key distribution that is also applicable to the quantum situation. In the appendices, we provide a brief outline of the history of some major QKD security proofs, a rather unfavorable comparison of current QKD proven security with that of conventional symmetric key ciphers, and a list of objections and answers concerning some major points of the paper.

abstract: Each step in a quantum random walk is typically understood to have two basic components; a `coin-toss' which produces a random superposition of two states, and a displacement which moves each component of the superposition by different amounts. Here we suggest the realization of a walk in momentum space with a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate subject to a quantum ratchet realized with a pulsed, off-resonant optical lattice. By an appropriate choice of the lattice detuning, we show how the atomic momentum can be entangled with the internal spin states of the atoms. For the coin-toss, we propose to use a microwave pulse to mix these internal states. We present experimental results showing an optimized quantum ratchet, and through a series of simulations, demonstrate how our proposal gives extraordinary control of the quantum walk. This should allow for the investigation of possible biases, and classical-to-quantum dynamics in the presence of natural and engineered noise.

abstract: We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that estimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is improved in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of precision may be substantial for short interaction time, i.e. for media of moderate size, e.g. biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the QFI as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the non-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.

abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing quantum supremacy.

The general solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for this potential is written through fundamental solutions each of which presents an irreducible combination of two Gauss hypergeometric functions. The potential is an asymmetric step-barrier with variable height and steepness. Discussing the transmission above such a barrier, we derive a compact formula for the reflection coefficient.

abstract: Quantum communication without a shared reference frame or the construction of a relational quantum theory requires the notion of a quantum reference frame. We analyze aspects of quantum reference frames associated with non-compact groups, specifically the group of spatial translations and Galilean boosts. We begin by demonstrating how the usually employed group average, used to dispense of the notion of an external reference frame, leads to unphysical states when applied to reference frames associated with non-compact groups. However, we show that this average does lead naturally to a reduced state on the relative degrees of freedom of a system, which was previously considered by Angelo et al. [1]. We then study in detail the informational properties of this reduced state for systems of two and three particles in Gaussian states.

abstract: The Quantum Query Model is a framework that allow us to express most known quantum algorithms. Algorithms represented by this model consist on a set of unitary operators acting over a finite Hilbert space, and a final measurement step consisting on a set of projectors. In this work, we prove that the application of these unitary operators before the measurement step is equivalent to decomposing a unit vector into a sum of vectors and then inverting some of their relative phases. We also prove that the vectors of that sum must fulfill a list of properties and we call such vectors a Block Set. If we take the same measurement step on the Quantum Query Model and on the Block Set Formulation, then we prove that both formulations give the same Gram matrix of output states, although the Block Set Formulation allows a much more explicit form. Therefore, the Block Set reformulation of the Quantum Query Model has advantages for the design of exact quantum algorithms. Finally, we test these advantages of Block Sets by applying our approach to the construction of quantum exact algorithms.

abstract: We present exact results on the exactly solvable spin chain of Bravyi et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 207202 (2012)]. This model is a spin one chain and has a Hamiltonian that is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. It has a unique (frustration free) ground state with an energy gap that is polynomially small in the system's size ($2n$). The half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state is $\frac{1}{2}\log n+const.$. Here we first write the Hamiltonian in the standard spin-basis representation. We prove that at zero temperature, the magnetization is along the $z-$direction i.e., $\langle s^{x}\rangle=\langle s^{y}\rangle=0$ (everywhere on the chain). We then analytically calculate $\langle s^{z}\rangle$ and the two-point correlation functions of $s^{z}$. By analytically diagonalizing the reduced density matrices, we calculate the Schmidt rank, von Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropies for: 1. Any partition of the chain into two pieces (not necessarily in the middle) and 2. $L$ consecutive spins centered in the middle. Further, we identify entanglement Hamiltonians (Eqs. 40 and 50). We prove a small lemma (Lemma1) on the combinatorics of lattice paths using the reflection principle to relate and calculate the Motzkin walk 'height' to spin expected values. We also calculate the, closely related, (scaled) correlation functions of Brownian excursions. The known features of this model are summarized in a table in Sec.I.

abstract: The existence of minimal length scale has motivated the proposal of generalized uncertainty principle, which provides a potential routine to probe quantum gravitational effects in low-energy quantum mechanics experiment. Hitherto, the tabletop experiment of testing deviations from ordinary quantum mechanics are mostly based on microscopic objects. However, the feasibility of these studies are challenged by the recent study of spacetime quantization for composite macroscopic body. In this paper, we propose a scheme to probe quantum gravity effects by revealing the deviations from predictions of Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Our scheme focus on manipulating the interaction sequences between external laser fields and a single trapped ion to seek evidence of spacetime quantization, therefore reduce the complicity induced by large bodies to some extent. The relevant study for microscopic particles is crucial considering the lack of satisfactory theories regarding basic properties for multi-particles in the framework of quantum gravity. Meanwhile, we are managed to set a new upper limit for deformation parameter.

abstract: The ability to modulate an optical field via an electric field is regarded as a key function of electro-optic interconnects, which are used in optical communications and information processing systems. One of the main required devices for such interconnects is the electro-optic modulator (EOM). Current EOM based on the electro-optic effect and the electro-absorption effect often is bulky and power inefficient due to the weak electro-optic properties of its constituent materials. Here we propose a new mechanism to produce an arbitrary-waveform EOM based on the quantum interference, in which both the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are engineered coherently with the superhigh efficiency. Based on this EOM, a waveform interconnect from the voltage to the modulated optical absorption is realised. We expect that such a new type of electro-optic interconnect will have a broad range of applications including the optical communications and network.

We show that in the particular case of rotationally-invariant circular states the Schmidt decomposition of two modes, and therefore the value of their entanglement, are given by analytical expressions. We analyse the dependence of the entanglement on the radius of the circle and number of components in the superposition. We also show that the set of rotationally-invariant circular states creates an orthonormal basis in the state space of the harmonic oscillator, and this basis is advantageous for representation of other circular states of light.

abstract: We consider an open quantum system composed of two dipole-dipole interacting two-level atoms and show that incoherent excitation can trigger coherent dynamics in this toy "molecular aggregate". We show that the retarded dipole-dipole interaction creates coherence regardless of the coherence properties of the excitation fields. In contrast to earlier claims in the literature, our rigorous analysis shows that the steady state coherence {\it increases} with the energy gradient between the two-level atoms.

abstract: This paper is concerned with a filtering problem for a class of nonlinear quantum stochastic systems with multichannel nondemolition measurements. The system-observation dynamics are governed by a Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation driven by quantum Wiener processes of bosonic fields in vacuum state. The Hamiltonian and system-field coupling operators, as functions of the system variables, are represented in a Weyl quantization form. Using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we obtain a stochastic integro-differential equation for the posterior quasi-characteristic function (QCF) of the system conditioned on the measurements. This equation is a spatial Fourier domain representation of the Belavkin-Kushner-Stratonovich stochastic master equation driven by the innovation process associated with the measurements. We also discuss a more specific form of the posterior QCF dynamics in the case of linear system-field coupling and outline a Gaussian approximation of the posterior quantum state.

abstract: The transition from quantum to classical physics remains an intensely debated question even though it has been investigated for more than a century. Further clarifications could be obtained by preparing macroscopic objects in spatial quantum superpositions and proposals for generating such states for nano-mechanical devices either in a transient or a probabilistic fashion have been put forward. Here we introduce a method to deterministically obtain spatial superpositions of arbitrary lifetime via dissipative state preparation. In our approach, we engineer a double-well potential for the motion of the mechanical element and drive it towards the ground state, which shows the desired spatial superposition, via optomechanical sideband cooling. We propose a specific implementation based on a superconducting circuit coupled to the mechanical motion of a lithium-decorated monolayer graphene sheet, introduce a method to verify the mechanical state by coupling it to a superconducting qubit, and discuss its prospects for testing collapse models for the quantum to classical transition.

abstract: One of the current major challenges surrounding the use of quantum annealers for solving practical optimization problems is their inability to encode even moderately sized problems---the main reason for this being the rigid layout of their quantum bits as well as their sparse connectivity. In particular, the implementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of practical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful penalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian --- a technique that often requires an `all-to-all' connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique designed to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on the construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of the problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose general guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an arbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism, not-all-equal 3SAT, and the so-called Lechner, Hauke and Zoller constraints. We also discuss the significance of our approach in the context of current and future experimental quantum annealers.

abstract: Refocusing of a quantum system in NMR and quantum information processing can be achieved by application of short pulses according to the methods of spin echo and dynamical decoupling. However, these methods are strongly limited by the requirement that the evolution of the system between pulses be suitably small. Here we show how refocusing may be achieved for arbitrary (but time-independent) evolution of the system between pulses. We first illustrate the procedure with one-qubit systems, and then generalize to $d$-dimensional quantum systems. We also give an application of this result to quantum computation, proving a new version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that does not require inverse gates.

abstract: The quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open system characterizes the most efficient response of the system to the environmental influences. Previous results showed that the non-Markovianity governs the quantum speedup. Via studying the dynamics of a dissipative two-level system, we reveal that the non-Markovian effect is only the dynamical way of the quantum speedup, while the formation of the system-environment bound states is the essential reason for the quantum speedup. Our attribution of the quantum speedup to the energy-spectrum character can supply another vital path for experiments when the quantum speedup shows up without any dynamical calculations. The potential experimental observation of our quantum speedup mechanism in the circuit QED system is discussed. Our results may be of both theoretical and experimental interests in exploring the ultimate QSL in realistic environments, and may open new perspectives for devising active quantum speedup devices.

abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states of photons can be prepared by effective gauge fields gated by the quantum states of a two-level atom interacting with three cavities. By periodically modulating the cavity frequencies with different phases, opposite effective gauge fields of cavity photons can be created for the two quantum states of the atom. A superposition of atomic states can transport photons from one cavity to a macroscopic superposition of the other two cavities. This mechanism provides new possibilities in exploring quantum entanglement and has applications in quantum metrology and quantum information.

abstract: Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks. Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states, propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification for either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold among the different approaches to quantifying coherence.

abstract: Heterogeneous bipartite quantum pure states, composed of two subsystems with a different number of levels, cannot have both reductions maximally mixed. In this work, we demonstrate existence of a wide range of highly entangled states of heterogeneous multipartite systems consisting of $N>2$ parties such that every reduction to one and two parties is maximally mixed. Two constructions of generating genuinely multipartite maximally entangled states of heterogeneous systems for an arbitrary number of subsystems are presented. Such states are related to quantum error correction codes over mixed alphabets and mixed orthogonal arrays. Additionally, we show that constructed entangled states can be expressed as superpositions of mutually orthogonal GHZ-like states.

abstract: Associative memory models, in theoretical neuro- and computer sciences, can generally store a sublinear number of memories. We show that using quantum annealing for recall tasks endows associative memory models with exponential storage capacities. Theoretically, we obtain the radius of attractor basins, $R(N)$, and the capacity, $C(N)$, of such a scheme and their tradeoffs. Our calculations establish that for randomly chosen memories the capacity of a model using the Hebbian learning rule with recall via quantum annealing is exponential in the size of the problem, $C(N)=\mathcal{O}(e^{C_1N}),~C_1\geq0$, and succeeds on randomly chosen memory sets with a probability of $(1-e^{-C_2N}),~C_2\geq0$ with $C_1+C_2=(.5-f)^2/(1-f)$, where, $f=R(N)/N,~0\leq f\leq .5$ is the radius of attraction in terms of Hamming distance of an input probe from a stored memory as a fraction of the problem size. We demonstrate the application of this scheme on a programmable quantum annealing device - the Dwave processor.

abstract: Quantum computer has an amazing potential of fast information processing. However, realisation of a digital quantum computer is still a challenging problem requiring highly accurate controls and key application strategies. Here we propose a novel platform, quantum reservoir computing, to solve these issues successfully by exploiting natural quantum dynamics, which is ubiquitous in laboratories nowadays, for machine learning. In this framework, nonlinear dynamics including classical chaos can be universally emulated in quantum systems. A number of numerical experiments show that quantum systems consisting of at most seven qubits possess computational capabilities comparable to conventional recurrent neural networks of 500 nodes. This discovery opens up a new paradigm for information processing with artificial intelligence powered by quantum physics.

abstract: Josza's definition of fidelity for a pair of (mixed) quantum states is studied in the context of two types of operator algebras. The first setting is mainly algebraic in that it involves unital C$^*$-algebras $A$ that possess a faithful trace functional $\tau$. In this context, the role of quantum states (that is, density operators) in the classical quantum-mechanical framework is assumed by positive elements $\rho\in A$ for which $\tau(\rho)=1$. The second of our two settings is more operator theoretic: by fixing a faithful normal semifinite trace $\tau$ on a semifinite von Neumann algebra $M$, we define and consider the fidelity of pairs of positive operators in $M$ of unit trace. The main results of this paper address monotonicity and preservation of fidelity under the action of certain trace-preserving positive linear maps of $A$ or of the predual $M_*$. Our results also yield a new proof of a theorem of Moln\'ar on the structure of quantum channels on the trace-class operators that preserve fidelity.

abstract: We study the critical properties of finite-dimensional dissipative quantum spin systems with uniform ferromagnetic interactions. Starting from the transverse-field Ising model coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators with Ohmic spectral density, we generalize its classical representation to classical spin systems with $O(n)$ symmetry and then take the large-$n$ limit to reduce the system to the spherical model. The exact solution to the resulting spherical model with long-range interactions along the imaginary-time axis shows a phase transition with static critical exponents coinciding with those of the conventional short-range spherical model in $d+2$ dimensions, where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality of the original quantum system. This implies the dynamical exponent to be $z=2$. These conclusions are consistent with the results of Monte Carlo simulations and renormalization group calculations for dissipative transverse-field Ising and $O(n)$ models in one and two dimensions. The present approach therefore serves as a useful tool to analytically investigate the properties of quantum phase transitions of the dissipative transverse-field Ising and related models. Our method may also offer a platform to study more complex phase transitions in dissipative finite-dimensional quantum spin systems, which recently receive renewed interest under the context of quantum annealing in a noisy environment.

abstract: In addition to the well-known Landauer-Buttiker scattering theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function technique for mesoscopic transports, an alternative (and very useful) scheme is quantum master equation approach. In this article, we review the particle-number (n)-resolved master equation (n-ME) approach and its systematic applications in quantum measurement and quantum transport problems. The n-ME contains rich dynamical information, allowing efficient study of topics such as shot noise and full counting statistics analysis. Moreover, we also review a newly developed master equation approach (and its n-resolved version) under self-consistent Born approximation. The application potential of this new approach is critically examined via its ability to recover the exact results for noninteracting systems under arbitrary voltage and in presence of strong quantum interference, and the challenging non-equilibrium Kondo effect.

abstract: The extension of the Ramo-Schockley-Pellegrini theorem for quantum systems allows to define a positive-operator valued measure (POVM) for the total conduction plus displacement electrical current. The resulting current operator is characterized by two parameters, viz. the width of the associated Gaussian functions and the lapse of time between consecutive measurements. For large Gaussian dispersions and small time intervals, the operator obeys to a continuous weak-measurement scheme. Contrarily, in the limit of very narrow Gaussian widths and a single-shot measurement, the operator corresponds to a standard von Neumann (projective) measurement. We have implemented the resulting measurement protocol into a quantum electron transport simulator. Numerical results for a resonant tunneling diode show the great sensibility of current-voltage characteristics to different parameter configurations of the total current operator.

abstract: Closed quantum systems obey the Schroedinger equation whereas nonequilibrium behavior of many of systems is routinely described in terms of classical, Markovian stochastic processes. Evidently, there are fundamental differences between those two types of behavior. We discuss the conditions under which the unitary dynamics may be mapped onto pertinent classical stochastic processes. This is first principally addressed based on the notions of "consistency" and "Markovianity." Numerical data are presented that show that the above conditions are to good approximation fulfilled for Heisenberg-type spin models comprising 12-20 spins. The accuracy to which these conditions are met increases with system size.

abstract: The thermodynamics of low-temperature gasses, especially notable in the blackbody energy spectrum, provided one of the central historical motivations for development of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, our understanding of heat and work for coupled quantum systems remains incomplete. A version of the EPR paradox prevents simultaneously doing work on a quantum system and knowing how much work has been done. A system can do work on its environment only if the two have a nonzero interaction energy. During interaction, two become entangled, leading to a superposition of different possible values for the work. According to quantum mechanics, measuring the work projects into a state with exactly zero interaction energy. Therefore the system-environment interaction is always either zero or unknown. This paper proposes observational definitions of heat and work based on the interaction of a quantum system and measurement apparatus. These definitions are consistent with the usual laws of thermodynamics at all temperatures. The statistics of the central system are known to go over to a quantum Boltzmann distribution in the limit of very slow measurement and small interaction. At finite measurement rates, interaction with the environment makes the system unable to reach absolute zero. Repeatedly measured quantum systems are thus predicted to exhibit a minimum achievable temperature. The phenomenon of minimum temperature offers a novel explanation of recent experiments aimed at testing fluctuation theorems in the quantum realm.

abstract: Establishing the strong converse theorem for a communication channel confirms that the capacity of that channel, that is, the maximum achievable rate of reliable information communication, is the ultimate limit of communication over that channel. Indeed, the strong converse theorem for a channel states that coding at a rate above the capacity of the channel results in the convergence of the error to its maximum value 1 and that there is no trade-off between communication rate and decoding error. Here we prove that the strong converse theorem holds for the product-state capacity of quantum channels with ergodic Markovian correlated memory.

abstract: We present an experimental method for the generation of amplitude squeezed high-order vector beams. The light is modified twice by a spatial light modulator such that the vector beam is created by means of a collinear interferometric technique. A major advantage of this approach is that it avoids systematic losses, which are detrimental as they cause decoherence in continuous-variable quantum systems. The utilisation of a spatial light modulator (SLM) gives the flexibility to switch between arbitrary mode orders. The conversion efficiency with our setup is only limited by the efficiency of the SLM. We show the experimental generation of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes with radial indices up to 1 and azimuthal indices up to 3 with complex polarization structures and a quantum noise reduction up to -0.9dB$\pm$0.1dB. The corresponding polarization structures are studied in detail by measuring the spatial distribution of the Stokes parameters.

abstract: We consider the physical situations where the resource theories of coherence and thermodynamics play competing roles. In particular, we study the creation of quantum coherence using unitary operations with the limited thermodynamical resources. We first find the maximal coherence that can be created under unitary operations, starting from a thermal state and find explicitly the unitary transformation that creates the maximal coherence. Since coherence is created by unitary operation starting from a thermal state, it requires some amount of energy. This motivates us to explore the trade-off between the amount of coherence that can be created and the energy cost of the unitary process. We find the maximal coherence that can be created under the additional constraint on the available energy. Additionally, we compare the maximal coherence and the maximal total correlation that can be created under unitary transformations with the same available energy at our disposal. We find that when maximal coherence is created with limited energy then the total correlation created in the process is upper bounded by the maximal coherence and vice versa. For two qubit systems we show that there does not exist any unitary transformation that creates maximal coherence and maximal total correlation simultaneously with limited energy cost.

Notably, all known equivalent characterisations of the classical $\Phi$-entropies have their matrix correspondences. Next, we propose an operator-valued generalisation of the matrix $\Phi$-entropy functionals, and prove their subadditivity under L\"owner partial ordering. Our results demonstrate that the subadditivity of operator-valued $\Phi$-entropies is equivalent to the convexity of various related functions. This result can be used to demonstrate an interesting result in quantum information theory: the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of a quantum ensemble is monotone under unital quantum channels. Finally, we derive the operator Efron-Stein inequality to bound the operator-valued variance of a random matrix.

abstract: The quasi-degenerate ground state manifold of the anisotropic Ising spin model can encode quantum information, but its degree of protection against local perturbations is known to be only partial. We explain how the coupling between the two ground states can be used to observe signatures of Majorana zero modes in a small controlled chain of qubits. We argue that the protection against certain local perturbations persists across a range of parameters even away from the ideal point. Remarkably, when additional non-local interactions are considered the system enters a phase where the ground states are fully protected against all local field perturbations.

Universality of the method consists in arbitrariness of the possible Ramsey schemes. However, most extremal results are obtained in combination with so-called hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy [V. I. Yudin, et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 011804(R) (2010)]. In the latter case, the probe-induced frequency shifts can be suppressed considerably below a fractional level of 10$^{-18}$ practically for any optical atomic clocks, where this shift previously was metrologically significant. The main advantage of our method in comparison with other radical hyper-Ramsey approaches [R. Hobson, et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 010501(R) (2016); T. Zanon-Willette, et al., arXiv:1511.04847 (2015)] consist in much greater efficiency and resistibility in the presence of decoherentization.

abstract: Based on a method that produces the solutions to the Schrodinger equations of partner potentials, we give two conditionally exactly solvable partner potentials of exponential type defined on the half line. These potentials are multiplicative shape invariant and each of their linearly independent solution includes a sum of two hypergeometric functions. Furthermore we calculate the scattering amplitudes and study some of their properties.

abstract: Linear programming approaches have been applied to derive upper bounds on the size of classical codes and quantum codes. In this paper, we derive similar results for general quantum codes with entanglement assistance, including nonadditive codes, by considering a type of split weight enumerators. After deriving the MacWilliams identities for these split weight enumerators, we are able to prove algebraic linear programming bounds, such as the Singleton bound, the Hamming bound, and the first linear programming bound. On the other hand, we obtain additional constraints on the size of Pauli subgroups for quantum codes, which allow us to improve the linear programming bounds on the minimum distance of small quantum codes. In particular, we show that there is no [[27,15,5]] quantum stabilizer code. We also discuss the existence of some entanglement-assisted quantum stabilizer codes with maximal entanglement. As a result, the upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of maximal-entanglement quantum stabilizer codes with length up to 15 are significantly improved.

abstract: We study a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled through the position operator $\hat{q}$ to a first bath and through the momentum operator $\hat{p}$ to a second bath yielding an Ohmic-Drude dissipation. We analyse the oscillator's fluctuations as a function of the ratio between the strength of the two couplings, focusing in particular on the situation in which the two dissipative interactions are comparable. Analytic formulas are derived in the relevant regimes corresponding to the low temperature limit and when the Drude high frequency cutoff is much larger than all other frequencies. At low temperature, each bath operates to suppress the oscillator's ground state quantum fluctuations ${\langle \Delta \hat{q}^2 \rangle}_0$ or ${\langle \Delta \hat{p}^2 \rangle}_0$ appearing in the corresponding interaction. When one of the two dissipative interactions dominates over the other, the fluctuations for the coupling operator are squeezed. When the two interactions are comparable, the two baths enter in competition as the two conjugate operators do not commute yielding quantum frustration. In this regime, remarkably, the fluctuations of both two quadratures can be enhanced by increasing the dissipative coupling.

abstract: We discuss a qubit weakly coupled to a finite-size heat bath (calorimeter) from the point of view of quantum thermodynamics. The energy deposited to this environment together with the state of the qubit provides a basis to analyze the heat and work statistics of this closed combined system. We present results on two representative models, where the bath is composed of two-level systems or harmonic oscillators, respectively. Finally, we derive results for an open quantum system composed of the above qubit plus finite-size bath, but now the latter is coupled to a practically infinite bath of the same nature of oscillators or two-level systems.

abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulator is characterized by the helical edge states, with the spin polarization of electron being locked to its direction of motion. Although the edge-state conduction has been observed, unambiguous evidence of the helical spin texture is still lacking. Here, we investigate the coherent edge-state transport in an interference loop pinched by two point contacts. Due to the helical character, the forward inter-edge scattering enforces a $\pi$ spin rotation. Two successive processes can only produce a nontrivial $2\pi$ or trivial $0$ spin rotation, which can be controlled by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The nontrivial spin rotation results in a geometric $\pi$ Berry phase, which can be detected by a $\pi$ phase shift of the conductance oscillation relative to the trivial case. Our results provide a smoking gun evidence for the helical spin texture of the edge states. Moreover, it also provides the opportunity to all-electrically explore the trajectory-dependent spin Berry phase in condensed matter.

abstract: We obtain ab initio the Hubbard parameters for Rydberg-dressed atoms in an one-dimensional sinusoidal optical lattice in the basis of maximally localized wannier states. Finite range, soft-core inter-atomic interactions become the trait of Rydberg admixed atoms, which can be extended over many neighbouring lattice sites. On contrary to dipolar gases, where the interactions follow an inverse cubic law, the key feature of Rydberg-dressed interactions being the possibility of making neighbouring couplings to the same magnitude as that of the onsite ones. The maximally localized Wannier functions are typically calculated via spread minimization procedure [Phys. Rev. B 56, 12847 (1997)] and always found to be real functions apart from a trivial global phase when considering an isolated set of Bloch bands. For an isolated single Bloch band, the above procedure reduces to a simple quasi-momentum dependent unitary phase transformation. Here, in stead of minimizing the spread, we employ a diagonal phase transformation which eliminates the imaginary part of the Wannier functions. The resulting Wannier states are found to be maximally localized and in exact agreement with those obtained via spread minimization procedure. Using that we calculate the Hubbard couplings from the Rydberg-admixed interactions, including dominant density assisted tunnelling coefficients. In the end we provide realistic lattice parameters for the state of the art experimental Rydberg dressed Rubidium setup.

abstract: We bring a Bayesian viewpoint to the analysis of clocks. Using exponential distributions as priors for clocks, we analyze the case of a single precessing spin. We find that, at least with a single qubit, quantum mechanics does not allow exact timekeeping, in contrast to classical mechanics which does. We find the optimal ratio of angular velocity of precession to rate of the exponential distribution that leads to maximum accuracy. Further, we find an energy versus accuracy tradeoff --- the energy cost is at least $k_BT$ times the improvement in accuracy as measured by the entropy reduction in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution.

abstract: We extend significantly previous works on the Hilbert space representations of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in 3+1 dimensions of the form $[X_i,P_j] = i F_{ij}$ where $ F_{ij} = f(P^2) \delta_{ij} + g(P^2) P_i P_j $ for any functions $f$. However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting $X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal length that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level, there exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum algebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of operators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the symmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a completely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with momentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space representations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus, specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional analysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a minimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of translations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship is preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal length is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding Aquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of this model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of translations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends on the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. This result provides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum gravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.

abstract: We present a novel procedure to solve the Schr\"odinger equation, which in optics is the paraxial wave equation, with an initial multisingular vortex Gaussian beam. This initial condition has a number of singularities in a plane transversal to propagation embedded in a Gaussian beam. We use the scattering modes, which are solutions of the paraxial wave equation that can be combined straightforwardly to express the initial condition and therefore permit to solve the problem. To construct the scattering modes one needs to obtain the $F$-polynomials, which play an analogous role than Laguerre polynomials for Laguerre-Gaussian modes. We demonstrate here the recurrence relations needed to determine the $F$-polynomials. To stress the utility and strength of the method we solve first the problem of an initial Gaussian beam with two positive singularities and a negative one embedded in. We show that the solution permits one to obtain analytical expressions. These can used to obtain closed expressions for meaningful quantities, like the distance at which the positive and negative singularities merge, closing the loop of a vortex line. Furthermore, we present an example of calculation of an specific discrete-Gauss state, which is the solution of the diffraction of a Laguerre-Gauss state showing definite angular momentum (that is, a highly charged vortex) by a thin diffractive element showing certain discrete symmetry. We show that thereby this problem is solved in a much simpler way than using the previous procedure based in the integral Fresnel diffraction method.

abstract: Motivated by questions about the open-system dynamics of topological quantum matter, we investigated the quantum Brownian motion of an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field. When the Fermi length $l_F=\hbar/(v_Fm_{\text{eff}})$ becomes much longer than the magnetic length $l_B=(\hbar c/eB)^{1/2}$, then the spatial coordinates $X,Y$ of the electron cease to commute, $[X,Y]=il_B^2$. As a consequence, localization of the electron becomes limited by Heisenberg uncertainty, and the linear bath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic energy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron has no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection between frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features make quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime $l_F\gg l_B$, which is at the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum Brownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation derived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of characterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out to be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to $t^\alpha$ and $\alpha=1$, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality constant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime, friction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We also show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the noncommutative plane for suitably designed metastable potential wells, a feature that might be worth exploiting for storage and protection of quantum information.

abstract: Motivated by a desire to understand quantum fluctuation energy densities and stress within a spatially varying dielectric medium, we examine the vacuum expectation value for the stress tensor of a scalar field with arbitrary conformal parameter, in the background of a given potential that depends on only one spatial coordinate. We regulate the expressions by incorporating a temporal-spatial cutoff in the (imaginary) time and transverse-spatial directions. The divergences are captured by the zeroth- and second-order WKB approximations. Then the stress tensor is "renormalized" by omitting the terms that depend on the cutoff. The ambiguities that inevitably arise in this procedure are both duly noted and restricted by imposing certain physical conditions; one result is that the renormalized stress tensor exhibits the expected trace anomaly. The renormalized stress tensor exhibits no pressure anomaly, in that the principle of virtual work is satisfied for motions in a transverse direction. We then consider a potential that defines a wall, a one-dimensional potential that vanishes for $z<0$ and rises like $z^\alpha$, $\alpha>0$, for $z>0$. The full finite stress tensor is computed numerically for the two cases where explicit solutions to the differential equation are available, $\alpha=1$ and 2. The energy density exhibits an inverse linear divergence as the boundary is approached from the inside for a linear potential, and a logarithmic divergence for a quadratic potential. Finally, the interaction between two such walls is computed, and it is shown that the attractive Casimir pressure between the two walls also satisfies the principle of virtual work (i.e., the pressure equals the negative derivative of the energy with respect to the distance between the walls).

abstract: We analyze the evolution of an entangled many-body state in a Josephson tunneling junction. A N00N state, which is a superposition of two complementary Fock states, appears in the evolution with sufficient probability only for a moderate many-body interaction on an intermediate time scale. This time scale is inversely proportional to the tunneling rate. Interaction between particles supports entanglement: The probability for creating an entangled state decays exponentially with the number of non-interacting particles, whereas it decays only like the inverse square root of the number of interacting particles.

abstract: Converting signals between different electromagnetic modes is an asset for future information technologies. In general, slightly asymmetric optical nanoantennas enable the coupling between bright and dark modes sustained by an optical nanoantenna. However, the conversion efficiency might be very low. Here, we show that the additional incorporation of a quantum emitter allows to tremendously enhance this efficiency. The enhanced local density of states cycles the quantum emitter between its upper and lower level at an extremely hight rate; hence converting the energy very efficient. The process is robust with respect to possible experimental tolerances and adds a new ingredient to be exploited while studying and applying coupling phenomena in optical nanosystems.

abstract: We determine the exact time evolution of an initial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state of ultra-cold atoms in a hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical evolution is triggered by ramping the lattice potential up, such that the interaction strength $U_f$ is much larger than the hopping amplitude $J_f$. The quench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\pi)$ in the momentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same frequency on the order parameter $\Delta$. The latter is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory. The momentum density-density or noise correlation functions oscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\pi$ as well as its second harmonic. For a very deep lattice, with negligible tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum occupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to dephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the oscillations. This occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS state, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. We therefore propose to use this dephasing to detect a BCS state. Finally, we predict that the noise correlation functions in a honeycomb lattice will develop strong anti-correlations near the Dirac point.

abstract: The simplest molecules in nature, molecular hydrogen ions in the form of H2+ and HD+, provide an important benchmark system for tests of quantum electrodynamics in complex forms of matter. Here, we report on such a test based on a frequency measurement of a vibrational overtone transition in HD+ by laser spectroscopy. We find that the theoretical and experimental frequencies are equal to within 0.6(1.1) parts per billion, which represents the most stringent test of molecular theory so far. Our measurement not only confirms the validity of high-order quantum electrodynamics in molecules, but also enables the long predicted determination of the proton-to-electron mass ratio from a molecular system, as well as improved constraints on hypothetical fifth forces and compactified higher dimensions at the molecular scale. With the perspective of comparisons between theory and experiment at the 0.01 part-per-billion level, our work demonstrates the potential of molecular hydrogen ions as a probe of fundamental physical constants and laws.

abstract: Spin defects in wide-band gap semiconductors are promising systems for the realization of quantum bits, or qubits, in solid-state environments. To date, defect qubits have only been realized in materials with strong covalent bonds. Here, we introduce a strain-driven scheme to rationally design defect spins in functional ionic crystals, which may operate as potential qubits. In particular, using a combination of state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations based on hybrid density functional and many-body perturbation theory, we predicted that the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in piezoelectric aluminum nitride exhibits spin-triplet ground states under realistic uni- and bi-axial strain conditions; such states may be harnessed for the realization of qubits. The strain-driven strategy adopted here can be readily extended to a wide range of point defects in other wide-band gap semiconductors, paving the way to controlling the spin properties of defects in ionic systems for potential spintronic technologies.

abstract: The ground state subspace of a topological phase of matter forms a representation of the mapping class group of the space on which the state is defined. We show that elements of the mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ can be obtained through a sequence of topological charge projections along at least three mutually intersecting non-contractible cycles. We demonstrate this both through the algebraic theory of anyons and also through an analysis of the topology of the space-time manifold. We combine this result with two observations: (i) that surfaces of genus $g$ can be effectively simulated in planar geometries by using bilayer, or doubled, versions of the topological phase of interest, and inducing the appropriate types of gapped boundaries; and (ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as adiabatic unitary transformations by locally tuning microscopic parameters of the system, such as the energy gap. These observations suggest a possible path towards effectively implementing modular transformations in physical systems. In particular, they also show how the $\text{Ising} \otimes \overline{\text{Ising}}$ state, in the presence of disconnected gapped boundaries, can support universal topological quantum computation.

abstract: We consider the propagation of several entangled photons through an elastically scattering medium and study statistical properties of their speckle patterns. We find the spatial correlations of multiphoton speckles and their sensitivity to changes of system parameters. Our analysis covers both the directed-wave regime, where rays propagate almost ballistically while experiencing small-angle diffusion, and the real-space diffusive regime. We demonstrate that long-range correlations of the speckle patterns dominate experimental signatures for large-aperture photon detectors. We also show that speckle sensitivity depends strongly on the number of photons $N$ in the incoming beam, increasing as $\sqrt{N}$ in the directed-wave regime and as $N$ in the diffusive regime.

abstract: Different from the spin-1 Haldane gapped phase, we propose a novel SO(3) spin-1 matrix product state (MPS), whose parent Hamiltonian includes three-site spin interactions. From the entanglement spectrum of a single block with $l$ sites, an enlarged SU(3) symmetry is identified in the edge states, which are conjugate to each other for the $l=even$ block but identical for the $l=odd$ block. By blocking this novel state, the blocked MPS explicitly displays the SU(3) symmetry with two distinct structures. Under a symmetric bulk bipartition with a sufficient large block length $% l=even$, the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) of the reduced system characterizes a spontaneous dimerized phase with two-fold degeneracy. However, for the block length $l=odd$, the corresponding EH represents an SU(3) quantum critical point with delocalized edge quasiparticles, and the critical field theory is described by the SU(3) level-1 Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory.

abstract: We mainly study real Klein-Gordon theory on Anti de Sitter spacetimes, and apply the General Boundary Formulation (GBF) of Quantum Theory in order to compute a radial S-matrix. We consider first the classical theory, giving a complete list of Klein-Gordon solutions and the actions of the isometries of AdS on them. We study two symplectic structures on spaces of such solutions, and show that they are invariant under all isometries' actions. We also calculate the flat limits of the involved quantities, and find that it reproduces the respective counterparts of the theory on Minkowski spacetime. We proceed applying Holomorphic Quantization, whose amplitudes are determined by an inner product which is induced by the symplectic structure together with a complex structure on the space of classical solutions. We construct this complex structure such that the inner product becomes positive-definite, and its induced amplitudes are invariant under time-translations and spatial rotations. Further, our complex structure makes these radial amplitudes agree with the amplitudes of states on equal-time hypersurfaces, and also reproduce the amplitudes of the theory on Minkowski spacetime in the flat limit. (There is also a more detailed summary at the beginning of the document.)

abstract: We analyze the properties of entangled random pure states of a quantum system partitioned into two smaller subsystems of dimensions $N$ and $M$. Framing the problem in terms of random matrices with a fixed-trace constraint, we establish, for arbitrary $N \leq M$, a general relation between the $n$-point densities and the cross-moments of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, i.e. the so-called Schmidt eigenvalues, and the analogous functionals of the eigenvalues of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of the random matrix theory. This allows us to derive explicit expressions for two-level densities, and also an exact expression for the variance of von Neumann entropy at finite $N,M$. Then we focus on the moments $\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ of the Schmidt number $K$, the reciprocal of the purity. This is a random variable supported on $[1,N]$, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom effectively contributing to the entanglement. We derive a wealth of analytical results for $\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ for $N = 2$ and $N=3$ and arbitrary $M$, and also for square $N = M$ systems by spotting for the latter a connection with the probability $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ that the smallest eigenvalue $x_{min}^{GUE}$ of a $N\times N$ matrix belonging to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble is larger than $\sqrt{2N}\xi$. As a byproduct, we present an exact asymptotic expansion for $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ for finite $N$ as $\xi \to \infty$. Our results are corroborated by numerical simulations whenever possible, with excellent agreement.

abstract: A metamaterial formed by superconducting circuits or quantum dots can serve as active lasing medium when coupled to a microwave resonator. For these artificial atoms, in contrast to real atoms, variations in their parameters cannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such a multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a self-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The reason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to resonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms. Not only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the width of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are found for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual coupling. We present relations how the allowed disorder scales with the number of atoms and confirm it by a numerical analysis. We also provide estimates for the sample-to-sample variations to be expected for setups with moderate numbers of atoms.

abstract: Today's science provides quite a lean picture of time as a mere geometric evolution parameter. I argue that time is much richer. In particular, I argue that besides the geometric time, there is creative time, when objective chance events happen. The existence of the latter follows straight from the existence of free-will. Following the french philosopher Lequyer, I argue that free-will is a prerequisite for the possibility to have rational argumentations, hence can't be denied. Consequently, science can't deny the existence of creative time and thus that time really passes.

abstract: We investigate the evolution of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral lineshapes in an optically-thick helium gas under near-infrared (IR) perturbation. In our experimental and theoretical work, we systematically vary the IR intensity, time-delay, gas density and IR polarization parameters to study lineshape modifications induced by collective interactions, in a regime beyond the single atom response of a thin, dilute gas. In both experiment and theory, we find that specific features in the frequency-domain absorption profile, and their evolution with propagation distance, can be attributed to the interplay between resonant attosecond pulse propagation and IR induced phase shifts. Our calculations show that this interplay also manifests itself in the time domain, with the IR pulse influencing the reshaping of the XUV pulse propagating in the resonant medium.

To obtain reliable error syndromes using imperfect physical circuits, we propose the idea of quantum data-syndrome (DS) codes that are capable of correcting both data qubits and syndrome bits errors. We study fundamental properties of quantum DS codes and provide several CSS-type code constructions of quantum DS codes.

abstract: Recent advance in quantum simulations of interacting photons using superconducting circuits offers opportunities for investigating the Bose-Hubbard model in various geometries with hopping coefficients and self-interactions tuned to both signs. Here we investigate phenomena related to localized states associated with a flat-band supported by the saw-tooth geometry. A localization-delocalization transition emerges in the non-interacting regime as the sign of hopping coefficient is changed. In the presence of interactions, patterns of localized states approach a uniform density distribution for repulsive interactions while interesting localized density patterns can arise in strongly attractive regime. The density patterns indicate the underlying inhomogeneity of the simulator. Two-particle correlations can further distinguish the nature of the localized states in attractive and repulsive interaction regimes. We also survey possible experimental implementations of the simulator.

abstract: We propose a scheme to realize a highly efficient solid state source of photon pairs using cavity-assisted stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in a single quantum dot, where a single photon from pump pulse and two stokes photons from cavity mode drives the Raman transition. The Autler-Townes doublet, generated by using a resonant continuous wave laser between biexciton and exciton states, and two-photon-resonant transition through strongly coupled cavity mode are utilized to facilitate (1+2)type Raman transition in the quantum dot. We show in the case of weak pump although the probability of generating two photons in cavity mode is small without cavity damping but two-photon-resonant emission is enhanced by cavity damping within strong coupling regime. We also discuss spectrum of the generated photon pair and photon-photon correlations in the generated photon pair. The efficiency of two photon source could be more than 80\% in current experimental conditions.

abstract: We investigate a novel hybrid system of a superconducting charge qubit interacting directly with a single neutral atom via electric dipole coupling. Interfacing of the macroscopic superconducting circuit with the microscopic atomic system is accomplished by varying the gate capacitance of the charge qubit. To achieve strong interaction, we employ two Rydberg states with an electric-dipole-allowed transition, which alters the polarizability of the dielectric medium of the gate capacitor. Sweeping the gate voltage with different rates leads to a precise control of hybrid quantum states. Furthermore, we show a possible implementation of a universal two-qubit gate.

abstract: Since the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis, living systems have developed protective mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. During charge separation in photosynthetic reaction centres, triplet states can react with molecular oxygen generating destructive singlet oxygen. The triplet product yield in bacteria is observed to be reduced by weak magnetic fields. Reaction centres from plants' photosystem II share many features with bacterial reaction centres, including a high-spin iron whose function has remained obscure. To explain observations that the magnetic field effect is reduced by the iron, we propose that its fast-relaxing spin plays a protective role in photosynthesis by generating an effective magnetic field. We consider a simple model of the system, derive an analytical expression for the effective magnetic field and analyse the resulting triplet yield reduction. The protective mechanism is robust for realistic parameter ranges, constituting a clear example of a quantum effect playing a macroscopic role vital for life.

An inclusion not only of acoustic phonons but also of optical phonons and of specific properties of the excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ like the central-cell corrections for the $1S$-exciton allows us to calculate the experimentally observed line widths in experiments by T. Kazimierczuk et al [Nature 514, 343, (2014)] within the same order of magnitude, which demonstrates a clear improvement in comparison to earlier work on this topic. We also discuss a variety of further effects, which explain the still observable discrepancy between theory and experiment but can hardly be included in theoretical calculations.

abstract: Artificially engineered light-matter systems constitute a novel, versatile architecture for the quantum simulation of driven, dissipative phase transitions and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. Here, we review recent experimental as well as theoretical works on the simulation of geometrical frustration in interacting photonic systems out of equilibrium. In particular, we discuss two recent discoveries at the interface of quantum optics and condensed matter physics: (i) the experimental achievement of bosonic condensation into a flat energy band and (ii) the theoretical prediction of crystalline phases of light in a frustrated qubit-cavity array. We show that this new line of research leads to novel and unique tools for the experimental investigation of frustrated systems and holds the potential to create new phases of light and matter with interesting spatial structure.

abstract: Many-body correlations and macroscopic quantum behaviors are fascinating condensed matter problems. A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and methods is the Kondo model which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to a continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems and can be explored with tunable nanostructures. Although Kondo physics is usually associated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic magnetic moments, theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum states are coupled to a continuum. Here we demonstrate the previously elusive `charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a single-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin-1/2 constituted by two degenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island. In contrast to other Kondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an electrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel, thereby providing an unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear path to multi-channel Kondo physics. Using a weakly coupled probe, we reveal the renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels competing to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how the predicted quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum critical point. Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate, on a fully characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions for the finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality.

abstract: A parametric modification of the dynamical transition from steady-state to limit circles and to chaos by the quadratic coupling in optomechanical system is investigated. Under a weak pumping field, the mechanical resonator damps to a steady state with a controllable nonlinear property, and then, when the driving power reaches a critical threshold, the steady state looses its stability and locks on a limit-circle oscillation (self-oscillation) with an increasing and jumping amplitude. Along with an increase of the driving power, the period-doubling bifurcations to chaos followed by the inversion bifurcations back to limit circles are found and verified by the numerical calculation of their maximal Lyapunov Exponents. Our study shows that the structure of bifurcation and inverse bifurcation can be easily modified by a weak shift of quadratic coupling, and the dynamical transitions between self-oscillation and chaos can easily be traced or detected by the power spectrum of the cavity field.

abstract: In this paper we present an extensive and detailed experimental assessment of the performance of homodyne detection vs direct detection for determining the flux of an incoherent light source. The intensity of a laser reference signal is measured, before and after contamination by photon bunching noise (transimpedance gain of 20k), simultaneously. Moreover, the measurement containing photon bunching noise was done using two schemes: direct and homodyne detection, also with no appreciable time delay. The sampling rate of all measurements is the same, and is always higher than the frequency limit of the bunching noise. By carefully comparing the resulting three time series, it is found, surprisingly, that the homodyne detection of the incoherent signal resembles more closely the variance and variability pattern of the original coherent signal, and the effect is most prominent at the highest sampling frequency. It therefore appears flux estimates made using the shot noise of the field were able to overcome the Nyquist theorem, viz. by combining the homodyne technique with sampling at a rate faster than the bunching noise fluctuations it is possible to surpass the sensitivity limit of the radiometer equation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a detailed analysis of shot noise fluctuations has been investigated experimentally. Although a full theoretical understanding is still lacking, the experiments appear to show an unambiguous effect that requires further investigation.

abstract: We investigate $N$ identical two-level systems that are collectively coupled to two thermal reservoirs and therefore behave as a single large spin. The coupling with one reservoir implements the usual Dicke superradiance setup. By contrast, the coupling with the other reservoir is of the pure dephasing type. To describe also the strong-coupling limit with the dephasing reservoir, we apply a reaction-coordinate mapping, which leads to a decomposition of the dephasing reservoir into a single collective degree of freedom, and residual oscillators. After the mapping, the large spin is coupled to the reaction coordinate with the original pure-dephasing interaction, but the reaction coordinate is dissipatively coupled to the residual oscillators. We first derive the quantum-optical master equation for the large spin and the reaction coordinate. To obtain a convenient representation as a rate equation, we switch to the energy eigenbasis of the large spin and the reaction coordinate by using a polaron transformation. Assuming fast relaxation of the reaction coordinate, we then derive a coarse-grained rate equation for the large spin only and discuss how the original Dicke superradiance is affected by the presence of the additional reservoir. Our main finding is a cooperatively enhanced rectification effect due to the interplay of supertransmittant heat currents (scaling quadratically with $N$) and the asymmetric coupling to both reservoirs. For large $N$, the system can thus significantly amplify current asymmetries under bias reversal, functioning as a heat diode.

abstract: This work investigates in which form quantities with Planck dimensions occur already in the common quantum theory with local Lorentz symmetry. Since such Planck quantities as Planck length or Planck mass involve the Planck constant h, the velocity of light c and the Newton gravitational constant G, the relativistic Dirac equation (h, c) in the Newtonian gravitational potential (G) can be considered as a test theory. The evaluation of the break-off condition of the power series of the radial energy eigenfunctions of a purely gravitational atom leads to exact terms for the energy eigenvalues E for various special cases of the quantum numbers N, k and n = N + |k|. It turns out that a meaningful atom model, based solely on Newtonian gravitational forces, can result if, inter alia, the test mass m in the gravitational field of the mass M is selected to be smaller than the Planck mass.

abstract: We investigate the interplay of localization, interactions and (pseudo)spin degrees of freedom on quantum states of particles on the lattice. Our results show that breaking the paradigm density-density interaction $U_0\gg$ (pseudo)spin-(pseudo)spin interaction $U_s$ will drive the sequence of quantum phase transitions (QPT), where (pseudo)spin state and particle ordering, in case of several particle species, on the lattice are strongly changed. QPT driven by competing interactions, $|U_s|\sim U_0$, manifest itself in singularities of effective exchange integrals. $|U_s|\sim U_0$ implies a frustration when the interactions standing alone drive the system to different phases. Even at $U_s=0$, there is typically a QPT induced by $U_s$ sign change. Vector cold atoms, Fermions or Bosons, on optical lattices are the state-of-the-art realization of our system where $U_s$ is tunable \textit{in situ}.

This builds on a body of work regarding the probing of systems by measuring the dephasing of an immersed qubit. We show this dephasing is captured by a function resembling characteristic functions of probability theory, of which the derivatives at short times reveal moments of the system operator to which the qubit couples. For a qubit formed by an impurity atom, in a system of ultracold atoms, this operator can be the density of the system at the location of the impurity, and thus, means, variances, and correlations of the atomic densities are accessible.

abstract: We develop a concept of traveling-wave Josephson parametric amplifier based on a ladder-type superconducting transmission line containing serial array of one-junctions SQUIDs. The circuit operates in a three-wave mixing mode and exploits both quadratic and cubic (Kerr) nonlinearities in the current-phase relation of the SQUIDs controlled by external magnetic flux. These two types of nonlinearities allow efficient three-wave mixing and perfect phase matching, respectively. The transmission line exhibits a power gain with exponential dependence on its length (number of cells $N$) in the widest frequency range, $0 \lesssim f_s, f_i \lesssim f_p$, where $f_s$, $f_i$ and $f_p$ are the signal, idler and pump frequencies, respectively, obeying relation $f_s + f_i = f_p$. Estimation of the amplifier characteristics with typical experimental parameters, number of cells $N$ = 700, length of 28 mm and pump frequency of 12.5 GHz yields a flat (-3 dB) gain of about 20 dB in the bandwidth from 3.35 GHz to 9.15 GHz and a saturation power of -90 dBm.

abstract: The relativistic acceleration of an electron in a uniform gravitational field is calculated numerically using the generalization of the Dirac equation to curved spacetime. Equivalent results are also obtained analytically using an iterative approach that is not based on the WKB approximation, which has been used extensively in the past. The acceleration is found to be proportional to a factor of $(1-3v^2/c^2)$ using Schwarzschild coordinates, which is consistent with the classical geodesic of a particle. These techniques may be useful in resolving the differences between commonly-used approximations.

The key property of the states we consider is that the ground state wavefunction is related to the statistical weight of a local statistical model. We give several examples of our construction in the context of Ising magnetism.

abstract: We numerically study the quantum phase transitions and the stability of Majorana zero modes in a generalized Kitaev model in one dimension when the chemical potential is periodically modulating in space. To characterize the ground-state phases, we use exact diagonalization to calculate the entanglement spectrum (ES) and the string correlation functions for open boundary condition. When we vary the phase of the modulation, the number of the Majorana zero modes changes, which manifests itself in the degeneracy of the lowest level of the ES. Next, we study the quantum phase transitions driven by the change in the amplitude of the modulation. In particular, for certain values of the wave number and the phase of the modulation, we observe a quantum phase transition from one topological phase into another having only one zero mode. We also show a case where the degeneracy of the ES does not change even for large enough amplitude of the modulation. Finally, we characterize the phases of the system with periodic boundary condition by the topological invariant, which reflects the number of the zero-energy excitations.

abstract: We report multistate optical switching among high-order bouncing-ball modes ("ripples") and whispering-gallerying modes ("petals") of exciton-polariton condensates in a laser-generated annular trap. By tailoring the diameter and power of the annular trap, the polariton condensate can be switched among different trapped modes, accompanied by redistribution of spatial densities and superlinear increase in the emission intensities, implying that polariton condensates in this geometry could be exploited for a multistate switch. A model based on non-Hermitian modes of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveals that this mode switching arises from competition between pump-induced gain and in-plane polariton loss. The parameters for reproducible switching among trapped modes have been measured experimentally, giving us a phase diagram for mode switching. Taken together, the experimental result and theoretical modeling advances our fundamental understanding of the spontaneous emergence of coherence and move us toward its practical exploitation.

abstract: We demonstrate a source of correlated photon pairs which will have applications in future integrated quantum photonic circuits. The source utilizes spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a dispersion-engineered nanowaveguide made of AlGaAs, which has merits of negligible two-photon absorption and low spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS). We observe a coincidence-to-accidental (CAR) ratio up to 177, mainly limited by propagation losses. Experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions of the SFWM photon pair generation and the SpRS noise photon generation. We also study the effects from the SpRS, propagation losses, and waveguide lengths on the quality of our source.

abstract: We study the inverse problem of constructing an appropriate Hamiltonian from a physically reasonable set of orthogonal wave functions for a quantum spin system. Usually, we are given a local Hamiltonian and try to characterize the relevant wave functions and energies (the spectrum) of the system. Here, we take the opposite approach; starting from a collection of orthogonal wave functions, our goal is to characterize the associated parent Hamiltonian, to see how the wave functions and the energy values determine the structure of the parent Hamiltonian. Specifically, we obtain (quasi) local Hamiltonians by a complete set of (multilayer) product states and a local mapping of the energy values to the wave functions. On the other hand, a complete set of tree wave functions (having a tree structure) results to nonlocal Hamiltonians and operators which flip simultaneously all the spins in a single branch of the tree graph. We observe that even for a given set of wave functions, the energy spectrum can significantly change the nature of interactions in the Hamiltonian. These effects can be exploited in a quantum engineering problem optimizing an objective functional of the Hamiltonian.

abstract: We consider the model of a single optical cavity mode interacting with two-level systems driven by a linearly time-dependent field. When this field passes through values at which spin energy level splittings become comparable to their coupling to the optical mode, a cascade of Landau-Zener transitions leads to co-flips of spins in exchange for photons of the cavity. We derive exact transition probabilities between different diabatic states induced by such a sweep of the field.

abstract: Coherent spatial transport or shuttling of a single electron spin through semiconductor nanostructures is an important ingredient in many spintronic and quantum computing applications. In this work we analyze the possible errors in solid-state quantum computation due to leakage in transporting a single-spin qubit through a semiconductor double quantum dot. In particular, we consider three possible sources of leakage errors associated with such transport: finite ramping times, spin-dependent tunneling rates between quantum dots induced by finite spin-orbit couplings, and the presence of multiple valley states. In each case we present quantitative estimates of the leakage errors, and discuss how they can be minimized. Moreover, we show that in order to minimize leakage errors induced by spin-dependent tunnelings, it is necessary to apply pulses to perform certain carefully designed spin rotations. We further develop a formalism that allows one to systematically derive constraints on the pulse shapes and present a few examples to highlight the advantage of such an approach.

abstract: Full general relativity is almost certainly non-integrable and likely chaotic and therefore almost certainly possesses neither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows that the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include non-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot carry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization. This has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we investigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that fails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on standard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any solutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is to refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes continuous. In the toy model it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type topology, as e.g. used in loop quantum cosmology, is sufficient. Basing quantization of the toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac observables and a suitable semiclassical limit.

abstract: We simulate the dissipative evolution of a vortex in a trapped finite-temperature dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensate using first-principles open-systems theory. Simulations of the complete stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a partially condensed Bose gas containing a single quantum vortex show that the transfer of condensate energy to the incoherent thermal component without population transfer provides an important channel for vortex decay. For the lower temperatures considered, this effect is significantly larger that the population transfer process underpinning the standard theory of vortex decay, and is the dominant determinant of the vortex lifetime. A comparison with the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin kinetic (two-fluid) theory further elucidates the role of the particle transfer interaction, and suggests the need for experimental testing of reservoir interaction theory. The dominance of this particular energetic decay mechanism for this open quantum system should be testable with current experimental setups, and its observation would have broad implications for the dynamics of atomic matter waves and experimental studies of dissipative phenomena.

abstract: By driving a 3D transmon with microwave fields, we generate an effective avoided energy-level crossing. Then we chirp microwave frequency, which is equivalent to driving the system through the avoided energy-level crossing by sweeping the avoided crossing. A double-passage chirp produces Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana interference that agree well with the numerical results. Our method is fully applicable to other quantum systems that contain no intrinsic avoided level crossing, providing an alternative approach for quantum control and quantum simulation.

abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) hosting optically active defects are an important technical material for applications in quantum sensing, biological imaging, and quantum optics. The negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) defect is known to fluoresce in molecular sized NDs (1 to 6 nm) and its spectral properties depend on the quality of the surrounding host lattice. This defect is therefore a good probe to investigate the material properties of small NDs. Here we report unprecedented narrow optical transitions for SiV colour centers hosted in nanodiamonds produced using a novel high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique. The SiV zero-phonon lines were measured to have an inhomogeneous distribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K across a sample of numerous NDs. Individual spectral lines as narrow as 354 MHz were measured for SiV centres in nanodiamonds smaller than 200 nm, which is four times narrower than the best SiV line previously reported for nanodiamonds. Correcting for apparent spectral diffusion yielded a homogeneous linewith of about 200 MHz, which is close to the width limit imposed by the radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate that the direct HPHT synthesis technique is capable of producing nanodiamonds with high crystal lattice quality, which are therefore a valuable technical material.

abstract: One of the major computational bottlenecks in one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional theory is the evaluation of approximate 1RDM functionals and their derivatives. The reason is that more advanced approximate functionals are almost exclusively defined in the natural orbital basis, so a 4-index transformation of the two-electron integrals appears to be unavoidable. I will show that this is not the case and that so-called separable functionals can be evaluated much more efficiently, i.e. only at cubic cost in the basis size. Since most approximate functionals are actually separable, this new algorithm is an important development to make 1RDM functional theory calculations feasible for large electronic systems.

abstract: Thermal noise generally greatly exceeds quantum noise in optomechanical devices unless the mechanical frequency is very high or the thermodynamic temperature is very low. This paper addresses the design concept for a novel optomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the audio frequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror Sloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a Membrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation pressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that practical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz, could achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring stiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 $\mu$g or less could achieve a Q-factor of $10^{11}$ at a frequency of 100 kHz. Applications for such devices include white light cavities for improvement of gravitational wave detectors, or sensors able to operate near the quantum limit.

abstract: Gate control of donor electrons near interfaces is a generic ingredient of donor-based quantum computing. Here, we address the question: how is the phonon-assisted qubit relaxation time $T_1$ affected as the electron is shuttled between the donor and the interface? We focus on the example of the `flip-flop qubit' [Tosi et al., arXiv:1509.08538v1], defined as a combination of the nuclear and electronic states of a phosphorous donor in silicon, promising fast electrical control and long dephasing times when the electron is halfway between the donor and the interface. We theoretically describe orbital relaxation, flip-flop relaxation, and electron spin relaxation. We estimate that the flip-flop qubit relaxation time can be of the order of $100 \, \mu\text{s}$, 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the value for an on-donor electron in bulk silicon, and a few orders of magnitude shorter (longer) than the predicted inhomogeneous dephasing time (gate times). All three relaxation processes are boosted by (i) the nontrivial valley structure of the electron-phonon interaction, and (ii) the different valley compositions of the involved electronic states.

abstract: The many-body problem is ubiquitous in the theoretical description of physical phenomena, ranging from the behavior of elementary particles to the physics of electrons in solids. Most of our understanding of many-body systems comes from analyzing the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian and states: the most striking example are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of systems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several approaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge theories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation platforms have been put forward for the realization of synthetic gauge theories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum information concepts have been formulated. In this review we present an introduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and highlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and report the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.

abstract: We study a model for quantum lightcone fluctuations in which vacuum fluctuations of the electric field and of the squared electric field in a nonlinear dielectric material produce variations in the flight times of probe pulses. When this material has a non-zero third order polarizability, the flight time variations arise from squared electric field fluctuations, and are analogous to effects expected when the stress tensor of a quantized field drives passive spacetime geometry fluctuations. We also discuss the dependence of the squared electric field fluctuations upon the geometry of the material, which in turn determines a sampling function for averaging the squared electric field along the path of the pulse. This allows us to estimate the probability of especially large fluctuations, which is a measure of the probability distribution for quantum stress tensor fluctuations.

abstract: The geometry and topology of quantum systems have deep connections to quantum dynamics. In this paper, I show how to measure the non-Abelian Berry curvature and its related topological invariant, the second Chern number, using dynamical techniques. The second Chern number is the defining topological characteristic of the four-dimensional generalization of the quantum Hall effect and has relevance in systems from three-dimensional topological insulators to Yang-Mills field theory. I illustrate its measurement using the simple example of a spin-3/2 particle in an electric quadrupole field. I show how one can dynamically measure diagonal components of the Berry curvature in an over-complete basis of the degenerate ground state space and use this to extract the full non-Abelian Berry curvature. I also show that one can accomplish the same ideas by stochastically averaging over random initial states in the degenerate ground state manifold. Finally I show how this system can be manufactured and the topological invariant measured in a variety of realistic systems, from superconducting qubits to trapped ions and cold atoms.

abstract: The coupled quantum dynamics of excitonic and vibrational degrees of freedom is investigated for high-dimensional models of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. This includes a seven and an eight-site model with 518 and 592 harmonic vibrational modes, respectively. The coupling between local electronic transitions and vibrations is described within the Huang-Rhys model using parameters that are obtained by discretization of an experimental spectral density. Different pathways of excitation energy flow are analyzed in terms of the reduced one-exciton density matrix, focussing on the role of vibrational and vibronic excitation. Distinct features due to both competing time scales of vibrational and exciton motion and vibronically-assisted transfer are observed. The question of the effect of initial state preparation is addressed by comparing the case of an instantaneous Franck-Condon excitation at a single site with that of a laser field excitation.

abstract: In quantum field theory, the vacuum is a fluctuating medium which behaves as a nonlinear polarizable material. In this article, we perform the first rigorous derivation of the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg effective energy, a nonlinear functional that describes the effective fluctuations of the quantum vacuum in a classical magnetic field. We start from a classical magnetic field in interaction with a quan-tized Dirac field in its ground state, and we study a limit in which the classical magnetic field is slowly varying. After a change of scales, this is equivalent to a semi-classical limit $\hbar\to0$, with a strong magnetic field of order $1/\hbar$. In this regime, we prove that the energy of Dirac's polarized vacuum converges to the Euler-Heisenberg functional. The model has ultraviolet divergences, which we regularize using the Pauli-Villars method. We also discuss how to remove the regularization of the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, using charge renormaliza-tion, perturbatively to any order of the coupling constant.

abstract: It is shown that all of the basic properties of the hydrogen atom can be consistently described in terms of classical electrodynamics instead of taking the electron to be a particle; we consider an electrically charged classical wave field, an "electron wave", which is held in a limited region of space by the electrostatic field of the proton. It is shown that quantum mechanics must be considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in the spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with difficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the spontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually derived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. It is shown that there are no discrete states and discrete energy levels of the atom: the energy of the atom and its states change continuously. An explanation of the conventional corpuscular-statistical interpretation of atomic phenomena is given. It is shown that this explanation is only a misinterpretation of continuous deterministic processes. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is obtained, which accounts for the inverse action of self-electromagnetic radiation of the electron wave and completely describes the spontaneous emissions of an atom.

abstract: The Interaction Enhanced Imaging technique allows to detect the spatial distribution of strongly interacting impurities embedded within a gas of background atoms used as a contrast medium. Here we present a detailed study of this technique, applied to detect Rydberg $P$ states. We experimentally realize fast and efficient three-photon excitation of $P$ states, optimized according to the results of a theoretical effective two-level model. Few Rydberg $P$-state atoms, prepared in a small cloud with dimensions comparable to the blockade radius, are detected with a good sensitivity by averaging over 50 shots. The main aspects of the technique are described with a hard-sphere model, finding good agreement with experimental data. This work paves the way to a non-destructive optical detection of single Rydberg atoms with high spatial and temporal resolution.

abstract: The limited connectivity of current and next-generation quantum annealers motivates the need for efficient graph-minor embedding methods. These methods allow non-native problems to be adapted to the target annealer's architecture. The overhead of the widely used heuristic techniques is quickly proving to be a significant bottleneck for solving real-world applications. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a systematic and deterministic embedding method, exploiting the structures of both the input graph of the specific problem and the quantum annealer. We focus on the specific case of the Cartesian product of two complete graphs, a regular structure that occurs in many problems. We divide the embedding problem by first embedding one of the factors of the Cartesian product in a repeatable pattern. The resulting simplified problem consists of the placement and connecting together of these copies to reach a valid solution. Aside from the obvious advantage of a systematic and deterministic approach with respect to speed and efficiency, the embeddings produced are easily scaled for larger processors and show desirable properties for the number of qubits used and the chain length distribution. To conclude, we briefly address the problem of circumventing inoperable qubits by presenting possible extensions of the method.

Then, the formalism developed here is applied to the stochastic dynamics of stock price in finance.

abstract: The recently demonstrated electroluminescence of color centers in diamond makes them one of the best candidates for room temperature single-photon sources. However, the reported emission rates are far off what can be achieved by state-of-the-art electrically driven epitaxial quantum dots. Since the electroluminescence mechanism has not yet been elucidated, it is not clear to what extent the emission rate can be increased. Here we develop a theoretical framework to study single-photon emission from color centers in diamond under electrical pumping. The proposed model comprises electron and hole trapping and releasing, transitions between the ground and excited states of the color center as well as structural transformations of the center due to carrier trapping. It provides the possibility to predict both the photon emission rate and the wavelength of emitted photons. Self-consistent numerical simulations of the single-photon emitting diode based on the proposed model show that the photon emission rate can be as high as 100 kcounts s$^{-1}$ at standard conditions. In contrast to most optoelectronic devices, the emission rate steadily increases with the device temperature achieving of more than 100 Mcount s$^{-1}$ at 500 K, which is highly advantageous for practical applications. These results demonstrate the potential of color centers in diamond as electrically driven non-classical light emitters and provide a foundation for the design and development of single-photon sources for optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks operating at room and higher temperatures.

abstract: We consider topological phases in periodically driven (Floquet) systems exhibiting many-body localization, protected by a symmetry $G$. We argue for a general correspondence between such phases and topological phases of undriven systems protected by symmetry $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G$, where the additional $\mathbb{Z}$ accounts for the discrete time translation symmetry. Thus, for example, the bosonic phases in $d$ spatial dimensions without intrinsic topological order (SPT phases) are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G, \mathrm{U}(1))$. For unitary symmetries, we interpret the additional resulting Floquet phases in terms of the lower-dimensional SPT phases that are pumped to the boundary during one time step. These results also imply the existence of novel symmetry-enriched topological (SET) orders protected solely by the periodicity of the drive.

abstract: We investigate the potential to probe physics beyond the Standard Model with isotope shift measurements of optical atomic clock transitions. We first derive the reach for generic new physics above the GeV scale at the effective field theory level, as well as estimate the limits on possible new spin-independent forces mediated by sub-GeV states coupled to electrons and neutrons. We also study the weak force and show that isotope shifts could provide strong constraints on the $Z^0$ couplings to valence quarks, which complement precision observables at LEP and atomic parity violation experiments. Finally, motivated by recent experimental hints of a new 750 GeV resonance in diphotons, we also consider the potential to probe its parity-preserving couplings to electrons, quarks and gluons with this method. In particular, combining the diphoton signal with indirect constraints from $g_e-2$ and isotope shifts in Ytterbium allows to probe the resonance coupling to electrons with unprecedented precision.

abstract: We present a Fermi golden rule giving rates of decay of states obtained by perturbing embedded eigenvalues of a quantum graph. To illustrate the procedure in a notationally simpler setting we also present a Fermi Golden Rule for boundary value problems on surfaces with constant curvature cusps. We also provide a resonance existence result which is uniform on compact sets of energies and metric graphs. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic-crystal nanostructures have been the subject of intense study. In this context, quantum dots are often considered to be simple two-level emitters, i.e., the complexities arising from the internal finestructure are neglected. We show that due to the intricate spatial variations of the electric field polarization found in photonic crystal, the two orthogonal finestructure states of quantum dots in general both couple significantly to a cavity mode, implying that the two-level description is not sufficient. As a consequence the emission dynamics and spectra, which are often recorded in experiments, are modified both in the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. The proposed effects are found to be significant for system parameters of current state-of-the-art photonic-crystal cavities.

abstract: In 1999 Raz demonstrated a partial function that had an efficient quantum two-way communication protocol but no efficient classical two-way protocol and asked, whether there existed a function with an efficient quantum one-way protocol, but still no efficient classical two-way protocol. In 2010 Klartag and Regev demonstrated such a function and asked, whether there existed a function with an efficient quantum simultaneous-messages protocol, but still no efficient classical two-way protocol. In this work we answer the latter question affirmatively and present a partial function Shape, which can be computed by a protocol sending entangled simultaneous messages of poly-logarithmic size, and whose classical two-way complexity is lower bounded by a polynomial.

abstract: We study the late-time relaxation following a quench in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system. We consider the open Dicke model, describing the infinite-range interactions between $N$ atoms and a single, lossy electromagnetic mode. We show that the dynamical phase transition at a critical atom-light coupling is characterized by the interplay between reservoir-driven and intrinsic relaxation processes. Above the critical coupling, small fluctuations in the occupation of the dominant quasi-particle-mode start to grow in time while the quasi-particle lifetime remains finite due to losses. Near the critical interaction strength we observe a crossover between exponential and power-law $1/\tau$ relaxation, the latter driven by collisions between quasi-particles. For a quench exactly to the critical coupling, the power-law relaxation extends to infinite times, but the finite lifetime of quasi-particles prevents ageing to appear. We predict our results to be accessible to quench experiments with ultracold bosons in optical resonators.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of single-qubit operations by oscillatory fields on various semiconductor platforms. We explicitly show how to perform faster gate operations by going beyond the universally-used rotating wave approximation (RWA) regime, while using only two sinusoidal pulses. No complicated pulse shaping or optimal control sequences are required. We first show for specific published experiments how much error is currently incurred by implementing pulses designed using standard RWA. We then show that an even modest increase in gate speed would cause problems in using RWA for gate design in the singlet-triplet (ST) and resonant-exchange (RX) qubits. We discuss the extent to which analytically keeping higher orders in the perturbation theory would address the problem. More strikingly, we give a new prescription for gating with strong coupling far beyond the RWA regime. We perform numerical calculations for the phases and the durations of two consecutive pulses to realize the key Hadamard and $\frac{\pi}{8}$ gates with coupling strengths up to several times the qubit splitting. Working in this manifestly non-RWA regime, the gate operation speeds up by two to three orders of magnitude.

abstract: In this paper we propose an extended Kundu-Eckhaus equation (KEE) for modeling the dynamics of skewed rogue waves emerging in the vicinity of a wave blocking point due to opposing current. The equation we propose is a KEE with an additional potential term therefore the results presented in this paper can easily be generalized to study the quantum tunneling properties of the rogue waves and ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses of the KEE. In the frame of the extended KEE, we numerically show that the chaotic perturbations of the ocean current trigger the occurrence of the rogue waves on the ocean surface. We propose and implement a split-step scheme and show that the extended KEE that we propose is unstable against random chaotic perturbations in the current profile. These perturbations transform the monochromatic wave field into a chaotic sea state with many peaks. We numerically show that the shapes of rogue waves due to perturbations in the current profile closely follow the form of rational rogue wave solutions, especially for the central peak. We also discuss the effects of magnitude of the chaotic current perturbations on the statistics of the rogue wave occurrence.

abstract: We study the energy transport in a system of two half-infinite XXZ chains initially kept separated at different temperatures, and later connected and let free to evolve unitarily. By changing independently the parameters of the two halves, we highlight, through bosonisation and time-dependent matrix-product-state simulations, the different contributions of low-lying bosonic modes and of fermionic quasi-particles to the energy transport. In the simulations we also observe that the energy current reaches a finite value which only slowly decays to zero. The general pictures that emerges is the following. Since integrability is only locally broken in this model, a pre-equilibration behaviour may appear. In particular, when the sound velocities of the bosonic modes of the two halves match, the low-temperature energy current is almost stationary and described by a formula with a non-universal prefactor interpreted as a transmission coefficient. Thermalisation, characterized by the absence of any energy flow, occurs only on longer time-scales which are not accessible with our numerics.

abstract: We study the propagation of a hole in degenerate (paramagnetic) spin environments. This canonical problem has important connections to a number of physical systems, and is perfectly suited for experimental realization with ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice. At the short-to-intermediate timescale that we can access using a stochastic-series-type numeric scheme, the propagation turns out to be distinctly non-diffusive with the proba- bility distribution featuring minima in both space and time due to quantum interference, yet the motion is not ballistic, except at the beginning. We discuss possible scenarios for long-term evolution that could be explored with an unprecedented degree of detail in experiments with single-atom resolved imaging.

First, we present efficient simulations of probabilistic and quantum automata by means of affine automata which allows us to characterized the class of exclusive stochastic languages. Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state numbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded.

abstract: We investigate confinement-induced resonances in a system composed by a tightly trapped ion and a moving atom in a waveguide. We determine the conditions for the appearance of such resonances in a broad region -- from the "long-wavelength" limit to the opposite case when the typical length scale of the atom-ion interaction essentially exceeds the transverse waveguide width. We find considerable dependence of the resonance position on the atomic mass which, however, disappears in the "long-wavelength" limit, where the result for the confined atom-atom scattering is reproduced. We also derive an analytic formula for the resonance position in the "long-wavelength zero-energy" limit. Our results, which can be investigated in current experiments, indicate a strategy to determine the atom-ion scattering length, the temperature of the atomic ensemble in the presence of an ion impurity, and a pathway to control the atom-phonon coupling in a one dimensional ion crystal in interaction with an atomic quantum gas.

abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetric systems have two distinguished phases, e.g., one with real energy eigenvalues and the other with complex conjugate eigenvalues. To enter one phase from the other, it is believed that the system must pass through an exceptional point, which is a non-Hermitian degenerate point with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this letter we reveal an anomalous PT transition that takes place away from an exceptional point in a nonlinear system: as the nonlinearity increases, the original linear system evolves along two distinct PT-symmetric trajectories, each of which can have an exceptional point. However, the two trajectories collide and vanish away from these exceptional points, after which the system is left with a PT-broken phase. We first illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify it using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.

abstract: We put forward and prove a simple theorem stating that the eigenvalues of a tridiagonal matrix change their sign (as a set), once the signs of the diagonal elements of the matrix are changed. We also provide an example of application of this theorem in quantum physics. Specifically, we introduce the notion of duality and self-duality for a sextic-polynomial quasi-exactly-solvable potential, and demonstrate that the algebraic parts of the spectrum of the dual potentials have signs opposite to one another (as sets). Our Theorem furnishes an elegant one-line proof of this statement. In addition, we also prove it by purely quantum-mechanical means - a far less straightforward method that requires some effort.

abstract: We present an efficient framework to numerically treat infinite periodic vortex lattices in rotating superfluids described by the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The commonly used split-step Fourier (SSF) spectral methods are inapplicable to such systems as the standard Fourier transform does not respect the boundary conditions mandated by the magnetic translation group. We present a generalisation of the SSF method which incorporates the correct boundary conditions by employing the so-called magnetic Fourier transform. We test the method and show that it reduces to known results in the lowest-Landau-level regime. While we focus on rotating scalar superfluids for simplicity, the framework can be naturally extended to treat multicomponent systems and systems under more general `synthetic' gauge fields.

abstract: Optomechanical systems couple an electromagnetic cavity to a mechanical resonator which is typically formed from a solid object. The range of phenomena accessible to these systems depends on the properties of the mechanical resonator and on the manner in which it couples to the cavity fields. In both respects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers several appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal conductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in situ alignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom that differ qualitatively from those of a solid. Here, we describe an optomechanical system consisting of a miniature optical cavity filled with superfluid helium. The cavity mirrors define optical and mechanical modes with near-perfect overlap, resulting in an optomechanical coupling rate ~3 kHz. This coupling is used to drive the superfluid; it is also used to observe the superfluid's thermal motion, resolving a mean phonon number as low as 11.

abstract: The point contact tunnel junctions between a one-dimensional topological superconductor and single-channel quantum Hall (QH) liquids are investigated theoretically with bosonization technology and renormalization group methods. For the $\nu=1$ integer QH liquid, the universal low-energy tunneling transport is governed by the perfect Andreev reflection fixed point with quantized zero-bias conductance $G(0)=2e^{2}/h$, which can serve as a definitive fingerprint of the existence of a Majorana fermion. For the $\nu =1/m$ Laughlin fractional QH liquids, its transport is governed by the perfect normal reflection fixed point with vanishing zero-bias conductance and bias-dependent conductance $G(V) \sim V^{m-2}$. Our setup is within reach of present experimental techniques.

abstract: Charge transfer states in organic semiconductors play crucial roles in processes such as singlet fission and exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor interfaces. Recently, a time-resolved spectroscopy study of dinaphtho[2,3-b:2'3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (DNTT) thin films provided evidence for the formation of mixed Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons after the photoexcitation. Here we investigate optical properties and excitation dynamics of the DNTT thin films by combining ab initio calculations and a stochastic Schrodinger equation. Our theory predicts that the low-energy Frenkel exciton band consists of 8 to 47% CT character. The quantum dynamics simulations show coherent dynamics of Frenkel and CT states in 50 fs after the optical excitation. We demonstrate the role of charge delocalization and localization in the mixing of CT states with Frenkel excitons as well as the role of their decoherence.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum computing. In these systems, the dynamically corrected gates offer considerable reduction of gate errors and are therefore of great interest both theoretically and experimentally. They are, however, designed under the static-noise model and may be considered as low-frequency filters. In this work, we perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the response of a type of dynamically corrected gates, namely the {\sc supcode} for singlet-triplet qubits, to realistic $1/f$ noises with frequency spectra $1/\omega^\alpha$. Through randomized benchmarking, we have found that {\sc supcode} offers improvement of the gate fidelity for $\alpha\gtrsim1$ and the improvement becomes exponentially more pronounced with the increase of the noise exponent in the range $1\lesssim\alpha\leq3$ studied. On the other hand, for small $\alpha$, {\sc supcode} will not offer any improvement. The $\delta J$-{\sc supcode}, specifically designed for systems where the nuclear noise is absent, is found to offer additional error reduction than the full {\sc supcode} for charge noises. The computed filter transfer functions of the {\sc supcode} gates are also presented.

abstract: Ring exchange is an elementary interaction for modeling unconventional topological matters which hold promise for efficient quantum information processing. We report the observation of four-body ring-exchange interactions and the topological properties of anyonic excitations within an ultracold atom system. A minimum toric code Hamiltonian in which the ring exchange is the dominant term, was implemented by engineering a Hubbard Hamiltonian that describes atomic spins in disconnected plaquette arrays formed by two orthogonal superlattices. The ring-exchange interactions were resolved from the dynamical evolutions in the spin orders, matching well with the predicted energy gaps between two anyonic excitations of the spin system. A braiding operation was applied to the spins in the plaquettes and an induced phase $1.00(3)\pi$ in the four-spin state was observed, confirming $\frac{1}{2}$-anynoic statistics. This work represents an essential step towards studying topological matters with many-body systems and the applications in quantum computation and simulation.

abstract: We study the scaling behavior of the relaxation dynamics to thermal equilibrium when a quantum system is near the quantum critical point. In particular, we investigate systems whose relaxation dynamics is described by a Lindblad master equation. We find that the universal scaling behavior not only exhibits in the equilibrium stage at the long-time limit, but also manifests itself in the non-equilibrium relaxation process. While the critical behavior is dictated by the low-lying energy levels of the Hamiltonian, the dissipative part in the Lindblad equation also plays important roles in two aspects: First, the dissipative part makes the high energy levels decay fast after which the universal behavior controlled by the low-lying modes emerges. Second, the dissipation rate gives rise to a time scale that affects the scaling behavior. We confirm our theory by solving the Lindblad equation for the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model.

abstract: High-gain amplifiers of electromagnetic signals operating near the quantum limit are crucial for quantum information systems and ultrasensitive quantum measurements. However, the existing techniques have a limited gain-bandwidth product and only operate with weak input signals. Here we demonstrate a two-port optomechanical scheme for amplification and routing of microwave signals, a system that simultaneously performs high-gain amplification and frequency conversion in the quantum regime. Our amplifier, implemented in a two-cavity microwave optomechanical device, shows 41 dB of gain and has a high dynamic range, handling input signals up to $10^{13}$ photons per second, three orders of magnitude more than corresponding Josephson parametric amplifiers. We show that although the active medium, the mechanical resonator, is at a high temperature far from the quantum limit, only 4.6 quanta of noise is added to the input signal. Our method can be readily applied to a wide variety of optomechanical systems, including hybrid optical-microwave systems, creating a universal hub for signals at the quantum level.

abstract: Recent advances in solid-state qubit technology are paving the way to fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. However, qubit technology is limited by qubit coherence time and by the complexity of coupling the quantum system with a classical electronic infrastructure. We propose an infrastructure, enabling to read and control qubits, that is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA platform supports functionality required by several qubit technologies and can operate physically close to the qubits over a temperature range from 4K to 300K. Extensive characterization of the platform over this temperature range revealed all major components (such as LUTs, MMCM, PLL, BRAM, IDELAY2) operate correctly and the logic speed is very stable. The stability is finally concretized by operating an integrated ADC with relatively stable performance over temperature.

abstract: In this paper the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method (MCTDHB) is derived for the case of $N$ identical bosons with internal degrees of freedom. The theory for bosons with internal degrees of freedom constitutes a generalization of the MCTDHB method that substantially enriches the many-body physics that can be described. We demonstrate that the numerically exact solution of the time-dependent many-body Schr\"odinger equation for interacting bosonic particles with internal degrees of freedom is now feasible. We report on the MCTDHB equations of motion for bosons with internal degrees of freedom and their implementation for a general many-body Hamiltonian with one-body and two-body terms that, both, may depend on the internal states of the considered particles. To demonstrate the capabilities of the theory and its software implementation integrated in the MCTDH-X software, we apply MCTDHB to the emergence of fragmentation of parabolically trapped bosons with two internal states: we study the groundstate of $N=100$ parabolically confined bosons as a function of the splitting between the state-dependent minima of the two parabolic potentials. To quantify the coherence of the system we compute its normalized one-body correlation function. We find that the coherence within each internal state of the atoms is maintained, while it is lost between the different internal states. This is a hallmark of a new kind of fragmentation which is absent in bosons without internal structure. We term the emergent phenomenon "composite fragmentation".

abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Schrodinger equation with a general kinetic energy operator. The conservation law is proved and the probability continuity equation is deducted in a general sense. Examples with a Hermitian kinetic energy operator include the standard Schrodinger equation, the relativistic Schrodinger equation, the fractional Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, and the deformed Schrodinger equation. We reveal that the Klein-Gordon equation has a hidden non-Hermitian kinetic energy operator. The probability continuity equation with sources indicates that there exists a different way of probability transportation, which is probability teleportation. An average formula is deducted from the relativistic Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, and the K-G equation.

abstract: We theoretically study a Kitaev wire interrupted by an extra site which gives rise to super exchange coupling between two Majorana bound states. We show that this system hosts a tunable, non-equlibrium Josephson effect with a characteristic $8\pi$ periodicity of the Josephson current. We elucidate the physical mechanism deriving a minimal model for the junction and confirm its quantitative accuracy by comparison to the numerical solution of the full model. The visibility of the $8\pi$ periodicity of the Josephson current is then studied using time-dependent simulations including the effects of dephasing and particle losses. Our findings provide a novel signature of Majorana quasi-particles which is qualitatively different form the behavior of a conventional superconductor, and can be experimentally verified in cold atom systems using alkaline-earth-like atoms.

abstract: Protected chiral edge modes are a well-known signature of topologically ordered phases like the Fractional Quantum Hall States. Recently, using the framework of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on the square lattice, we constructed a family of chiral Resonating Valence Bond states with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry. Here we revisit and analyze in full details the properties of the edge modes as given by their Entanglement Spectra on a cylinder. Surprisingly, we show that the latter can be well described by a chiral SU(2)$_1$ Conformal Field Theory (CFT), as for the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) gapped Laughlin state, although our numerical data suggest a critical bulk compatible with an emergent $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. We propose that our family of PEPS may physically describe a boundary between a chiral topological phase and a trivial phase.

abstract: The two criteria of ensemble equivalence, i.e. the macrostate equivalence and the measure equivalence, are investigated for a general pair of states. The macrostate equivalence implies the two ensembles are indistinguishable by the measurement of macroscopic quantities obeying the large-deviation principle, and the measure equivalence means that the specific relative entropy of these two states vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the measure equivalence implies the macrostate equivalence for a general pair of states. Moreover, it is shown that we can obtain much information on the large-deviation rate functions by considering the specific relative Renyi entropies. The result is applicable to both quantum and classical systems. As applications, a sufficient condition for thermalization is given by considering the equivalence of the diagonal ensemble and the microcanonical ensemble, and the timescale of quantum dynamics of macrovariables is estimated by considering the equivalence of the state at the present time and the initial state.

We derive an effective approach to describe magnetoassociation in an external trap in the presence of multiple overlapping resonances. We study how the strength and shape of the trap affects the energy level structure and demonstrate the existence of a regime in which the conventional two-channel Landau-Zener description of the molecule production process breaks down.

The significance of the Seiberg-Witten map in this context is discussed and its effect in the problem is incorporated to all orders in $\theta$. We map the noncommutative problem to an equivalent commutative problem by using a set of generalised Bopp-shift transformations containing a scaling parameter. The energy spectrum of the noncommutative Pauli Hamiltonian is obtained and found to be $\theta$ corrected which is valid to all orders in $\theta$.

abstract: Ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to study strongly correlated phases of matter in and out of equilibrium. Much of the experimental progress in this field crucially relies on the control of the contact interaction between two atoms. Control of strong long-range interactions between distant ground state atoms has remained a long standing goal, opening the path towards the study of fundamentally new quantum many-body systems including frustrated or topological magnets and supersolids. Optical dressing of ground state atoms by near-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile method to engineer such interactions. However, up to now the great potential of this approach for interaction control in a many-body setting has eluded experimental confirmation. Here we report the realisation of coherent Rydberg-dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single atom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy of the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable agreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems. Finally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible routes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times. Our work marks the first step towards the use of laser-controlled Rydberg interactions for the study of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices.

abstract: The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) stems from the diagonal second derivative coupling term in the adiabatic representation, and it can have an arbitrary large magnitude when a gap between neighbouring Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces (PESs) is closing. Nevertheless, DBOC is typically neglected in mixed quantum-classical methods of simulating nonadiabatic dynamics (e.g., fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH) method). A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method, FSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models containing conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC inclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D but on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively assesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state problems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of one- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC can enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2) PESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is detrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even diverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this case, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between diagonal and off-diagonal terms in derivative nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping approaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.

abstract: This paper is concerned with quantum harmonic oscillators consisting of a quantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer. We employ discounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted time averages of second-order moments of the system variables. A coherent quantum filtering (CQF) problem is formulated as the minimization of the discounted mean square of an estimation error, with which the dynamic variables of the observer approximate those of the plant. The cost functional also involves a quadratic penalty on the plant-observer coupling matrix in order to mitigate the back-action of the observer on the covariance dynamics of the plant. For the discounted mean square optimal CQF problem with penalized back-action, we establish first-order necessary conditions of optimality in the form of algebraic matrix equations. By using the Hamiltonian structure of the Heisenberg dynamics and related Lie-algebraic techniques, we represent this set of equations in a more explicit form in the case of equally dimensioned plant and observer.

abstract: Generating non-reciprocal radio frequency transduction plays important roles in a wide range of research and applications, and an aspiration is to integrate this functionality into micro-circuit without introducing magnetic field, which, however, remains challenging. By designing a 1D artificial lattice structure with neighbor-interaction engineered parametrically, we predicted a non-reciprocity transduction with giant unidirectionality. We then experimentally demonstrated the phenomenon on a nano-electromechanical chip fabricated by conventional complementary metal-silicon processing. A unidirectionality with isolation as high as 24dB is achieved and several different transduction schemes are realized by programming the control voltages topology. Apart from being used as a radio frequency isolator, the system provides a way to build practical on-chip programmable device for many researches and applications in radio frequency domain.

abstract: In this letter we investigate measures of chaos and entanglement scrambling in rational conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions. First, we derive a formula for the late time value of the out-of-time-order correlators for these class of theories. Our universal result can be expressed as a particular combination of the modular S-matrix elements known as anyon monodromy scalar. Next, in the explicit setup of a $SU(N)_k$ WZW model, we compare the late time behaviour of the out-of-time correlators and the purity. Interestingly, in the large-c limit, the purity grows logarithmically but the out-of-time-order correlators remain constant. Therefore, we find that some systems may display entanglement scrambling in the absence of chaos.

abstract: We show that short-range correlations have a dramatic impact on the steady-state phase diagram of quantum driven-dissipative systems. This effect, never observed in equilibrium, follows from the fact that ordering in the steady state is of dynamical origin, whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium it arises from the properties of the (free-)energy. To this scope, by combining the cluster methods extensively used in equilibrium phase transitions to quantum trajectories and tensor-network techniques, we extend them to non-equilibrium phase transitions in dissipative many-body systems. We analyse in detail a model of spins-1/2 on a lattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of them coupled to an independent environment which induces incoherent spin flips. In the steady-state phase diagram derived from our cluster approach, the location of the phase boundaries and even its topology radically change, as compared to the single-site mean field where correlations are absent. Furthermore a stability analysis of the cluster mean-field indicates a susceptibility towards a possible incommensurate ordering, not present if short-range correlations are ignored.

abstract: We introduce a method which enables to directly compare the impact of elastic strain on the optical properties of distinct quantum dots (QDs). Specifically, the QDs are integrated in a cross-section of a semiconductor core wire which is surrounded by an amorphous straining shell. Detailed numerical simulations show that, thanks to the mechanical isotropy of the shell, the strain field in a core section is homogeneous. Furthermore, we use the core material as an in situ strain gauge, yielding reliable values for the emitter energy tuning slope. This calibration technique is applied to self-assembled InAs QDs submitted to incremental tensile strain along their growth axis. In contrast to recent studies conducted on similar QDs stressed perpendicularly to their growth axis, optical spectroscopy reveals 5-10 times larger tuning slopes, with a moderate dispersion. These results highlight the importance of the stress direction to optimise QD response to applied strain, with implications both in static and dynamic regimes. As such, they are in particular relevant for the development of wavelength-tunable single photon sources or hybrid QD opto-mechanical systems.

abstract: Topological operations have the merit of achieving certain goals without requiring accurate control over local operational details. To date, topological operations have been used to control geometric phases, and have been proposed as a means for controlling the state of certain systems within their degenerate subspaces. More recently, it was predicted that topological operations can be extended to transfer energy between normal modes, provided that the system possesses a specific type of degeneracy known as an exceptional point (EP). Here we realize the transfer of energy between two modes of a cryogenic optomechanical device by topological operations. We show that this transfer arises from the presence of an EP in the device's spectrum. We also show that this transfer is non-reciprocal. These results open new directions in system control; they also open the possibility of exploring other dynamical effects related to EPs, as well as the behavior of thermal and quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of EPs.

In particular, we explain how a curvature dependence of the collapse rate of such models could offer a dynamical justification for Penrose's conjecture. The present essay constitutes an extension of a previous proposal of ours that uses collapse theories in dealing with open problems in contemporary physical theories.

abstract: For some crystalline materials, a regime can be found where continuous ductile cutting is feasible. Using precision diamond turning, such materials can be cut into complex optical components with high surface quality and form accuracy. In this work we use diamond-turning to machine a monolithic, square-shaped, doubly-resonant $LiNbO_3$ cavity with two flat and two convex facets. When additional mild polishing is implemented, the Q-factor of the resonator is found to be limited only by the material absorption loss. We show how our monolithic square resonator may be operated as an optical parametric oscillator that is evanescently coupled to free-space beams via birefringent prisms. The prism arrangement allows for independent and large tuning of the fundamental and second harmonic coupling rates. We measure $2.6\pm0.5$ dB of vacuum squeezing at 1064 nm using our system. Potential improvements to obtain higher degrees of squeezing are discussed.

abstract: Integrated optics has brought unprecedented levels of stability and performance to quantum photonic circuits. However, integrated devices are not merely micron-scale equivalents of their bulk-optics counterparts. By exploiting the inherently dispersive characteristics of the integrated setting, such devices can play a remarkably more versatile role in quantum circuit architectures. We show this by examining the implications of linear dispersion in an ordinary directional coupler. Dispersion unlocks several novel capabilities for this device, including in-situ control over photon spectral and polarization entanglement, tunable photon time-ordering, and entanglement-sensitive two-photon coincidence generation. Also revealed is an ability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while tuning the interference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk-optics. The outcome of this work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that benefit from the advantages of integration. It also paves the way for re-evaluating the possibilities offered by dispersion in other on-chip devices.

abstract: The ability to transport quantum information across some distance can facilitate the design and operation of a quantum processor. One-dimensional spin chains provide a compact platform to realize scalable spin transport for a solid-state quantum computer. Here, we model odd-sized donor chains in silicon under a range of experimental non-idealities, including variability of donor position within the chain. We show that the tolerance against donor placement inaccuracies is greatly improved by operating the spin chain in a mode where the electrons are confined at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. We then estimate the required timescales and exchange couplings, and the level of noise that can be tolerated to achieve high fidelity transport. We also propose a protocol to calibrate and initialize the chain, thereby providing a complete guideline for realizing a functional donor chain and utilizing it for spin transport.

abstract: We present a new numerical system using classical finite elements with mesh adaptivity for computing stationary solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The programs are written as a toolbox for FreeFem++ (www.freefem.org), a free finite-element software available for all existing operating systems. This offers the advantage to hide all technical issues related to the implementation of the finite element method, allowing to easily implement various numerical algorithms.Two robust and optimised numerical methods were implemented to minimize the Gross-Pitaevskii energy: a steepest descent method based on Sobolev gradients and a minimization algorithm based on the state-of-the-art optimization library Ipopt. For both methods, mesh adaptivity strategies are implemented to reduce the computational time and increase the local spatial accuracy when vortices are present. Different run cases are made available for 2D and 3D configurations of Bose-Einstein condensates in rotation. An optional graphical user interface is also provided, allowing to easily run predefined cases or with user-defined parameter files. We also provide several post-processing tools (like the identification of quantized vortices) that could help in extracting physical features from the simulations. The toolbox is extremely versatile and can be easily adapted to deal with different physical models.

New results on the structure of the generalized scattering operators are derived. Interesting interrelations between dynamical and stationary cases are found for radial Schr\"odinger and Dirac equations, and for Dirac-type equations as well. For some important examples we explain why the well-known divergences in the higher order approximations of the scattering matrices do not appear in the "generalized wave operator" approach.

abstract: Bosons hopping across sites and interacting on-site are the essence of the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM). Inspired by the success of BHM simulators with atoms in optical lattices, proposals for implementing the BHM with photons in coupled nonlinear cavities have emerged. Two coupled semiconductor microcavities constitute a model system where the hopping, interaction, and decay of exciton polaritons --- mixed light-matter quasiparticles --- can be engineered in combination with site-selective coherent driving to implement the driven-dissipative two-site optical BHM. Here we explore the interplay of interference and nonlinearity in this system, in a regime where three distinct density profiles can be observed under identical driving conditions. We demonstrate how the phase acquired by polaritons hopping between cavities can be controlled through effective polariton-polariton interactions. Our results open new perspectives for synthesizing density-dependent gauge fields for polaritons in two-dimensional multicavity systems.

We investigate the spectrum of this dual operator with a focus on the different parameter regimes (chaotic, regular) of the spin chain. We present applications of this duality relation to spectral statistics in an accompanying paper.

abstract: We investigate the behavior of entanglement entropy at finite temperature and chemical potential for strongly coupled large-N gauge theories in $d$-dimensions ($d\ge 3$) that are dual to Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrom geometries in $(d+1)-$dimensions, in the context of gauge-gravity duality. We develop systematic expansions based on the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription that enable us to derive analytic expressions for entanglement entropy and mutual information in different regimes of interest. Consequently, we identify the specific regions of the bulk geometry that contribute most significantly to the entanglement entropy of the boundary theory at different limits. We define a scale, dubbed as the effective temperature, which determines the behavior of entanglement in different regimes. At high effective temperature, entanglement entropy is dominated by the thermodynamic entropy, however, mutual information subtracts out this contribution and measures the actual quantum entanglement. Finally, we study the entanglement/disentanglement transition of mutual information in the presence of chemical potential which shows that the quantum entanglement between two sub-regions decreases with the increase of chemical potential.

abstract: Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) provides a dispersion-canceled axial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the light source and by artifacts in the images. A recent study using chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) has demonstrated dispersion-canceled and artifact-free OCT with a classical system; however, unwanted background signals still remain after removing the artifacts. Here, we propose a classical optical method that realizes dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free OCT. We employ a time-reversed system for Q-OCT with transform-limited input laser pulses to achieve dispersion-canceled OCT with a classical system. We have also introduced a subtraction method to remove artifacts and background signals. With these methods, we experimentally demonstrated dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free axial imaging of a coverglass and cross-sectional imaging of the surface of a coin.

The trace of the unitary evolution operator for $N$ spins at time $T$ is related to one of a non-unitary evolution operator for $T$ spins at time $N$. Using this duality relation we obtain the oscillating part of the density of states for a large number of spins. Furthermore, the duality relation explains the anomalous short-time behavior of the spectral form factor previously observed in the literature.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a non-linear detection scheme exploiting time-reversal dynamics which disentangles continuous variable entangled states for feasible read-out. Spin exchange dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates is used as the non-linear mechanism which not only generates entangled states but can also be time reversed by controlled phase imprinting. For demonstration of a quantum-enhanced measurement we construct an active atom SU(1,1) interferometer, where entangled state preparation and non-linear read-out both consist of parametric amplification. This scheme is capable of exhausting the full quantum resource up to the fundamental Heisenberg limit by detecting solely mean atom numbers. Controlled non-linear transformations widen the spectrum of useful entangled states for applied quantum technologies.

abstract: High level of dissipation in normal metals makes challenging development of active and passive plasmonic devices. One possible solution to this problem is to use alternative materials. Graphene is a good candidate for plasmonics in near infrared (IR) region. In this paper we develop quantum theory of a graphene plasmon generator. We account for the first time quantum correlations and dissipation effects that allows describing such regimes of quantum plasmonic amplifier as surface plasmon emitting diode and surface plasmon amplifier by stimulated emission of radiation. Switching between these generation types is possible in situ with variance of graphene Fermi-level or gain transition frequency. We provide explicit expressions for dissipation and interaction constants through material parameters and find the generation spectrum and correlation function of second order which predicts laser statistics.

abstract: In this paper we argue for a paradigmatic shift from `reductionism' to `togetherness'. In particular, we show how interaction between systems in quantum theory naturally carries over to modelling how word meanings interact in natural language. Since meaning in natural language, depending on the subject domain, encompasses discussions within any scientific discipline, we obtain a template for theories such as social interaction, animal behaviour, and many others.

abstract: We use quantum detector tomography to investigate the detection mechanism in WSi nanowire superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs). To this purpose, we fabricated a 250nm wide and 250nm long WSi nanowire and measured its response to impinging photons with wavelengths ranging from $\lambda$ = 900 nm to $\lambda$ = 1650 nm. Tomographic measurements show that the detector response depends on the total excitation energy only. Moreover, for energies Et > 0.8eV the current energy relation is linear, similar to what was observed in NbN nanowires, whereas the current-energy relation deviates from linear behaviour for total energies below 0.8eV.

abstract: We present combined measurements of the spatially-resolved optical spectrum and the total excited-atom number in an ultracold gas of three-level atoms under electromagnetically induced transparency conditions involving high-lying Rydberg states. The observed optical transmission of a weak probe laser at the center of the coupling region exhibits a double peaked spectrum as a function of detuning, whilst the Rydberg atom number shows a comparatively narrow single resonance. By imaging the transmitted light onto a charge-coupled-device camera, we record hundreds of spectra in parallel, which are used to map out the spatial profile of Rabi frequencies of the coupling laser. Using all the information available we can reconstruct the full one-body density matrix of the three-level system, which provides the optical susceptibility and the Rydberg density as a function of spatial position. These results help elucidate the connection between three-level interference phenomena, including the interplay of matter and light degrees of freedom and will facilitate new studies of many-body effects in optically driven Rydberg gases.

abstract: We experimentally implement high-efficiency coherent excitation to a Rydberg state using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a cold atom electron and ion source, leading to a peak efficiency of 85%, a 1.7 times improvement in excitation probability relative to incoherent pulsed-laser excitation. Using streak measurements and pulsed electric field ionization of the Rydberg atoms we demonstrate electron bunches with duration of 250 ps. High-efficiency excitation will increase source brightness, crucial for ultrafast electron diffraction experiments, while using coherent excitation to high-lying Rydberg states could allow for the reduction of internal bunch heating and the creation of a high-speed single ion source.

abstract: We develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic approach for a harmonically trapped one-dimensional quasicondensate and apply it to describe the phenomenon of frequency doubling in the breathing-mode oscillations of its momentum distribution. The doubling here refers to the oscillation frequency relative to the oscillations of the real-space density distribution, invoked by a sudden confinement quench. We find that the frequency doubling is governed by the quench strength and the initial temperature, rather than by the crossover from the ideal Bose gas to the quasicondensate regime. The hydrodynamic predictions are supported by the results of numerical simulations based on a finite-temperature c-field approach, and extend the utility of the hydrodynamic theory for low-dimensional quantum gases to the description of finite-temperature systems and their dynamics in momentum space.

abstract: For the two-parameter $p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra (DHA) introduced recently and in which, instead of usual commutator of $X$ and $P$ in the l.h.s. of basic relation $[X,P]={\rm i}\hbar$, one uses the $p,q$-commutator, we established interesting properties. Most important is the realizability of the $p,q$-DHA by means of the appropriate deformed oscillator algebra (DOA). Another uncovered property is special extension of the usual mutual Hermitian conjugation of the creation and annihilation operators, namely the so-called $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rule, along with the related $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermiticity property of the position or momentum operators. In this work, we present some new solutions of the realization problem yielding new (nonstandard) deformed oscillators, and show their inequivalence to the earlier known solution and respective DOA, in particular what concerns ground state energy.

abstract: Determining the minimum number of states required by a finite automaton to separate a given pair of different words is an important problem. In this paper, we consider this problem for quantum automata (QFAs). We show that 2-state QFAs can separate any pair of words in nondeterministic acceptance mode and conjecture that they can separate any pair also with zero-error. Then, we focus on (a more general problem) separating a pair of two disjoint finite set of words. We show that QFAs can separate them efficiently in nondeterministic acceptance mode, i.e. the number of states is two to the power of the size of the small set. Additionally, we examine affine finite automata (AfAs) and show that two states are enough to separate any pair with zero-error. Moreover, AfAs can separate any pair of disjoint finite sets of words with one-sided bounded error efficiently like QFAs in nondeterministic mode.

abstract: We demonstrate a silicon-chip biphoton source with an unprecedented quantum cross correlation up to ${\rm g_{si}^{(2)}(0) = (2.58 \pm 0.16) \times 10^4}$. The emitted biphotons are intrinsically single-mode, with self correlations of ${\rm g_{ss}^{(2)}(0) = 1.90 \pm 0.05}$ and ${\rm g_{ii}^{(2)}(0) = 1.87 \pm 0.06}$ for signal and idler photons, respectively. We observe the waveform asymmetry of cross correlation between signal and idler photons and reveal the identical and non-exponential nature of self correlations of individual signal and idler photon modes, which is a nature of cavity-enhanced nonlinear optical processes. The high efficiency and high purity of the biphoton source allow us to herald single photons with a conditional self correlation $\rm g_{c}^{(2)}(0)$ as low as $\rm 0.0059 \pm 0.0014$ at a pair flux of $\rm 1.95 \times 10^5$ pairs/s, which remains below $\rm 0.026 \pm 0.001$ for a biphoton flux up to $\rm 2.93 \times 10^6$ pairs/s, with a photon preparation efficiency in the single-mode fiber up to 51%, among the best values that have ever been reported. Our work unambiguously demonstrates that silicon photonic chips are superior material and device platforms for integrated quantum photonics.

abstract: By applying the infinite-mass boundary condition, we analytically calculate the confined states and the corresponding wave functions of AA-stacked bilayer graphene quantum {dots} in the presence of an uniform magnetic field $B$. It is found that the energy spectrum shows two set of levels, which are the double copies of the energy spectrum for single layer graphene, shifted up-down by $+\gamma$ and $-\gamma$, respectively. However, the obtained spectrum exhibits different symmetries between the electron and hole states as well as the intervalley symmetries. It is noticed that, the applied magnetic field breaks all symmetries, except one related to the intervalley electron-hole symmetry, i.e. $E^e(\tau,m)=-E^h(\tau,m)$. Two different regimes of confinement are found: the first one is due to the infinite-mass barrier at weak $B$ and the second is dominated by the magnetic field as long as $B$ is large. We numerically investigated the basics features of the energy spectrum to show the main similarities and differences with respect to monolayer graphene, AB-stacked bilayer graphene and semiconductor quantum dots.

abstract: Decision making is a vital function in the era of artificial intelligence; however, its physical realizations and their theoretical fundamentals are not yet known. In our former study [Sci. Rep. 5, 513253 (2015)], we demonstrated that single photons can be used to make decisions in uncertain, dynamically changing environments. The multi-armed bandit problem was successfully solved using the dual probabilistic and particle attributes of single photons. Herein, we present the category theoretic foundation of the single-photon-based decision making, including quantitative analysis that agrees well with the experimental results. The category theoretic model unveils complex interdependencies of the entities of the subject matter in the most simplified manner, including a dynamically changing environment. In particular, the octahedral structure in triangulated categories provides a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the single-photon decision maker. This is the first demonstration of a category theoretic interpretation of decision making, and provides a solid understanding and a design fundamental for intelligence.

The security analysis of authentication and communication processes against many types of attacks proved that the attacker cannot gain any information during intercepting either authentication or communication processes. Hence, the security of transmitted message among N users is ensured as the attacker introduces an error probability irrespective of the sequence of measurement.

abstract: The localization properties of eigenfunctions for two interacting particles in the one-dimensional Anderson model are studied for system sizes up to $N=5000$ sites corresponding to a Hilbert space of dimension $\approx 10^7$ using the Green function Arnoldi method. The eigenfunction structure is illustrated in position, momentum and energy representation, the latter corresponding to an expansion in non-interacting product eigenfunctions. Different types of localization lengths are computed for parameter ranges in system size, disorder and interaction strengths inaccessible until now. We confirm that one-parameter scaling theory can be successfully applied provided that the condition of $N$ being significantly larger than the one-particle localization length $L_1$ is verified. The enhancement effect of the two-particle localization length $L_2$ behaving as $L_2\sim L_1^2$ is clearly confirmed for a certain quite large interval of optimal interactions strengths. Further new results for the interaction dependence in a very large interval, an energy value outside the band center, and different interaction ranges are obtained.

abstract: We propose that the vacuum state of a scalar field around a black hole is a modified Unruh vacuum. In (1+1) dimensions, we show that a free-faller close to such a horizon can be modelled as an inertial observer in a modified Minkowski vacuum. The modification allows for information-leaking correlations at high frequencies. Using a Gaussian detector centred at $k_0$, we find that the expectation value of the number operator for a detector crossing the horizon is proportional to $1/|k_0|$, implying that the free-faller will observe unbounded numbers of high energy photons, i.e. a firewall.

abstract: Obtaining full control over the internal and external quantum states of molecules is the central goal of ultracold chemistry and allows for the study of coherent molecular dynamics, collisions and tests of fundamental laws of physics. When the molecules additionally have a permanent electric dipole moment, the study of dipolar quantum gases and spin-systems with long-range interactions as well as applications in quantum information processing are possible. Rydberg molecules constitute a class of exotic molecules, which are bound by the interaction between the Rydberg electron and the ground state atom. They exhibit extreme bond lengths of hundreds of Bohr radii and giant permanent dipole moments in the kilo-Debye range. A special type with exceptional properties are the so-called butterfly molecules, whose electron density resembles the shape of a butterfly. Here, we report on the photoassociation of butterfly Rydberg molecules and their orientation in a weak electric field. Starting from a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms, we fully control the external degrees of freedom and spectroscopically resolve the rotational structure and the emerging pendular states in an external electric field. This not only allows us to extract the bond length, the dipole moment and the angular momentum of the molecule but also to deterministically create molecules with a tunable bond length and orientation. We anticipate direct applications in quantum chemistry, many-body quantum physics and quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum systems in contact with an environment display a rich physics emerging from the interplay between dissipative and Hamiltonian terms. We consider a dissipative boundary driven ladder in presence of a gauge field which can be implemented with ion microtraps arrays. The dissipation stimulates currents while the gauge field tends to steer the flow. We show that depending on the geometry of coupling to the baths and of the strength of the gauge field, non-equilibrium phase transitions emerge strongly modifying the currents both in magnitude and spatial distribution.

abstract: We show that coupling ultracold atoms in optical lattices to quantized modes of an optical cavity leads to quantum phases of matter, which at the same time posses properties of systems with both short- and long-range interactions. This opens perspectives for novel quantum simulators of finite-range interacting systems, even though the light-induced interaction is global (i.e. infinitely long range). This is achieved by spatial structuring of the global light-matter coupling at a microscopic scale. Such simulators can directly benefit from the collective enhancement of the global light-matter interaction and constitute an alternative to standard approaches using Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. The system in the steady state of light induces effective many-body interactions that change the landscape of the phase diagram of the typical Bose-Hubbard model. Therefore, the system can support non-trivial superfluid states, bosonic dimer, trimers, etc. states and supersolid phases depending on the choice of the wavelength and pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical lattice potential. We find that by carefully choosing the system parameters one can investigate diverse strongly correlated physics with the same setup, i.e., modifying the geometry of light beams. In particular, we present the interplay between the density and bond (or matter-wave coherence) interactions. We show how to tune the effective interaction length in such a hybrid system with both short-range and global interactions.

abstract: The Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a multilayered system composed of infinitely thin planes is considered using the zeta-function regularization approach with summation of the zero-point energies. As a prototype material, each plane is represented by a graphene sheet whose optical response is described by a constant conductivity or Drude-Lorentz model conductivity. Asymptotic expressions for various separations are derived and compared to numerical calculations. We distinguish between large atom/plane limit, where retardation effects are prominent, and small atom/plane limit, where the typical van der Waals coefficient is found to be dependent on the number of graphenes and characteristic distances. The calculated energies for different atoms and graphene conductivity models brings forward the basic science of the Casimir-Polder effect and suggests ways to manipulate this interaction experimentally.
