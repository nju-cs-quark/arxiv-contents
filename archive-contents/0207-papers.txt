abstract: Reversible or information-lossless circuits have applications in digital signal processing, communication, computer graphics and cryptography. They are also a fundamental requirement in the emerging field of quantum computation. We investigate the synthesis of reversible circuits that employ a minimum number of gates and contain no redundant input-output line-pairs (temporary storage channels). We prove constructively that every even permutation can be implemented without temporary storage using NOT, CNOT and TOFFOLI gates. We describe an algorithm for the synthesis of optimal circuits and study the reversible functions on three wires, reporting distributions of circuit sizes. We study circuit decompositions of reversible circuits where gates of the same type are next to each other. Finally, in an application important to quantum computing, we synthesize oracle circuits for Grover's search algorithm, and show a significant improvement over a previously proposed synthesis algorithm.

abstract: We construct the exchange gate with small elementary gates on the space of qudits, which consist of three controlled shift gates and three "reverse" gates. This is a natural extension of the qubit case. We also consider a similar subject on the Fock space, but in this case we meet with some different situation. However we can construct the exchange gate by making use of generalized coherent operator based on the Lie algebra su(2) which is a well--known method in Quantum Optics. We moreover make a brief comment on "imperfect clone".

abstract: We consider algebras underlying Hilbert spaces used by quantum information algorithms. We show how one can arrive at equations on such algebras which define n-dimensional Hilbert space subspaces which in turn can simulate quantum systems on a quantum system. In doing so we use MMP diagrams and linear algorithms. MMP diagrams are tractable since an n-block of an MMP diagram has n elements while an n-block of a standard lattice diagram has 2^n elements. An immediate test for such an approach is a generation of minimal and arbitrary Kochen-Specker vectors and we present a minimal state-independent Kochen-Specker set of seven vectors from a Hilbert space with more than four dimensions.

abstract: In quantum information theory, for $a,b$ two positive operators living in $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a separable Hilbert space, the quantum fidelity is denoted by $a*b =(b^{1/2}ab^{1/2})^{1/2}$. One of the aim of this let ter is to interpret the quantum fidelity as an algebraic law. We remark that if $a,b,c$ are three positive operators whi ch commute pairwise, the law * becomes self-distributive, i.e. the third Reidemeister movement in knot theory is verif ied. We study the converse. Let three positive operators be given, does the fact that the third Reidemeister movement between them is possible implie that they commute pairwise ? Though in general we only conjecture it for the moment, we prove it in some par ticular but important cases. Should this movement be not possible, we interpret it as an obstruction to comm utativity. We give also new examples of quandle algebras and left distributive systems and study the generalisation of Ito maps.

abstract: This paper elaborates on four previously proposed rules of engagement between conscious states and physiological states. A new rule is proposed that applies to a continuous model of conscious brain states that cannot precisely resolve eigenvalues. If two apparatus states are in superposition, and if their eigenvalues are so close together that they cannot be consciously resolved on this model, then it is shown that observation will not generally reduce the superposition to just one of its member eigenstates. In general, the observation of a quantum mechanical superposition results in another superposition. Key words: Brain states, consciousness, conscious observer, macroscopic superposition, measurement, state reduction, state collapse, von Neumann.

abstract: In this paper we analyze the behavior of quantum random walks. In particular we present several new results for the absorption probabilities in systems with both one and two absorbing walls for the one-dimensional case. We compute these probabilites both by employing generating functions and by use of an eigenfunction approach. The generating function method is used to determine some simple properties of the walks we consider, but appears to have limitations. The eigenfunction approach works by relating the problem of absorption to a unitary problem that has identical dynamics inside a certain domain, and can be used to compute several additional interesting properties, such as the time dependence of absorption. The eigenfunction method has the distinct advantage that it can be extended to arbitrary dimensionality. We outline the solution of the absorption probability problem of a (d-1)-dimensional wall in a d-dimensional space.

abstract: We propose the use of quantum optical systems to perform universal simulation of quantum dynamics. Two specific implementations that require present technology are put forward for illustrative purposes. The first scheme consists of neutral atoms stored in optical lattices, while the second scheme consists of ions stored in an array of micro--traps. Each atom (ion) supports a two--level system, on which local unitary operations can be performed through a laser beam. A raw interaction between neighboring two--level systems is achieved by conditionally displacing the corresponding atoms (ions). Then, average Hamiltonian techniques are used to achieve evolutions in time according to a large class of Hamiltonians.

It is described by a simple affine relation between different quantum "data structures" like pure and mixed state, separable and inseparable one. It is shown also, that due to such relations imperfect device for a classical model may mimic measurements of quantum correlations on ideal equipment.

abstract: A relativistic version of the (consistent or decoherent) histories approach to quantum theory is developed on the basis of earlier work by Hartle, and used to discuss relativistic forms of the paradoxes of spherical wave packet collapse, Bohm's formulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, and Hardy's paradox. It is argued that wave function collapse is not needed for introducing probabilities into relativistic quantum mechanics, and in any case should never be thought of as a physical process. Alternative approaches to stochastic time dependence can be used to construct a physical picture of the measurement process that is less misleading than collapse models. In particular, one can employ a coarse-grained but fully quantum mechanical description in which particles move along trajectories, with behavior under Lorentz transformations the same as in classical relativistic physics, and detectors are triggered by particles reaching them along such trajectories. States entangled between spacelike separate regions are also legitimate quantum descriptions, and can be consistently handled by the formalism presented here. The paradoxes in question arise because of using modes of reasoning which, while correct for classical physics, are inconsistent with the mathematical structure of quantum theory, and are resolved (or tamed) by using a proper quantum analysis. In particular, there is no need to invoke, nor any evidence for, mysterious long-range superluminal influences, and thus no incompatibility, at least from this source, between relativity theory and quantum mechanics.

abstract: Stochastic perturbation of two-level atoms strongly driven by a coherent light field is analyzed by the quantum trajectory method. A new method is developed for calculating the resonance fluorescence spectra from numerical simulations. It is shown that in the case of dominant incoherent perturbation, the stochastic noise can unexpectedly create phase correlation between the neighboring atomic dressed states. This phase correlation is responsible for quantum interference between the related transitions resulting in anomalous modifications of the resonance fluorescence spectra.

abstract: Relativistic bipartite entangled quantum states is studied to show that Nature doesn't favor nonlocality for massive particles in the ultra-relativistic limit. We found that to an observer (Bob) in a moving frame S', the entangled Bell state shared by Alice and Bob appears as the superposition of the Bell bases in the frame S' due to the requirement of the special relativity. It is shown that the entangled pair satisfies the Bell's inequality when the boost speed approaches the speed of light, thus providing a counter example for nonlocality of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) paradox.

More specifically, logical qubits are encoded in excitonic states with different spin polarizations and manipulated by adiabatic time-control of the laser amplitudes . The two-qubit gate is realized in a geometric fashion by exploiting dipole-dipole coupling between excitons in neighboring quantum dots.

The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, adjustable quarter- and half-wave plates, beam splitter, polarizing beam splitters, and single-photon detectors, and well fits the status of the current experimental technology. Finally we use the nonmaximally entangled state of ensembles to demonstrate quantum nonlocality by detecting the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.

abstract: Recently, geometric phases, which is fault tolerate to certain errors intrinsically due to its geometric property, are getting considerable attention in quantum computing theoretically. So far, only one experiment about adiabatic geometric gate with NMR through Berry phase has been reported. However, there are two drawbacks in it. First, the adiabatic condition of Berry phase makes such gate very slowly. Second, the extra operation to eliminate the dynamic phase. As we know, geometric phase can exist both adiabatic(Berry phase) and nonadiabatic(Aharonov-Anandan phase). In this letter, we reports the first experimental realization of nonadiabatic geometric gate with NMR through conditional-AA phase. In our experiment the gates can be made faster and more easily, and the two drawbacks mentioned above are removed.

abstract: Within the framework of quantization of the macroscopic electromagnetic field, a master equation describing both the resonant dipole-dipole interaction (RDDI) and the resonant atom-field interaction (RAFI) in the presence of dispersing and absorbing macroscopic bodies is derived, with the relevant couplings being expressed in terms of the surroundings-assisted Green tensor. It is shown that under certain conditions the RDDI can be regarded as being governed by an effective Hamiltonian. The theory, which applies to both weak and strong atom-field coupling, is used to study the resonant energy exchange between two (two-level) atoms sharing initially a single excitation. In particular, it is shown that in the regime of weak atom-field coupling there is a time window, where the energy transfer follows a transfer-rate law of the type obtained by ordinary second-order perturbation theory. Finally, the spectrum of the light emitted during the energy transfer is studied and the line splittings are discussed.

abstract: Let $H^{[ N]}=H^{[ d_{1}]}\otimes ... \otimes H^{[ d_{n}]}$ be a tensor product of Hilbert spaces and let $\tau_{0}$ be the closest separable state in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to an entangled state $\rho_{0}$. Let $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ denote the closest separable state to $\rho_{0}$ along the line segment from $I/N$ to $\rho_{0}$ where $I$ is the identity matrix. Following [pitrubmat] a witness $W_{0}$ detecting the entanglement of $\rho_{0}$ can be constructed in terms of $I, \tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$. If representations of $\tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ as convex combinations of separable projections are known, then the entanglement of $\rho_{0}$ can be detected by local measurements. G\"{u}hne \textit{et. al.} in [bruss1] obtain the minimum number of measurement settings required for a class of two qubit states. We use our geometric approach to generalize their result to the corresponding two qudit case when $d$ is prime and obtain the minimum number of measurement settings. In those particular bipartite cases, $\tau_{0}=\tilde{\tau}_{0}$. We illustrate our general approach with a two parameter family of three qubit bound entangled states for which $\tau_{0} \neq \tilde{\tau}_{0}$ and we show our approach works for $n$ qubits. In [pitt] we elaborated on the role of a ``far face'' of the separable states relative to a bound entangled state $\rho_{0}$ constructed from an orthogonal unextendible product base. In this paper the geometric approach leads to an entanglement witness expressible in terms of a constant times $I$ and a separable density $\mu_{0}$ on the far face from $\rho_{0}$. Up to a normalization this coincides with the witness obtained in [bruss1] for the particular example analyzed there.

abstract: Physical systems contain information which can be divided between classical and quantum information. Classical information is locally accessible and allows one to perform tasks such as physical work, while quantum information allows one to perform tasks such as teleportation. It is shown that these two kinds of information are complementarity in the sense that two parties can either gain access to the quantum information, or to the classical information but not both. This complementarity has a form very similar to the complementarities usually encountered in quantum mechanics. For pure states, the entanglement plays the role of Planck's constant. We also find another class of complementarity relations which applies to operators, and is induced when two parties can only perform local operations and communicate classical. In order to formalize this notion we define the restricted commutator. Observables such as the parity and phase of two qubits commute, but their restricted commutator is non-zero. It is also found that complementarity is pure in the sense that can be ''decoupled'' from the uncertainty principle.

This leads to a definition of the macrocanonical entanglement of pairing (MEP) for which we compute an analytical formula in terms of two adimensional numbers, the cut-off and gap numbers, which depend on measurable physical quantities. We find that strongly coupled BCS elements like Pb and Nb have much larger MEP values than more conventional BCS transition metal superconductors.

In contradistinction to the theoretical studies of quantum walks over orthogonal lattice states, we introduce quantum walks over nonorthogonal lattice states (specifically, coherent states on a circle) to demonstrate that the key features of a quantum walk are observable albeit for strict parameter ranges. A quantum quincunx may be realized with current cavity quantum electrodynamics capabilities, and precise control over decoherence in such experiments allows a remarkable decrease in the position noise, or spread, with increasing decoherence.

abstract: The quantum Zeno evolution of a quantum system takes place in a proper subspace of the total Hilbert space. The physical and mathematical features of the "Zeno subspaces" depend on the measuring apparatus: when this is included in the quantum description, the Zeno effect becomes a mere consequence of the dynamics and, remarkably, can be cast in terms of an adiabatic theorem, with a dynamical superselection rule. We look at several examples and focus on quantum computation and decoherence-free subspaces.

abstract: We investigate the asymptotic rates of entanglement transformations for bipartite mixed states by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We analyse the relations between the rates for different transitions and obtain simple lower and upper bound for these transitions. In a transition from one mixed state to another and back, the amount of irreversibility can be different for different target states. Thus in a natural way, we get the concept of "amount" of irreversibility in asymptotic manipulations of entanglement. We investigate the behaviour of these transformation rates for different target states. We show that with respect to asymptotic transition rates under LOCC, the maximally entangled states do not have a special status. In the process, we obtain that the entanglement of formation is additive for all maximally correlated states. This allows us to show irreversibility in asymptotic entanglement manipulations for maximally correlated states in 2x2. We show that the possible nonequality of distillable entanglement under LOCC and that under operations preserving the positivity of partial transposition, is related to the behaviour of the transitions (under LOCC) to separable target states.

abstract: We present an architecture of QCPU(Quantum Central Processing Unit), based on the discrete quantum gate set, that can be programmed to approximate any n-qubit computation in a deterministic fashion. It can be built efficiently to implement computations with any required accuracy. QCPU makes it possible to implement universal quantum computation with a fixed, general purpose hardware. Thus the complexity of the quantum computation can be put into the software rather than the hardware.

abstract: An addition rule of impure density operators, which provides a pure state density operator, is formulated. Quantum interference including visibility property is discussed in the context of the density operator formalism. A measure of entanglement is then introduced as the norm of the matrix equal to the difference between a bipartite density matrix and the tensor product of partial traces. Entanglement for arbitrary quantum observables for multipartite systems is discussed. Star-product kernels are used to map the formulation of the addition rule of density operators onto the addition rule of symbols of the operators. Entanglement and nonlocalization of the pure state projector and allied operators are discussed. Tomographic and Weyl symbols (tomograms and Wigner functions) are considered as examples. The squeezed-states and some spin-states (two qubits) are studied to illustrate the formalism.

abstract: The interaction of coherent light with a nonlinear medium is modeled here by a general quantum anharmonic oscillator. The model is not exactly solvable in a closed analytical form. But we need operator solutions of the equations of motion corresponding to these models in order to study the quantum fluctuations of coherent light in nonlinear media. In the present work we derive approximate operator solutions. From these solutions we observe that there exists an apparent discrepancy between the solutions obtained by different techniques. We compare different solutions and conclude that all correct solutions are equivalent and the apparent discrepancy is due to the use of different ordering of the operators. We use these solutions to investigate the possibilities of observing different optical phenomena in a nonlinear dielectric medium. To be precise, we have studied quantum phase fluctuations of coherent light in a third order inversion symmetric nonlinear medium. Fluctuations in phase space quadrature for the same system are studied and the possibility of generating squeezed state is reported. Fluctuations in photon number are studied and the nonclassical phenomenon of antibunching is predicted. We have generalized the results obtained for third order nonlinear medium and have studied the interaction of an intense laser beam with a general (m-1)-th order nonlinear medium. Aharanov Anandan nonadiabatic geometric phase is also discussed in the context of (m-1)-th order nonlinear medium.

abstract: An asymmetric nature of the boson `destruction' operator $\hat{a}$ and its `creation' partner $\hat{a}^{\dagger}$ is made apparent by applying them to a quantum state $|\psi>$ different from the Fock state $|n>$. We show that it is possible to {\em increase} (by many times or by any quantity) the mean number of quanta in the new `photon-subtracted' state $\hat{a}|\psi >$. Moreover, for certain `hyper-Poissonian' states $|\psi>$ the mean number of quanta in the (normalized) state $\hat{a}|\psi>$ can be much greater than in the `photon-added' state $\hat{a}^{\dagger}|\psi > $. The explanation of this `paradox' is given and some examples elucidating the meaning of Mandel's $q$-parameter and the exponential phase operators are considered.

abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phase shifts, in which a cyclic geometric phase is used to realize a set of universal quantum gates. Physical implementation of this set of gates is designed for Josephson junctions and for NMR systems. Interestingly, we find that the nonadiabatic phase shift may be independent of the operation time under appropriate controllable conditions. A remarkable feature of the present nonadiabatic geometric gates is that there is no intrinsic limitation on the operation time, unlike adiabatic geometric gates. Besides fundamental interest, our results may simplify the implementation of geometric quantum computation based on solid state systems, where the decoherence time may be very short.

abstract: We study a two-level model coupled to the electromagnetic vacuum and to an external classic electric field with fixed frequency. The amplitude of the external electric field is supposed to vary very slow in time. Garrison and Wright [{\it Phys. Lett.} {\bf A128} (1988) 177] used the non-hermitian Hamiltonian approach to study the adiabatic limit of this model and obtained that the probability of this two-level system to be in its upper level has an imaginary geometric phase. Using the master equation for describing the time evolution of the two-level system we obtain that the imaginary phase due to dissipative effects is time dependent, in opposition to Garrison and Wright result. The present results show that the non-hermitian hamiltonian method should not be used to discuss the nature of the imaginary phases in open systems.

abstract: The quantum deformation of the Hopf algebra describes the skeleton of quantum field theory, namely its characterizing feature consisting in the existence of infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations. From this we derive the thermal properties of quantum field theory, with the entropy playing the role of the generator of the non-unitary time evolution. The entanglement of the quantum vacuum appears to be robust against interaction with the environment: on cannot ``unknot the knots" in the infinite volume limit.

The coherence of the photonic qubits was maintained during switching operations by using a high-speed polarizing Sagnac interferometer switch.

abstract: The problems related to the management of large quantum registers could be handled in the context of distributed quantum computation: unitary non-local transformations among spatially separated local processors are realized performing local unitary transformations and exchanging classical communication. In this paper, we propose a scheme for the implementation of universal non-local quantum gates such as a controlled-$\gate{NOT}$ ($\cnot$) and a controlled-quantum phase gate ($\gate{CQPG}$). The system we have chosen for their physical implementation is a Cavity-Quantum-Electro-Dynamics (CQED) system formed by two spatially separated microwave cavities and two trapped Rydberg atoms. We describe the procedures to follow for the realization of each step necessary to perform a specific non-local operation.

abstract: The function $\gamma(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ plays an important role in mathematical physics, e.g. as factor for relativistic time dilation in case of $x=\beta$ with $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$ or $\beta=\frac{pc}{E}$. Due to former considerations it is reasonable to study the power series expansion of $\gamma(x)$. Here its relationship to the binomial distribution is shown, especially the fact, that the summands of the power series correspond to the return probabilities to the starting point (local coordinates, configuration or state) of a Bernoulli random walk. So $\gamma(x)$ and with that also proper time is proportional to the sum of the return probabilities. In case of $x=1$ or $v=c$ the random walk is symmetric. Random walks with absorbing barriers are introduced in the appendix. Here essentially the basic mathematical facts are shown and references are given, most interpretation is left to the reader.

We discuss bifurcations of pure stationary states for open quantum systems which are quantum analogs of classical dynamical bifurcations.

abstract: The quantum state of the photon pair generated from type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion pumped by a ultrafast laser pulse exhibits strong decoherence in its polarization entanglement, an effect which can be attributed to the clock effect of the pump pulse or, equivalently, to distinguishing spectral information in the two-photon state. Here, we propose novel temporal and spectral engineering techniques to eliminate these detrimental decoherence effects. The temporal engineering of the two-photon wavefunction results in a universal Bell-state synthesizer that is independent of the choice of pump source, crystal parameters, wavelengths of the interacting photons, and the bandwidth of the spectral filter. In the spectral engineering technique, the distinguishing spectral features of the two-photon state are eliminated through modifications to the two-photon source. In addition, spectral engineering also provides a means for the generation of polarization-entangled states with novel spectral characteristics: the frequency-correlated state and the frequency-uncorrelated state.

We have also studied the thermal-noise squeezing when the external force is parametrically modulated. We have observed both the 50% theoretical limit of squeezing at low gain and the parametric oscillation of the mirror for a large gain.

abstract: In modern quantum information theory one deals with an idealized situation when the spacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the transmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in spacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit, channel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space and time. In this paper some basic notions of quantum information theory are considered from the point of view of quantum field theory and general relativity. It is pointed out an important fact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two regions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical probabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum field theory is obtained. A noncommutative generalization of von Neumann`s spectral theorem is discussed. We suggest a new physical principle describing a relation between the mathematical formalism of Hilbert space and quantum physical phenomena which goes beyond the superselection rules. Entangled states and the change of state associated with the measurement process in space and time are discussed including the black hole and the cosmological spacetime. It is shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes disentangled at large spacelike distances if one makes local observations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed without inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if the distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further experimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence of the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.

abstract: We examine the effects of intra-environmental coupling on decoherence by constructing a low temperature spin--spin-bath model of an atomic impurity in a Debye crystal. The impurity interacts with phonons of the crystal through anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions. The reduced density matrix of the central spin representing the impurity is calculated by dynamically integrating the full Schroedinger equation for the spin--spin-bath model for different thermally weighted eigenstates of the spin-bath. Exact numerical results show that increasing the intra-environmental coupling results in suppression of decoherence. This effect could play an important role in the construction of solid state quantum devices such as quantum computers.

abstract: In this paper, we derived Lorentz covariant quantum Liouville equation for the density operator which describes the relativistic quantum information processing from Tomonaga-Schwinger equation and an exact formal solution for the reduced-density-operator is obtained using the projector operator technique and the functional calculus. When all the members of the family of the hypersurfaces become flat hyperplanes, it is shown that our results agree with those of non-relativistic case which is valid only in some specified reference frame. To show that our new formulation can be applied to practical problems, we derived the polarization of the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics up to the second order. The formulation presented in this work is general and might be applied to related fields such as quantum electrodynamics and relativistic statistical mechanics.

abstract: Chemical potential is a property which involves the effect of interaction between the components of a system, and it results from the whole system. In this paper, we argue that for two particles which have interacted via their spins and are now spatially separated, the so-called Bell's locality condition implies that the chemical potential of each particle is an individual property. Here is a point where quantum statistical mechanics and the local hidden variable theories are in conflict. Based on two distinct concepts of chemical potential, the two theories predict two different patterns for the energy levels of a system of two entangled particles. In this manner, we show how one can distinguish the non-separable features of a two-particle system.

In order to study its robustness against the optimal individual attacks, we derive the information gained by a potential eavesdropper applying a cloning-based attack.

This is an algebro-topological object (non-trivial only for mixed states) which captures the localisation of entanglement of the state. Particular examples of separability polytopes for 3-partite systems are explicitly provided. It turns out that this characterisation of entanglement is associated with simulation of arbitrary unitary operations by 1- and 2-qubit gates. A topological description of how entanglement changes in course of such simulation is provided.

abstract: We present a set of concrete and realistic ideas for the implementation of a small-scale quantum computer using electron spins in lateral GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots. Initialization is based on leads in the quantum Hall regime with tunable spin-polarization. Read-out hinges on spin-to-charge conversion via spin-selective tunneling to or from the leads, followed by measurement of the number of electron charges on the dot via a charge detector. Single-qubit manipulation relies on a microfabricated wire located close to the quantum dot, and two-qubit interactions are controlled via the tunnel barrier connecting the respective quantum dots. Based on these ideas, we have begun a series of experiments in order to demonstrate unitary control and to measure the coherence time of individual electron spins in quantum dots.

abstract: A scheme is presented for protecting one-qubit quantum information against decoherence due to a general environment and local exchange interactions. The scheme operates essentially by distributing information over two pairs of qubits and through error prevention procedures. In the scheme, quantum information is encoded through a decoherence-free subspace for collective phase errors and exchange errors affecting the qubits in pairs; leakage out of the encoding space due to amplitude damping is reduced by quantum Zeno effect. In addition, how to construct decoherence-free states for n-qubit information against phase and exchange errors is discussed.

abstract: In this paper, we present an architecture and implementation algorithm such that digital data can be switched in the quantum domain. First we define the connection digraph which can be used to describe the behavior of a switch at a given time, then we show how a connection digraph can be implemented using elementary quantum gates. The proposed mechanism supports unicasting as well as multicasting, and is strict-sense non-blocking. It can be applied to perform either circuit switching or packet switching. Compared with a traditional space or time domain switch, the proposed switching mechanism is more scalable. Assuming an n-by-n quantum switch, the space consumption grows linearly, i.e. O(n), while the time complexity is O(1) for unicasting, and O(log n) for multicasting. Based on these advantages, a high throughput switching device can be built simply by increasing the number of I/O ports.

abstract: Two-qubit operations may be characterized by their capacities for communication, both with and without free entanglement, and their capacity for creating entanglement. We establish a set of inequalities that give an ordering to the capacities of two-qubit unitary operations. Specifically, we show that the capacities for entanglement creation and bidirectional communication without entanglement assistance are at least as great as half the bidirectional communication capacity with entanglement assistance. In addition, we show that the bidirectional communication that can be performed using an ensemble may be increased via a two-qubit unitary operation by twice the operation's capacity for entanglement.

abstract: The long time behaviour of the survival probability of initial state and its dependence on the initial states are considered, for the one dimensional free quantum particle. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the time evolution operator at long times, in terms of the integral operators. This enables us to obtain the asymptotic formula for the survival probability of the initial state $\psi (x)$, which is assumed to decrease sufficiently rapidly at large $|x|$. We then show that the behaviour of the survival probability at long times is determined by that of the initial state $\psi$ at zero momentum $k=0$. Indeed, it is proved that the survival probability can exhibit the various power-decays like $t^{-2m-1}$ for an arbitrary non-negative integers $m$ as $t \to \infty $, corresponding to the initial states with the condition $\hat{\psi} (k) = O(k^m)$ as $k\to 0$.

abstract: The behavior of both the survival S(t) and nonescape P(t) probabilities at long times for the one-dimensional free particle system is shown to be closely connected to that of the initial wave packet at small momentum. We prove that both S(t) and P(t) asymptotically exhibit the same power-law decrease at long times, when the initial wave packet in momentum representation behaves as O(1) or O(k) at small momentum. On the other hand, if the integer m becomes greater than 1, S(t) and P(t) decrease in different power-laws at long times.

abstract: Decoherence is the main problem to be solved before quantum computers can be built. To control decoherence, it is possible to use error correction methods, but these methods are themselves noisy quantum computation processes. In this work we study the ability of Steane's and Shor's fault-tolerant recovering methods, as well a modification of Steane's ancilla network, to correct errors in qubits. We test a way to measure correctly ancilla's fidelity for these methods, and state the possibility of carrying out an effective error correction through a noisy quantum channel, even using noisy error correction methods.

abstract: A system of interacting qubits can be viewed as a non-i.i.d quantum information source. A possible model of such a source is provided by a quantum spin system, in which spin-1/2 particles located at sites of a lattice interact with each other. We establish the limit for the compression of information from such a source and show that asymptotically it is given by the von Neumann entropy rate. Our result can be viewed as a quantum analog of Shannon's noiseless coding theorem for a class of non - i.i.d. quantum information sources.

abstract: The ``N-Box Experiment'' is a much-discussed thought experiment in quantum mechanics. It is claimed by some authors that a single particle prepared in a superposition of N+1 box locations and which is subject to a final ``post-selection'' measurement corresponding to a different superposition can be said to have occupied ``with certainty'' N boxes during the intervening time. However, others have argued that under closer inspection, this surprising claim fails to hold. Aharonov and Vaidman have continued their advocacy of the claim in question by proposing a variation on the N-box experiment, in which the boxes are replaced by shutters and the pre- and post-selected particle is entangled with a photon. These authors argue that the resulting ``N-shutter experiment'' strengthens their original claim regarding the N-box experiment. It is argued in this paper that the apparently surprising features of this variation are no more robust than those of the N-box experiment and that it is not accurate to say that the particle is ``with certainty'' in all N shutters at any given time.

abstract: Which gates are universal for quantum computation? Although it is well known that certain gates on two-level quantum systems (qubits), such as the controlled-not (CNOT), are universal when assisted by arbitrary one-qubit gates, it has only recently become clear precisely what class of two-qubit gates is universal in this sense. Here we present an elementary proof that any entangling two-qubit gate is universal for quantum computation, when assisted by one-qubit gates. A proof of this important result for systems of arbitrary finite dimension has been provided by J. L. and R. Brylinski [arXiv:quant-ph/0108062, 2001]; however, their proof relies upon a long argument using advanced mathematics. In contrast, our proof provides a simple constructive procedure which is close to optimal and experimentally practical [C. M. Dawson and A. Gilchrist, online implementation of the procedure described herein (2002), this http URL].

abstract: New status in quantum mechanics is connected with recent achievements in the inverse problem. With its help instead of about ten exactly solvable models which serve as a basis of the contemporary education there are infinite (!) number, even complete sets of such models. So, the whole quantum mechanics is embraced by them. They correspond to all possible variations of spectral parameters which determine all properties of quantum systems. There appears a possibility to change at wish quantum objects by variation of these parameters as control levers and examine quantum systems in different thinkable situations. As a result, we acquire a vision of the intrinsic logic of behavior of any thinkable system, including real ones. The regularities revealed by computer visualization of these models were reformulated into unexpectedly simple universal rules of arbitrary transformations and what is more, their elementary constituents were discovered (new breakthrough). Of these elementary "bricks" it is possible in principle to construct objects with any given properties. This book of inverse problem quantum pictures is utmost intelligible and recommended to any physicists, chemists, mathematicians, biologists from students to professors who are interested in laws of the microworld.

We also discuss specific 3D photonic microstructure architectures in which our model can be realized and the feasibility of implementing such a device using ${Er}^{3+}$ ions that produce single photons at the telecommunication wavelength of $1.55 \mu$m.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate quantum teleportation for continuous variables using squeezed-state entanglement. The teleportation fidelity for a real experimental system is calculated explicitly, including relevant imperfection factors such as propagation losses, detection inefficiencies and phase fluctuations. The inferred fidelity for input coherent states is F = 0.61 +- 0.02, which when corrected for the efficiency of detection by the output observer, gives a fidelity of 0.62. By contrast, the projected result based on the independently measured entanglement and efficiencies is 0.69. The teleportation protocol is explained in detail, including a discussion of discrepancy between experiment and theory, as well as of the limitations of the current apparatus.

abstract: A formulation of quantum mechanics with additive and multiplicative (q-)difference operators instead of differential operators is studied from first principles. Borel-quantisation on smooth configuration spaces is used as guiding quantisation method. After a short discussion this method is translated step-by-step to a framework based on difference operators. To restrict the resulting plethora of possible quantisations additional assumptions motivated by simplicity and plausibility are required. Multiplicative difference operators and the corresponding q-Borel kinematics are given on the circle and its N-point discretisation; the connection to q-deformations of the Witt algebra is discussed. For a "natural" choice of the q-kinematics a corresponding q-difference evolution equation is obtained. This study shows general difficulties for a generalisation of a physical theory from a known one to a "new" framework.

abstract: Searching for marked items from an unsorted database is an important scientific problem and a benchmark for computing devices as well. Using a 7-qubit liquid NMR quantum computer, we have demonstrated successfully an hybrid quantum fetching algorithm that finds marked items using only a single query. The essential idea is the operation of quantum computers in parallel. We gave the detailed pulse sequence for coherent control of the 7 qubits. The pulse sequence demonstrated here is not only useful for ensemble quantum computation, but also can be regarded as a general purpose control-gate which is useful for experimental design of quantum algorithms and general quantum information processing task in other quantum computer schemes. A generalization of the algorithm that is scalable to arbitrary qubit number is also provided.

abstract: We consider how randomness can be made to play a useful role in quantum information processing - in particular, for decoherence control and the implementation of quantum algorithms. For a two-level system in which the decoherence channel is non-dissipative, we show that decoherence suppression is possible if memory is present in the channel. Random switching between two potentially harmful noise sources can then provide a source of stochastic control. Such random switching can also be used in an advantageous way for the implementation of quantum algorithms.

abstract: The fundamental principles of complementarity and uncertainty are shown to be related to the possibility of joint unsharp measurements of pairs of noncommuting quantum observables. A new joint measurement scheme for complementary observables is proposed. The measured observables are represented as positive operator valued measures (POVMs), whose intrinsic fuzziness parameters are found to satisfy an intriguing pay-off relation reflecting the complementarity. At the same time, this relation represents an instance of a Heisenberg uncertainty relation for measurement imprecisions. A model-independent consideration show that this uncertainty relation is logically connected with the joint measurability of the POVMs in question.

abstract: We study the +/- J random-plaquette Z_2 gauge model (RPGM) in three spatial dimensions, a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional +/- J random-bond Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the ``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the temperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0}, the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding p_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding p_{c0}=.1031 +/-.0001. Our value of p_{c0} is incompatible with the value of p_c=.1093 +/-.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in disagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is vertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line.

abstract: It is generally believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is impossible, due to widespread acceptance of an impossibility proof that utilizes quantum entaglement cheating. In this paper, we delineate how the impossibiliy proof formulation misses various types of quantum bit commitment protocols based on two-way quantum communications. We point out some of the gaps in the impossibility proof reasoning, and present corresponding counterexamples. Four different types of bit commitment protocols are constructed with several new protocol techniques. A specific Type 4 protocol is described and proved unconditionally secure. Security analysis of a Type 1 protocol and a Type 2 protocol are also sketched. The security of Type 3 protocols is as yet open. A development of quantum statistical decision theory and quantum games is needed to provie a complete security analysis of many such protocols.

abstract: Quantum entanglement distillation protocols are LOCC protocols between Alice and Bob that convert imperfect EPR pairs, or, in general, partially entangled bipartite states into perfect or near-perfect EPR pairs. The classical communication complexity of these protocols is the minimal amount of classical communication needed for the conversion. In this paper, we focus on the communication complexity of protocols that operate with incomplete information, i.e., where the inputs are mixed states and/or prepared adversarially. We study 3 models of imperfect EPR pairs. In the measure-r model, r out of n EPR pairs are measured by an adversary; in the depolarization model, Bob's share of qubits underwent a depolarization channel; in the fidelity model, the only information Alice and Bob possess is the fidelity of the shared state. For the measure-r model and the depolarization model, we prove tight and almost-tight bounds on the outcome of LOCC protocols that don't use communication. For the fidelity model, we prove a lower bound on the communication complexity that matches the upper bound given by Ambainis, Smith, and Yang [ASY02].

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We present a general analysis for the interaction of a probe laser radiation with a coherently prepared molecular Raman medium. We describe a general formalism which includes dispersive effects, such as group velocity and group velocity dispersion (GVD). When dispersion is negligible, the analysis is especially simple and insightful. We show that molecular oscillations result in a modulated instantaneous susceptibility of the medium. The effect of the time-varying susceptibility on a probe laser pulse is two-fold: the output frequency becomes modulated because of the time-varying phase velocity, and the pulse shape becomes deformed because of the time-varying group velocity. We identify two mechanisms for pulse compression: (1) Frequency chirping with subsequent pulse compression by normal linear GVD (possibly in the same medium) and (2) Compression due to the time-varying group velocity. We analyze various aspects of pulse compression in the coherent Raman medium and derive conservation relations for this process. When we consider a probe laser pulse which is much shorter than the molecular oscillation period, we observe frequency chirping, compression, or stretching of this pulse, depending on its relative timing with respect to the molecular oscillations. Based on our analysis, we propose a method for selective compression or frequency conversion of single ultrashort pulses.

Quantum mechanics is believed to be capable of explaining the enigma of conscious experience, however till now there is not good enough model considering both the data from clinical neurology and having some explanatory power. In this paper is presented a novel model in defence of macroscopic quantum events within and between neural cells. The synaptic beta-neurexin/neuroligin-1 adhesive protein complex is claimed to be not just the core of the excitatory glutamatergic CNS synapse, instead it is a device mediating entanglement between the cytoskeletons of the cortical neurons. Thus the macroscopic coherent quantum state can extend throughout large brain cortical areas and the subsequent collapse of the wavefunction could affect simultaneously the subneuronal events in millions of neurons. The neuroligin-1/beta-neurexin/synaptotagmin-1 complex also controls the process of exocytosis and provides an interesting and simple mechanism for retrograde signalling during learning-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity. A brief outlook of the molecular machinery driving neuromediator release through exocytosis is provided with particular emphasis on the possibility for vibrationally-assisted tunneling.

abstract: We derive semiclassical quantization conditions for systems with spin. To this end one has to define the notion of integrability for the corresponding classical system which is given by a combination of the translational motion and classical spin precession. We determine the geometry of the invariant manifolds of this product dynamics which support semiclassical solutions of the wave equation. The semiclassical quantization conditions contain a new term, which is of the same order as the Maslov correction. This term is identified as a rotation angle for a classical spin vector. Applied to the relativistic Kepler problem the procedure sheds some light on the amazing success of Sommerfeld's theory of fine structure [Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) 51 (1916) 1-94].

This allows us to discriminate two neighboring frequencies with a resolution nearly 40 times better than the limit set by the Fourier inequality. Furthermore, numerical studies indicate that there is no limit, but the loss of signal, to this resolution, opening ways for the development of sub-Fourier quantum-chaotic signal processing.

abstract: We discuss possibilities of utilizing superconductors with Cooper condensates in triplet pairing states (where the spin of condensate pairs is S=1) for practical realization of quantum computers. Superconductors with triplet pairing condensates have features that are unique and cannot be found in the usual (singlet pairing, S=0) superconductors. The symmetry of the order parameter in some triplet superconductors (e.g., ruthenates) corresponds to doubly-degenerate chiral states. These states can serve as qubit base states for quantum computing.

abstract: Recent work has connected the type of fidelity decay in perturbed quantum models to the presence of chaos in the associated classical models. We demonstrate that a system's rate of fidelity decay under repeated perturbations may be measured efficiently on a quantum information processor, and analyze the conditions under which this indicator is a reliable probe of quantum chaos and related statistical properties of the unperturbed system. The type and rate of the decay are not dependent on the eigenvalue statistics of the unperturbed system, but depend on the system's eigenvector statistics in the eigenbasis of the perturbation operator. For random eigenvector statistics the decay is exponential with a rate fixed precisely by the variance of the perturbation's energy spectrum. Hence, even classically regular models can exhibit an exponential fidelity decay under generic quantum perturbations. These results clarify which perturbations can distinguish classically regular and chaotic quantum systems.

The new paper contains a to the conjecture that all extreme points of EBT maps are CQ when d > 2. quant-ph/0302032 Qubit Entanglement Breaking Channels by Mary Beth Ruskai contains the results oroginally in section 2. The main result is that for qubits, EBT maps are precisely the convex hull of those known as classical-quantum channels. The complete positivity conditions in a canonical parameterization are reviewed and used to formulate EBT constraints.

abstract: The derivation of the quantum retrodictive probability formula involves an error, an ambiguity. The end result is correct because this error appears twice, in such a way as to cancel itself. In addition, however, the usual expression for the probability itself contains the same ambiguity; this may lead to errors in its application. A generally applicable method is given to avoid such ambiguities altogether.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207104
abstract: A formalism is presented in which quantum particle dynamics can be developed on its own rather than `quantization' of an underlying classical theory. It is proposed that the unification of probability and dynamics should be considered as the basic feature of quantum theory. Arguments are given to show that when such a unification is attempted at the configuration space level, the wave funtions of Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger theory appear as the natural candidates for the desired unification. A *-algebra $\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ of (not necessarily bounded) linear operators acting on an appropriate dense set of these wave functions appears as the arena for quantum kinematics. A simple generalization of an existing formalism in noncommutative geometry is employed to develop the notion of generalized algebraic symplectic structure (GASS) which can accomodate classical and quantum symplectic structures as special cases. Quantum kinematics and dynamics is developed in in the framework of a noncommutative Hamiltonian system employing an appropriate GASS based in $ \mathcal{A}_{Q}$. The Planck constant is introduced at only one place -- in the quantum symplectic form; its appearance at conventional places is then automatic. Unitary Wigner symmetries appear as canonical transformations in the noncommutative Hamiltonian system. A straightforward treatment of quantum - classical correspondence is given in terms of appropriate GASSes.

abstract: An alternative description of quantum scattering processes rests on inhomogeneous terms amended to the Schroedinger equation. We detail the structure of sources that give rise to multipole scattering waves of definite angular momentum, and introduce pointlike multipole sources as their limiting case. Partial wave theory is recovered for freely propagating particles. We obtain novel results for ballistic scattering in an external uniform force field, where we provide analytical solutions for both the scattering waves and the integrated particle flux. Our theory directly applies to p-wave photodetachment in an electric field. Furthermore, illustrating the effects of extended sources, we predict some properties of vortex-bearing atom laser beams outcoupled from a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of gravity.

abstract: The Casimir effect in a dispersive and absorbing multilayered system is considered adopting the (net) vacuum-field pressure point of view to the Casimir force. Using the properties of the macroscopic field operators appropriate for absorbing systems and a convenient compact form of the Green function for a multilayer, a straightforward and transparent derivation of the Casimir force in a lossless layer of an otherwise absorbing multilayer is presented. The resulting expression in terms of the reflection coefficients of the surrounding stacks of layers is of the same form as that obtained by Zhou and Spruch for a purely dispersive multilayer using the (surface) mode summation method [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 52}, 297 (1995)]. Owing to the recursion relations which the generalized Fresnel coefficients satisfy, this result can be applied to more complex systems with planar symmetry. This is illustrated by calculating the Casimir force on a dielectric (metallic) slab in a planar cavity with realistic mirrors. Also, a relationship between the Casimir force and energy in two different layers is established.

abstract: A method of fundamental solutions has been used to study adiabatic transition amplitudes in two energy level systems for a class of Hamiltonians allowing some simplifications of Stokes graphs corresponding to such transitions. It has been shown that for simplest such cases the amplitudes take the Nikitin - Umanskii form but for more complicated ones they are formed by a sum of terms strictly related to a structure of Stokes graph corresponding to such cases. This paper corrects our previous one [Phys. Rev. A, 63 052101 (2001)] and its results are in a full agreement with the ones of Joye, Mileti and Pfister [Phys. Rev. A, 44 4280 (1991)].

Generation of various entangled states like |0,2>+|2,0> are discussed and in far off resonance case generation of entangled state of two coherent states is discussed.

abstract: The highest information rate at which quantum error-correction schemes work reliably on a channel, which is called the quantum capacity, is proven to be lower bounded by the limit of the quantity termed coherent information maximized over the set of input density operators which are proportional to the projections onto the code spaces of symplectic stabilizer codes. Quantum channels to be considered are those subject to independent errors and modeled as tensor products of copies of a completely positive linear map on a Hilbert space of finite dimension, and the codes that are proven to have the desired performance are symplectic stabilizer codes. On the depolarizing channel, this work's bound is actually the highest possible rate at which symplectic stabilizer codes work reliably.

We present novel design rules for micropillars in view of this application and show that for the well-mastered GaAs/AlAs system more than 70% of the emission can be concentrated into the collimated emission beam associated with the fundamental cavity mode.

We show that the amount of information gained in a measurement is not equal to the amount of entanglement between the system and the apparatus, but is instead equal to the degree of classical correlations between the two. As a consequence, we derive an uncertainty-like expression relating the information gain in the measurement and the initial mixedness of the apparatus. Final entanglement between the environment and the apparatus is also shown to be relevant for the efficiency of the measurement.

abstract: A simple experimental setup consisting of a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source and passive linear optics is proposed for conditional preparation of a maximally entangled polarization state of two photons. Successful preparation is unambiguously heralded by coincident detection of four auxiliary photons. The proposed scheme utilizes the down-conversion term corresponding to the generation of three pairs of photons. We analyze imperfect detection of the auxiliary photons and demonstrate that its deleterious effect on the fidelity of the prepared state can be suppressed at the cost of decreasing the efficiency of the scheme.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Fault tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) networks are studied by a combination of numerical and approximate analytical treatments. The probability of failure of the recovery operation is calculated for a variety of CSS codes, including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and more noise-tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries which can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various parameters. The main parameters are the gate (gamma) and memory (epsilon) failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t_m required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on the [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise gamma_0 is a function of epsilon/gamma and t_m; example values are {epsilon/gamma, t_m, gamma_0} = {1, 1, 0.001}, {0.01, 1, 0.003}, {1, 100, 0.0001}, {0.01, 100, 0.002}, assuming zero cost for information transport. This represents an order of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise, compared with previous calculations, which is made possible by recent insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process.

abstract: How mixed can one component of a bi-partite system be initially and still become entangled through interaction with a thermalized partner? We address this question here. In particular, we consider the question of how mixed a two-level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in the course of the time evolution according to a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction. We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is initially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has been prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice for the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode, three cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created immediately, (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time different from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains positive at all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial temperature of the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable during the time evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower initial temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement quantitatively, by evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by providing an analytical upper bound.

abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the noise in a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement should be no less than the limit set by Planck's constant, hbar/2, as demonstrated by Heisenberg's thought experiment using a gamma-ray microscope. Here I show that this common assumption is false: a universally valid trade-off relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument. An experimental implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.

abstract: We propose a novel configuration that utilizes electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to tailor a fiber mode propagating inside a thin optical fiber and coherently control its dispersion properties to drastically reduce the group velocity of the fiber mode. The key to this proposal is: the evanescent-like field of the thin fiber strongly couples with the surrounding active medium, so that the EIT condition is met by the medium. We show how the properties of the fiber mode is modified due to the EIT medium, both numerically and analytically. We demonstrate that the group velocity of the new modified fiber mode can be drastically reduced (approximately 44 m/sec) using the coherently prepared orthohydrogen doped in a matrix of parahydrogen crystal as the EIT medium.

abstract: A simple classical probabilistic system (a simple card game) classically exemplifies Aharonov and Vaidman's "Three-Box 'paradox'" [J. Phys. A 24, 2315 (1991)], implying that the Three-Box example is neither quantal nor a paradox and leaving one less difficulty to busy the interpreters of quantum mechanics. An ambiguity in the usual expression of the retrodiction formula is shown to have misled Albert, Aharonov, and D'Amato [Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 5 (1985)] to a result not, in fact, "curious"; the discussion illustrates how to avoid this ambiguity.

abstract: The statistics of the light emitted by two-level lasers is evaluated on the basis of generalized rate equations. According to that approach, all fluctuations are interpreted as being caused by the jumps that occur in active and detecting atoms. The intra-cavity Fano factor and the photo-current spectral density are obtained analytically for Poissonian and quiet pumps. The algebra is simple and the formulas hold for small as well as large pumping rates. Lasers exhibit excess noise at low pumping levels.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207128
abstract: The relative entropy description of Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) classical channel capacity is applied to single qubit channels. A simple formula for the relative entropy of qubit density matrices in the Bloch sphere representation is derived. This formula is combined with the King-Ruskai-Szarek-Werner qubit channel ellipsoid picture to analyze several unital and non-unital qubit channels in detail. An alternate proof that the optimal HSW signalling states for single qubit unital channels are those states with the minimum channel output entropy is presented. The derivation is based on the symmetries of the qubit relative entropy formula and the King-Ruskai-Szarek-Werner qubit channel ellipsoid picture. A proof is given that the average output density matrix of any set of optimal HSW signalling states for a (qubit or non-qubit) quantum channel is unique.

abstract: We revisit the relationship between quantum separability and the sign of the relative q-entropies of composite quantum systems. The q-entropies depend on the density matrix eigenvalues p_i through the quantity omega_q = sum_i p_i^q. Renyi's and Tsallis' measures constitute particular instances of these entropies. We perform a systematic numerical survey of the space of mixed states of two-qubit systems in order to determine, as a function of the degree of mixture, and for different values of the entropic parameter q, the volume in state space occupied by those states characterized by positive values of the relative entropy. Similar calculations are performed for qubit-qutrit systems and for composite systems described by Hilbert spaces of larger dimensionality. We pay particular attention to the limit case q --> infinity. Our numerical results indicate that, as the dimensionalities of both subsystems increase, composite quantum systems tend, as far as their relative q-entropies are concerned, to behave in a classical way.

This also means that the algebraic-geometric separability criterion proposed here can be used to dectect all low rank entangled mixed states outside a measure zero set.

abstract: We present an efficient quantum algorithm for estimating Gauss sums over finite fields and finite rings. This is a natural problem as the description of a Gauss sum can be done without reference to a black box function. With a reduction from the discrete logarithm problem to Gauss sum estimation we also give evidence that this problem is hard for classical algorithms. The workings of the quantum algorithm rely on the interaction between the additive characters of the Fourier transform and the multiplicative characters of the Gauss sum.

abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to Doppler cooling of atoms by one- or two-photon transitions when the natural width of the excited level is so small that the process leads to a Doppler temperature comparable to the recoil temperature. A ``quenching'' of the sharp line is introduced in order to allow control of the time scale of the problem. In such limit, the usual Fokker-Planck equation does not correctly describe the cooling process. We propose a generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation and derive a new model which is able to reproduce correctly the numerical results, up to the recoil limit. Two cases of practical interest, one-photon Doppler cooling of strontium and two-photon Doppler cooling of hydrogen are considered.

abstract: An n-qubit quantum register can in principle be completely controlled by operating on a single qubit that interacts with the register via an appropriate fixed interaction. We consider a hypothetical system consisting of n spin-1/2 nuclei that interact with an electron spin via a magnetic interaction. We describe algorithms that measure non-trivial joint observables on the register by acting on the control spin only. For large n this is not an efficient model for universal quantum computation but it can be modified to an efficient one if one allows n possible positions of the control particle. This toy model of measurements illustrates in which way specific interactions between the register and a probe particle support specific types of joint measurements in the sense that some joint observables can be measured by simple sequences of operations on the probe particle.

abstract: The Partition Ensemble Fallacy was recently applied to claim no quantum coherence exists in coherent states produced by lasers. We show that this claim relies on an untestable belief of a particular prior distribution of absolute phase. One's choice for the prior distribution for an unobservable quantity is a matter of `religion'. We call this principle the Partition Ensemble Fallacy Fallacy. Further, we show an alternative approach to construct a relative-quantity Hilbert subspace where unobservability of certain quantities is guaranteed by global conservation laws. This approach is applied to coherent states and constructs an approximate relative-phase Hilbert subspace.

abstract: We discuss several methods for unambiguous state discrimination of N symmetric coherent states using linear optics and photodetectors. One type of measurements is shown to be optimal in the limit of small photon numbers for any N. For the special case of N=4 this measurement can be fruitfully used by the receiving end (Bob) in an implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using faint laser pulses. In particular, if Bob detects only a single photon the procedure is equivalent to the standard measurement that he would have to perform in a single-photon implementation of BB84, if he detects two photons Bob will unambiguously know the bit sent to him in 50% of the cases without having to exchange basis information, and if three photons are detected, Bob will know unambiguously which quantum state was sent.

abstract: The marriage of Quantum Physics and Information Technology, originally motivated by the need for miniaturization, has recently opened the way to the realization of radically new information-processing devices, with the possibility of guaranteed secure cryptographic communications, and tremendous speedups of some complex computational tasks. Among the many problems posed by the new information technology there is the need of characterizing the new quantum devices, making a complete identification and characterization of their functioning. As we will see, quantum mechanics provides us with a powerful tool to achieve the task easily and efficiently: this tools is the so called quantum entanglement, the basis of the quantum parallelism of the future computers. We present here the first full experimental quantum characterization of a single-qubit device. The new method, we may refer to as ''quantum radiography'', uses a Pauli Quantum Tomography at the output of the device, and needs only a single entangled state at the input, which works on the test channel as all possible input states in quantum parallel. The method can be easily extended to any n-qubits device.

We demonstrate that this cost is directly related to the logarithmic negativity, thereby providing the operational interpretation for this easily computable entanglement measure. As examples we discuss general Werner states and arbitrary bi-partite Gaussian states. Equipped with this result we then prove that for the anti-symmetric Werner state PPT-cost and PPT-entanglement of distillation coincide giving the first example of a truly mixed state for which entanglement manipulation is asymptotically reversible.

abstract: Recent work has shown how to use the laws of quantum mechanics to keep classical and quantum bits secret in a number of different circumstances. Among the examples are private quantum channels, quantum secret sharing and quantum data hiding. In this paper we show that a method for keeping two classical bits hidden in any such scenario can be used to construct a method for keeping one quantum bit hidden, and vice--versa. In the realm of quantum data hiding, this allows us to construct bipartite and multipartite hiding schemes for qubits from the previously known constructions for hiding bits. Our method also gives a simple proof that two bits of shared randomness are required to construct a private quantum channel hiding one qubit.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Spectral determinants have proven to be valuable tools for resumming the periodic orbits in the Gutzwiller trace formula of chaotic systems. We investigate these tools in the context of integrable systems to which these techniques have not been previously applied. Our specific model is a stroboscopic map of an integrable Hamiltonian system with quadratic action dependence, for which each stage of the semiclassical approximation can be controlled. It is found that large errors occur in the semiclassical traces due to edge corrections which may be neglected if the eigenvalues are obtained by Fourier transformation over the long time dynamics. However, these errors cause serious harm to the spectral approximations of an integrable system obtained via the spectral determinants. The symmetry property of the spectral determinant does not generally alleviate the error, since it sometimes sheds a pair of eigenvalues from the unit circle. By taking into account the leading order asymptotics of the edge corrections, the spectral determinant method makes a significant recovery.

abstract: Unentangled pure states on a bipartite system are exactly the coherent states with respect to the group of local transformations. What aspects of the study of entanglement are applicable to generalized coherent states? Conversely, what can be learned about entanglement from the well-studied theory of coherent states? With these questions in mind, we characterize unentangled pure states as extremal states when considered as linear functionals on the local Lie algebra. As a result, a relativized notion of purity emerges, showing that there is a close relationship between purity, coherence and (non-)entanglement. To a large extent, these concepts can be defined and studied in the even more general setting of convex cones of states. Based on the idea that entanglement is relative, we suggest considering these notions in the context of partially ordered families of Lie algebras or convex cones, such as those that arise naturally for multipartite systems. The study of entanglement includes notions of local operations and, for information-theoretic purposes, entanglement measures and ways of scaling systems to enable asymptotic developments. We propose ways in which these may be generalized to the Lie-algebraic setting, and to a lesser extent to the convex-cones setting. One of our original motivations for this program is to understand the role of entanglement-like concepts in condensed matter. We discuss how our work provides tools for analyzing the correlations involved in quantum phase transitions and other aspects of condensed-matter systems.

abstract: State estimation is a classical problem in quantum information. In optimization of estimation scheme, to find a lower bound to the error of the estimator is a very important step. So far, all the proposed tractable lower bounds use derivative of density matrix. However, sometimes, we are interested in quantities with singularity, e.g. concurrence etc. In the paper, lower bounds to a Mean Square Error (MSE) of an estimator are derived for a quantum estimation problem without smoothness assumptions. Our main idea is to replace the derivative by difference, as is done in classical estimation theory. We applied the inequalities to several examples, and derived optimal estimator for some of them.

For ferromagnetic layers separated by vacuum (or a dielectric) such boundary-conditions are influenced by the magneto-optical Kerr effect. We will show that this gives rise to a long-range magnetic interaction and discuss the effect for two different configurations (magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the layers). Analytical expressions are derived for two models and compared to numerical calculations. Numerical calculations of the effect for Fe are also presented and the possibility of an experimental observation of the Casimir magnetic interaction is discussed.

It is natural to ask how many such elementary gates are needed to implement more elaborate gates or circuits. Recall that a controlled-U gate can be realized with two controlled-not gates and four single qubit gates. We prove that this implementation is optimal if and only if the matrix U satisfies the conditions tr U != 0, tr UX != 0, and det U != 1. We also derive optimal implementations in the non-generic cases.

abstract: This paper introduces quantum analogues of non-interactive perfect and statistical zero-knowledge proof systems. Similar to the classical cases, it is shown that sharing randomness or entanglement is necessary for non-trivial protocols of non-interactive quantum perfect and statistical zero-knowledge. It is also shown that, with sharing EPR pairs a priori, the class of languages having one-sided bounded error non-interactive quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof systems has a natural complete problem. Non-triviality of such a proof system is based on the fact proved in this paper that the Graph Non-Automorphism problem, which is not known in BQP, can be reduced to our complete problem. Our results may be the first non-trivial quantum zero-knowledge proofs secure even against dishonest quantum verifiers, since our protocols are non-interactive, and thus the zero-knowledge property does not depend on whether the verifier in the protocol is honest or not. A restricted version of our complete problem derives a natural complete problem for BQP.

abstract: The transient response of a stationary state of a quantum particle in a step potential to an instantaneous change in the step height (a simplified model for a sudden bias switch in an electronic semiconductor device) is solved exactly by means of a semianalytical expression. The characteristic times for the transient process up to the new stationary state are identified. A comparison is made between the exact results and an approximate method.

abstract: The generation of an entangled coherent state is one of the most important ingredients of quantum information processing using coherent states. Recently, numerous schemes to achieve this task have been proposed. In order to generate travelling-wave entangled coherent states, cross phase modulation, optimized by optical Kerr effect enhancement in a dense medium in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) regime, seems to be very promising. In this scenario, we propose a fully quantized model of a double-EIT scheme recently proposed [D. Petrosyan and G. Kurizki, {\sl Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 65}, 33833 (2002)]: the quantization step is performed adopting a fully Hamiltonian approach. This allows us to write effective equations of motion for two interacting quantum fields of light that show how the dynamics of one field depends on the photon-number operator of the other. The preparation of a Schr\"odinger cat state, which is a superposition of two distinct coherent states, is briefly exposed. This is based on non-linear interaction via double-EIT of two light fields (initially prepared in coherent states) and on a detection step performed using a $50:50$ beam splitter and two photodetectors. In order to show the entanglement of a generated entangled coherent state, we suggest to measure the joint quadrature variance of the field. We show that the entangled coherent states satisfy the sufficient condition for entanglement based on quadrature variance measurement. We also show how robust our scheme is against a low detection efficiency of homodyne detectors.

abstract: We propose a simple geometrical approach for finding the Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition of Bell decomposable states of 2 otimes 2 quantum systems. We show that in these systems, the weight of the pure entangled part in the decomposition is equal to the concurrence of the state. It is also shown that the optimized separable part of L-S decomposition minimizes the von Neumann relative entropy. We also obtain the decomposition for a class of mixed states by using some LQCC actions. It is also shown that for these states the average concurrence of L-S decomposition is equal to their concurrence.

abstract: We study information storage in noisy quantum registers and computers using the methods of statistical dynamics. We develop the concept of a strictly contractive quantum channel in order to construct mathematical models of physically realizable, i.e., nonideal, quantum registers and computers. Strictly contractive channels are simple enough, yet exhibit very interesting features, which are meaningful from the physical point of view. In particular, they allow us to incorporate the crucial assumption of finite precision of all experimentally realizable operations. Strict contractivity also helps us gain insight into the thermodynamics of noisy quantum evolutions (approach to equilibrium). Our investigation into thermodynamics focuses on the entropy-energy balance in quantum registers and computers under the influence of strictly contractive noise. Using entropy-energy methods, we are able to appraise the thermodynamical resources needed to maintain reliable operation of the computer. We also obtain estimates of the largest tolerable error rate. Finally, we explore the possibility of going beyond the standard circuit model of error correction, namely constructing quantum memory devices on the basis of interacting particle systems at low temperatures.

abstract: Starting point is a given semigroup of completely positive maps on the 2 times 2 matrices. This semigroup describes the irreversible evolution of a decaying 2-level atom. Using the integral-sum kernel approach to quantum stochastic calculus we couple the 2-level atom to an environment, which in our case will be interpreted as the electromagnetic field. The irreversible time evolution of the 2-level atom then stems from the reversible time evolution of atom and field together. Mathematically speaking, we have constructed a Markov dilation of the semigroup. The next step is to drive the atom by a laser and to count the photons emitted into the field by the decaying 2-level atom. For every possible sequence of photon counts we construct a map that gives the time evolution of the 2-level atom inferred by that sequence. The family of maps that we obtain in this way forms a so-called Davies process. In his book Davies describes the structure of these processes, which brings us into the field of quantum trajectories. Within our model we calculate the jump operators and we briefly describe the resulting counting process.

abstract: This is the final paper in a series that considers the rules of engagement between conscious states and physiological states. In this paper, we imagine that an endogenous quantum mechanical superposition is created by a classical stimulus, and that this leads to a `physiological pulse' of states that are in superposition with one another. This pulse is correlated with a `conscious pulse' of the kind discussed in a previous paper (Conscious Pulse I). We then add a rule (5) to the four rules previously given. This rule addresses the effect of `pain' consciousness on both of these pulses, and in doing so, it validates the "Parallel Principle" applied to pain. Key words: Brain states, consciousness, conscious observer, macroscopic superposition, measurement, state reduction, state collapse, von Neumann.

abstract: A new method for generating entangled photons with controllable frequency correlation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is presented. The method entails initiating counter-propagating SPDC in a single-mode nonlinear waveguide by pumping with a pulsed beam perpendicular to the waveguide. The method offers several advantages over other schemes, including the ability to generate frequency-correlated photon pairs regardless of the dispersion characteristics of the system. Numerical evidence demonstrates the improvement provided by this source in the special case of frequency-correlated two-photon states.

abstract: A new quantum cryptography implementation is presented that combines one-way operation with an autocompensating feature that has hitherto only been available in implementations that require the signal to make a round trip between the users. Using the concept of advanced waves, it is shown that this new implementation is related to the round-trip implementations in the same way that Ekert's two-particle scheme is related to the original one-particle scheme of Bennett and Brassard. The practical advantages and disadvantages of the proposed implementation are discussed in the context of existing schemes.

abstract: A new paradigm for distributed quantum systems where information is a valuable resource is developed. After finding a unique measure for information, we construct a scheme for it's manipulation in analogy with entanglement theory. In this scheme instead of maximally entangled states, two parties distill local states. We show that, surprisingly, the main tools of entanglement theory are general enough to work in this opposite scheme. Up to plausible assumptions, we show that the amount of information that must be lost during the protocol of concentration of local information can be expressed as the relative entropy distance from some special set of states.

abstract: The interplay between two basic quantities -- quantum communication and information -- is investigated. Quantum communication is an important resource for quantum states shared by two parties and is directly related to entanglement. Recently, the amount of local information that can be drawn from a state has been shown to be closely related to the non-local properties of the state. Here we consider both formation and extraction processes, and analyze informational resources as a function of quantum communication. The resulting diagrams in information space allow us to observe phase-like transitions when correlations become classical.

We explain how quantum noise in QIP can be described and classified, and summarize the requirements that need to be satisfied for fault tolerance. Considering the capabilities of currently available quantum technology, the requirements appear daunting. But the idea of ``subsystems'' shows that these requirements can be met in many different, and often unexpected ways.

abstract: After a general introduction to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we give the basics of implementing quantum algorithms. We describe how qubits are realized and controlled with RF pulses, their internal interactions, and gradient fields. A peculiarity of NMR is that the internal interactions (given by the internal Hamiltonian) are always on. We discuss how they can be effectively turned off with the help of a standard NMR method called ``refocusing''. Liquid state NMR experiments are done at room temperature, leading to an extremely mixed (that is, nearly random) initial state. Despite this high degree of randomness, it is possible to investigate QIP because the relaxation time (the time scale over which useful signal from a computation is lost) is sufficiently long. We explain how this feature leads to the crucial ability of simulating a pure (non-random) state by using ``pseudopure'' states. We discuss how the ``answer'' provided by a computation is obtained by measurement and how this measurement differs from the ideal, projective measurement of QIP. We then give implementations of some simple quantum algorithms with a typical experimental result. We conclude with a discussion of what we have learned from NMR QIP so far and what the prospects for future NMR QIP experiments are.

abstract: The conventional postulate for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics is asymmetric in preparation and measurement, making retrodiction reliant on inference by use of Bayes' theorem. Here, a more fundamental symmetric postulate is presented, from which both predictive and retrodictive probabilities emerge immediately, even where measurement devices more general than those usually considered are involved. It is shown that the new postulate is perfectly consistent with the conventional postulate.

abstract: In the Jaynes-Cummings model a two-level atom interacts with a single-mode electromagnetic field. Quantum mechanics predicts collapses and revivals in the probability that a measurement will show the atom to be excited at various times after the initial preparation of the atom and field. In retrodictive quantum mechanics we seek the probability that the atom was prepared in a particular state given the initial state of the field and the outcome of a later measurement on the atom. Although this is not simply the time reverse of the usual predictive problem, we demonstrate in this paper that retrodictive collapses and revivals also exist. We highlight the differences between predictive and retrodictive evolutions and describe an interesting situation where the prepared state is essentially unretrodictable.

abstract: A physical theory of experiments carried out in a space-time region can accommodate a detector localized in another space-like separated region, in three, not necessarily exclusive, ways: 1) the detector formally collapses physical states across space-like separations, 2) the detector enables superluminal signals, and 3) the theory becomes logically inconsistent. If such a theory admits autonomous evolving states, the space-like collapse must be instantaneous. Time-like separation does not allow such conclusions. We also prove some simple results on structural stability: within the set of all possible theories, under a weak empirical topology, the set of all theories with superluminal signals and the set of all theories with retrograde signals are both open and dense.

abstract: In a previous study (quant-ph/9911058), several remarkably simple exact results were found, in certain specialized m-dimensional scenarios (m<5), for the a priori probability that a pair of qubits is unentangled/separable. The measure used was the volume element of the Bures metric (identically one-fourth the statistical distinguishability [SD] metric). Here, making use of a newly-developed (Euler angle) parameterization of the 4 x 4 density matrices (math-ph/0202002), we extend the analysis to the complete 15-dimensional convex set (C) of arbitrarily paired qubits -- the total SD volume of which is known to be \pi^8 / 1680 = \pi^8 / (2^4 3 5 7) = 5.64794. Using advanced quasi-Monte Carlo procedures (scrambled Halton sequences) for numerical integration in this high-dimensional space, we approximately (5.64851) reproduce that value, while obtaining an estimate of .416302 for the SD volume of separable states. We conjecture that this is but an approximation to \pi^6 /2310 = \pi^6 / (2 3 5 7 11) = .416186. The ratio of the two volumes, 8 / (11 \pi^2) = .0736881, would then constitute the exact Bures/SD probability of separability. The SD area of the 14-dimensional boundary of C is 142 \pi^7 / 12285 = 142 \pi^7 /(3^3 5 7 13) = 34.911, while we obtain a numerical estimate of 1.75414 for the SD area of the boundary of separable states.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A relation is obtained between weak values of quantum observables and the consistency criterion for histories of quantum events. It is shown that ``strange'' weak values for projection operators (such as values less than zero) always correspond to inconsistent families of histories. It is argued that using the ABL rule to obtain probabilities for counterfactual measurements corresponding to those strange weak values gives inconsistent results. This problem is shown to be remedied by using the conditional weight, or pseudo-probability, obtained from the multiple-time application of Luders' Rule. It is argued that an assumption of reverse causality (a form of time symmetry) implies that weak values obtain, in a restricted sense, at the time of the weak measurement as well as at the time of post-selection. Finally, it is argued that weak values are more appropriately characterised as multiple-time amplitudes than expectation values, and as such can have little to say about counterfactual questions.

abstract: The one-way quantum computer (QCc) is a universal scheme of quantum computation consisting only of one-qubit measurements on a particular entangled multi-qubit state, the cluster state. The computational model underlying the QCc is different from the quantum logic network model and it is based on different constituents. It has no quantum register and does not consist of quantum gates. The QCc is nevertheless quantum mechanical since it uses a highly entangled cluster state as the central physical resource. The scheme works by measuring quantum correlations of the universal cluster state.

abstract: A quantum model of neural network is introduced and its phase structure is examined. The model is an extension of the classical Z(2) gauged neural network of learning and recalling to a quantum model by replacing the Z(2) variables, $S_i = \pm1$ of neurons and $J_{ij} =\pm1$ of synaptic connections, to the U(1) phase variables, $S_i = \exp(i\phi_i)$ and $J_{ij} = \exp(i\theta_{ij}) $. These U(1) variables describe the phase parts of the wave functions (local order parameters) of neurons and synaptic connections. The model takes the form similar to the U(1) Higgs lattice gauge theory, the continuum limit of which is the well known Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. Its current may describe the flow of electric voltage along axons and chemical materials transfered via synaptic connections. The phase structure of the model at finite temperatures is examined by the mean-field theory, and Coulomb, Higgs and confinement phases are obtained. By comparing with the result of the Z(2) model, the quantum effects is shown to weaken the ability of learning and recalling.

abstract: We discuss the time evolution of quotations of stocks and commodities and show that corrections to the orthodox Bachelier model inspired by quantum mechanical time evolution of particles may be important. Our analysis shows that traders tactics can interfere as waves do and trader's strategies can be reproduced from the corresponding Wigner functions. The proposed interpretation of the chaotic movement of market prices imply that the Bachelier behaviour follows from short-time interference of tactics adopted (paths followed) by the rest of the world considered as a single trader and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck corrections to the Bachelier model should qualitatively matter only for large time scales. The famous smithonian invisible hand is interpreted as a short-time tactics of whole the market considered as a single opponent. We also propose a solution to the currency preference paradox.

abstract: We study the time evolution of a single spin coupled inhomogeneously to a spin environment. Such a system is realized by a single electron spin bound in a semiconductor nanostructure and interacting with surrounding nuclear spins. We find striking dependencies on the type of the initial state of the nuclear spin system. Simple product states show a profoundly different behavior than randomly correlated states whose time evolution provides an illustrative example of quantum parallelism and entanglement in a decoherence phenomenon.

abstract: We investigate the influence of dissipation on one- and two-qubit rotations in coupled semiconductor quantum dots, using a (pseudo) spin-boson model with adiabatically varying parameters. For weak dissipation, we solve a master equation, compare with direct perturbation theory, and derive an expression for the `fidelity loss' during a simple operation that adiabatically moves an electron between two coupled dots. We discuss the possibility of visualizing coherent quantum oscillations in electron `pump' currents, combining quantum adiabaticity and Coulomb blockade. In two-qubit spin-swap operations where the role of intermediate charge states has been discussed recently, we apply our formalism to calculate the fidelity loss due to charge tunneling between two dots.

abstract: We analyze the phenomena of Bose Novae, as described by Donley et al [Nature 412, 295 (2001)], by focusing on the behavior of excitations or fluctuations above the condensate, as driven by the dynamics of the condensate (rather than the dynamics of the condensate alone or the kinetics of the atoms). The dynamics of the condensate squeezes and amplifies the quantum excitations, mixing the positive and negative frequency components of their wave functions thereby creating particles which appear as bursts and jets. By analyzing the changing amplitude and particle content of these excitations, our simple physical picture (based on a test field approximation) explains well the overall features of the Bose Novae phenomena and provide excellent quantitative fits with experimental data on several aspects, such as the scaling behavior of the collapse time and the amount of particles in the jet. The predictions of the bursts at this level of approximation is less than satisfactory but may be improved on by including the backreaction of the excitations on the condensate. The mechanism behind the dominant effect -- parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations and freezing of modes outside of horizon -- is similar to that of cosmological particle creation and structure formation in a rapid quench (which is fundamentally different from Hawking radiation in black holes). This shows that BEC dynamics is a promising venue for doing `laboratory cosmology'.

We present numerical results demonstrating that at this transition the system changes from being quasi-integrable to quantum chaotic. By deriving an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit we relate this phenomenon to a localisation-delocalisation transition in which a macroscopic superposition is generated. We also describe the classical analogues of this behaviour.

abstract: We have recently calculated shot noise for entangled and spin-polarized electrons in novel beam-splitter geometries with a local Rashba s-o interaction in the incoming leads. This interaction allows for a gate-controlled rotation of the incoming electron spins. Here we present an alternate simpler route to the shot noise calculation in the above work and focus on only electron pairs. Shot noise for these shows continuous bunching and antibunching behaviors. In addition, entangled and unentangled triplets yield distinctive shot noise oscillations. Besides allowing for a direct way to identify triplet and singlet states, these oscillations can be used to extract s-o coupling constants through noise measurements. Incoming leads with spin-orbit interband mixing give rise an additional modulation of the current noise. This extra rotation allows the design of a spin transistor with enhanced spin control.

Starting with the canonical generator $\eta_c=[H_0,H]$ with $H_0$ resembling the non-interacting bosonic bath, the flow equations exhibit a universal attractor for the Hamiltonian flow. This allows to calculate equilibrium correlation functions for super-Ohmic, Ohmic and sub-Ohmic baths within a uniform framework including finite bias.

We find the Raman spectra to have significant dependence on the donor exchange splitting and the relative spatial positions of the two donor sites. In particular, we establish a strong correlation between the temperature dependence of the Raman peak intensity and the interdonor exchange coupling. Micro-Raman scattering can therefore potentially become a powerful tool to measure interqubit coupling in the development of a Si quantum computer architecture.

abstract: Spin preparation and spin detection are fundamental problems in spintronics and in several solid state proposals for quantum information processing. Here we propose the mesoscopic equivalent of an optical polarizing beam splitter (PBS). This interferometric device uses non-dispersive phases (Aharonov-Bohm and Rashba) in order to separate spin up and spin down carriers into distinct outputs and thus it is analogous to a Stern-Gerlach apparatus. It can be used both as a spin preparation device and as a spin measuring device by converting spin into charge (orbital) degrees of freedom. An important feature of the proposed spin polarizer is that no ferromagnetic contacts are used.

abstract: By using the complex angular momentum method, we provide a semiclassical analysis of electron scattering by a magnetic vortex of Aharonov-Bohm-type. Regge poles of the $S$-matrix are associated with surface waves orbiting around the vortex and supported by a magnetic field discontinuity. Rapid variations of sharp characteristic shapes can be observed on scattering cross sections. They correspond to quasibound states which are Breit-Wigner-type resonances associated with surface waves and which can be considered as quantum analogues of acoustic whispering-gallery modes. Such a resonant magnetic vortex could provide a new kind of artificial atom while the semiclassical approach developed here could be profitably extended in various areas of the physics of vortices.

abstract: Within the Geometry of Interaction (GoI) paradigm, we present a setting that enables qualitative differences between classical and quantum processes to be explored. The key construction is the physical interpretation/realization of the traced monoidal categories of finite-dimensional vector spaces with tensor product as monoidal structure and of finite sets and relations with Cartesian product as monoidal structure, both of them providing a so-called wave-style GoI. The developments in this paper reveal that envisioning state update due to quantum measurement as a process provides a powerful tool for developing high-level approaches to quantum information processing.

abstract: In this article and a companion paper we address the question of how one might obtain the semiclassical limit of ordinary matter quantum fields (QFT) propagating on curved spacetimes (CST) from full fledged Quantum General Relativity (QGR), starting from first principles. We stress that we do not claim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is to ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when carrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one might follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and conceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in principle. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that QGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion of a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric operator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a "photon vacuum operator"! While in this first paper we focus on conceptual and abstract aspects, for instance the definition of (fundamental) n-particle states (e.g. photons), in the second paper we perform detailed calculations including, among other things, coherent state expectation values and propagation on random lattices. These calculations serve as an illustration of how far one can get with present mathematical techniques. Although they result in detailed predictions for the size of first quantum corrections such as the gamma-ray burst effect, these predictions should not be taken too seriously because a) the calculations are carried out at the kinematical level only and b) while we can classify the amount of freedom in our constructions, the analysis of the physical significance of possible choices has just begun.

abstract: The present paper is the companion of [1] in which we proposed a scheme that tries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit from background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions of [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the present paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently proposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the general formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under some simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the operators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the complexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective matter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state is peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter propagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar and the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of corrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the fact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate on a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph. Finally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion relations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field. They should, however, not be taken too seriously, due to the many ambiguities in our scheme, the analysis of the physical significance of which has only begun. We show however, that one can classify these ambiguities at least in broad terms.

abstract: The structure of the thermal equilibrium state of a weakly interacting Bose gas is of current interest. We calculate the density matrix of that state in two ways. The most effective method, in terms of yielding a simple, explicit answer, is to construct a generating function within the traditional framework of quantum statistical mechanics. The alternative method, arguably more interesting, is to construct the thermal state as a vector state in an artificial system with twice as many degrees of freedom. It is well known that this construction has an actual physical realization in the quantum thermodynamics of black holes, where the added degrees of freedom correspond to the second sheet of the Kruskal manifold and the thermal vector state is a state of the Unruh or the Hartle-Hawking type. What is unusual about the present work is that the Bogolubov transformation used to construct the thermal state combines in a rather symmetrical way with Bogolubov's original transformation of the same form, used to implement the interaction of the nonideal gas in linear approximation. In addition to providing a density matrix, the method makes it possible to calculate efficiently certain expectation values directly in terms of the thermal vector state of the doubled system.

abstract: Runaway solutions can be avoided in fourth order gravity by a doubling of the matter operator algebra with a symmetry constraint with respect to the exchange of observable and hidden degrees of freedom together with the change in sign of the ghost and the dilaton fields. The theory is classically equivalent to Einstein gravity, while its non-unitary Newtonian limit is shown to lead to a sharp transition, around $10^{11}$ proton masses, from the wavelike properties of microscopic particles to the classical behavior of macroscopic bodies, as well as to a trans-Planckian regularization of collapse singularities. A unified reading of ordinary and black hole entropy emerges as entanglement entropy with hidden degrees of freedom. The emergent picture gives a substantial agreement with B-H entropy and Hawking temperature.

abstract: In the Skyrme model, the Lagrangian can be quantized in several ways using the collective coordinate approach. Not all of which produce quantum states that can be interpreted as physical particles. For example the SU(2) collective coordinate approach produces both integral and half-integral spin and isospin states. Only half of these are the physical baryons. Less well known is the fact that it is equally possible to quantize the system using the SO(3) collective coordinates. This produces only unphysical integral spin and isospin states. To fulfill the goal of being able to express a classical skyrmion as a coherent state of baryons directly in terms of the baryon states, surprisingly a combination of both collective coordinate approaches is required. To prepare for the subsequent application to skyrmion formation through disoriented chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions, the Skyrme model is rigorously quantized using the Dirac prescription for constrained systems. This is shown for both the SU(2) as well as the SO(3) collective coordinate approach.

abstract: In connection with the possibility of skyrmion production from small domain disoriented chiral condensates formation from heavy ion collisions, the direct relation of a classical skyrmion to baryon states is examined. It is argued that a skyrmion is a coherent state of baryons. The collective coordinate approach of quantization means that the physical baryon states exist not in flat space but on a compact manifold. This requires the construction of coherent states in such a curve space. Using the techniques associated with the Segal-Bargmann transform also known as the coherent state transform used for example in the study of the classical limit of quantum gravity, such states can be constructed in the context of the Skyrme model. They are made up directly of baryon states on S^3 but with quantum operators on the SO(3) manifold. In terms of wavefunctions, they are a superposition of the analytic baryon wavefunctions of Adkins, Nappi and Witten. The distribution of the baryon states in terms of the relative probabilities of the baryons inside a skyrmion can therefore be determined.

abstract: We compute the radiation pressure force on a moving mirror, in the nonrelativistic approximation, assuming the field to be at temperature $T.$ At high temperature, the force has a dissipative component proportional to the mirror velocity, which results from Doppler shift of the reflected thermal photons. In the case of a scalar field, the force has also a dispersive component associated to a mass correction. In the electromagnetic case, the separate contributions to the mass correction from the two polarizations cancel. We also derive explicit results in the low temperature regime, and present numerical results for the general case. As an application, we compute the dissipation and decoherence rates for a mirror in a harmonic potential well.

abstract: The vacuum expectation values of the energy--momentum tensor are investigated for massless scalar fields satisfying Dicichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, and for the electromagnetic field with perfect conductor boundary conditions on two infinite parallel plates moving by uniform proper acceleration through the Fulling--Rindler vacuum. The scalar case is considered for general values of the curvature coupling parameter and in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimension. The mode--summation method is used with combination of a variant of the generalized Abel--Plana formula. This allows to extract manifestly the contributions to the expectation values due to a single boundary. The vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are presented as a sum of the self--action and interaction terms. The first one contains well known surface divergences and needs a further regularization. The interaction forces between the plates are always attractive for both scalar and electromagnetic cases. An application to the 'Rindler wall' is discussed.

abstract: We study the the properties of a BRST ghost degree of freedom complementary to a two-state spinor. We show that the ghost may be regarded as a unit carrier of negative entropy. We construct an irreducible representation of the su(2) Lie algebra with negative spin, equal to -1/2, on the ghost state space and discuss the representation of finite SU(2) group elements. The Casimir operator J^2 of the combined spinor-ghost system is nilpotent and coincides with the BRST operator Q. Using this, we discuss the sense in which the positive and negative spin representations cancel in the product to give an effectively trivial representation. We compute an effective dimension, equal to 1/2, and character for the ghost representation and argue that these are consistent with this cancellation.

abstract: The Casimir problem is usually posed as the response of a fluctuating quantum field to externally imposed boundary conditions. In reality, however, no interaction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies of a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by coupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements the boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop general new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and energy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute Green's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta. Our calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of singular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation of exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify potentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in the Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and add back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms fixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's functions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite functionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir energy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and reflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all energy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc surface counterterms. We apply our methods to simple examples to illustrate cases where these subtleties invalidate the conclusions of the boundary condition approach.

It is shown that they are due to the fact that the generators of the symmetry do not leave invariant the domain of definition of the Hamiltonian and then a term, normally forgotten in the Heisenberg equation, gives an extra contribution responsible for the non conservation of the charges. This explanation is equivalent to that of the Fujikawa in the path integral formalism. Finally, this approach is applied to the conformal symmetry breaking in two-dimensional quantum mechanics.

abstract: We consider a model of topological solitons where charged particles have finite mass and the electric charge is quantised already at the classical level. In the electrodynamic limit, which physically corresponds to electrodynamics of solitons of zero size, the Lagrangian of this model has two degrees of freedom only and reduces to the Lagrangian of the Maxwell field in dual representation. We derive the equations of motion and discuss their relations with Maxwell's equations. It is shown that Coulomb and Lorentz forces are a consequence of topology. Further, we relate the U(1) gauge invariance of electrodynamics to the geometry of the soliton field, give a general relation for the derivation of the soliton field from the field strength tensor in electrodynamics and use this relation to express homogeneous electric fields in terms of the soliton field.

abstract: We study the Casimir problem as the limit of a conventional quantum field theory coupled to a smooth background. The Casimir energy diverges in the limit that the background forces the field to vanish on a surface. We show that this divergence cannot be absorbed into a renormalization of the parameters of the theory. As a result, the Casimir energy of the surface and other quantities like the surface tension, which are obtained by deforming the surface, cannot be defined independently of the details of the coupling between the field and the matter on the surface. In contrast, the energy density away from the surface and the force between rigid surfaces are finite and independent of these complications.

abstract: The question of Bohr correspondence in quantum field theory is considered from a dynamical point of view. It is shown that the classical description of particle interactions is inapplicable even in the limit of large particles' masses because of finite quantum fluctuations of the fields produced. In particular, it is found that the relative value of the root mean square fluctuation of the Coulomb and Newton potentials of a massive particle is equal to 1/sqrt{2}. It is shown also that in the case of a macroscopic body, the quantum fluctuations are suppressed by a factor 1/sqrt{N}, where N is the number of particles in the body. An adequate macroscopic interpretation of the correspondence principle is given.

abstract: It is shown that the vacuum state of weakly interacting quantum field theories can be described, in the Heisenberg picture, as a linear combination of randomly distributed incoherent paths that obey classical equations of motion with constrained initial conditions. We call such paths "pseudoclassical" paths and use them to define the dynamics of quantum fluctuations. Every physical observable is assigned a time-dependent value on each path in a way that respects the uncertainty principle, but in consequence, some of the standard algebraic relations between quantum observables are not necessarily fulfilled by their time-dependent values on paths. We define "collective observables" which depend on a large number of independent degrees of freedom, and show that the dynamics of their quantum fluctuations can be described in terms of unconstrained classical stochastic processes without reference to any additional external system or to an environment. Our analysis can be generalized to states other than the vacuum. Finally, we compare our formalism to the formalism of coherent states, and highlight their differences.

abstract: The quantum gravity is formulated based on gauge principle. The model discussed in this paper has local gravitational gauge symmetry and gravitational field is represented by gauge potential. A preliminary study on gravitational gauge group is presented. Path integral quantization of the theory is discussed in the paper. A strict proof on the renormalizability of the theory is also given. In leading order approximation, the gravitational gauge field theory gives out classical Newton's theory of gravity. It can also give out an Einstein-like field equation with cosmological term. The prediction for cosmological constant given by this model is well consistent with experimental results. For classical tests, it gives out the same theoretical predictions as those of general relativity. Combining cosmological principle with the field equation of gravitational gauge field, we can also set up a cosmological model which is consistent with recent observations.

abstract: We give two characterization theorems for pseudo-Hermitian (possibly nondiagonalizable) Hamiltonians with a discrete spectrum that admit a block-diagonalization with finite-dimensional diagonal blocks. In particular, we prove that for such an operator H the following statements are equivalent. 1. H is pseudo-Hermitian; 2. The spectrum of H consists of real and/or complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues and the geometric multiplicity and the dimension of the diagonal blocks for the complex-conjugate eigenvalues are identical; 3. H is Hermitian with respect to a positive-semidefinite inner product. We further discuss the relevance of our findings for the merging of a complex-conjugate pair of eigenvalues of diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians in general, and the PT-symmetric Hamiltonians and the effective Hamiltonian for a certain closed FRW minisuperspace quantum cosmological model in particular.

abstract: We study the quantum Zeno effect in quantum statistical mechanics within the operator algebraic framework. We formulate a condition for the appearance of the effect in W*-dynamical systems, in terms of the short-time behaviour of the dynamics. Examples of quantum spin systems show that this condition can be effectively applied to quantum statistical mechanical models. Further, we derive an explicit form of the Zeno generator, and use it to construct Gibbs equilibrium states for the Zeno dynamics. As a concrete example, we consider the X-Y model, for which we show that a frequent measurement at a microscopic level, e.g. a single lattice site, can produce a macroscopic effect in changing the global equilibrium.

subjects: Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0207026
abstract: We investigate a class of operators resulting from a quantization scheme attributed to Berezin. These so-called Berezin-Toeplitz operators are defined on a Hilbert space of square-integrable holomorphic sections in a line bundle over the classical phase space. As a first goal we develop self-adjointness criteria for Berezin-Toeplitz operators defined via quadratic forms. Then, following a concept of Daubechies and Klauder, the semigroups generated by these operators may under certain conditions be represented in the form of Wiener-regularized path integrals. More explicitly, the integration is taken over Brownian-motion paths in phase space in the ultra-diffusive limit. All results are the consequence of a relation between Berezin-Toeplitz operators and Schrodinger operators defined via certain quadratic forms. The probabilistic representation is derived in conjunction with a version of the Feynman-Kac formula.

We show that in the proper limit these potentials reduce to well-known exactly solvable potentials.

abstract: A digraph D is the pattern of a matrix M when D has an arc ij if and only if the ij-th entry of M is nonzero. Study the relationship between unitary matrices and their patterns is motivated by works in quantum chaology and quantum computation. In this note, we prove that if a Cayley digraph is a line digraph then it is the pattern of a unitary matrix. We prove that for any finite group with two generators there exists a set of generators such that the Cayley digraph with respect to such a set is a line digraph and hence the pattern of a unitary matrix.

The one-dimensional case covers quantum information sources and is basic for coding theorems.

Some conditions under which the uncertainty relations are minimized are also given.

We have found that the three-body system exists only when M_2 is greater than a critical value M_c approximately 1.43 m (m is the constituent mass). For M_2=M_c the mass M_3 turns into zero and for M_2<M_c there is no solution with real value of M_3.

Possible connections to physical systems are also considered.

We show that the total spin states obtained are: one boson singlet state and an arbitrary number of spin-1/2 states, the later ones are energy degenerate. It means that we have in this case supersymmetric quantum mechanics and also the addition of angular momentum for massless particles. We review too the cases of two bosonic and fermionic oscillators.

The methodology and validity of this approach are illustrated by considering several stationary state problems in quantum mechanics.
