abstract: Dispersion interactions such as the van der Waals interaction between atoms or molecules derive from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and can be understood as the exchange of virtual photons between the interacting partners. Any modification of the environment in which those photons propagate will thus invariably lead to an alteration of the van der Waals interaction. Here we show how the two-body dispersion interaction inside a cylindrical waveguide can be made to decay asymptotically exponentially, and how this effect sensitively depends on the material properties and the length scales of the problem, eventually leading to the possibility of controllable interactions. Further, we discuss the possibility to detect the retarded van der Waals interaction by resonant enhancement of the interaction between Rydberg atoms in the light of long-range potentials due to guided modes.

abstract: If the second law of thermodynamics forbids a transition from one state to another, then it is still possible to make the transition happen by using a sufficient amount of work. But if we do not have access to this amount of work, can the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this probability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized systems, it can be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a thermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state, and show that this maximum can be achieved for any final state which is block-diagonal in the energy eigenbasis. We also find upper and lower bounds on this transition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a bi-product, we introduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the thermo-majorization criteria which governs state transitions, and compute the work of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a transition, and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also considered. Our results have applications in entanglement theory, and we find the amount of entanglement required (or gained) when transforming one pure entangled state into any other.

abstract: It is shown that if a complete set of mutually commuting operators is formed by constants of motion, then, up to a factor that only depends on the time, each common eigenfunction of such operators is a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the operators representing the initial values of the Cartesian coordinates of a particle are constants of motion that commute with each other and from their common eigenfunction one readily obtains the Green function.

abstract: Many of the challenges of scaling quantum computer hardware lie at the interface between the qubits and the classical control signals used to manipulate them. Modular ion trap quantum computer architectures address scalability by constructing individual quantum processors interconnected via a network of quantum communication channels. Successful operation of such quantum hardware requires a fully programmable classical control system capable of frequency stabilizing the continuous wave lasers necessary for trapping and cooling the ion qubits, stabilizing the optical frequency combs used to drive logic gate operations on the ion qubits, providing a large number of analog voltage sources to drive the trap electrodes, and a scheme for maintaining phase coherence among all the controllers that manipulate the qubits. In this work, we describe scalable solutions to these hardware development challenges.

abstract: Tensor network states and specifically matrix-product states have proven to be a powerful tool for simulating ground states of strongly correlated spin models. Recently, they have also been applied to interacting fermionic problems, specifically in the context of quantum chemistry. A new freedom arising in such non-local fermionic systems is the choice of orbitals, it being far from clear what choice of fermionic orbitals to make. In this work, we propose a way to overcome this challenge. We suggest a method intertwining the optimisation over matrix product states with suitable fermionic Gaussian mode transformations, hence bringing the advantages of both approaches together. The described algorithm generalises basis changes in the spirit of the Hartree-Fock methods to matrix-product states, and provides a black box tool for basis optimisation in tensor network methods.

abstract: Hitherto, a finitely thick barrier next to a well or a rigid wall has been considered the potential of simplest shape giving rise to resonances (metastable states) in one dimension: $x \in(-\infty, \infty)$. In such a potential, there are three real turning points at an energy below the barrier. Resonances are Gamow's (time-wise) decaying states with discrete complex energies $({\cal E}_n = E_n -i\Gamma_n/2)$. These are also spatially catastrophic states that manifest as peaks/wiggles in Wigner's reflection time-delay at $E = \epsilon_n \approx E_n$. Here we explore potentials with simpler shapes giving rise to resonances - two-piece rising potentials having just one-turning point. We demonstrate our point by using rising exponential profile in various ways.

abstract: Recently, Girolami and Adesso have demonstrated that the calculation of quantum discord for two-qubit case can be viewed as to solve a pair of transcendental equation (Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 83}, 052108(2011)). In present work, we introduce the generalized Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism and apply it as a convenient tool for constructing transcendental equations. For the general two-qubit case, we show that the transcendental equations always have a finite set of universal solutions, this result can be viewed as a generalization of the one get by Ali, Rau, and Alber (Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 81}, 042105 (2010)). For a subclass of $X$ state, we find the analytical solutions by solving the transcendental equations.

abstract: In open system approaches with non-Markovian environments, the process of inserting an individual mode (denoted as "pseudomode") into the bath or extracting it from the bath is widely employed. This procedure, however, is typically performed on basis of the spectral density (SD) and does not incorporate temperature. Here, we show how the - temperature-dependent - bath correlation function (BCF) transforms in such a process. We present analytic formulae for the transformed BCF and numerically study the differences between factorizing initial state and global thermal (correlated) initial state of mode and bath, respectively. We find that in the regime of strong coupling of the mode to both system and bath, the differences in the BCFs give rise to pronounced differences in the dynamics of the system.

abstract: An extensively pursued current direction of research in physics aims at the development of practical technologies that exploit the effects of quantum mechanics. As part of this ongoing effort, devices for information processing, secure communication and high-precision sensing are being implemented with diverse systems, ranging from photons, atoms and spins to mesoscopic superconducting and nanomechanical structures. Their physical properties make some of these systems better suited than others for specific tasks; thus, photons are well suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins can serve as long-lived quantum memories, and superconducting elements can rapidly process information encoded in their quantum states. A central goal of the envisaged quantum technologies is to develop devices that can simultaneously perform several of these tasks, namely, reliably store, process, and transmit quantum information. Hybrid quantum systems composed of different physical components with complementary functionalities may provide precisely such multi-tasking capabilities. This article reviews some of the driving theoretical ideas and first experimental realizations of hybrid quantum systems and the opportunities and the challenges they present and offers a glance at the near- and long-term perspectives of this fascinating and rapidly expanding field.

abstract: Experiments in long distance quantum key distribution have motivated the development of ruggedised single photon sources, capable of producing useful correlations even when removed from the warm, nurturing environment found in most optics laboratories. As part of an ongoing pro- gramme to place such devices into low earth orbit (LEO), we have developed and built a number of rugged single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. In order to evalu- ate device reliability, we have subjected our design to various thermal, mechanical and atmospheric stresses. Our results show that while such a device may tolerate launch into orbit, operation in orbit and casual mishandling by graduate students, it is probably unable to survive the forcible disassembly of a launch vehicle at the top of a ball of rapidly expanding and oxidising kerosene and liquid oxygen.

abstract: We discuss a simple quantum thermal machine for the generation of steady-state entanglement between two interacting qubits. The machine is autonomous in the sense that it uses only incoherent interactions with thermal baths, but no source of coherence or external control. By weakly coupling the qubits to thermal baths at different temperatures, inducing a heat current through the system, steady-state entanglement is generated far from thermal equilibrium. Finally, we discuss two possible implementations, using superconducting flux qubits or a semiconductor double quantum dot. Experimental prospects for steady-state entanglement are promising in both systems.

abstract: We propose two schemes for concentration of $(n+1)$-qubit entangled states that can be written in the form of $(\alpha|\varphi_{0}\rangle|0\rangle+\beta|\varphi_{1}\rangle|1\rangle)_{n+1}$ where $|\varphi_{0}\rangle$ and $|\varphi_{1}\rangle$ are mutually orthogonal $n$-qubit states. The importance of this general form is that the entangled states like Bell, cat, GHZ, GHZ-like, $|\Omega\rangle$, $|Q_{5}\rangle$, 4-qubit cluster states and specific states from the 9 SLOCC-nonequivalent families of 4-qubit entangled states can be expressed in this form. The proposed entanglement concentration protocol is based on the local operations and classical communications (LOCC). It is shown that the maximum success probability for ECP using quantum nondemolition (QND) technique is $2\beta^{2}$ for $(n+1)$-qubit states of the prescribed form. It is shown that the proposed schemes can be implemented optically. Further it is also noted that the proposed schemes can be implemented using quantum dot and microcavity systems.

abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of different types of qubits are promising for building quantum computers if they combine useful properties of their constituent qubits. However, they also pose additional challenges if one type of qubits is more susceptible to environmental noise than the others. Dynamical decoupling can help to protect such systems by reducing the decoherence due to the environmental noise, but the protection must be designed such that it does not interfere with the control fields driving the logical operations. Here, we test such a protection scheme on a quantum register consisting of the electronic and nuclear spins of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The results show that processing is compatible with protection: The dephasing time was extended almost to the limit given by the longitudinal relaxation time of the electron spin.

The general pure three-qubit states are chosen as shared quantum channel, which are not LOCC equivalent to the mostly used GHZ-state. It is the first time to introduce general pure three-qubit states to complete remote state preparation. The probability of successful preparation is presented. Moreover, in some special cases, the successful probability could reach unit.

Different entanglement measures, such as one-site entanglement entropy, one-tangle, concurrence of formation and assistance, negativity and entanglement per bond are calculated and their `characterizing power' to determine quantum phase transitions is compared. A special emphasis is made on the study of entanglement monogamy properties.

abstract: One of the predominant challenges when engineering future quantum information processors is that large quantum systems are notoriously hard to maintain and control accurately. It is therefore of immediate practical relevance to investigate quantum information processing with limited physical resources, for example to ask: How well can we perform information processing tasks if we only have access to a small quantum device? Can we beat fundamental limits imposed on information processing with classical resources? This book will introduce the reader to the mathematical framework required to answer such questions. A strong emphasis is given to information measures that are essential for the study of devices of finite size, including R\'enyi entropies and smooth entropies. The presentation is self-contained and includes rigorous and concise proofs of the most important properties of these measures. The first chapters will introduce the formalism of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on norms and metrics for quantum states. This is necessary to explore quantum generalizations of R\'enyi divergence and conditional entropy, information measures that lie at the core of information theory. The smooth entropy framework is discussed next and provides a natural means to lift many arguments from information theory to the quantum setting. Finally selected applications of the theory to statistics and cryptography are discussed.

abstract: We show that a class of exactly solvable quantum Ising models, including transverse-field Ising model and anisotropic XY model, can be characterized as the loops in a two-dimensional auxiliary space. The transverse-field Ising model corresponds to a circle and the XY model corresponds to an ellipse, while other models yield a Cardioid, Limacon, Hypocycloid, and Lissajous curves, et al.. It is shown that the variation of the ground state energy density, which is a function of the loop, experiences a non-analytical point when the winding number of the corresponding loop changes. The winding number can serve as a topological quantum number of the quantum phases in the extended quantum Ising model, which sheds some light upon the relation between quantum phase transition and the geometrical order parameter characterizing the phase diagram.

abstract: The Frenkel-Kontorova model reproduces in one dimension the essential features of the stick-slip motion characteristic of friction. We theoretically analyze a realization where the atomic array is an ion chain and the substrate potential is the optical lattice of a high-finesse resonator, to which the ions dipolar transitions strongly couple. In this regime the lattice depth depends on their spatial density and the cavity potential behaves like a dynamically deformable substrate, which mediates infinitely long-ranged interactions between the ions. We characterize the properties of the stationary state, resulting from the balance between a pump driving the resonator and losses due to cavity decay, in a finite chain within a harmonic trap. When the cavity wavelength is incommensurate with the interparticle distance at the chain center, the phase diagram exhibits a sliding-to-pinned transition. The transition point depends on the cavity nonlinearity $C$, and its nature changes from a symmetry-breaking to a first-order transition as $C$ is increased. Its salient features can be explained by the global lattice deformation and can be revealed by monitoring the emitted field, which carries information about the ions structure within the cavity mode. These dynamics represent a paradigm of competing self-organizing mechanisms which can be observed in existing experimental setups.

abstract: Quantum sensitivity is an important issue in the field of quantum metrology where sub-Planck scale structures play crucial role in the Heisenberg limited measurement. We investigate the mesoscopic superposition structures, particularly for well-known cat-like and compass-like states, in the rotating Morse system where sub-Planck scale structures originate in the dynamics of a suitably constructed SU(2) coherent state. A detail study of the sensitivity analysis reveals that rotational coupling in the vibrational wave packet can be used as a probe to enhance the sensitivity limit in a diatomic molecule. The maximum sensitivity limit is identified with the rotational amendment, and a quantitative measure of the angle of rotation for different rotational levels is also given. The correspondence of the numerical result with the angle of rotation is also delineated in phase-space Wigner representation.

abstract: Studies on symmetric extendibility of quantum states become especially important in a context of analysis of one-way quantum measures of entanglement, distilabillity and security of quantum protocols. In this paper we analyze composite systems containing a symmetric extendible part with a particular attention devoted to one-way security of such systems. Further, we introduce a new one-way monotone based on the best symmetric approximation of quantum state and differentiate symmetric extendibility into weak and strong type. We underpin those results with geometric observations on structures of multi-party settings which posses in sub-spaces substantial symmetric extendible components. Finally, we state a very important conjecture linking symmetric-extendibility with one-way distillability and security of all quantum states analyzing behavior of private key in neighborhood of symmetric extendible states.

abstract: A novel quantum imaging technique has recently been demonstrated in an experiment, where the photon used for illuminating an object is not detected; the image is obtained by interfering two beams, none of which ever interacts with the object. Here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the experiment. We show that the object information is present only in the interference term and not in the individual intensities of the interfering beams. We also theoretically establish that the magnification of the imaging system depends on two wavelengths: the average wavelength of the photon that illuminates the object and the average wavelength of the photon that is detected. Our analysis affirms that the imaging process is based on the principle that quantum interference occurs when interferometric path information is unavailable.

The obtained adiabatic condition consists of two inequalities, one of which coincides with the conventional adiabatic condition for the real-time Schroedinger equation, but the other does not. We apply this adiabatic approximation to the analysis of Markovian dynamics of the classical Ising model, which can be formulated as the imaginary-time Schr\"odinger equation, to obtain an asymptotic formula for the probability that the system reaches the ground state in the limit of a long annealing time in simulated annealing. Using this form, we amend the theory of Somma, Batista, and Ortiz for a convergence condition for simulated annealing.

We observed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in the in-phase and out-of-phase couplings between the two slave lasers. Their phase difference is locked to either 0 or p even if the coupling path is continuously modulated. The system automatically selects the oscillation frequency to satisfy the in-phase or out-of-phase coupling condition, when the mutual coupling dominates over the injection-locking by the master laser.

Using quantum trajectory approach we obtain the single-photon time-dependent spectrum in this hybrid system where the influence of a strong atom-cavity coupling and a strong optomechanical interaction are studied. We find a dressed state picture can explain the spectra by predicting the exact peak locations as well as the relative peak heights. In our analysis we also include the effect of mechanical losses (under weak mechanical damping limit) and single-photon loss through spontaneous emission from the two-level emitter.

abstract: We address the question of finding the most effective convex decompositions into boundary elements (so-called boundariness) for sets of quantum states, observables and channels. First we show that in general convex sets the boundariness essentially coincides with the question of the most distinguishable element, thus, providing an operational meaning for this concept. Unexpectedly, we discovered that for any interior point of the set of channels the optimal decomposition necessarily contains a unitary channel. In other words, for any given channel the best distinguishable one is some unitary channel. Further, we prove that boundariness is sub-multiplicative under composition of systems and explicitly evaluate its maximal value that is attained only for the most mixed elements of the considered convex structures.

abstract: It is still unclear how thermal states dynamically emerge from a microscopic quantum description. A complete understanding of the long time evolution of closed quantum systems may resolve the tension between a microscopic description and the one offered by equilibrium statistical mechanics. In an attempt in this direction, we consider a simple bipartite system (a quantum scalar field propagating in black-hole background) and study the evolution of the entanglement entropy --- by tracing over the degrees of freedom inside the event-horizon --- at different times. We define entanglement temperature which is similar to the one used in the microcanonical ensemble picture in statistical mechanics and show that (i) this temperature is a finite quantity while the entanglement entropy diverges and (ii) matches with the Hawking temperature for all several black-hole space-times. We also discuss the implications of our result for the laws of black-hole mechanics and eigen-state thermalization.

abstract: In our two preceding papers we studied bipartite composite boson (or quasiboson) systems through their realization in terms of deformed oscillators. Therein, the entanglement characteristics such as the entanglement entropy and purity were found and expressed, for both one-quasiboson and more complex states, through the parameter of deformation. In this work we initiate an analogous study of composite fermions for two major cases: (i) "boson + fermion" composites; (ii) "deformed-boson + fermion" composites. Both the entanglement entropy and purity of composite fermions are dealt with, their dependence on the relevant parameters established, and for some particular two- or three-mode cases depicted graphically. In a few special cases the entanglement entropy turns out to be constant $S_0=\ln 2$ (or $\ln 3$) or $S_0=0$, while in the rest of the cases which we considered it varies between zero and $\ln 2$ (or $\ln 3$).

abstract: We study the occurrence of errors in a continuously decoupled two-qubit state during a $\sqrt{SWAP}$ quantum operation under decoherence. We consider a realization of this quantum gate based on the Heisenberg exchange interaction, which alone suffices for achieving universal quantum computation. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous-dynamical-decoupling scheme that commutes with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian to protect it from the amplitude damping and dephasing errors caused by the system-environment interaction. We consider two error-protection settings. One protects the qubits from both amplitude damping and dephasing errors. The other features the amplitude damping as a residual error and protects the qubits from dephasing errors only. In both settings, we investigate the interaction of qubits with common and independent environments separately. We study how errors affect the entanglement and fidelity for different environmental spectral densities.

This raises the possibility that quaternionic quantum mechanics may not be understood as a correction to complex quantum mechanics, but it may also be a structure that can be used to study phenomena that cannot be described through the framework of complex quantum mechanics.

abstract: We introduce a necessary and sufficient criterion for the non-Markovianity of Gaussian quantum dynamical maps based on the violation of divisibility. The criterion is derived by defining a general vectorial representation of the covariance matrix which is then exploited to determine the condition for the complete positivity of partial maps associated to arbitrary time intervals. Such construction does not rely on the existence of a Choi-Jamiolkowski representation and does not require optimization over states.

abstract: Preparing and detecting spatially extended quantum superpositions of a massive object comprises an important fundamental test of quantum theory. State-of-the-art experiments demonstrate quantum interference of nanometer-sized molecules with mass $\sim 10^4$ amu. A number of experiments have been proposed to push the mass limit several orders of magnitude further. All the experimental setups considered up to date require that the nanoparticle is isolated in a sufficiently high vacuum in order to avoid collisional decoherence. We argue that superfluid helium is a viable alternative to vacuum as a low-decoherence medium. Indeed, for an object moving in a pure superfluid at zero temperature with a velocity less than the critical one decoherence is absent since the object can not create any excitations of the superfluid. In real life impurities and thermal excitations will cause decoherence. We show that it is low enough to permit interference experiments with nanoparticles well beyond the current mass limit. While the robustness of spatial superpositions of an objects surrounded by dense medium is remarkable in its own right, performing interference experiments in superfluid helium can provide some practical advantages compared to conventional schemes, e.g. effective cooling and compensation of gravity by the buoyancy force.

abstract: Tracking the kinematics of fast-moving objects is an important diagnostic tool for science and engineering. Existing optical methods include high-speed CCD/CMOS imaging, streak cameras, lidar, serial time-encoded imaging and sequentially timed all-optical mapping. Here, we demonstrate an entirely new approach to positional and directional sensing based on the concept of classical entanglement in vector beams of light. The measurement principle relies on the intrinsic correlations existing in such beams between transverse spatial modes and polarization. The latter can be determined from intensity measurements with only a few fast photodiodes, greatly outperforming the bandwidth of current CCD/CMOS devices. In this way, our setup enables two-dimensional real-time sensing with temporal resolution in the GHz range. We expect the concept to open up new directions in photonics-based metrology and sensing.

We show that it is possible to create and detect such entanglement at various scales, ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems. In the present architecture, we suggest that the maximal phase shift induced in the process of interaction between photons is proportional to photon numbers. Also, in the absence of decoherence we analyze maximum error probability and show its feasibility with current technology.

abstract: Embedded random matrix ensembles are generic models for describing statistical properties of finite isolated interacting quantum many-particle systems. For the simplest spinless systems, with say $m$ particles in $N$ single particle states and interacting via $k$-body interactions, we have EGUE($k$) and the embedding algebra is $U(N)$. A finite quantum system, induced by a transition operator, makes transitions from its states to the states of the same system or to those of another system. Examples are electromagnetic transitions (same initial and final systems), nuclear beta and double beta decay (different initial and final systems), particle addition to/removal from a given system and so on. Towards developing a complete statistical theory for transition strength densities, we have derived formulas for lower order bivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of transition operators. For a spinless fermion system, using EGUE($k$) representation for Hamiltonian and an independent EGUE($t$) representation for transition operator, finite-$N$ formulas for moments up to order four are derived, for the first time, for the transition strength densities. Formulas for the moments up to order four are also derived for systems with two types of spinless fermions and a transition operator similar to beta decay and neutrinoless beta decay operators. Moments formulas are also derived for transition operator that removes $k_0$ number of particles from $m$ fermion system. Numerical results obtained using the exact formulas for two-body ($k=2$) Hamiltonians (in some examples for $k=3,4$) and the asymptotic formulas clearly establish that in general the smoothed form of the bivariate transition strength densities take bivariate Gaussian form for isolated finite quantum systems. Extensions of these results to bosonic systems and EGUE ensembles with further symmetries are discussed.

abstract: We show that the interaction of a pulsed laser light with a mechanical oscillator through the radiation pressure results in an opto-mechanical entangled state in which the photon number is correlated with the oscillator position. Interestingly, the mechanical oscillator can be delocalized over a large range of positions when driven by an intense laser light. This provides a simple yet sensitive method to probe hypothetic post-quantum theories including an explicit wave function collapse model, like the Diosi and Penrose model. We propose an entanglement witness to reveal the quantum nature of this opto-mechanical state as well as an optical technique to record the decoherence of the mechanical oscillator. We also report on a detailed feasibility study giving the experimental challenges that need to be overcome to confirm or rule out predictions from explicit wave function collapse models.

Without any spectral filtering, we observe a visibility of V=62$\pm$4%. After correcting for accidental coincidences, we obtain V=93$\pm$6%. The observed interference demonstrates the compatibility of the two sources, forming the basis for an efficient quantum interface between different physical systems.

The algorithm runs in time linear in the number of qubits, which makes its performance the strongest to date for linear-time decoding of quantum codes. The algorithm relies on expanding properties, not of the quantum code's factor graph directly, but of the factor graph of the original classical code it is constructed from.

abstract: Recently, a large number of protocols for bidirectional controlled state teleportation (BCST) have been proposed using $n$-qubit entangled states ($n\in\{5,6,7\}$) as quantum channel. Here, we propose a general method of selecting multi-qubit $(n>4)$ quantum channels suitable for BCST and show that all the channels used in the existing protocols of BCST can be obtained using the proposed method. Further, it is shown that the quantum channels used in the existing protocols of BCST forms only a negligibly small subset of the set of all the quantum channels that can be constructed using the proposed method to implement BCST. It is also noted that all these quantum channels are also suitable for controlled bidirectional remote state preparation (CBRSP). Following the same logic, methods for selecting quantum channels for other controlled quantum communication tasks, such as controlled bidirectional joint remote state preparation (CJBRSP) and controlled quantum dialogue, are also provided.

Also, we calculate the "stationarity time" for mixed Gaussian states of a quantum harmonic oscillator, showing explicitly that pure quantum states are "more fragile" than mixed ones with the same value of the energy dispersion. The problems of quantum evolution speed limits, time operators and measurements of energy and time are briefly discussed, too.

abstract: Entanglement distillation is a process via which the strength and purity of quantum entanglement can be increased probabilistically. It is a key step in many quantum communication and computation protocols. In particular, entanglement distillation is a necessary component of the quantum repeater, a device which counters the degradation of entanglement that inevitably occurs due to losses in a communication line. Here we report an experiment on distilling the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state of light, the workhorse of continuous-variable entanglement, using the technique of noiseless amplification. In contrast to previous implementations, the entanglement enhancement factor achievable by our technique is not fundamentally limited and permits recovering an EPR state with a macroscopic level of entanglement no matter how low the initial entanglement or how high the loss may be. In particular, we recover the original level of entanglement after one of the EPR modes has passed through a channel with a loss factor of 20. The level of entanglement in our distilled state is higher than that achievable by direct transmission of any state through a similar loss channel. This is a key bench-marking step towards the realization of a practical continuous-variable quantum repeater and other CV quantum protocols.

abstract: While fully device-independent security in BB84-like one way QKD is impossible, it can be guaranteed against individual attacks in a semi device-independent scenario, where no assumptions on the characteristics of the hardware used are made except for the communication channel for which an upper bound on capacity is put. This approach is meaningful especially in the context of recent {\it quantum hacking} attacks in which the eavesdroppers are able to remotely alter the behaviour of the devices used by the communicating parties. They are however unable to change the capacity of the channel. In this work we study a semi device-independent protocol wherein the knowledge of success probability of the associated dimension witness and the observed efficiency of the detectors ($\eta_{avg}$) are sufficient to determine the security. We consider practically possible, individual attacks with and without eavesdropper having access to quantum memory. We find critical detection efficiencies required for security in both cases.

abstract: We describe new unconditionally secure bit commitment schemes whose security is based on Minkowski causality and the monogamy of quantum entanglement. We first describe an ideal scheme that is purely deterministic, in the sense that neither party needs to generate any secret randomness at any stage. We also describe a variant that allows the committer to proceed deterministically, requires only local randomness generation from the receiver, and allows the commitment to be verified in the neighbourhood of the unveiling point. We show that these schemes still offer near-perfect security in the presence of losses and errors, which can be made perfect if the committer uses an extra single random secret bit. We discuss scenarios where these advantages are significant.

We describe relativistic quantum bit commitment schemes that are immune to these attacks, and show that these schemes offer device-independent security against hypothetical post-quantum adversaries subject only to the no-signalling principle. We compare a relativistic classical bit commitment scheme with similar features, and note some possible advantages of the quantum schemes.

abstract: When the amount of entanglement in a quantum system is limited, the relevant dynamics of the system is restricted to a very small part of the state space. When restricted to this subspace the description of the system becomes efficient in the system size. A class of algorithms, exemplified by the Time-Evolving Block-Decimation (TEBD) algorithm, make use of this observation by selecting the relevant subspace through a decimation technique relying on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In these algorithms, the complexity of each time-evolution step is dominated by the SVD. Here we show that, by applying a randomized version of the SVD routine (RRSVD), the power law governing the computational complexity of TEBD is lowered by one degree, resulting in a considerable speed-up. We exemplify the potential gains in efficiency at the hand of some real world examples to which TEBD can be successfully applied to and demonstrate that for those system RRSVD delivers results as accurate as state-of-the-art deterministic SVD routines.

abstract: A classical optics waveguide structure is proposed to simulate resonances of short range one-dimensional potentials in quantum mechanics. The analogy is based on the well known resemblance between the guided and radiation modes of a waveguide with the bound and scattering states of a quantum well. As resonances are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the scatterer, we associate them with the leaky modes of a waveguide, the latter characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is complete since resonances (leaky modes) can be interpreted as bound states (guided modes) with definite lifetime (longitudinal shift). As an immediate application we calculate the leaky modes (resonances) associated with a dielectric homogeneous slab (square well potential) and show that these modes are attenuated as they propagate.

abstract: While entanglement is believed to be an important ingredient in understanding quantum many-body physics, the complexity of its characterization scales very unfavorably with the size of the system. Finding super-sets of the set of separable states that admit a simpler description has proven to be a fruitful approach in the bipartite setting. In this paper we discuss a systematic way of characterizing multiparticle entanglement via various relaxations. We furthermore describe an operational witness construction arising from such relaxations that is capable of detecting every entangled state. Finally, we also derive analytic upper-bounds on the volume of biseparable states and show that the volume of the states with a positive partial transpose for any split exponentially outgrows this volume. This proves that simple semi-definite relaxations in the multiparticle case cannot be an equally good approximation for any scenario.

abstract: An integrated silicon nitride resonator is proposed as an ultra-compact source of bright single-mode quadrature squeezed light at 850 nm. Optical properties of the device are investigated and tailored through numerical simulations, with particular attention paid to loss associated with interfacing the device. An asymmetric double layer stack waveguide geometry with inverse vertical tapers is proposed for efficient and robust fibre-chip coupling, yielding a simulated total loss of -0.75 dB/facet. We assess the feasibility of the device through a full quantum noise analysis and derive the output squeezing spectrum for intra-cavity pump self-phase modulation. Subject to standard material loss and detection efficiencies, we find that the device holds promises for generating substantial quantum noise squeezing over a bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. In the low-propagation loss regime, approximately -7 dB squeezing is predicted for a pump power of only 50 mW.

Then analytical results are obtained for quantum discord of 2n-dimensional Bell-diagonal states. As illustration, some special cases are examined. Finally, we investigate the additivity relation between the different correlations for the separable generalized bloch sphere states.

abstract: Controllable systems relying on quantum behavior to simulate distinctly quantum models so far rely on increasingly challenging classical computing to verify their results. We develop a general protocol for confirming that an arbitrary many-body system, such as a quantum simulator, can entangle distant objects. The protocol verifies that distant qubits interacting separately with the system can become mutually entangled, and therefore serves as a local test that excitations of the system can create non-local quantum correlations. We derive an inequality analogous to Bell's inequality which can only be violated through entanglement between distant sites of the many-body system. Although our protocol is applicable to general many-body systems, it requires finding system-dependent local operations to violate the inequality. A specific example in quantum magnetism is presented.

abstract: In this study, we have derived close form of the Casimir force for the non-interacting ideal Bose gas between two slabs in harmonic-optical lattice potential by using Ketterle and van Druten approximation. We find that Bose-Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$ is a critical point for different physical behavior of the Casimir force. We have shown that Casimir force of confined Bose gas in the presence of the harmonic-optical potential decays with inversely proportional to $d^{5}$ when $T\leq T_{c}$. However, in the case of $T>T_{c}$, it decays exponentially depends on separation $d$ of the slabs. Additionally we have discussed temperature dependence of Casimir force and importance of the harmonic-optical lattice potential on quantum critical systems, quantum phase transition and nano-devices.

abstract: A direct-detection Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) is proposed and demonstrated by using an up-conversion single-photon detector and a fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer (FFP-SI). Taking advantage of high signal-to-noise ratio of the detector and high spectrum resolution of the FFP-SI, the Brillouin spectrum along a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) is recorded on a multiscaler with a small data size directly. In contrast with conventional BOTDR adopting coherent detection, photon-counting BOTDR is simpler in structure and easier in data processing. In the demonstration experiment, characteristic parameters of the Brillouin spectrum including its power, spectral width and frequency center are analyzed simultaneously along a 10 km PMF at different temperature and stain conditions.

abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement is the distance or angle between an entangled target state and the nearest unentangled state. Often one considers the geometric measure of entanglement for highly symmetric entangled states because it simplifies the calculations and allows for analytic solutions. Although some symmetry is required in order to deal with large numbers of qubits, we are able to loosen some of the restrictions on the highly symmetric states considered previously, and consider several generalizations of the coefficients of both target and unentangled states. By relaxing some of the symmetry assumptions, we can compute the geometric entanglement measure for larger and more relevant classes of states.

abstract: The aim of this work is to compute the entanglement entropy of real and virtual particles by rewriting the generating functional of $\phi ^{4}$ theory as a mean value between states and observables defined through the correlation functions. Then the von Neumann definition of entropy can be applied to these quantum states and in particular, for the partial traces taken over the internal or external degrees of freedom. This procedure can be done for each order in the perturbation expansion showing that the entanglement entropy for real and virtual particles behaves as $\ln (m_{0})$. In particular, entanglement entropy is computed at first order for the correlation function of two external points showing that mutual information is identical to the external entropy and that conditional entropies are negative for all the domain of $m_{0}$. In turn, from the definition of the quantum states, it is possible to obtain general relations between total traces between different quantum states of a r theory. Finally, discussion about the possibility of taking partial traces over external degrees of freedom is considered, which implies the introduction of some observables that measure space-time points where interaction occurs.

abstract: In this article we propose a new approach to quantum measurement in reference to the stroboscopic tomography. Generally, in the stroboscopic approach it is assumed that the information about the quantum system is encoded in the mean values of certain Hermitian operators $Q_1, ..., Q_r$ and each of them can be measured more than once. The main goal of the stroboscopic tomography is to determine when one can reconstruct the initial density matrix $\rho(0)$ on the basis of the measurement results $\langle Q_i \rangle_{t_j}$. In this paper we propose to treat every complex matrix as a measurable operator. This generalized approach to quantum measurement may bring some improvement into the models of stroboscopic tomography.

abstract: The overwhelming majority of the attempts in exploring the problems related to quantum logical structures and their interpretation have been based on an underlying set-theoretic syntactic language. We propose a transition in the involved syntactic language to tackle these problems from the set-theoretic to the category-theoretic mode, together with a study of the consequent semantic transition in the logical interpretation of quantum event structures. In the present work, this is realized by representing categorically the global structure of a quantum algebra of events (or propositions) in terms of sheaves of local Boolean frames forming Boolean localization functors. The category of sheaves is a topos providing the possibility of applying the powerful logical classification methodology of topos theory with reference to the quantum world. In particular, we show that the topos-theoretic representation scheme of quantum event algebras by means of Boolean localization functors incorporates an object of truth values, which constitutes the appropriate tool for the definition of quantum truth-value assignments to propositions describing the behavior of quantum systems. Effectively, this scheme induces a revised realist account of truth in the quantum domain of discourse. We also include an appendix, where we compare our topos-theoretic representation scheme of quantum event algebras with other categorial and topos-theoretic approaches.

abstract: The fidelity of laser-driven quantum logic operations on trapped ion qubits tend to be lower than microwave-driven logic operations due to the difficulty of stabilizing the driving fields at the ion location. Through stabilization of the driving optical fields and use of composite pulse sequences, we demonstrate high fidelity single-qubit gates for the hyperfine qubit of a $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$ ion trapped in a microfabricated surface electrode ion trap. Gate error is characterized using a randomized benchmarking protocol, and an average error per randomized Clifford group gate of $3.6(3)\times10^{-4}$ is measured. We also report experimental realization of palindromic pulse sequences that scale efficiently in sequence length.

abstract: This is a comprehensive review on fault-tolerant topological quantum computation with the surface codes. The basic concepts and useful tools underlying fault-tolerant quantum computation, such as universal quantum computation, stabilizer formalism, and measurement-based quantum computation, are also provided in a pedagogical way. Topological quantum computation by brading the defects on the surface code is explained in both circuit-based and measurement-based models in such a way that their relation is clear. The interdisciplinary connections between quantum error correction codes and subjects in other fields such as topological order in condensed matter physics and spin glass models in statistical physics are also discussed. This manuscript will be appeared in SpringerBriefs.

abstract: Donoho and Stark have shown that a precise deterministic recovery of missing information contained in a time interval shorter than the time-frequency uncertainty limit is possible. We analyze this signal recovery mechanism from a physics point of view and show that the well-known Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, which is fundamental in signal processing, also uses essentially the same mechanism. The uncertainty relation in the context of information theory, which is based on Fourier analysis, provides a criterion to distinguish Shannon-Nyquist sampling from compressed sensing. A new signal recovery formula, which is analogous to Donoho-Stark formula, is given using the idea of Shannon-Nyquist sampling; in this formulation, the smearing of information below the uncertainty limit as well as the recovery of information with specified bandwidth take place. We also discuss the recovery of states from the domain below the uncertainty limit of coordinate and momentum in quantum mechanics and show that in principle the state recovery works by assuming ideal measurement procedures. The recovery of the lost information in the sub-uncertainty domain means that the loss of information in such a small domain is not fatal, which is in accord with our common understanding of the uncertainty principle, although its precise recovery is something we are not used to in quantum mechanics. The uncertainty principle provides a universal sampling criterion covering both the classical Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and the quantum mechanical measurement.

abstract: We derive rigorous truncation-error bounds for the spin-boson model and its generalizations to arbitrary quantum systems interacting with bosonic baths. For the numerical simulation of such baths the truncation of both, the number of modes and the local Hilbert-space dimensions is necessary. We derive super-exponential Lieb--Robinson-type bounds on the error when restricting the bath to finitely-many modes and show how the error introduced by truncating the local Hilbert spaces may be efficiently monitored numerically. In this way we give error bounds for approximating the infinite system by a finite-dimensional one. As a consequence, numerical simulations such as the time-evolving density with orthogonal polynomials algorithm (TEDOPA) now allow for the fully certified treatment of the system-environment interaction.

abstract: The thermal Casimir-Lifshitz force among two bodies held at different temperatures displays striking features that are absent in systems in thermal equilibrium. The manifestation of this force has been observed so far only in Bose-Einstein condensates close to a heated substrate, but never between two macroscopic bodies. Observation of the thermal Casimir-Lifhitz force out of thermal equilibrium with conventional Casimir setups is very difficult, because for experimentally accessible separations the thermal force is small compared to the zero-temperature quantum Casimir force, unless prohibitively large temperature differences among the plates are considered. We describe an apparatus that allows for a direct observation of the thermal force out of equilibrium for submicron separations and for moderate temperature differences between the plates.

abstract: The logic of a physical theory reflects the structure of the propositions referring to the behaviour of a physical system in the domain of the relevant theory. It is argued in relation to classical mechanics that the propositional structure of the theory allows truth-value assignment in conformity with the traditional conception of a correspondence theory of truth. Every proposition in classical mechanics is assigned a definite truth value, either 'true' or 'false', describing what is actually the case at a certain moment of time. Truth-value assignment in quantum mechanics, however, differs; it is known, by means of a variety of 'no go' theorems, that it is not possible to assign definite truth values to all propositions pertaining to a quantum system without generating a Kochen-Specker contradiction. In this respect, the Bub-Clifton 'uniqueness theorem' is utilized for arguing that truth-value definiteness is consistently restored with respect to a determinate sublattice of propositions defined by the state of the quantum system concerned and a particular observable to be measured. An account of truth of contextual correspondence is thereby provided that is appropriate to the quantum domain of discourse. The conceptual implications of the resulting account are traced down and analyzed at length. In this light, the traditional conception of correspondence truth may be viewed as a species or as a limit case of the more generic proposed scheme of contextual correspondence when the non-explicit specification of a context of discourse poses no further consequences.

abstract: Quantum and global discord in a spin-1 Heisenberg chain subject to single-ion anisotropy (uniaxial field) are studied using exact diagonalisation and the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG). We find that these measures of quantum nonclassicality are able to detect the quantum phase transitions confining the symmetry protected Haldane phase and show critical scaling with universal exponents. Moreover, in the case of thermal states, we find that quantum discord can increase with increasing temperature.

abstract: We propose a novel approach to define and measure the statistics of work, internal energy and dissipated heat in a driven quantum system. In our framework the presence of a physical detector arises naturally and work and its statistics can be investigated in the most general case. In particular, we explicitly show that the quantum coherence of the initial state can lead to measurable effects on the moments of the work done on the system. At the same time, we recover the known results if the initial state is a statistical mixture of energy eigenstates. Our method can also be applied to measure the dissipated heat in an open quantum system. By sequentially coupling the system to a detector, we can track the energy dissipated in the environment while accessing only the system degrees of freedom.

abstract: A hierarchy of equations for equilibrium reduced density matrices obtained earlier is used to consider systems of spinless bosons bound by forces of gravity alone. The systems are assumed to be at absolute zero of temperature under conditions of Bose condensation. In this case, a peculiar interplay of quantum effects and of very weak gravitational interaction between microparticles occurs. As a result, there can form spatially-bounded equilibrium structures macroscopic in size, both immobile and rotating. The size of a structure is inversely related to the number of particles in the structure. When the number of particles is relatively small the size can be enormous, whereas if this numbder equals Avogadro's number the radius of the structure is about 30 cm in the case that the structure consists of hydrogen atoms. The rotating objects have the form of rings and exhibit superfluidity. An atmosphere that can be captured by tiny celestial bodies from the ambient medium is considered too. The thickness of the atmosphere decreases as its mass increases. If short-range intermolecular forces are taken into account, the results obtained hold for excited states whose lifetime can however be very long. The results of the paper can be utilized for explaining the first stage of formation of celestial bodies from interstellar and even intergalactic gases.

abstract: The extension of thermodynamics into the quantum regime has received much attention in recent years. A primary objective of current research is to find thermodynamic tasks which can be enhanced by quantum mechanical effects. With this goal in mind, we explore the finite-time dynamics of absorption refrigerators composed of three qubits. The aim of this finite-time cooling is to reach low temperatures as fast as possible and subsequently extract the cold particle to exploit it for information processing purposes. We show that the coherent oscillations inherent to quantum dynamics can be harnessed to reach temperatures that are colder than the steady state in orders of magnitude less time, thereby providing a fast source of low-entropy qubits. This effect demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones, reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields, and is applicable to a broad range of technologically important scenarios.

abstract: There is no controversy on the assertion that entanglement and nonlocality are distinct resources. It is acknowledged that a clear illustration of this fact is the discrepancy between maximally entangled states and states that maximally violate a Bell inequality (usually identified with maximally nonlocal states), for systems composed by two qutrits. We argue that this anomaly is an artefact of the measures that have been used to quantify Bell nonlocality. By reasoning that the numeric value of a Bell function is akin to a witness rather than a quantifier, we define a measure of nonlocality and show that, for two qutrits and two four-dimensional Hilbert spaces, maximal entanglement does correspond to maximal nonlocality. As a consequence of our proposal, the question wether violations in local causality grow with the dimension of Hilbert spaces is reopen.

abstract: Non-Markovianity has recently attracted large interest due to significant advances in its characterization and its exploitation for quantum information processing. However, up to now, only non-Markovian regimes featuring environment to system backflow of information (strong non-Markovianity) have been experimentally simulated. Here, we report an all-optical observation of the so-called weak non-Markovian dynamics. Through full process tomography, we experimentally demonstrate that the dynamics of a qubit can be non-Markovian despite an always increasing correlation between the system and its environment. We also show the transition from the weak to the strong regime by changing a single parameter in the environmental state, leading us to a better understanding of the fundamental features of non-Markovianity.

abstract: The exact quantum decay of a many-body system equivalent to a gas of particles obeying generalized exclusion statistics is presented. The survival probability of the initial state exhibits early on a quadratic dependence on time that turns into a power-law decay, during the course of the evolution. Its is shown that the particle number and the strength of interactions determine the power-law exponent in the latter regime, as recently conjectured. The non-exponential character of the decay is linked to the many-particle reconstruction of the initial state from the decaying products.

Three-boson interaction is due to electro-optical effect. Analysis of the model is based on the algebraic properties of multimode field operators who, under certain assumptions, are su (2) algebra generators. The features of the transformation of the quantum states of signal photons in the electro-optical modulator are investigated. The limit on the number of interacting modes from the proposed (restricted) model to the traditionally used (unrestricted) model of electro-optical modulator is investigated.

abstract: In contrast to Hermitian systems, eigenstates of non-Hermitian ones are in general nonorthogonal. This feature is most pronounced at exceptional points where several eigenstates are linearly dependent. In this work we show that near this point a new effect takes place. It exhibits in energy increases in the system when its parameters change periodically. This effect resembles parametric resonance in a Hermitian system but there is a fundamental difference. It comes from the unique properties of the exceptional point that leads to parametric instability that occurs almost at any change in a parameter, while in the case of Hermitian systems it is necessary to fulfill resonance conditions. We illustrate this phenomenon by the case of two coupling waveguides with gain and loss. This phenomenon opens a wide range of applications in optics, plasmonics, and optoelectronics, where the loss is an inevitable problem and plays a crucial role.

abstract: We experimentally observed nonlinear variations in the three-vertex geometric phase in a two- photon polarization qutrit. The three-vertex geometric phase is defined by three quantum states, which generally forms a three-state (qutrit) system. By changing one of the three constituent states, we observed two rapid increases in the three-vertex geometric phase. The observed variations are inherent in a three-state system and cannot be observed in a two-state system. We used a time-reversed two-photon interferometer to measure the geometric phase with much more intense signals than those of a typical two-photon interferometer.

abstract: Using the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound from quantum estimation theory, we derive a fundamental quantum limit on the sensitivity of a temperature measurement of a thermal astronomical source. This limit is expressed in terms of the source temperature $T_s$, input spectral bandwidth $\Delta \nu$, and measurement duration $T$, subject to a long measurement time assumption $T\Delta \nu \gg 1$. It is valid for any measurement procedure that yields an unbiased estimate of the source temperature. The limit agrees with the sensitivity of direct detection or photon counting, and also with that of the ideal radiometer in the regime $kT_s/h \nu_0\gg 1$ for which the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation is valid, where $\nu_0$ is the center frequency at which the radiometer operates. While valid across the electromagnetic spectrum, the limit is especially relevant for radio astronomy in this regime, since it implies that no ingenious design or technological improvement can beat an ideal radiometer for temperature measurement. In this connection, our result refutes the recent claim of a radio astronomy technique with much-improved sensitivity over the radiometer (Lieu et al. 2015).

abstract: The practical prospect of quantum communication and information processing relies on sophisticated single photon pairs which feature controllable waveform, narrow spectrum, excellent purity, fiber compatibility and miniaturized design. For practical realizations, stable, miniaturized, low-cost devices are required. Sources with one or some of above performances have been demonstrated already, but it is quite challenging to have a source with all of the described characteristics simultaneously. Here we report on an integrated single-longitudinal-mode non-degenerate narrowband photon pair source, which exhibits all requirements needed for quantum applications. The device is composed of a periodically poled Ti-indiffused lithium niobate waveguide with high reflective dielectric mirror coatings deposited on the waveguide end-faces. Photon pairs with wavelengths around 890 nm and 1320 nm are generated via type II phase-matched parametric down-conversion. Clustering in this dispersive cavity restricts the whole conversion spectrum to one single-longitudinal-mode in a single cluster yielding a narrow bandwidth of only 60 MHz. The high conversion efficiency in the waveguide, together with the spectral clustering in the doubly resonant waveguide, leads to a high brightness of $3\times10^4~$pairs/(s$\cdot$mW$\cdot$MHz). This source exhibits prominent single-longitudinal-mode purity and remarkable temporal shaping capability. Especially, due to temporal broadening, we can observe that the coherence time of the two-photon component of PDC state is actually longer than the one of the single photon states. The miniaturized monolithic design makes this source have various fiber communication applications.

The proposed scheme is based on routinely performed measurements and established experimental procedures, hence providing a simplified methodology for quantum technological applications.

abstract: In the absence of decay, the conditional dynamics for an opensystem is often describable by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This study investigates spin squeezing (SS) in non-Hermitian one-axis twisting (OAT) model. Somewhat surprisingly, SS close to the limit of Hermitian two-axis counter twisting (TACT) Hamiltonian is achievable for some parameters, which significantly improves upon the optimal value realizable by Hermitian OAT model. The drawback is like with all conditional schemes, it takes on average longer time to evolve into steady state, and the probability of no decay or success decreases as number of atoms (spins) increases. The result above for steady state SS in non-Hermitian OAT Hamiltonian is thus limited to small systems. For other parameter regimes, however, desirable SS arrives dynamically before steady state is achieved, with greatly shortened evolution time and enhanced probability of success, while still remain significantly improved over the limit of Hermitian OAT.

abstract: Quasiprobability distributions (QDs) in open quantum systems are investigated for $SU(2)$, spin like systems, having relevance to quantum optics and information. In this work, effect of both quantum non-demolition (QND) and dissipative open quantum systems, on the evolution of a number of spin QDs are investigated. Specifically, compact analytic expressions for the $W$, $P$, $Q$, and $F$ functions are obtained for some interesting single, two and three qubit states, undergoing general open system evolutions. Further, corresponding QDs are reported for an N qubit Dicke model and a spin-1 system. The existence of nonclassical characteristics are observed in all the systems investigated here. The study leads to a clear understanding of quantum to classical transition in a host of realistic physical scenarios. Variation of the amount of nonclassicality observed in the quantum systems, studied here,are also investigated using nonclassical volume.

abstract: Fisher's information measure plays a very important role in diverse areas of theoretical physics. The associated measures as functionals of quantum probability distributions defined in, respectively, coordinate and momentum spaces, are the protagonists of our present considerations. The product of them has been conjectured to exhibit a non trivial lower bound in [Phys. Rev. A (2000) 62 012107]. We show here that such is not the case. This is illustrated, in particular, for pure states that are solutions to the free-particle Schr\"odinger equation. In fact, we construct a family of counterexamples to the conjecture, corresponding to time-dependent solutions of the free-particle Schr\"odinger equation. We also give a new conjecture regarding any normalizable time-dependent solution of this equation.

abstract: Li and Luo [Phys. Rev. A 78 (2008), 024303] discovered a remarkable relation between discord and entanglement. It establishes that all separable states can be obtained via reduction of a classicaly-correlated state "living" in a space of larger dimension. Starting from this result, we discuss here an optimal classical extension of separable states and explore this notion for low-dimensional systems. We find that the larger the dimension of the classical extension, the larger the discord in the original separable state. Further, we analyze separable states of maximum discord of two qubits, and their associated classical extensions.

abstract: We examine a class of operations for topological quantum computation based on fusing and measuring topological charges for systems with SU$(2)_4$ or $k=4$ Jones-Kauffman anyons. We show that such operations augment the braiding operations, which, by themselves, are not computationally universal. This augmentation results in a computationally universal gate set through the generation of an exact, topologically protected irrational phase gate and an approximate, topologically protected controlled-$Z$ gate.

abstract: Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of a classical description of objects in terms of the creation of many redundant registers in an environment containing their classical information. This amplification phenomenon, where only classical information reaches the macroscopic observer and through which different observers can agree on the objective existence of such object, has been revived lately for several types of situations, successfully explaining classicality. We explore quantum Darwinism in the setting of an environment made of two level systems which are initially prepared in the ground state of the XX model, which exhibits different phases; we find that the different phases have different ability to redundantly acquire classical information about the system, being the "ferromagnetic phase" the only one able to complete quantum Darwinism. At the same time we relate this ability to how non-Markovian the system dynamics is, based on the interpretation that non-Markovian dynamics is associated to back flow of information from environment to system, thus spoiling the information transfer needed for Darwinism. Finally, we explore mixing of bath registers by allowing a small interaction among them, finding that this spoils the stored information as previously found in the literature.

abstract: We demonstrate arbitrary coherent addressing of individual neutral atoms in a $5\times 5\times 5$ array formed by an optical lattice. Addressing is accomplished using rapidly reconfigurable crossed laser beams to selectively ac Stark shift target atoms, so that only target atoms are resonant with state-changing microwaves. The effect of these targeted single qubit gates on the quantum information stored in non-targeted atoms is smaller than $3\times 10^{-3}$ in state fidelity. This is an important step along the path of converting the scalability promise of neutral atoms into reality.

abstract: Consider a bipartite quantum system with at least one of its two components being itself a composite system. By tracing over part of one (or both) of these two subsystems it is possible to obtain a reduced (separable) state that exhibits quantum correlations even if the original state of the full system is endowed only with classical correlations. This effect, first pointed out by Li and Luo in (2008), is of considerable interest because there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that quantum correlations in non-entangled, mixed states may constitute a useful resource to implement non trivial information related tasks. Here we conduct a systematic exploration of the aforementioned effect for particular families of states of quantum systems of low dimensionality (three qubits states). In order to assess the non-classicality of the correlations of the reduced states we use an indicator of quantum correlations based upon the state disturbances generated by the measurement of local observables. We show, for a three-qubit system, that there exists a relationship between the classical mutual information of the original classically correlated states and the maximum quantum correlation exhibited by the reduced states.

abstract: We report the storage of microwave pulses at the single-photon level in a spin-ensemble memory consisting of $10^{10}$ NV centers in a diamond crystal coupled to a superconducting LC resonator. The energy of the signal, retrieved $100\, \mu \mathrm{s}$ later by spin-echo techniques, reaches $0.3\%$ of the energy absorbed by the spins, and this storage efficiency is quantitatively accounted for by simulations. This figure of merit is sufficient to envision first implementations of a quantum memory for superconducting qubits.

abstract: Here we propose and analyse in detail protocols that can achieve rapid hyperpolarization of 13C nuclear spins in randomly oriented ensembles of nanodiamonds at room temperature. Our protocols exploit a combination of optical polarization of electron spins in nitrogen-vacancy centers and the transfer of this polarization to 13C nuclei by means of microwave control to overcome the severe challenges that are posed by the random orientation of the nanodiamonds and their nitrogen-vacancy centers. Specifically, these random orientations result in exceedingly large energy variations of the electron spin levels that render the polarization and coherent control of the nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins as well as the control of their coherent interaction with the surrounding 13C nuclear spins highly inefficient. We address these challenges by a combination of an off-resonant microwave double resonance scheme in conjunction with a realization of the integrated solid effect which, together with adiabatic rotations of external magnetic fields or rotations of nanodiamonds, leads to a protocol that achieves high levels of hyperpolarization of the entire nuclear-spin bath in a randomly oriented ensemble of nanodiamonds even at room temperature. This hyperpolarization together with the long nuclear spin polarization lifetimes in nanodiamonds and the relatively high density of 13C nuclei has the potential to result in a major signal enhancement in 13C nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and suggests functionalized and hyperpolarized nanodiamonds as a unique probe for molecular imaging both in vitro and in vivo.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: One of the defining traits of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle which was originally expressed in terms of the standard deviation of two observables. Alternatively, it can be formulated using entropic measures, and can also be generalized by including a memory particle that is entangled with the particle to be measured. Here we consider a realistic scenario where the memory particle is an open system interacting with an external environment. Through the relation of conditional entropy to mutual information, we provide a link between memory effects and the rate of change of conditional entropy controlling the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation. Our treatment reveals that the memory effects stemming from the non-Markovian nature of quantum dynamical maps directly control the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation in a general way, independently of the specific type of interaction between the memory particle and its environment.

abstract: Characterizing quantum correlations in terms of information-theoretic principles is a popular chapter of quantum foundations. Traditionally, the principles used for this scope have been expressed in terms of conditional probability distributions, specifying the probability that a black box produces a certain output upon receiving a certain input. This framework is known as "device-independent". Another major chapter of quantum foundations is the information-theoretic characterization of quantum theory as a whole, with its sets of states and measurements, and with its allowed dynamics. The different frameworks adopted for this scope are known under the umbrella term "general probabilistic theories". With only a few exceptions, the two programmes on characterizing quantum correlations and characterizing quantum theory have so far proceeded on separate tracks, each one developing its own methods and its own agenda. However, both programmes share the same basic goal: a new and better understanding of quantum mechanics in information-theoretic terms. Considering such a common goal, it is quite striking that the connections between the two programmes are still largely undeveloped. This paper aims at bridging the gap, by presenting a "Rosetta stone" for the two frameworks and by illustrating how the two programmes can benefit each other. As a case study, we focus on two device-independent features known as Local Orthogonality (LO) and Consistent Exclusivity (CE) and reconstruct them from a different set of principles about pure orthogonal measurements, that is, measurements that cannot be further refined and that identify states without error.

abstract: We develop a microscopic toy model for Cavity dynamical Casimir effect (DCE), namely, the photon generation from vacuum due to a nonstationary dielectric slab in a fixed single mode cavity. We represent the slab by $N\gg 1$ noninteracting two-level atoms coupled to the field via the standard dipole interaction. We show that the DCE is contained implicitly in the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian when its parameters are externally prescribed functions of time. We also predict several new phenomena, such as saturation of the photon growth due to effective Kerr nonlinearity, generation of pairs of atomic excitations instead of photons ("Inverse DCE") and coherent annihilation of pair of system excitations due to the atomic modulation ("Anti-DCE"). These results are extended to the circuit QED architecture, where similar effects can be implemented with a single qubit providing an alternative way to generate cavity and atom-field entangled states.

abstract: Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) seems attractively simple: information is borne entirely by light and processed by components such as beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors. However this very simplicity leads to limitations, such as the lack of deterministic entangling operations, which are compensated for by using substantial hardware overheads. Here we quantify the resource costs for full scale LOQC by proposing a specific protocol based on the surface code. With the caveat that our protocol can be further optimised, we report that the required number of physical components is at least five orders of magnitude greater than in comparable matter-based systems. Moreover the resource requirements grow higher if the per-component photon loss rate is worse than one in a thousand, or the per-component noise rate is worse than $10^{-5}$. We identify the performance of switches in the network as the single most influential factor influencing resource scaling.

abstract: We construct a model of quantum metrology inspired by the computational model known as deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using only one pure qubit together with $l$ fully-mixed qubits we obtain measurement precision at the standard quantum limit, which is typically obtained using the same number of uncorrelated qubits in fully-pure states. The standard quantum limit can be exceeded using an additional qubit, which adds only a small amount of purity. We show that the discord in the final state vanishes only in the limit of attaining infinite precision for the parameter being estimated.

We show that in (1+1)-dimensions, a detector coupled to the scalar field vacuum for finite timescales (but long enough to satisfy the KMS condition) has a KMS temperature that decreases with acceleration, in certain regimes. This contrasts with the heating that one would expect from the Unruh effect.

abstract: Nano-structuring impurity-doped crystals affects the phonon density of states and thereby modifies the atomic dynamics induced by interaction with phonons. We propose the use of nano-structured materials in the form of powders or phononic bandgap crystals to enable, or improve, persistent spectral hole-burning and optical coherence for inhomogeneously broadened absorption lines in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. This is crucial for applications such as ultra-precise radio-frequency spectrum analyzers and certain approaches to optical quantum memories. We specifically discuss how phonon engineering can enable spectral hole burning in erbium-doped materials operating in the telecommunication band, and present simulations for density of states of nano-sized powders and phononic crystals for the case of Y$_2$SiO$_5$, a widely-used material in current quantum memory research.

abstract: We introduce an arrival time operator which is self-adjoint and, unlike previously proposed arrival time operators, has a close link to simple measurement models. Its spectrum leads to an arrival time distribution which is a variant of the Kijowski distribution (a re-ordering of the current) in the large momentum regime but is proportional to the kinetic energy density in the small momentum regime, in agreement with measurement models. A brief derivation of the latter distribution is given. We make some simple observations about the physical reasons for self-adjointness, or its absence, in arrival time operators and in the momentum operator on the half-line and we also compare our operator with the dwell time operator.

abstract: The `Schr\"odinger's cat' thought experiment highlights the counterintuitive facet of quantum theory that entanglement can exist between microscopic and macroscopic systems, producing a superposition of distinguishable states like the fictitious cat that is both alive and dead. The hallmark of entanglement is the detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the violation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this violation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and artificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable states, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations is typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate this reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an oscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can continuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its dependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement between an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a `Bell-cat' state. We use a circuit QED architecture, high-fidelity measurements, and real-time feedback control to violate Bell's inequality without post-selection or corrections for measurement inefficiencies. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of decoherence by continuously varying the size of created Bell-cat states and characterize the entangled system by joint Wigner tomography. These techniques provide a toolset for quantum information processing with entangled qubits and resonators. While recent results have demonstrated a high level of control of such systems, this experiment demonstrates that information can be extracted efficiently and with high fidelity, a crucial requirement for quantum computing with resonators.

abstract: As a quantum device, a quantum heat engine (QHE) is described by a Hermitian Hamiltonian. However, since it is an open system, reservoirs have to be imposed phenomenologically without any description in the context of quantum mechanics. A non-Hermitian system is expected to describe an open system which exchanges energy and particles with external reservoirs. Correspondingly, such an exchange can be adiabatic in the context of quantum mechanics. We first propose a non-Hermitian QHE by a concrete simple two-level system, which is an S = 1/2 spin in a complex external magnetic field. The non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian, as a self-contained one, describes both working medium and reservoirs. A heat-engine cycle is composed of completely quantum adiabatic processes. Surprisingly, the heat efficiency is obtained to be the same as that of Hermitian quantum Carnot cycle. A classical analogue of this scheme is also presented. Our finding paves the way for revealing what the role of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian plays in physics.

abstract: We propose an interferometric method for statistically discriminating between nonorthogonal states in high dimensional Hilbert spaces for use in quantum information processing. The method is illustrated for the case of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) states. These states belong to pairs of bases that are mutually unbiased on a sequence of two-dimensional subspaces of the full Hilbert space, but the vectors within the same basis are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. Over multiple trials, this method allows distinguishing OAM eigenstates from superpositions of multiple such eigenstates. Variations of the same method are then shown to be capable of preparing and detecting arbitrary linear combinations of states in Hilbert space. One further variation allows the construction of chains of states obeying recurrence relations on the Hilbert space itself, opening a new range of possibilities for more abstract information-coding algorithms to be carried out experimentally in a simple manner. Among other applications, we show that this approach provides a simplified means of switching between pairs of high-dimensional mutually unbiased OAM bases.

abstract: Several recent experiments have established by measuring the Mandel Q parameter that the number of Rydberg excitations in ultracold gases exhibits sub-Poissonian statistics. This effect is attributed to the Rydberg blockade that occurs due to the strong interatomic interactions between highly-excited atoms. Because of this blockade effect, the system can end up in a state in which all particles are either excited or blocked: a jamming limit. We analyze appropriately constructed random-graph models that capture the blockade effect, and derive formulae for the mean and variance of the number of Rydberg excitations in jamming limits. This yields an explicit relationship between the Mandel Q parameter and the blockade effect, and comparison to measurement data shows strong agreement between theory and experiment.

We point out that Crull is mistaken about decoherence and tacitly assumes some kind of interpretation of the quantum formalism.

Kraus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 110502 (2013)] the maximally entangled set of n-partite quantum states. This set consists of the states that are most useful under conversion of pure states via Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). We will review our results here on the maximally entangled set of three- and generic four-qubit states. Moreover, we will discuss the preparation of arbitrary (pure or mixed) bipartite states via deterministic LOCC transformations. Furthermore, we will consider the deterministic preparation of arbitrary three-qubit (four-qubit) states via LOCC using as a resource a six-qubit (23-qubit) state respectively.

abstract: We investigate sudden change (SC) behaviors of the distance-based measures of geometric quantum discords (GQDs) for two non-interacting qubits subject to the two-sided and the one-sided thermal reservoirs. We found that the GQDs defined by different distances exhibit different SCs, and thus the SCs are the combined result of the chosen discord measure and the property of a state. We also found that the thermal reservoir may generate states having different orderings related to different GQDs. These inherent differences of the GQDs reveal that they are incompatible in characterizing quantum correlations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

abstract: Since the inception of quantum mechanics, its validity as a complete description of reality has been challenged due to predictions that defy classical intuition. For many years it was unclear whether predictions like entanglement and projective measurement represented real phenomena or artifacts of an incomplete model. Bell inequalities (BI) provided the first quantitative test to distinguish between quantum entanglement and a yet undiscovered classical hidden variable theory. The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) provides a similar test for projective measurement, and more recently has been adapted to include variable strength measurements to study the process of measurement itself. Here we probe the intersection of both entanglement and measurement through the lens of the hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality (BLGI). By correlating data from ancilla-based weak measurements and direct projective measurements, we for the first time quantify the effect of measurement strength on entanglement collapse. Violation of the BLGI, which we achieve only at the weakest measurement strengths, offers compelling evidence of the completeness of quantum mechanics while avoiding several loopholes common to previous experimental tests. This uniquely quantum result significantly constrains the nature of any possible classical theory of reality. Additionally, we demonstrate that with sufficient scale and fidelity, a universal quantum processor can be used to study richer fundamental physics.

abstract: The setting of Moessbauer nuclei embedded in thin-film cavities has facilitated an aspiring platform for x-ray quantum optics as shown in several recent experiments. Here, we generalize the theoretical model of this platform that we developed earlier [Phys. Rev. A 88, 043828 (2013)]. The theory description is extended to cover multiple nuclear ensembles and multiple modes in the cavity. While the extensions separately do not lead to qualitatively new features, their combination gives rise to cooperative effects between the different nuclear ensembles and distinct spectral signatures in the observables. A related experiment by Roehlsberger et al. [Nature 482, 199 (2012)] is successfully modeled, the scalings derived with semiclassical methods are reproduced, and a microscopic understanding of the setting is obtained with our quantum mechanical description.

abstract: In this paper we introduce quantum Latin squares, combinatorial quantum objects which generalize classical Latin squares, and investigate their applications in quantum computer science. Our main results are on applications to unitary error bases (UEBs), basic structures in quantum information which lie at the heart of procedures such as teleportation, dense coding and error correction. We present a new method for constructing a UEB from a quantum Latin square equipped with extra data. Developing construction techniques for UEBs has been a major activity in quantum computation, with three primary methods proposed: shift-and-multiply, Hadamard, and algebraic. We show that our new approach simultaneously generalizes the shift-and-multiply and Hadamard methods. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a UEB using our technique which we prove cannot be obtained from any of these existing methods.

abstract: We study two models describing the interaction of a two-level system with two quantum field modes. The first one is equivalent to a dissipative two-state system with just two boson fields in the absence of tunneling. The second describes two orthogonal fields interacting with the corresponding orthogonal dipoles of a two-level system. We show that both models present a partial two-mode $SU(2)$ symmetry and that they can be solved in the exceptional case of resonant fields. We study their ground state configurations, that is, we find the quantum precursors of the corresponding semi-classical phase transitions, as well as their whole spectra to infer their integrability. We show that the first model in the exceptional case is isomorphic with the quantum Rabi model and allows just two ground state configurations, vacuum and non-vacuum. The second model allows four ground state configurations, one vacuum, two non-vacuum single mode and one non-vacuum dual mode, and give analytic and numerical pointers that may suggest its integrability. We also show that in the single excitation subspace these models can serve as a fast $SU(2)$ beam splitter even in the ultra-strong coupling regime.

abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum information processing and long-distance quantum communication. The field has recently seen a lot of progress, and the present focus issue offers a glimpse of these developments, showing both experimental and theoretical results from many of the leading groups around the world. On the experimental side, it shows work on cold gases, warm vapors, rare-earth ion doped crystals and single atoms. On the theoretical side there are in-depth studies of existing memory protocols, proposals for new protocols including approaches based on quantum error correction, and proposals for new applications of quantum storage. Looking forward, we anticipate many more exciting results in this area.

abstract: Envariance -- entanglement assisted invariance -- is a recently discovered symmetry of composite quantum systems. We show that thermodynamic equilibrium states are fully characterized by their envariance. In particular, the microcanonical equilibrium of a system $\mathcal{S} $ with Hamiltonian $H_\mathcal{S}$ can be described as an "even", i.e., envariant under any unitary transformation, fully energetically degenerate quantum state. The representation of the canonical equilibrium then follows from simply counting degenerate energy states. Our conceptually novel approach is free of mathematically ambiguous notions such as ensemble, randomness, etc., and it does not even rely on probability.

title: Path integrals in configuration space and the emergence of classical behavior for closed systems

abstract: Traditionally, the field of quantum foundations has been preoccupied with different forms of the question "How can an observer be in a state of quantum superposition?". In this paper, I approach this question by exploring a timeless interpretation of quantum mechanics \emph{of closed systems}, solely in terms of path integrals in non-relativistic timeless configuration space. What prompts a fresh look at the foundational problems in this context, is the advent of multiple gravitational models in which Lorentz symmetry is only emergent. In this setting, I propose a new understanding of records as certain relations between two configurations, the recorded one and the record-holding one. These relations are formalized through a factorization of the amplitude kernel, which forbids unwanted `recoherence' of branches. On this basis, I show that in simple cases the Born rule emerges from counting the relative density of observers with the same records. Furthermore, unlike what occurs in consistent histories, in this context there is indeed a preferred notion of coarse-grainings: those centered around piece-wise classical paths in configuration space. Thus, this new understanding claims to resolve aspects of the measurement problem which are still deemed controversial in the standard approaches.

abstract: The procedure proposed recently by J.Bougie, A.Gangopadhyaya and J.V.Mallow to study the general form of shape invariant potentials in one-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM) is generalized to the case of Higher Order SUSY QM with supercharges of second order in momentum. A new shape invariant potential is constructed by this method. It is singular at the origin, it grows at infinity, and its spectrum depends on the choice of connection conditions in the singular point. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is solved explicitly: the wave functions are constructed analytically, and the energy spectrum is defined implicitly via the transcendental equation which involves Confluent Hypergeometric functions.

abstract: We propose a protocol for measurement of the phonon number distribution of a harmonic oscillator based on selective mapping to a discrete spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We consider a system of a harmonically trapped ion, where a transition between two long lived states can be driven with resolved motional sidebands. The required unitary transforms are generated by amplitude-modulated polychromatic radiation fields, where the time-domain ramps are obtained from numerical optimization by application of the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior of the attainable fidelities and required times for the mapping transform with respect to the size of the Hilbert space. As one application we show how the mapping can be employed as a building block for experiments which require measurement of the work distribution of a quantum process.

abstract: We theoretically study the quantum receivers with adaptive measurements feedback for discriminating quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) coherent states in terms of average symbol error rate. For rectangular 16-QAM signal set, with different stages of adaptive measurements, the effects of realistic imperfection parameters including the sub-unity quantum efficiency and the dark counts of on-off detectors, as well as the transmittance of beam splitters and the mode mismatch factor between the signal and local oscillating fields on the symbol error rate are separately investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. Using photon-number-resolving detectors (PNRD) instead of on-off detectors, all the effects on the symbol error rate due to the above four imperfections can be suppressed in a certain degree. The finite resolution and PNR capability of PNRDs are also considered. We find that for currently available technology, the receiver shows a reasonable gain from the standard quantum limit (SQL) with moderate stages.

The optimal conversion of coherent states under incoherent operations is presented which sheds some light on the coherence of a single copy of a pure state.

abstract: We analyze theoretically the measurement of the mean output work and its fluctuations in a recently proposed optomechanical quantum heat engine [K. Zhang {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf112}, 150602 (2014)]. After showing that this work can be evaluated by a continuous measurements of the intracavity photon number we discuss both dispersive and absorptive measurement schemes and analyze their back-action effects on the efficiency of the engine. Both measurements are found to reduce the efficiency of the engine, but their back-action is both qualitatively and quantitatively different. For dispersive measurements the efficiency decreases as a result of the mixing of photonic and phononic excitations, while for absorptive measurements, its reduction results from photon losses due to the interaction with the quantum probe.

abstract: Superconducting systems have a long history of use in experiments that push the frontiers of mechanical sensing. This includes both applied and fundamental research, which at present day ranges from quantum computing research and efforts to explore Planck-scale physics to fundamental studies on the nature of motion and the quantum limits on our ability to measure it. In this paper, we first provide a short history of the role of superconducting circuitry and devices in mechanical sensing, focusing primarily on efforts in the last decade to push the study of quantum mechanics to include motion on the scale of human-made structures. This background sets the stage for the remainder of the paper, which focuses on the development of quantum electromechanical systems (QEMS) that incorporate superconducting quantum bits (qubits), superconducting transmission line resonators and flexural nanomechanical elements. In addition to providing the motivation and relevant background on the physical behavior of these systems, we discuss our recent efforts to develop a particular type of QEMS that is based upon the Cooper-pair box (CPB) and superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavities, a system which has the potential to serve as a testbed for studying the quantum properties of motion in engineered systems.

The geometry also plays an important role in foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information. In this work we discuss a geometric framework for mixed quantum states represented by density matrices, where the quantum phase space of density matrices is equipped with a symplectic structure, an almost complex structure, and a compatible Riemannian metric. This compatible triple allow us to investigate arbitrary quantum systems. We will also discuss some applications of the geometric framework.

abstract: A proposal for a phase gate and a M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate in the dressed state basis is presented. In order to perform the multi-qubit interaction, a strong magnetic field gradient is required to couple the phonon-bus to the qubit states. The gate is performed using resonant microwave driving fields together with either a radio-frequency (RF) driving field, or additional detuned microwave driving fields. The gate is robust to ambient magnetic field fluctuations due to an applied resonant microwave driving field. Furthermore, the gate is robust to fluctuations in the microwave Rabi frequency and is decoupled from phonon dephasing due to a resonant RF or a detuned microwave driving field. This makes this new gate an attractive candidate for the implementation of high-fidelity microwave based multi-qubit gates. The proposal can also be realized in laser-based set-ups.

abstract: Recently, entanglement concentration was explicitly shown to be irreversible. However, it is still not clear what kind of states can be reversibly converted in the asymptotic setting by LOCC when neither the initial and the target states are maximally entangled. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled states in the asymptotic setting. Moreover, we show that conversion can be achieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition except for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free reversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose copies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of copies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In fact, we show such an example. In addition, we evaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the irreversibility of LOCC conversion.

abstract: We introduce local filters as a means to detect the entanglement of bound entangled states which do not yield to detection by witnesses based on positive (P) maps which are not completely positive (CP). We demonstrate how such non-detectable bound entangled states can be locally filtered into detectable bound entangled states. Specifically, we show that a bound entangled state in the orthogonal complement of the unextendible product bases (UPB), can be locally filtered into a another bound entangled state that is detectable by the Choi map. We reinterpret these filters as local measurements on locally extended Hilbert spaces. We give explicit constructions of a measurement-based implementation of these filters for $2 \otimes 2$ and $3 \otimes 3$ systems. This provides us with a physical mechanism to implement such local filters.

Starting from a naive perturbative solution of the von Neumann equation, the reduced density matrix with the coarse grained time steps is obtained using the assumption of short correlation time of the bath field. Then applying the renormalization group method, it is shown that dependence of the specific initial time in the solution can be removed and the Markovian semi-group master equation in Lindblad form is attained in the weak coupling limit.

abstract: The full structuration of light in the transverse plane, including intensity, phase and polarization, holds the promise of unprecedented capabilities for applications in classical optics as well as in quantum optics and information sciences. Harnessing special topologies can lead to enhanced focusing, data multiplexing or advanced sensing and metrology. Here we experimentally demonstrate the storage of such spatio-polarization-patterned beams into an optical memory. A set of vectorial vortex modes is generated via liquid crystal cell with topological charge in the optic axis distribution, and preservation of the phase and polarization singularities is demonstrated after retrieval, at the single-photon level. The realized multiple-degree-of-freedom memory can find applications in classical data processing but also in quantum network scenarios where structured states have been shown to provide promising attributes, such as rotational invariance.

abstract: We investigate the nature of a gravitational two-state system (G2S) in the simplest setup in Newtonian gravity. In a quantum description of matter a single motionless massive particle can in principle be in a superposition state of two spatially-separated locations. This superposition state in gravity, or gravitational cat state, would lead to fluctuations in the Newtonian force exerted on a nearby test particle. The central quantity of importance for this inquiry is the energy density correlation. This corresponds to the noise kernel in stochastic gravity theory, evaluated in the weak field nonrelativistic limit. In this limit, quantum fluctuations of the stress energy tensor manifest as the fluctuations of the Newtonian force. We describe the properties of such a G2S system and present two ways of measuring the cat state for the Newtonian force, one by way of a classical probe, the other a quantum harmonic oscillator. Our findings include: (i) mass density fluctuations persist even in single particle systems, and they are of the same order of magnitude as the mean; (ii) a classical probe generically records a non-Markovian fluctuating force; (iii) a quantum probe interacting with the G2S system may undergo Rabi oscillations in a strong coupling regime. This simple prototypical gravitational quantum system could provide a robust testing ground to compare predictions from alternative quantum theories, since the results reported here are based on standard quantum mechanics and classical gravity.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that it is impossible to simulate quantum bipartite correlations with a deterministic universal Turing machine. Our approach is based on the Normalized Information Distance (NID) that allows the comparison of two pieces of data without detailed knowledge about their origin. Using NID, we derive an inequality for output of two local deterministic universal Turing machines with correlated inputs. This inequality is violated by correlations generated by a maximally entangled polarization state of two photons. The violation is shown using a freely available lossless compression program. The presented technique may allow to complement the common statistical interpretation of quantum physics by an algorithmic one.

abstract: Numerical methods for the 1-D Dirac equation based on operator splitting and on the quantum lattice Boltzmann (QLB) schemes are reviewed. It is shown that these discretizations fall within the class of quantum walks, i.e. discrete maps for complex fields, whose continuum limit delivers Dirac-like relativistic quantum wave equations. The correspondence between the quantum walk dynamics and these numerical schemes is given explicitly, allowing a connection between quantum computations, numerical analysis and lattice Boltzmann methods. The QLB method is then extended to the Dirac equation in curved spaces and it is demonstrated that the quantum walk structure is preserved. Finally, it is argued that the existence of this link between the discretized Dirac equation and quantum walks may be employed to simulate relativistic quantum dynamics on quantum computers.

abstract: We propose the use of the subwavelength localization via adiabatic passage technique for fluorescence microscopy with nanoscale resolution in the far field. This technique uses a {\Lambda}-type medium coherently coupled to two laser pulses: the pump, with a node in its spatial profile, and the Stokes. The population of the {\Lambda} system is adiabatically transferred from one ground state to the other except at the node position, yielding a narrow population peak. This coherent localization allows fluorescence imaging with nanometer lateral resolution. We derive an analytical expression to asses the resolution and perform a comparison with the coherent population trapping and the stimulated-emission-depletion techniques.

abstract: Multi-photon interferences in complex multimode structures - quantum walks - are of both funda- mental and technological interest. They rely on the ability to design the complex network where the walk occurs. Here, we demonstrate the control of quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in a complex linear system - a highly multimode fiber - by means of wavefront shaping techniques. Using the measured transmission matrix of the fiber, we demonstrate the ability to address arbitrary output modes of the two-photon speckle pattern, and simultaneous control of the quantum inter- ferences. This work provides a reconfigurable platform for multi-photon, multimode interference experiments and a route to high-dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: We investigate in detail a recently introduced "coherent averaging scheme" in terms of its usefulness for achieving Heisenberg limited sensitivity in the measurement of different parameters. In the scheme, $N$ quantum probes in a product state interact with a quantum bus. Instead of measuring the probes directly and then averaging as in classical averaging, one measures the quantum bus or the entire system and tries to estimate the parameters from these measurement results. Combining analytical results from perturbation theory and an exactly solvable dephasing model with numerical simulations, we draw a detailed picture of the scaling of the best achievable sensitivity with $N$, the dependence on the initial state, the interaction strength, the part of the system measured, and the parameter under investigation.

abstract: In response to a recent rebuttal of [1] presented in [2], we defend the claim that the Consistent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics does not solve the measurement problem. In order to do so, we argue that satisfactory solutions to the problem must not only not contain anthropomorphic terms (such as measurement or observer) at the fundamental level, but also that applications of the formalism to concrete situations (e.g., measurements) should not require any input not contained in the description of the situation at hand at the fundamental level. Our assertion is that the Consistent Histories formalism does not meet the second criterion. We also argue that the so-called second measurement problem, i.e., the inability to explain how an experimental result is related to a property possessed by the measured system before the measurement took place, is only a pseudo-problem. As a result, we reject the claim, defended in [2], that the capacity of the Consistent Histories formalism to solve it should count as an advantage over other interpretations.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03250
abstract: In the pursuit of speculative new particles, forces, and dimensions with vanishingly small influence on normal matter, understanding the ultimate physical limits of experimental sensitivity is essential. Here, I show that quantum decoherence offers a window into otherwise inaccessible realms. There is a standard quantum limit for diffusion that restricts some entanglement-generating phenomena, like soft collisions with new particle species, from having appreciable classical influence on normal matter. Such phenomena are \emph{classically undetectable} but can be revealed by the anomalous decoherence they induce on non-classical superpositions with long-range coherence in phase space. This gives strong, novel motivation for the construction of matter interferometers and other experimental sources of large superpositions, which recently have seen rapid progress. Decoherence is always at least second order in the coupling strength, so such searches are best suited for soft, but not weak, interactions.

abstract: A special configuration of graph state stabilizers, which contains only Pauli $\sigma_X$ operators, is studied. The vertex sets $\xi$ associated with such configurations are defined as what we call X-chains of graph states. The X-chains of a general graph state can be determined efficiently. They form a group structure such that one can obtain the explicit representation of graph states in the X-basis via the so-called X-chain factorization diagram. We show that graph states with different X-chain groups can have different probability distributions of X-measurement outcomes, which allows one to distinguish certain graph states with X-measurements. We provide an approach to find the Schmidt decomposition of graph states in the X-basis. The existence of X-chains in a subsystem facilitates error correction in the entanglement localization of graph states. In all of these applications, the difficulty of the task decreases with increasing number of X-chains. Furthermore, we show that the overlap of two graph states can be efficiently determined via X-chains, while its computational complexity with other known methods increases exponentially.

abstract: We propose here a two-round relativistic bit commitment scheme where committer commits in the first round and then confirms his/her commitment in the second round. The scheme offers indefinite commitment time where both committer and receiver extract non-locally correlated measurement outcomes during the scheme that can be stored and revealed after arbitrarily long time. We show that the proposed scheme turns out to be a multiparty bit commitment scheme where both parties commit and reveal simultaneously. The multiparty generalization would have applications in business and secure multiparty computations such as managing joint bank account, holding joint shares in stock exchange and blind bidding. The same bit commitment scheme can also be used for the commitment of arbitrarily long classical bit strings. The scheme can be applied efficiently with existing technologies; entanglement is required only for time t=x/c where x is the special distance, can be as small as possible, between the committer and receiver.

Using recently developed scattering approach we discuss transmission properties, power spectrum, the full counting statistics and the entanglement entropy of transmitted and reflected states of light. Our approach takes into account spatial parameters of an incident coherent pulse as well as waiting and counting times of a detector. We describe time evolution of the power spectrum as well as observe deviations from the Poissonian statistics for reflected and transmitted fields. In particular, the statistics of reflected photons can change from sub-Poissonian to super-Poissonian for increasing values of the detuning, while the statistics of transmitted photons is strictly super-Poissonian in all parametric regimes. We study the entanglement entropy of some spatial part of the scattered pulse and observe that it obeys the area laws and that it is bounded by the maximal entropy of the effective four-level system.

abstract: Electron-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots plays a significant role in determining the optical properties of excited excitons, especially the spectral nature of emitted photons. This paper presents a comprehensive theory and analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled to structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons, when excited with incoherent pump fields. As specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose a Lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide, which are of current experimental interest. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare and contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat electron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian polaron master equation, a non-Markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear susceptibility approach, and we point out the limitations of these models. For the cavity-QED polaron master equation, we give closed form analytical solutions to the phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation approximation, fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning and cavity dot coupling. We show explicitly why the semiclassical linear susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon-mediated cavity feeding. For weakly coupled cavities, we calculate the optical spectra using a more general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above approaches in the low Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We subsequently use this general reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled to slow-light photonic crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of striking photon-phonon coupling effects. Our quantum theory can be applied to a wide range of photonic structures including photonic molecules and coupled-cavity waveguide systems.

abstract: Quantum states can be stabilized in the presence of intrinsic and environmental losses by either applying active feedback conditioned on an ancillary system or through reservoir engineering. Reservoir engineering maintains a desired quantum state through a combination of drives and designed entropy evacuation. We propose and implement a quantum reservoir engineering protocol that stabilizes Fock states in a microwave cavity. This protocol is realized with a circuit quantum electrodynamics platform where a Josephson junction provides direct, nonlinear coupling between two superconducting waveguide cavities. The nonlinear coupling results in a single photon resolved cross-Kerr effect between the two cavities enabling a photon number dependent coupling to a lossy environment. The quantum state of the microwave cavity is discussed in terms of a net polarization and is analyzed by a measurement of its steady state Wigner function.

abstract: In a recent series of two research papers Cui, Wang and Hong proposed a class of anyonic models for universal quantum computation based on weakly-integral anyons. While universal set of gates cannot be obtained in this context by anyon braiding alone, designing a certain type of sector charge measurement provides universality. From the mathematical standpoint the underlying unitary bases arising in various versions of the weakly-integral anyonic models are defined over a certain ring of Eisenstein rationals, that has useful number-theoretic properties. In this paper we develop a compilation algorithm to approximate arbitrary $n$-qutrit unitaries with asymptotically efficient circuits over the metaplectic anyon model, the most recent instance of the weakly-integral anyonic class. One flavor of our algorithm produces efficient circuits with upper complexity bound asymptotically in $O(3^{2\,n} \, \log{1/\varepsilon})$ and entanglement cost that is exponential in $n$. Another flavor of the algorithm produces efficient circuits with upper complexity bound in $O(n\,3^{2\,n} \, \log{1/\varepsilon})$ and no additional entanglement cost.

abstract: To implement a set of universal quantum logic gates based on non-Abelian geometric phases, it is a conventional wisdom that quantum systems beyond two levels are required, which is extremely difficult to fulfil for superconducting qubits, appearing to be a main reason why only single qubit gates was implemented in a recent experiment [A. A. Abdumalikov Jr \emph{et al}., Nature 496, 482 (2013)]. Here we propose to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspace on circuit QED, where one can use only the two levels in transmon qubits, a usual interaction, and a minimal resource for the decoherence-free subspace encoding. In particular, our scheme not only overcomes the difficulties encountered in previous studies, but also can still achieve considerably large effective coupling strength, such that high fidelity quantum gates can be achieved. Therefore, the present scheme makes it very promising way to realize robust holonomic quantum computation with superconducting circuits.

abstract: It has long been speculated that the Dirac or, more generally, the Dirac-Pauli spinor in the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) representation should behave like a classical relativistic spinor in the low-energy limit when the particle-antiparticle interaction is negligible. In the weak-field limit of static and homogeneous electromagnetic fields, we rigorously prove, by applying Kutzelnigg's method inductively on the orders of $1/c$ in the power series, that it is indeed the case: the FW transformation of the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian is in full agreement with the classical counterpart, which is the sum of the orbital Hamiltonian for the Lorentz force equation and the spin Hamiltonian for the Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation.

abstract: Systems evolving under the influence of competing two-body and three-body interactions, are of particular interest in exploring the stability of equilibrium states of strongly interacting many-body system. We present a solvable model based on qubit networks, which allows us to investigate the intricate influence of these couplings on the possible asymptotic equilibrium states. We study the asymptotic evolution of finite qubit networks under two and three-qubit interactions. As representatives of three-qubit interactions we choose controlled unitary interactions (cu-interactions) with one and two control qubits. It is shown that networks with purely three-qubit interactions exhibit different asymptotic dynamics depending on whether we deal with interactions controlled by one or two qubits. However, when we allow three-qubit interactions next to two-qubit interactions, the asymptotics is dictated by two-qubit interactions only. Finally, we prove that the simultaneous presence of two types of three-qubit interactions results in the asymptotic dynamics characteristic for two-qubit cu-interactions.

abstract: Various spin effects are expected to become observable in light-matter interaction at relativistic intensities. Relativistic quantum mechanics equipped with a suitable relativistic spin operator forms the theoretical foundation for describing these effects. Various proposals for relativistic spin operators have been offered by different authors, which are presented in a unified way. As a result of the operators' mathematical properties only the Foldy-Wouthuysen operator and the Pryce operator qualify as possible proper relativistic spin operators. The ground states of highly charged hydrogen-like ions can be utilized to identify a legitimate relativistic spin operator experimentally. Subsequently, the Foldy-Wothuysen spin operator is employed to study electron-spin precession in high-intensity standing light waves with elliptical polarization. For a correct theoretical description of the predicted electron-spin precession relativistic effects due to the spin angular momentum of the electromagnetic wave has to be taken into account even in the limit of low intensities.

abstract: We search for the optimal quantum pure states of identical bosonic particles for applications in quantum metrology, in particular in the estimation of a single parameter for the generic two-mode interferometric setup. We consider the general case in which the total number of particles is fluctuating around an average $N$ with variance $\Delta N^2$. By recasting the problem in the framework of classical probability, we clarify the maximal accuracy attainable and show that it is always larger than the one reachable with a fixed number of particles (i.e., $\Delta N=0$). In particular, for larger fluctuations, the error in the estimation diminishes proportionally to $1/\Delta N$, below the Heisenberg-like scaling $1/N$. We also clarify the best input state, which is a "quasi-NOON state" for a generic setup, and for some special cases a two-mode "Schr\"odinger-cat state" with a vacuum component. In addition, we search for the best state within the class of pure Gaussian states with a given average $N$, which is revealed to be a product state (with no entanglement) with a squeezed vacuum in one mode and the vacuum in the other.

abstract: We present practical methods to measure entanglement for quantum simulators that can be realized with trapped ions, cold atoms, and superconducting qubits. Focussing on long- and short-range Ising-type Hamiltonians, we introduce schemes that are applicable under realistic experimental conditions including mixedness due to, e.g., noise or temperature. In particular, we identify a single observable whose expectation value serves as a lower bound to entanglement and which may be obtained by a simple quantum circuit. As such circuits are not (yet) available for every platform, we investigate the performance of routinely measured observables as quantitative entanglement witnesses. Possible applications include experimental studies of entanglement scaling in critical systems and the reliable benchmarking of quantum simulators.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03575
abstract: The impact of control sequences on the environmental coupling of a quantum system can be described in terms of a filter. Here we analyze how the coherent evolution of two interacting spins subject to periodic control pulses, at the example of a nitrogen vacancy center coupled to a nuclear spin, can be described in the filter framework in both the weak and the strong coupling limit. A universal functional dependence around the filter resonances then allows for tuning the coupling type and strength. Originally limited to small rotation angles, we show how the validity range of the filter description can be extended to the long time limit by time-sliced evolution sequences. Based on that insight, the construction of tunable, noise decoupled, conditional gates composed of alternating pulse sequences is proposed. In particular such an approach can lead to a significant improvement in fidelity as compared to a strictly periodic control sequence. Moreover we analyze the decoherence impact, the relation to the filter for classical noise known from dynamical decoupling sequences, and we outline how an alternating sequence can improve spin sensing protocols.

abstract: Small quantum absorption refrigerators have recently attracted renewed attention. Here we present a missing design of a two-qubit fridge, the main feature of which is that one of the two machine qubits is itself maintained at a temperature colder than the cold bath. This is achieved by 'reversing' the couplings to the baths compared to previous designs, where only a transition is maintained cold. We characterize the working regime and the efficiency of the fridge. We demonstrate the soundness of the model by deriving and solving a master equation. Finally, we discuss the performance of the fridge, in particular the heat current extracted from the cold bath. We show that our model performs comparably to the standard three-level quantum fridge, and thus appears appealing for possible implementations of nano thermal machines.

abstract: We investigate how much amount of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement is required in order to prepare a given multipartite state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC).We present a LOCC procedure that asymptotically converts GHZ states into an arbitrary multipartite pure state, whose conversion rate is given by the multipartite discord of the state. This reveals that the GHZ-entanglement cost of preparing a pure state is not higher than the multipartite discord of the state. It also provides an operational interpretation of multipartite discord for pure states, namely, the consumption rate of GHZ entanglement in the devised procedure.

abstract: Individual atoms in optical cavities can provide an efficient interface between stationary qubits and flying qubits (photons), which is an essentiel building block for quantum communication. Furthermore, cavity assisted controlled-not (CNOT) gates can be used for swapping entanglement to long distances in a quantum repeater setup. Nonetheless, dissipation introduced by the cavity during the CNOT may increase the experimental difficulty in obtaining long-distance entanglement distribution using these systems. We analyse and compare a number of cavity-based repeater schemes combining various entanglement generation schemes and cavity assisted CNOT gates. We find that a scheme, where high-fidelity entanglement is first generated in a two-photon detection scheme and then swapped to long distances using a recently proposed heralded CZ-gate exhibits superior performance compared to the other schemes. The heralded gate moves the effect of dissipation from the fidelity to the success probability of the gate thereby enabling high-fidelity entanglement swapping. As a result, high-rate entanglement distribution can be achieved over long distances even for low cooperativities of the atom-cavity systems. This high-fidelity repeater is shown to outperform the other cavity-based schemes by up to two orders of magnitude in the rate for realistic parameters and large distances (1000 km).

abstract: Postselection is the process of discarding outcomes from statistical trials that are not the event one desires. Postselection can be useful in many applications where the cost of getting the wrong event is implicitly high. However, unless this cost is specified exactly, one might conclude that discarding all data is optimal. Here we analyze the optimal decision rules and quantum measurements in a decision theoretic setting where a pre-specified cost is assigned to discarding data. We also relate our formulation to previous approaches which focus on minimizing the probability of indecision.

abstract: We characterize the set of generalized quantum measurements that can be decomposed into a continuous measurement process using a stream of probe qubits and a tunable interaction Hamilto- nian. Each probe in the stream interacts weakly with the target quantum system, then is measured projectively in a standard basis. This measurement result is used in a closed feedback loop to tune the interaction Hamiltonian for the next probe. The resulting evolution is a stochastic process with the structure of a one-dimensional random walk. To maintain this structure, and require that at long times the measurement outcomes be independent of the path, the allowed interaction Hamil- tonians must lie in a restricted set, such that the Hamiltonian terms on the target system form a finite dimensional Jordan algebra. This algebraic structure of the interaction Hamiltonians yields a large class of generalized measurements that can be continuously performed by our scheme, and we fully describe this set.

abstract: The Wigner function provides a useful quasi-probability representation of quantum mechanics, with applications in various branches of physics. Many nice properties of the Wigner function are intimately connected with the high symmetry of the underlying operator basis composed of phase point operators: any pair of phase point operators can be transformed to any other pair by a unitary transformation. We show that, in the discrete scenario, such a highly symmetric representation can only appear in odd prime power dimensions except for dimensions 2 and 8. In addition, this permutation symmetry suffices to single out a unique discrete Wigner function not only among various discrete Wigner functions, but also among all possible quasi-probability representations of quantum mechanics. This special discrete Wigner function is also uniquely determined by covariance with respect to the Clifford group of the multipartite Heisenberg-Weyl group.

abstract: We consider the effect of self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation on the joint spectral amplitude of photon pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing. In particular, the purity of a heralded photon from a pair is considered, in the context of schemes that aim to maximise the purity and minimise correlation in the joint spectral amplitude using birefringent phase-matching and short pump pulses. We find that non-linear phase modulation effects will be detrimental, and will limit the quantum interference visibility that can be achieved at a given generation rate. An approximate expression for the joint spectral amplitude with phase modulation is found by considering the group velocity walk-off between each photon and the pump, but neglecting the group-velocity dispersion at each wavelength. The group-velocity dispersion can also be included with a numerical calculation, and it is shown that it only has a small effect on the purity for the realistic parameters considered.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03779
abstract: In Heisenberg's error-disturbance relation for electron position measurement, the measurement error must be the one that determines the uncertainty in the electron position just after the measurement. It is the resolution $\epsilon(x_t)$ i.e., the measurement error of the post-measurement observable $\hat{x}_t$, not the precision $\epsilon(x_0)$ i.e., that of the pre-measurement observable $\hat{x}_0$ that determines the uncertainty of the observable $\hat{x}_t$. Therefore, Heisenberg's relation must be interpreted as one between the resolution $\epsilon(x_t)$ and the disturbance $\eta(y_0)$. The magnitude of the disturbance $\eta(y_0)$ is independent of the definition of the measurement value of the observable $\hat{x}_t$. Heisenberg's error-disturbance relation is proven to hold true in general, when the measurement value of $\hat{x}_t$ is defined in order to minimize the resolution $\epsilon(x_t)$.

We then turn to even more peculiar phenomenon suggesting "emerging correlations" between independent pre- and post-selected ensembles of particles. This can be viewed as a quantum violation of the classical "pigeonhole principle".

However, we provide a partial classification of the limit through a study of the space of all quantum random variables having quantum expectation zero.

We provide empirical support for the assumption of Gaussian statistics in quasi-resonant light transmitted through an $^{87}$Rb vapor cell and we illustrate the suggested approach by studying the evolution of the fluctuation ellipsis as a function of laser detuning. Applying the method to two light beams obtained by parting squeezed light in a beamsplitter, we have measured entanglement and quantum discord.

abstract: Entanglement can be well quantified by R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy which is a generalization of the standard von Neumann entropy. Here we study the measure of entanglement R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy for arbitrary two-qubit states. We show that entanglement of two states may be incomparable, contrary to other well-accepted entanglement measures. These facts impose constraint on the convertibility of entangled states by local operations and classical communication. We find that when $\alpha $ is larger than a critical value, the entanglement measure by R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy is determined solely by concurrence which is a well accepted measure of entanglement. When $\alpha $ is small, the entanglement R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy of Werner state is obtained. Interestingly, we show that entanglement R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy of Werner state is always less than any pure entangled state when $\alpha $ is close to zero, even this Werner state is close to a maximally entangled state and the concurrence is larger. We also conclude that the optimal decomposition of a general mixed state cannot be the same for all $\alpha $.

One approach is to use block codes that encode multiple qubits, which can achieve significantly higher rates for the same code distance than single-qubit code blocks or topological codes. We present a scheme for universal quantum computation using multi-qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) block codes, where codes admitting different transversal gates are used to achieve universality, and logical teleportation is used to move qubits between code blocks. All circuits for both computation and error correction are transversal. We also argue that single shot fault-tolerant error correction can be done in Steane syndrome extraction. Then, we present estimates of information lifetime for a few possible codes, which suggests that highly nontrivial quantum computations can be achieved at reasonable error rates, using codes that require significantly less than 100 physical qubits per logical qubit.

abstract: We study the discrimination of N mixed quantum states in an optimal measurement that maximizes the probability of correct results while the probability of inconclusive results is fixed at a given value. After considering the discrimination of N states in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, we focus on the discrimination of qubit states. We develop a method to determine an optimal measurement for discriminating arbitrary qubit states, taking into account that often the optimal measurement is not unique and the maximum probability of correct results can be achieved by several different measurements. Analytical results are derived for a number of examples, mostly for the discrimination between qubit states which possess a partial symmetry, but also for discriminating N equiprobable qubit states and for the dicrimination between a pure and a uniformly mixed state in d dimensions. In the special case where the fixed rate of inconclusive results is equal to zero, our method provides a treatment for the minimum-error discrimination of arbitrary qubit states which differs from previous approaches.

abstract: The problem concerning the minimum time for an initial state to evolve up to a target state plays an important role in the Classic Optimal Control theory. In the quantum context, as quantum states are so sensitive to environmental influences, the problem is more complex, but its formulation and solution are decisive to implement quantum information processing systems. As is well known, the decoherence phenomenon is unavoidable and the time-energy uncertainty relation must be used to study quantum dynamics. Here, the time-energy uncertainty relations are revisited, being fundamental to propose performance measures based on minimum time evolution. A minimum time performance measure is definedfor quantum control problems. Then, some practical examples are considered and the minimum time performance measure is applied providing results that are supposed to be useful for researchers to pursue strategies to optimize the control of the states of a quantum system.

abstract: Superconducting circuits and trapped ions are promising architectures for quantum information processing. However, the natural frequencies for controlling these systems -- radio frequency ion control and microwave domain superconducting qubit control -- make direct Hamiltonian interactions between them weak. In this paper we describe a technique for coupling a trapped ion's motion to the fundamental mode of a superconducting circuit. We do this by applying a carefully modulated external magnetic flux to the circuit. In conjunction with a non-linear element (Josephson junction), this gives the circuit an effective time-dependent inductance. We then show how to tune the external flux to generate a resonant coupling between circuit and ion's motional mode, and discuss the limitations of this approach compared to using a time-dependent capacitance.

abstract: We show how to realize high-fidelity quantum non-demolition qubit readout using longitudinal qubit-oscillator interaction. This is realized by modulating the longitudinal coupling at the cavity frequency. The qubit-oscillator interaction then acts as a qubit-state dependent drive on the cavity, a situation that is fundamentally different from the standard dispersive case. Single-mode squeezing can be exploited to exponentially increase the signal-to-noise ratio of this readout protocol. We present an implementation of this idea in circuit quantum electrodynamics and a possible multi-qubit architecture.

abstract: A common assumption in analyses of error thresholds and quantum computing in general is that one applies fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) after every gate. This, however, is known not to always be optimal if the FTQEC procedure itself can introduce errors. We investigate the effect of varying the number of logical gates between FTQEC operations, and in particular the case where failure of a postselection condition in FTQEC may cause FTQEC to be skipped with high probability. By using a simplified model of errors induced in FTQEC, we derive an expression for the logical error rate as a function of error-correction frequency, and show that in this model the optimal frequency is relatively insensitive to postselection failure probability for a large range of such probabilities. We compare the model to data derived from Monte Carlo simulation for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code.

abstract: Invisible cloaks provide a way to hide an object under the detection of waves. A perfect cloak guides the incident waves through the cloaking shell without any distortion. In most cases, some important quantum degrees of freedom, e.g. electron spin or photon polarization, are not taken into account when designing a cloak. Here, we propose to use the temporal steering inequality of these degrees of freedom to detect the existence of an invisible cloak.

abstract: The envelope theory, also known as the auxiliary field method, is a simple technique to compute approximate solutions of Hamiltonians for $N$ identical particles in $D$ dimensions. The quality of the approximate eigenvalues can be improved by adding a free parameter in the characteristic global quantum number of the solutions. A method is proposed to determine the value of this parameter by comparing the eigenvalues computed with the envelope theory to the corresponding ones computed with a $N$-body generalization of the dominantly orbital state method. The accuracy of the procedure is tested with several systems.

abstract: We describe a criterion for the detection of entanglement between two multi-boson systems. The criterion is based on calculating correlations of Gell-Mann matrices with a fixed boson number on each subsystem. This applies naturally to systems such as two entangled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. We apply our criterion to several experimentally motivated examples, such as an $ S^z S^z $ entangled BECs, ac Stark shift induced two-mode squeezed BECs, and photons under parametric down conversion. We find that entanglement can be detected for all parameter regions for the most general criterion. Alternative criteria based on a similar formalism are also discussed together with their merits.

We describe several possible hamiltonians and corresponding solutions for a finite wire with fixed endpoints and non-vanishing curvature. We compute and compare the disparate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from different quantization prescriptions. The JWKB approximation without potential leads precisely to the square well spectrum and the coordinate dependent stretched or compressed box related eigenfunctions. The geometric potential arising from an adiabatic expansion in terms of curvature is at best only valid for very small curvature.

abstract: In recent years, a close connection between the description of open quantum systems, the input-output formalism of quantum optics, and continuous matrix product states in quantum field theory has been established. So far, however, this connection has not been extended to the condensed-matter context. In this work, we substantially develop further and apply a machinery of continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to perform tomography of transport experiments. We first present an extension of the tomographic possibilities of cMPS by showing that reconstruction schemes do not need to be based on low-order correlation functions only, but also on low-order counting probabilities. We show that fermionic quantum transport settings can be formulated within the cMPS framework. This allows us to present a reconstruction scheme based on the measurement of low-order correlation functions that provides access to quantities that are not directly measurable with present technology. Emblematic examples are high-order correlations functions and waiting times distributions (WTD). The latter are of particular interest since they offer insights into short-time scale physics. We demonstrate the functioning of the method with actual data, opening up the way to accessing WTD within the quantum regime.

abstract: Information-theoretic definitions for noise and disturbance in quantum measurements were given in Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 050401 (2014) and a state-independent noise-disturbance uncertainty relation was obtained. Here, we derive a tight noise-disturbance uncertainty relation for complementary qubit observables and carry out an experimental test. Successive projective measurements on the neutron's spin-1/2system, together with a correction procedure which reduces the disturbance, are performed. Our experimental results saturate the tight noise-disturbance uncertainty relation for qubits when an optimal correction procedure is applied.

abstract: We focus on a family of quantum coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the analysis for the quantum case. We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming models on the optimization side. Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum and classical protocols, we show that only "classical" protocols can saturate Kitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of Alice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from attaining the optimal level of security.

abstract: A long-standing problem on the classical capacity of bosonic Gaussian channels has recently been resolved by proving the minimum output entropy conjecture. It is also known that the ultimate capacity quantified by the Holevo bound can be achieved asymptotically by using an infinite number of channels. However, it is less understood to what extent the communication capacity can be reached if one uses a finite number of channels, which is a topic of practical importance. In this paper, we study the capacity of Gaussian communication, i.e., employing Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements to encode and decode information under a single-channel use. We prove that the optimal capacity of single-channel Gaussian communication is achieved by one of two well-known protocols, i.e., coherent-state communication or squeezed-state communication, depending on the energy (number of photons) as well as the characteristics of the channel. Our result suggests that the coherent-state scheme known to achieve the ultimate information-theoretic capacity is not a practically optimal scheme for the case of using a finite number of channels. We find that overall the squeezed-state communication is optimal in a small-photon-number regime whereas the coherent-state communication performs better in a large-photon-number regime.

Starting from a ground state condensate, we investigate how the measurement back action leads to squeezing and entanglement of the quantized density oscillations. In particular, we show that properly timed, stroboscopic imaging and feedback can be used to selectively address specific eigenmodes and avoid excitation of non-targeted modes of the system.

abstract: High precision macroscopic quantum control in interacting light-matter systems remains a signi?cant goal toward novel information processing and ultra-precise metrology. We show that the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a paradigmatic light-matter system (Dicke model) reveals two successive stages of enhanced quantum correlations beyond the traditional schemes of near-adiabatic and sudden quenches. The fi?rst stage features magni?cation of matter-only and light-only entanglement and squeezing due to e?ective non linear self-interactions. The second stage results from a highly entangled light-matter state, with enhanced superradiance and signatures of chaotic and highly quantum states. We show that these new e?ects scale up consistently with matter system size, and are reliable even in dissipative environments.

abstract: The non-relativistic hydrogen atom enjoys an accidental $SO(4)$ symmetry, that enlarges the rotational $SO(3)$ symmetry, by extending the angular momentum algebra with the Runge-Lenz vector. In the relativistic hydrogen atom the accidental symmetry is partially lifted. Due to the Johnson-Lippmann operator, which commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian, some degeneracy remains. When the non-relativistic hydrogen atom is put in a spherical cavity of radius $R$ with perfectly reflecting Robin boundary conditions, characterized by a self-adjoint extension parameter $\gamma$, in general the accidental $SO(4)$ symmetry is lifted. However, for $R = (l+1)(l+2) a$ (where $a$ is the Bohr radius and $l$ is the orbital angular momentum) some degeneracy remains when $\gamma = \infty$ or $\gamma = \frac{2}{R}$. In the relativistic case, we consider the most general spherically and parity invariant boundary condition, which is characterized by a self-adjoint extension parameter. In this case, the remnant accidental symmetry is always lifted in a finite volume. We also investigate the accidental symmetry in the context of the Pauli equation, which sheds light on the proper non-relativistic treatment including spin. In that case, again some degeneracy remains for specific values of $R$ and $\gamma$.

abstract: Optics and interferometry with matter waves is the art of coherently manipulating the translational motion of particles like neutrons, atoms and molecules. Coherent atom optics is an extension of techniques that were developed for manipulating \emph{internal} quantum states. Applying these ideas to translational motion required the development of techniques to localize atoms and transfer population coherently between distant localities. In this view position and momentum are (continuouse) quantum mechanical degree of freedom analogous to discrete internal quantum states. In our contribution we start with an introduction into matter-wave optics in section 1, discuss coherent atom optics and atom interferometry techniques for molecular beams in section 2 and for trapped atoms in section 3. In section 4 we then describe tools and experiments that allow us to probe the evolution of quantum states of many-body systems by atom interference.

abstract: Here we demonstrate quantum interference of photons on a Silicon chip produced from a single ring resonator photon source. The source is seamlessly integrated with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which path entangles degenerate bi-photons produced via spontaneous four wave mixing in the Silicon ring resonator. The resulting bi-photon N00N state is controlled by varying the relative phase of the integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer, resulting in high two-photon interference visibilities of V~96%. Furthermore, we show that the interference can be produced using pump wavelengths tuned to all of the ring resonances accessible with our tunable lasers (C+L band). This work is a key demonstration towards the simplified integration of multiple photon sources and quantum circuits together on a monolithic chip, in turn, enabling quantum information chips with much greater complexity and functionality.

abstract: In earlier papers we showed unpredictability beyond quantum uncertainty in atomic clocks, ensuing from a proven gap between given evidence and explanations of that evidence. Here we reconceive a clock, not as an isolated entity, but as enmeshed in a self-adjusting communications network adapted to one or another particular investigation, in contact with an unpredictable environment. From the practical uses of clocks, we abstract a clock enlivened with the computational capacity of a Turing machine, modified to transmit and to receive numerical communications. Such "live clocks" phase the steps of their computations to mesh with the arrival of transmitted numbers. We lift this phasing, known in digital communications, to a principle of \emph{logical synchronization}, distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in special relativity. Logical synchronization elevates digital communication to a topic in physics, including applications to biology. One explores how feedback loops in clocking affect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of unpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of investigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live clocks extends information theory by expressing the need to actively maintain communications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them. We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of coordinates in a spacetime. A network serves as an organizing principle, even when the concept of the rigid body that anchors a special-relativistic coordinate system is inapplicable, as is the case, for example, in a generic curved spacetime.

abstract: Exact synthesis is a tool used in algorithms for approximating an arbitrary qubit unitary with a sequence of quantum gates from some finite set. These approximation algorithms find asymptotically optimal approximations in probabilistic polynomial time, in some cases even finding the optimal solution in probabilistic polynomial time given access to an oracle for factoring integers. In this paper, we present a common mathematical structure underlying all results related to the exact synthesis of qubit unitaries known to date, including Clifford+T, Clifford-cyclotomic and V-basis gate sets, as well as gates sets induced by the braiding of Fibonacci anyons in topological quantum computing. The framework presented here also provides a means to answer questions related to the exact synthesis of unitaries for wide classes of other gate sets, such as Clifford+T+V and SU(2) level k anyons.

abstract: Physical implementations of qubits can be extremely sensitive to environmental coupling, which can result in decoherence. While efforts are made for protection, coupling to the environment is necessary to measure and manipulate the state of the qubit. As such, the goal of having long qubit energy relaxation times is in competition with that of achieving high-fidelity qubit control and measurement. Here we propose a method that integrates filtering techniques for preserving superconducting qubit lifetimes together with the dispersive coupling of the qubit to a microwave resonator for control and measurement. The result is a compact circuit that protects qubits from spontaneous loss to the environment, while also retaining the ability to perform fast, high-fidelity readout. Importantly, we show the device operates in a regime that is attainable with current experimental parameters and provide a specific example for superconducting qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: We consider quantum excitation energy transport (EET) in a network of two-state nodes in the Markovian approximation by employing the Lindblad formulation. We find that EET from an initial site, where the excitation is inserted to the sink, is generally inefficient due to the inhibition of transport by Anderson localization of the excitation wave packet in a symmetric, fully-connected network. We demonstrate that the EET efficiency can be significantly increased up to $\approx100\%$ by perturbing hopping transport between the initial node and the one connected directly to the sink, while the rate of energy transport is highest at a finite value of the hopping parameter. We also show that prohibiting hopping between the other nodes which are not directly linked to the sink does not improve the efficiency. We show that external dephasing noise in the network plays a constructive role for EET in the presence of localization in the network, while in the absence of localization it reduces the efficiency of EET.

abstract: Quantum theory imposes fundamental limitations to the amount of information that can be carried by any quantum system. On the one hand, Holevo bound rules out the possibility to encode more information in a quantum system than in its classical counterpart, comprised of perfectly distinguishable states. On the other hand, when states are uniformly distributed in the state space, the so-called subentropy lower bound is saturated. How uniform quantum systems are can be naturally quantified by characterizing them as $t$-designs, with $t = \infty$ corresponding to the uniform distribution. Here we show the existence of a trade-off between the uniformity of a quantum system and the amount of information it can carry. To this aim, we derive a hierarchy of informational bounds as a function of $t$ and prove their tightness for qubits and qutrits. By deriving asymptotic formulae for large dimensions, we also show that the statistics generated by any $t$-design with $t > 1$ contains no more than a single bit of information, and this amount decreases with $t$. Holevo and subentropy bounds are recovered as particular cases for $t = 1$ and $t = \infty$, respectively.

abstract: We obtain a lower bound on the maximum number of qubits, $Q^{n, \varepsilon}({\mathcal{N}})$, which can be transmitted over a finite number, $n$, of uses of a quantum channel ${\mathcal{N}}$, for a given non-zero error threshold $\varepsilon$. To obtain our result, we first derive a bound on the one-shot quantum capacity of the channel, which is stronger than previously known one-shot bounds. The method that we employ is one in which the decoding map, used by the receiver on the output of the channel, is given by the Petz recovery map (also known as the transpose channel). We obtain a second order achievability bound for quantum information transmission by computing the second order expansion of our lower bound on $Q^{n, \varepsilon}({\mathcal{N}})$. We prove that this is tighter than a second order achievability bound obtained via the standard decoupling method. For a 50-50 erasure channel (which is known to have zero quantum capacity), the second order achievability bound obtained via the Petz recovery map implies that there is a sharp error threshold above which $Q^{n, \varepsilon}({\mathcal{N}})$ scales as $\sqrt{n}$. As intermediate results, we also derive second order achievability bounds for the protocols of entanglement transmission and entanglement generation.

abstract: Ground state cooling of massive mechanical objects remains a difficult task restricted by the unresolved mechanical sidebands. We propose an optomechanically-induced-transparency cooling scheme to achieve ground state cooling of mechanical motion without the resolved sideband condition in a pure optomechanical system with two mechanical modes coupled to the same optical cavity mode. We show that ground state cooling is achievable for sideband resolution $\omega_{m}/\kappa$ as low as 0.003. This provides a new route for quantum manipulation of massive macroscopic devices and high-precision measurements.

abstract: We find equivalent hypergeometric- and difference-equation-based formulas, $Q(k,\alpha)= G_1^k(\alpha) G_2^k(\alpha)$, for $k = -1, 0, 1,\ldots,9$, for that (rational-valued) portion of the total separability probability for generalized two-qubit states endowed with random induced measure, for which the determinantal inequality $|\rho^{PT}| >|\rho|$ holds. Here $\rho$ denotes a $4 \times 4$ density matrix and $\rho^{PT}$, its partial transpose, while $\alpha$ is a Dyson-index-like parameter with $\alpha = 1$ for the standard (15-dimensional) convex set of two-qubit states. The dimension of the space in which these density matrices is embedded is $4 \times (4 +k)$. For the symmetric case of $k=0$, we obtain the previously reported Hilbert-Schmidt formulas, with (the two-re[al]bit case) $Q(0,\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{29}{128}$, (the standard two-qubit case) $Q(0,1)=\frac{4}{33}$, and (the two-quater[nionic]bit case) $Q(0,2)= \frac{13}{323}$. The factors $G_2^k(\alpha)$ can be written as the sum of weighted hypergeometric functions $_{p}F_{p-1}$, $p \geq 7$, all with argument $\frac{27}{64} =(\frac{3}{4})^3$. We find formulas for the upper and lower parameter sets of these functions and, then, equivalently express $G_2^k(\alpha)$ in terms of first-order difference equations. The factors $G_1^k(\alpha)$ are equal to $(\frac{27}{64})^{\alpha-1}$ times ratios of products of six Pochhammer symbols involving the indicated parameters. Some remarkable $\alpha-$ and $k$-specific invariant asymptotic properties (again, involving $\frac{27}{64}$ and related quantities) of separability probability formulas emerge.

abstract: Entanglement is a ubiquitous feature of low temperature systems and believed to be highly relevant for the dynamics of condensed matter properties and quantum computation even at higher temperatures. The experimental certification of this paradigmatic quantum effect in macroscopic high temperature systems is constrained by the limited access to the quantum state of the system. In this paper we show how macroscopic observables beyond the energy of the system can be exploited as proxy witnesses for entanglement detection. Using linear and semi-definite relaxations we show that all previous approaches to this problem can be outperformed by our proxies, i.e. entanglement can be certified at higher temperatures without access to any local observable. For an efficient computation of proxy witnesses one can resort to a generalized grand canonical ensemble, enabling entanglement certification even in complex systems with macroscopic particle numbers.

abstract: The quantum capacity of a memoryless channel is often used as a single figure of merit to characterize its ability to transmit quantum information coherently. The capacity determines the maximal rate at which we can code reliably over asymptotically many uses of the channel. We argue that this asymptotic treatment is insufficient to the point of being irrelevant in the quantum setting where decoherence severely limits our ability to manipulate large quantum systems in the encoder and decoder. For all practical purposes we should instead focus on the trade-off between three parameters: the rate of the code, the number of coherent uses of the channel, and the fidelity of the transmission. The aim is then to specify the region determined by allowed combinations of these parameters. Towards this goal, we find approximate and exact characterizations of the region of allowed triplets for the qubit dephasing channel and for the erasure channel with classical post-processing assistance. In each case the region is parametrized by a second channel parameter, the quantum channel dispersion. In the process we also develop several general inner (achievable) and outer (converse) bounds on the coding region that are valid for all finite-dimensional quantum channels and can be computed efficiently. Applied to the depolarizing channel, this allows us to determine a lower bound on the number of coherent uses of the channel necessary to witness super-additivity of the coherent information.

abstract: We introduce the anisotropic two-photon Rabi model in which the rotating and counter rotating terms enters along with two different coupling constants. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are studied with exact means. We employ a variation of the Braak method based on Bogolubov rotation of the underlying $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. Accordingly, the spectrum is provided by the analytical properties of a suitable meromorphic function. Our formalism applies to the two-modes Rabi model as well, sharing the same algebraic structure of the two-photon model. Through the analysis of the spectrum, we discover that the model displays a first order and a parity symmetry breaking quantum phase transitions as the spin-boson coupling strength is varied.

abstract: We address the issue of reducing the resource required to compute information-theoretic quantum correlation measures like quantum discord and quantum work deficit in two qubits and higher dimensional systems. We provide a mathematical description of determining the quantum correlation measure using a restricted set of local measurements. We show that the computational error caused by the constraint over the complete set of local measurements reduces fast with an increase in the size of the restricted set. We perform quantitative analysis to investigate how the error scales with the system size, taking into account a set of plausible constructions of the constrained set. Carrying out a comparative study, we show that the resource required to optimize quantum work deficit is usually higher than that required for quantum discord. We also demonstrate that minimization of quantum discord and quantum work deficit is easier in the case of two-qubit mixed states of fixed ranks and with positive partial transpose in comparison to the corresponding states having non-positive partial transpose. For bound entangled states, we show that the error is significantly low when the measurements correspond to the spin observables along the three Cartesian coordinates.

abstract: Quantum heat machines (QHMs) models generally assume a weak coupling to the baths. This supposition is grounded in the separability principle between systems and allows the derivation of the evolution equation for this case. In the weak coupling regime, the machine's output is limited by the coupling strength, restricting their application. Seeking to overcome this limitation, we here analyze QHMs in the virtually unexplored strong coupling regime, where separability, as well as other standard thermodynamic assumptions, may no longer hold. We show that strongly coupled QHMs may be as efficient as their weakly coupled counterparts. In addition, we find a novel turnover behavior where their output saturates and disappears in the limit of ultra-strong coupling.

abstract: Deriving minimum evolution times is of paramount importance in quantum mechanics. Bounds on the speed of evolution are given by the so called quantum speed limit (QSL). In this work we use quantum optimal control methods to study the QSL for driven many level systems which exhibit local two-level interactions in the form of avoided crossings (ACs). Remarkably, we find that optimal evolution times are proportionally smaller than those predicted by the well-known two-level case, even when the ACs are isolated. We show that the physical mechanism for such enhancement is due to non-trivial cooperative effects between the AC and other levels, which are dynamically induced by the shape of the optimized control field.

abstract: In a weak measurement with post-selection, a measurement value, called the weak value, can be amplified beyond the eigenvalues of the observable. However, there are some controversies whether the weak value amplification is practically useful or not in increasing sensitivity of the measurement in which fundamental quantum noise dominates. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity limit of an optical interferometer by properly taking account quantum shot noise and radiation pressure noise. To do so, we formulate the weak value amplification in the Heisenberg picture, which enables us to intuitively understand what happens when the measurement outcome is post-selected and the weak value is amplified. As a result, we found that the sensitivity limit is given by the standard quantum limit that is the same as in a standard interferometry. We also discuss a way to circumvent the standard quantum limit.

abstract: The extended Bloch representation of quantum mechanics was recently derived to offer a (hidden-measurement) solution to the measurement problem. In this article we use it to investigate the geometry of superposition and entangled states, explaining the interference effects, and the entanglement correlations, in terms of the different orientations that a state-vector can take within the generalized Bloch sphere. We also introduce a tensorial determination of the generators of SU(N), particularly suitable to describe multipartite systems, from the viewpoint of the sub-entities. We then use it to show that non-product states admit a general description in which the sub-entities can always remain in well-defined states, even when they are entangled. Therefore, the completed version of quantum mechanics provided by the extended Bloch representation, in which the density operators are also representative of pure states, allows to solve not only the well-known measurement problem, but also the lesser-known entanglement problem. This because we no longer need to give up the general physical principle saying that a composite entity exists, and therefore is in a pure state, if and only if its components also exist, and therefore are in well-defined pure states.

abstract: We consider the nonstationary circuit QED architecture, where a single artificial two-level atom interacts with a cavity field mode under external modulation of one or more system parameters. Two different approaches are employed to study the effects of Markovian dissipation on modulation-induced transitions between the atom-field dressed states: the standard master equation of Quantum Optics and the recently formulated dressed-picture master equation. We estimate the associated transition rates and show that photon generation from vacuum ("dynamical Casimir effect", DCE) and coherent photon annihilation from nonvacuum states ("Anti-DCE") are possible with the current state-of-the-art parameters.

abstract: A general quantum search algorithm aims to evolve a quantum system from a known source state $|s\rangle$ to an unknown target state $|t\rangle$. It uses a diffusion operator $D_{s}$ having source state as one of its eigenstates and $I_{t}$, where $I_{\psi}$ denotes the selective phase inversion of $|\psi\rangle$ state. It evolves $|s\rangle$ to a particular state $|w\rangle$, call it w-state, in $O(B/\alpha)$ time steps where $\alpha$ is $|\langle t|s\rangle|$ and $B$ is a characteristic of the diffusion operator. Measuring the w-state gives the target state with the success probability of $O(1/B^{2})$ and $O(B^{2})$ applications of the algorithm can boost it from $O(1/B^{2})$ to $O(1)$, making the total time complexity $O(B^{3}/\alpha)$. In the special case of Grover's algorithm, $D_{s}$ is $I_{s}$ and $B$ is very close to $1$. A more efficient way to boost the success probability is quantum amplitude amplification provided we can efficiently implement $I_{w}$. Such an efficient implementation is not known so far. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to approximate selective phase inversions of the unknown eigenstates of an operator using phase estimation algorithm. This algorithm is used to efficiently approximate $I_{w}$ which reduces the time complexity of general algorithm to $O(B/\alpha)$. Though $O(B/\alpha)$ algorithms are known to exist, our algorithm offers physical implementation advantages.

abstract: In the theory of open quantum systems interaction is a fundamental concepts in the review of the dynamics of open quantum systems. Correlation, both classical and quantum one, is generated due to interaction between system and environment. Here, we recall the quantity which well known as total entropy production. Appearance of total entropy production is due to the entanglement production between system an environment. In this work, we discuss about the role of the total entropy production for detecting non-Markovianity. By utilizing the relation between total entropy production and total correlation between subsystems, one can see a temporary decrease of total entropy production is a signature of non-Markovianity.

abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental efforts have shown the remarkable and counter-intuitive role of noise in enhancing the transport efficiency of complex systems. Here, we realize simple, scalable, and controllable optical fiber cavity networks that allow us to analyze the performance of transport networks for different conditions of interference, dephasing and disorder. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that the transport efficiency reaches a maximum when varying the external dephasing noise, i.e. a bell-like shape behavior that had been predicted only theoretically. These optical platforms are very promising simulators of quantum transport phenomena, and could be used, in particular, to design and test optimal topologies of artificial light-harvesting structures for future solar energy technologies.

abstract: We propose a method to decouple the nanomechanical resonator in optomechanical systems from the environmental noise by introducing a chaotic coherent feedback loop. We find that the chaotic controller in the feedback loop can modulate the dynamics of the controlled optomechanical system and induce a broadband response of the mechanical mode. This broadband response of the mechanical mode will cut off the coupling between the mechanical mode and the environment and thus suppress the environmental noise of the mechanical modes. As an application, we use the protected optomechanical system to act as a quantum memory. It's shown that the noise-decoupled optomechanical quantum memory is efficient for storing information transferred from coherent or squeezed light.

abstract: This work presents Wigner-type quasiprobability distributions for the rigid rotator which become, in the limit h=0, coherent solutions of the classical Liouville equation known as the "action waves" of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The results are consistent with the usual quantization of the intrinsic angular momentum, but for the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, a finite "zero point" energy term is obtained. It is shown that if a quasiprobability distribution satisfies the Liouville equation then the related quantum wave function evolves according to the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.

abstract: Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics was proposed to avoid problems inherent in the prevailing interpretational frame. It assumes that quantum mechanics can be applied to any system and that the state vector always evolves unitarily. It then claims that whenever an observable is measured, all possible results of the measurement exist. This notion of multiplicity has been understood in different ways by proponents of Everett's theory. In fact the spectrum of opinions on various ontological questions raised by Everett's approach is rather large, as we attempt to document in this critical review. We conclude that much remains to be done to clarify and specify Everett's approach.

abstract: We experimentally construct a novel three-qubit entangled W-superposition ($\rm W \bar{\rm W}$) state on an NMR quantum information processor. We give a measurement-based filtration protocol for the invertible local operation (ILO) that converts the $\rm W \bar{\rm W}$ state to the GHZ state, using a register of three ancilla qubits. Further we implement an experimental protocol to reconstruct full information about the three-party $\rm W \bar{\rm W}$ state using only two-party reduced density matrices. An intriguing fact unearthed recently is that the $\rm W \bar{\rm W}$ state which is equivalent to the GHZ state under ILO, is in fact reconstructible from its two-party reduced density matrices, unlike the GHZ state. We hence demonstrate that although the $\rm W \bar{\rm W}$ state is interconvertible with the GHZ state, it stores entanglement very differently.

abstract: NMR imaging without any radio-frequency magnetic field is explained by a quantum treatment of independent spin~$\tfrac 12$. The total magnetization is determined by means of their individual wave function. The theoretical treatment, based on fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics and solving explicitly the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the kinetic energy part which gives the motion of free spins, is recalled. It explains the phase shift of the spin noise spectrum with its amplitude compared to the conventional NMR spectrum. Moreover it explains also the relatively good signal to noise ratio of NMR images obtained without a RF pulse. This derivation should be helpful for new magnetic resonance imaging sequences or for developing quantum computing by NMR.

abstract: We investigate the coherent manipulation of interacting Rydberg atoms placed inside a high-finesse optical cavity for the preparation of strongly coupled light-matter systems. We consider a four-level diamond scheme with one common Rydberg level for $N$ interacting atoms. One side of the diamond is used to excite the atoms into a collective `superatom' Rydberg state using either $\pi$-pulses or stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) pulses. The upper transition on the other side of the diamond is used to transfer the collective state to one that is coupled to a field mode of an optical cavity. Due to the strong interaction between the atoms in the Rydberg level, the Rydberg blockade mechanism plays a key role in the quantum state synthesis of the atoms in the cavity. We use numerical simulation to show that non-classical states of light can be generated and that the state that is coupled to the cavity field is a collective one. We also investigate how different decay mechanisms affect this interacting many-body system. We also analyze our system in the case of two Rydberg excitations within the blockade volume. The simulations are carried out with parameters corresponding to realizable high-finesse optical cavities and alkali atoms like rubidium.

abstract: Distinguishing assigned quantum states with assigned probabilities via quantum measurements is a crucial problem for the transmission of classical information through quantum channels. Measurement operators maximizing the probability of correct discrimination have been characterized by Helstrom, Holevo and Yuen since 1970's. On the other hand, closed--form solutions are available only for particular situations enjoying high degrees of symmetry. As a suboptimal solution to the problem, measurement operators, directly determined from states and probabilities and known as square root measurements (SRM), were introduced by Hausladen and Wootters. These operators were also recognized to be optimal for pure states equipped with geometrical uniform symmetry (GUS). In this paper we discuss the optimality of the SRM and find necessary and sufficient conditions in order that SRM maximize the correct decision probabilities for set of states formed by several constellations of GUS states. The results are applied to some specific examples concerning double constellations of quantum phase shift keying (PSK) and pulse position modulation (PPM) states, with possible applications to practical systems of quantum communications.

abstract: We present a quantum receiver for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) coherent states discrimination with homodyne-displacement hybrid structure. Our strategy is to carry out two successive measurements on parts of the quantum states. The homodyne result of the first measurement reveals partial information about the state and is forward to a displacement receiver, which finally identifies the input state by using feedback to adjust a reference field. Numerical simulation results show that for 16-QAM, the hybrid receiver could outperform the standard quantum limit (SQL) with a reduced number of codeword interval partitions and on-off detectors, which shows great potential toward implementing the practical application.

abstract: The application of machine learning to quantum information processing has recently attracted keen interest, particularly for the optimization of control parameters in quantum tasks without any pre-programmed knowledge. By adapting the machine learning technique, we present a novel protocol in which an arbitrarily initialized device at a learner's location is taught by a provider located at a distant place. The protocol is designed such that any external learner who attempts to participate in or disrupt the learning process can be prohibited or noticed. We numerically demonstrate that our protocol works faithfully for single-qubit operation devices. A trade-off between the inaccuracy and the learning time is also analyzed.

abstract: It is shown that the Pauli equation and the concept of spin naturally emerge from logical inference applied to experiments on a charged particle under the conditions that (i) space is homogeneous (ii) the observed events are logically independent, and (iii) the observed frequency distributions are robust with respect to small changes in the conditions under which the experiment is carried out. The derivation does not take recourse to concepts of quantum theory and is based on the same principles which have already been shown to lead to e.g. the Schr\"odinger equation and the probability distributions of pairs of particles in the singlet or triplet state. Application to Stern-Gerlach experiments with chargeless, magnetic particles, provides additional support for the thesis that quantum theory follows from logical inference applied to a well-defined class of experiments.

abstract: Photon number resolving detectors can be highly useful for studying the statistics of multi-photon quantum states of light. In this work we study the counts statistics of different states of light measured on multiplexed on-off detectors. We put special emphasis on artificial nonclassical features of the statistics obtained. We show new ways to derive analytical formulas for counts statistics and their moments. Using our approach we are the first to derive statistics moments for multi-mode thermal states measured on multiplexed on-off detectors. We use them to determine empirical Mandel parameters and recently proposed subbinomial parameters suitable for tests of nonclassicality of the measured states. Additionally, we investigate subpoissonian and superbunching properties of the two-mode squeezed state measured on a pair of multiplexed detectors and we present results of the Fano factor and second-order correlation function for these states.

abstract: Single photon detectors are fundamental tools of investigation in quantum optics and play a central role in measurement theory and quantum informatics. Photodetectors based on different technologies exist at optical frequencies and much effort is currently being spent on pushing their efficiencies to meet the demands coming from the quantum computing and quantum communication proposals. In the microwave regime however, a single photon detector has remained elusive although several theoretical proposals have been put forth. In this article, we review these recent proposals, especially focusing on non-destructive detectors of propagating microwave photons. These detection schemes using superconducting artificial atoms can reach detection efficiencies of 90\% with existing technologies and are ripe for experimental investigations.

abstract: Dimension 2 is expected to be the lower critical dimension for Anderson localization in a time-reversal-invariant disordered quantum system: the dynamics is generically localized in dimension lower than 2, while it presents a transition from a diffusive regime at weak disorder to a localized regime at strong disorder in dimension larger than 2. We use an atomic quasiperiodically kicked rotor -- equivalent to a two-dimensional Anderson-like model -- to experimentally study Anderson localization in dimension 2. We observe a localized dynamics with a localization length depending exponentially on the disorder strength and show that a self-consistent theory of localization quantitatively predicts the localization length.

abstract: This work introduces the notion of First Event Signalling (FES) correlations in multipartite scenario where the first measurement on one subsystem influences the measurement outcomes of all the other local subsystems. It is shown that these correlations are related to bilocal ones but stronger than their variations proposed earlier. We propose a new Bell inequality which is satisfied by all FES models. Then we show quantum mechanical violation of this inequality, which can be regarded as an alternative definition of a stronger type of genuine multipartite nonlocality and a proof that quantum mechanics exhibits even more powerful correlations than these already known. We also introduce another Bell inequality which is satisfied by all bilocal correlations but violated by FES. The study of our new inequalities and the ones introduced previously allows us to analyze the relation between different types of tripartite nonlocality which reveals a very complex and interesting structure.

abstract: In recent years we have witnessed a concentrated effort to make sense of thermodynamics for small-scale systems. One of the main difficulties is that, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations of energy in general render it conceptually difficult to distinguish work from heat. Despite of several attempts to resolve this issue, many of which inspired by quantum information theory, there is still remarkable little consensus on it. In this work, we attempt to define work in a strictly operational way. In our resource-theoretic approach, agents wish to agree upon how much work needs to be invested to effect a transition from one state of an arbitrary quantum work-storage device to another. We introduce basic operational principles, and deduce from them a strict set of mathematical properties that any reasonable function quantifying such work has to fulfil. One of those generalises strong sub-additivity, a key property in quantum information theory, to the domain of thermodynamics. We show that one work quantifier fulfilling all the required properties is the difference of the non-equilibrium free energy of the initial and final state of the work-storage system. More generally, for any work quantifier fulfilling the stated properties, we can derive a quantitative second law in the sense of bounding the work that can be performed using some non-equilibrium resource by the work that is needed to create it. We furthermore discuss the role of path dependence for work quantifiers and the connection to the concept of probability-distributions of work. Our mathematical results can be formulated abstractly and carry over to other resource theories than quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: This paper considers work extraction from a quantum system to a work storage system (or weight) following reference [1]. An alternative approach is here developed that relies on the comparison of subspace dimensions without a need to introduce thermo-majorisation used previously. Optimal single shot work for processes where a weight transfers from (a) a single energy level to another single energy level is then re-derived. In addition we discuss the final state of the system after work extraction and show that the system typically ends in its thermal state, while there are cases where the system is only close to it. The work of formation in the single level transfer setting [1] is also re-derived. The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot work concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the weight. A key conclusion here is that the single shot work for case (a) is appropriate only when a \emph{resonance} of a particular energy is required. When wishing to identify "work extraction" with finding the weight in a specific available energy or any higher energy a broadening of the single shot work concept is required. As a final contribution we consider transformations of the system that (c) result in general weight state transfers. Introducing a transfer-quantity allows us to formulate minimum requirements for transformations to be at all possible in a thermodynamic framework. We show that choosing the free energy difference of the weight as the transfer-quantity one recovers various single shot results including single level transitions (a), multiple final level transitions (b), and recent results on restricted sets of multi-level to multi-level weight transfers.

abstract: Using very general and well established ideas of the statistical physics of macroscopic bodies, that is, of those composed of many degrees of freedom, we show how classical behavior of the center of mass motion arises from a fully quantum mechanical description of the dynamics of the whole body. We do not attempt to provide a rigorous proof of the latter statement, but rather, we show or, at least, indicate the hypotheses needed to obtain the purported result. Moreover, we neither attempt to deal with the "most general" physical situation and, instead, we concentrate on a stylized model of a small solid, yet macroscopic, that we shall call a "little stone". The main hypothesis is that a macroscopic body can be decomposed into several smaller pieces, still macroscopic, that become statistically independent due to the short-range interaction nature of their constituent atoms. The ensuing main result is that the quantum distributions of extensive variables of the body become sharply-peaked. The center of mass variables are of this type and hence their dynamics is essentially classical. We point out the crucial role played by the external potential, in which the motion occurs, as the macroscopic agent that executes the "measurement" process of the center of mass.

We find that, for oscillations between two degenerate states in lambda-configuration, shifts on the Rabi frequency may be induced by non-additive level shifts. For oscillations between two Rydberg states in ladder-configuration, shifts on the Rabi frequency may be induced by the effective renormalization of the laser interaction.

abstract: In the single-shot regime it is argued that the criterion for allowed state transitions ought to be more restricted than the second law of thermodynamics, and is given by a condition called thermo-majorisation. Hence to arrive at a fluctuation theorem for the single-shot scenario, such a restriction has to be taken into account. Here we formulate and prove a tighter fluctuation relation for the single-shot $\epsilon$-deterministic work extraction. The result links two areas of thermodynamics which have been of great interest recently, fluctuation relations for non-equilibrium processes and the $\epsilon$-deterministic work extractable from single microscopic non-equilibrium systems. Furthermore, in doing so, we unify the notions of fluctuation in $\epsilon$-deterministic work extraction and in fluctuation theorems.

abstract: This work establishes a connection between canonical perturbation series in quantum mechanics and a Kato expansion for the resolvent of the Liouville superoperator. Our approach leads to an explicit expression for a generator of a block-diagonalizing Dyson's ordered exponential in arbitrary perturbation order. Unitary intertwining of perturbed and unperturbed averaging superprojectors allows for a description of ambiguities in the generator and block-diagonalized Hamiltonian. We compare the efficiency of the corresponding computational algorithm with the efficiencies of the Van Vleck and Magnus methods for high perturbative orders.

abstract: We propose a universal, on-chip quantum transducer based on surface acoustic waves in piezo-active materials. Because of the intrinsic piezoelectric (and/or magnetostrictive) properties of the material, our approach provides a universal platform capable of coherently linking a broad array of qubits, including quantum dots, trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy centers or superconducting qubits. The quantized modes of surface acoustic waves lie in the gigahertz range, can be strongly confined close to the surface in phononic cavities and guided in acoustic waveguides. We show that this type of surface acoustic excitations can be utilized efficiently as a quantum bus, serving as an on-chip, mechanical cavity-QED equivalent of microwave photons and enabling long-range coupling of a wide range of qubits.

abstract: In quantum superdense coding, two parties previously sharing entanglement can communicate a two bit message by sending a single qubit. We study this feature in the broader framework of general probabilistic theories. We consider a particular class of theories in which the local state space of the communicating parties corresponds to Euclidian hyperballs of dimension n (the case n = 3 corresponds to the Bloch ball of quantum theory). We show that a single n-ball can encode at most one bit of information, independently of n. We introduce dense coding protocols in which log_2 (n+1) bits are communicated if entanglement is previously shared by the communicating parties. For n > 3, these protocols are more powerful than the quantum one, because more than two bits are communicated by transmission of a system that locally encodes at most one bit. We call this phenomenon hyperdense coding. Our hyperdense coding protocols imply superadditive classical capacities: two entangled systems can encode log_2 (n+1) > 2 bits, even though each system individually encodes at most one bit. In our examples, hyperdense coding and superadditivity of classical capacities come at the expense of violating tomographic locality or dynamical continuous reversibility.

abstract: We derive an equality for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The equality concerns the worst-case work output of a time-dependent Hamiltonian protocol in the presence of a Markovian heat bath. It has the form "worst-case work = penalty - optimum". The equality holds for all rates of changing the Hamiltonian and can be used to derive the optimum by setting the penalty to 0. The optimum term contains the max entropy of the initial state, rather than the von Neumann entropy, thus recovering recent results from single-shot statistical mechanics. We apply the equality to an electron box.

abstract: We present a complete classification of all possible sets of classical reversible gates acting on bits, in terms of which reversible transformations they generate, assuming swaps and ancilla bits are available for free. Our classification can be seen as the reversible-computing analogue of Post's lattice, a central result in mathematical logic from the 1940s. It is a step toward the ambitious goal of classifying all possible quantum gate sets acting on qubits. Our theorem implies a linear-time algorithm (which we have implemented), that takes as input the truth tables of reversible gates G and H, and that decides whether G generates H. Previously, this problem was not even known to be decidable. The theorem also implies that any n-bit reversible circuit can be "compressed" to an equivalent circuit, over the same gates, that uses at most 2^n*poly(n) gates and O(1) ancilla bits; these are the first upper bounds on these quantities known, and are close to optimal. Finally, the theorem implies that every non-degenerate reversible gate can implement either every reversible transformation, or every affine transformation, when restricted to an "encoded subspace." Briefly, the theorem says that every set of reversible gates generates either all reversible transformations on n-bit strings (as the Toffoli gate does); no transformations; all transformations that preserve Hamming weight (as the Fredkin gate does); all transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod k for some k; all affine transformations (as the Controlled-NOT gate does); all affine transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod 2 or mod 4, inner products mod 2, or a combination thereof; or a previous class augmented by a NOT or NOTNOT gate. Ruling out the possibility of additional classes, not in the list, requires some arguments about polynomials, lattices, and Diophantine equations.

abstract: The dynamic atomic polarizability describes the response of the atom to incoming electromagnetic radiation. The functional form of the imaginary part of the polarizability for small driving frequencies omega has been a matter of long-standing discussion, with both a linear dependence and an omega^3 dependence being presented as candidate formulas. The imaginary part of the polarizability enters the expressions of a number of fundamental physical processes which involve the thermal dissipation of energy, such as blackbody friction, and non-contact friction. Here, we solve the long-standing problem by calculating the imaginary part of the polarizability in both the length (d.E) as well as the velocity-gauge (p.A) form of the dipole interaction, verify the gauge invariance, and find general expressions applicable to atomic theory; the omega^3 form is obtained in both gauges. The seagull term in the velocity gauge is found to be crucial in establishing gauge invariance.

abstract: Non-contact friction forces are exerted on physical systems through dissipative processes, when the two systems are not in physical contact with each other, or, in quantum mechanical terms, when the overlap of their wave functions is negligible. Non-contact friction is mediated by the exchange of virtual quanta, with the additional requirement that the scattering process needs to have an inelastic component. For finite-temperature ion-surface interactions, the friction is essentially caused by Ohmic resistance due to the motion of the image charge moving in a dielectric material. A conceivable experiment is difficult because the friction force needs to be isolated from the interaction with the image charge, which significantly distorts the ion's flight path. We propose an experimental setup which is designed to minimize the influence of the image charge interaction though a compensation mechanism, and evaluate the energy loss due to non-contact friction for helium ions (He+) interacting with gold, vanadium, titanium and graphite surfaces. Interactions with the infinite series of mirror charges in the plates are summed in terms of the logarithmic derivatives of the Gamma function, and of the Hurwitz zeta function.

abstract: We introduce the notion of pseudo-stochastic matrices and consider their semigroup property. Unlike stochastic and bistochastic matrices, pseudo-stochastic matrices are permitted to have matrix elements which are negative while respecting the requirement that the sum of the elements of each column is one. They also allow for convex combinations, and carry a Lie group structure which permits the introduction of Lie algebra generators. The quantum analog of a pseudo-stochastic matrix exists and is called a pseudo-positive map. They have the property of transforming a subset of quantum states (characterized by maximal purity or minimal von Neumann entropy requirements) into quantum states. Examples of qubit dynamics connected with "diamond" sets of stochastic matrices and pseudo-positive maps are dealt with.

abstract: We study source compression with a helper in the fully quantum regime, extending our earlier result on classical source compression with a quantum helper [arXiv:1501.04366, 2015]. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem (QRST). This result demonstrates an unexpected connection between distributed source compression with the QRST protocol, a quantum protocol that consumes noiseless resources to simulate a noisy quantum channel.

abstract: General quantum correlations measures like quantum discord, one norm geometric quantum discord, exhibit freezing, sudden change, double sudden change behavior in their decay rates under different noisy channels. Therefore, one may attempt to investigate how the freezing behavior and other dynamical features are affected under application of local quantum operations. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of local filtering on the dynamical evolution of quantum correlations. We have found that using local filtering one may remove freezing depending upon the filtering parameter.

The time behavior of the qubit purity and entropy in the regime of enhancement of coherence is considered for different temperatures and coupling strengths.

abstract: Master equations are probably the most fundamental equations for anyone working in quantum optics in the presence of dissipation. In this context it is then incredibly useful to have efficient ways of coding and simulating such equations in the computer, and in this notes I try to introduce in a comprehensive way how do I do so, focusing on Matlab, but making it general enough so that it can be directly translated to any other language or software of choice. I inherited most of my methods from Juan Jos\'e Garc\'ia-Ripoll (whose numerical abilities I cannot praise enough), changing them here and there to accommodate them to the way my (fairly limited) numerical brain works, and to connect them as much as possible to how I understand the theory behind them. At present, the notes focus on how to code master equations and find their steady state, but I hope soon I will be able to update them with time evolution methods, including how to deal with time-dependent master equations. During the last 4 years I've tested these methods in various different contexts, including circuit quantum electrodynamics, the laser problem, optical parametric oscillators, and optomechanical systems. Comments and (constructive) criticism are greatly welcome, and will be properly credited and acknowledged.

abstract: Quantum information is an emerging field which has attracted a lot of attention in the last fifteen years or so. It is a broad subject which covers from the most applied questions (e.g., how to build quantum computers or secure cryptographic systems), to the most theoretical problems concerning the formalism of quantum mechanics, its complexity, and its potential to go beyond classical physics. I have written these notes as an introduction to the formalism of quantum information, trying to show how it is a natural progression from an undergraduate course on quantum mechanics (just as I felt it was for me). Hence, these are mainly notes about the language of quantum information and the meaning of its terms, not about its applications. They do not intend to be an exhaustive review about the field, but just a logical sequence of ideas, concepts and definitions, building up towards the continuous variables formalism, which actually takes over most of the notes. In this way, most of the results are stated without proof, and I haven't been careful with references; this is a work in progress, and I intend to add such things in the future. In any case, most of the topics that I introduce have been thoroughly covered in previous books and reviews, and with this notes I only intend to give my point of view, as well as to introduce the different topics and objects in exactly the way I work with and think about them, hoping it will be useful, especially for the people who are starting in the field. These notes originated in 2010 as a way of studying for my close collaboration with Ra\'ul Garc\'ia-Patr\'on and Nicolas J. Cerf, to whom I am deeply grateful for guidance and incredibly clarifying discussions. They benefited greatly as well from the weeks I spent in Doha with Hyunchul Nha and his group in 2012, especially from discussions with him and Ho-Joon Kim.

abstract: The dynamics of the quantum Fisher information of the parameters of the initial atomic state and atomic transition frequency is studied, in the framework of open quantum systems, for a static polarizable two-level atom coupled in the multipolar scheme to a bath of fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields without and with the presence of a reflecting boundary. Our results show that in the case without a boundary, the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations always cause the quantum Fisher information of the initial parameters and thus the precision limit of parameter estimation to decrease. Remarkably, however, with the presence of a boundary, the quantum Fisher information becomes position and atomic polarization dependent, and as a result, it may be enhanced as compared to that in the case without a boundary and may even be shielded from the influence of the vacuum fluctuations in certain circumstances as if it were a closed system.

abstract: Free will has been studied to achieve loophole-free Bell's inequality test and to provide device-independent quantum key distribution security proofs. The required free will (or randomness) such that a local hidden variable model (LHVM) can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality has been studied, but a tight bound has not been proved for a practical case that i) the device settings of the two parties in the Bell test are independent; and ii) the device settings of each party can be correlated or biased across different runs. For a randomness measure related to min-entropy, we prove in this paper a tight bound of the required randomness for this case such that the CHSH inequality can be violated by certain LHVM. Our technique used in the proof is also of independent interest.

abstract: Randomized benchmarking is an important statistical tool for characterising the performance of high-fidelity quantum gates. Here we study randomized benchmarking in the presence of quasi-static (i.e. low-frequency) errors. We contrast the resulting fidelity with that under the conventional assumption of Markovian errors. We treat these limiting cases analytically by mapping the averaging process to a random walk in "Pauli space". In the quasi-static case, we find a broad, highly skewed distribution of fidelities, while Markovian errors produce a narrow, approximately Gaussian distribution of fidelities. We use the filter-transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these differences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in certain random sequences. Large skew in the distribution towards high-fidelity outcomes -- consistent with existing experimental data -- highlights potential finite-sampling pitfalls when deploying randomized benchmarking. Moreover, these results demonstrate general challenges in extracting useful single-gate fidelities from randomized benchmarking measurements with correlated errors.

Regarding ultimate quantum limits, we stress that, as a difference with linear schemes, the nonlinearity introduces pulse duration as a new variable into play along with the energy resources.

abstract: Properties of weak spatio-spectral twin beams in paraxial approximation are analyzed using the decomposition into appropriate paired modes. Numbers of paired modes as well as numbers of modes in the signal (or idler) field in the transverse wave-vector and spectral domains are analyzed as functions of pump-beam parameters. Spatial and spectral coherence of weak twin beams is described by auto- and cross-correlation functions. Relation between the numbers of modes and coherence is discussed.

abstract: In contrast to the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) defined conventionally, the inverse OMIT behaves as coherent absorption of the input lights in the optomechanical systems. We characterize a feasible inverse OMIT in a multi-channel fashion with a double-sided optomechanical cavity system coupled to a nearby charged nanomechanical resonator via Coulomb interaction, where two counter-propagating probe lights can be absorbed via one of the channels or even via three channels simultaneously with the assistance of a strong pump light. Under realistic conditions, we demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our model using two slightly different nanomechanical resonators and the possibility of detecting the energy dissipation of the system. In particular, we find that our model turns to be an unilateral inverse OMIT once the two probe lights are different with a relative phase, and in this case we show the possibility to measure the relative phase precisely.

abstract: We prove a one-shot "minimax" converse bound for quantum channel coding assisted by positive partial transpose channels between sender and receiver. The bound is similar in spirit to the converse by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu [IEEE Trans. Info. Theory 56, 2307-2359 (2010)] for classical channel coding, and also enjoys the saddle point property enabling the order of optimizations to be interchanged. Equivalently, the bound can be formulated as a semidefinite program satisfying strong duality. The convex nature of the bound implies channel symmetries can substantially simplify the optimization, enabling us to explicitly compute the finite blocklength behavior for several simple qubit channels. In particular, we find that finite blocklength converse statements for the classical erasure channel apply to the assisted quantum erasure channel, while bounds for the classical binary symmetric channel apply to both the assisted dephasing and depolarizing channels. This implies that these qubit channels inherit statements regarding the asymptotic limit of large blocklength, such as the strong converse or second-order converse rates, from their classical counterparts. Moreover, for the dephasing channel, the finite blocklength bounds are as tight as those for the classical binary symmetric channel, since coding for classical phase errors yields equivalently-performing unassisted quantum codes.

abstract: Motivated by a model presented by S. Gudder, we study a quantum generalization of Markov chains and discuss the relation between these maps and open quantum random walks, a class of quantum channels described by S. Attal et al. We consider processes which are nonhomogeneous in time, i.e., at each time step, a possibly distinct evolution kernel. Inspired by a spectral technique described by L. Saloff-Coste and J. Z\'u\~niga, we define a notion of ergodicity for nonhomogeneous quantum Markov chains and describe a criterion for ergodicity of such objects in terms of singular values. As a consequence we obtain a quantum version of the classical probability result concerning the behavior of the columns (or rows) of the iterates of a stochastic matrix induced by a finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain. We are also able to relate the ergodic property presented here with the notions of weak and uniform ergodicity known in the literature of noncommutative $L^1$-spaces.

abstract: Practical realizations of quantum-enhanced interferometry are vulnerable to imperfections such as the residual spectral distinguishability of interfering photons. We demonstrate experimentally that a careful design of the spatial structure of used photons, combined with position-resolved coincidence detection at the output, allows one to recover quantum enhancement for a two-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer operated in a regime that otherwise cannot even attain the shot-noise limit. This shows the potential of engineering the modal structure of physical systems in metrological applications.

abstract: Ultrashort non-resonant electromagnetic pulses applied to effective one-electron systems may operate on the electronic state as a position or momentum translation operator. As derived here, extension to many-body correlated systems exposes qualitatively new aspects. For instance, to the lowest order in the electric field intensity the action of the pulse is expressible in terms of the two-body reduced density matrix enabling thus to probe various facets of electronic correlations. As an experimental realization we propose a pump-probe scheme in which after a weak, swift "kick" by the non-resonant pulse the survival probability for remaining in the initial state is measured. This probability we correlate to the two-body reduced density matrix. Since the strength of electronic correlation is bond-length sensitive, measuring the survival probability may allow for a direct insight into the bond-dependent two-body correlation in the ground state. As an illustration, full numerical calculations for two molecular systems are provided and different measures of electronic correlations are analyzed.

abstract: Quantum walks are interesting simple models for describing various fundamental processes in nature ranging from chaos or photosynthesis to universal quantum computation. Their implementation usually comprises a single particle and $O(n^2)$ optical elements, where $n$ is the size of the quantum walk space. The question arises if this can be achieved with fewer or complementary resources. Here we show that this can be done using a multi-particle Hong--Ou--Mandel interference. It employs $O(n)$ indistinguishable bosons and a single beam splitter to achieve a similar quantum walk. In addition we show that a quantum-to-classical transition takes place if the particles become distinguishable. This approach establishes a link between the fundamental indistinguishability of quantum particles and the wavelike coherent nature of the walk.

abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum architecture for engineering a photonicMott insulator-superfluid phase transition in a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice of a superconducting transmission line resonator (TLR) coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center encircled by a persistent current qubit. The localization-delocalization transition results from the interplay between the on-site repulsion and the nonlocal tunneling. The phase boundary in the case of photon hopping with real-valued and complex-valued amplitudes can be obtained using the mean-field approach. Also, the quantum jump technique is employed to describe the phase diagram when the dissipative effects are considered. The unique feature of our architecture is the good tunability of effective on-site repulsion and photon-hopping rate, and the local statistical property of TLRs which can be analyzed readily using presentmicrowave techniques. Our work opens new perspectives in quantum simulation of condensed-matter and many-body physics using a hybrid spin circuit-QED system. The experimental challenges are realizable using currently available technologies.

Bob sends photons toward the double-slit, and Alice commits by determining either the slit from which each photon emerges (for $b=0$), or its landing position on a screen (for $b=1$). Since the photon's wave front expands at the speed of light, Alice cannot delay the detection indefinitely, or it would very soon be out of her control no matter how much resources she has.

abstract: We propose the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) method for multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). A multicarrier CVQKD protocol utilizes Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CV) for information transmission. The GQI framework provides a minimal error estimate of the quadratures of the CV quantum states from the discrete, measured noisy subcarrier variables. GQI utilizes the fundamentals of regularization theory and statistical information processing. We characterize GQI for multicarrier CVQKD, and define a method for the statistical modeling and processing of noisy Gaussian subcarrier quadratures. We demonstrate the results through the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division (AMQD) scheme. We define direct GQI (DGQI), and prove that it achieves a theoretical minimal magnitude error. We introduce the terms statistical secret key rate and statistical private classical information, which quantities are derived purely by the statistical functions of GQI. We prove the secret key rate formulas for a multiple access multicarrier CVQKD via the AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) scheme. The GQI and DGQI frameworks can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol and measurement setting, and are implementable by standard low-complexity statistical functions, which is particularly convenient for an experimental CVQKD scenario.

abstract: The recent demonstration of cooling of a macroscopic silicon nitride membrane based on dissipative coupling makes dissipatively coupled optomechanical systems as promising candidates for squeezing. We theoretically show that such a system in a cavity on resonance can yield good squeezing which is comparable to that produced by dispersive coupling. We also report the squeezing resulting from the combined effects of dispersive and dissipative couplings and thus the device can be operated in one regime or the other. We derive the maximal frequency and quadrature angles to observe squeezing for given optomechanical coupling strengths. We also discuss the effects of temperature on squeezing.

These new AQCC's are constructed by means of the CSS-type construction applied to suitable families of classical convolutional codes, which are also constructed here. The new codes have noncatastrophic generator matrices and they present great asymmetry. Since our constructions are performed algebraically, it is possible to derive several families of such codes and not only codes with specifi?c parameters. Additionally, several different types of such codes are obtained.

The quantized energy levels show coupling of the oscillator frequency with the Larmor frequency in the 2D surface where the electrons under consideration follow a 2D oscillator. The axis in which magnetic field is pointed, the electrons follow a 1D oscillator. There is also coupling between spin and orbital motion and also a coupling between a resultant effect of orbital and spin motion with Larmor precession.

abstract: Resolving quantum many-body problems represents one of the greatest challenges in physics and physical chemistry, due to the prohibitively large computational resources that would be required by using classical computers. A solution has been foreseen by directly simulating the time evolution through sequences of quantum gates applied to arrays of qubits, i.e. by implementing a digital quantum simulator. Superconducting circuits and resonators are emerging as an extremely-promising platform for quantum computation architectures, but a digital quantum simulator proposal that is straightforwardly scalable, universal, and realizable with state-of-the-art technology is presently lacking. Here we propose a viable scheme to implement a universal quantum simulator with hybrid spin-photon qubits in an array of superconducting resonators, which is intrinsically scalable and allows for local control. As representative examples we consider the transverse-field Ising model, a spin-1 Hamiltonian, and the two-dimensional Hubbard model; for these, we numerically simulate the scheme by including the main sources of decoherence. In addition, we show how to circumvent the potentially harmful effects of inhomogeneous broadening of the spin systems.

abstract: We introduce a simple method to realize and detect photonic topological Chern insulators with one-dimensional circiut quantum electrodynamics arrays. By periodically modulating the couplings of the array, we show that this one-dimensional model can be mapped into a two-dimensional Chern insulator model. In addition to allow the study of photonic Chern insulators, this approach also provides a natural platform to realise experimentally Laughlin's pumping argument. Based on scattering theory of topological insulators and input-output formalism, we show that the photonic edge state can be probed directly and the topological invariant can be detected from the winding number of the reflection coefficient phase.

abstract: Gaussian distribution of a quantum state with continuous spectrum is known to maximize the Shannon entropy at a fixed variance. Applying it to a pair of canonically conjugate quantum observables $\hat x$ and $\hat p$, quantum entropic uncertainty relation can take a suggestive form, where the standard deviations $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_p$ are featured explicitly. From the construction, it follows in a transparent manner that: (i) the entropic uncertainty relation implies the Kennard-Robertson uncertainty relation in a modifed form, $\sigma_x\sigma_p\geq\hbar e^{\cal N}/2$; (ii) the additional factor ${\cal N}$ quantifies the quantum non-Gaussianity of the probability distributions of two observables; (iii) the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation for non-gaussian continuous variable (CV) mixed state becomes stronger with purity. Optimality of specific non-gaussian CV states to the refined uncertainty relation has been investigated and the existance of new class of CV quantum state is identified.

In our previous work, we calculated linear entropy and von Neumann entropy as entanglement measures for the ground state and lower lying excited states in helium-like systems. In this work, we adopt another entropic measure, Shannon entropy, to probe the nature of correlation effects. Besides the results of the Shannon entropy in coordinate space for the singlet ground states of helium-like systems including positronium negative ion, hydrogen negative ion, helium atom, and lithium positive ion, we also show results for systems with nucleus charge around the ionization threshold.

abstract: A typical bipartite quantum protocol, such as EPR-steering, relies on two quantum features, entanglement of states and incompatibility of measurements. Noise can delete both of these quantum features. In this work we study the behavior of incompatibility under noisy quantum channels. The starting point for our investigation is the observation that compatible measurements cannot become incompatible by the action of any channel. We focus our attention to channels which completely destroy the incompatibility of various relevant sets of measurements. We call such channels incompatibility breaking, in analogy to the concept of entanglement breaking channels. This notion is relevant especially for the understanding of noise-robustness of the local measurement resources for steering.

abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple and natural bipartite Bell scenario, by considering the correlations between two parties defined by general measurements in one party and dichotomic ones in the other. We show that unbounded Bell violations can be obtained in this context. Since such violations cannot occur when both parties use dichotomic measurements, our setting can be considered as the simplest one where this phenomenon can be observed. Our example is essentially optimal in terms of the outputs and the Hilbert space dimension.

abstract: We introduce and analyze a task that we call Markovianization, in which a tripartite quantum state is transformed to a quantum Markov chain by a randomizing operation on one of the three subsystems. We consider cases where the initial state is a tensor product of $n$ copies of a tripartite state $\rho^{ABC}$, and is transformed to a quantum Markov chain conditioned by $B^n$ with a small error, by a random unitary operation on $A^n$. In an asymptotic limit of infinite copies and vanishingly small error, we analyze the Markovianizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required for Markovianization. For tripartite pure states, we derive a single-letter formula for the Markovianizing costs. Counterintuitively, the Markovianizing cost is not a continuous function of states, and can be arbitrarily large even if the state is an approximate quantum Markov chain. Our results have an application for distributed quantum computation.

We demonstrate the phenomenon on a V-type model system and a two-state Born-Oppenheimer molecular system. Remarkably, wavepacket-like dynamics is induced in the excited molecular potential-energy surface.

abstract: Natural and artificial light harvesting systems often operate in a regime where the flux of photons is relatively low. Besides absorbing as many photons as possible it is therefore paramount to prevent excitons from annihilation via photon re-emission until they have undergone an irreversible conversion process. Taking inspiration from photosynthetic antenna structures, we here consider ring-like systems and introduce a class of states we call ratchets: excited states capable of absorbing but not emitting light. This allows our antennae to absorb further photons whilst retaining the excitations from those that have already been captured. Simulations for a ring of four sites reveal a peak power enhancement of 35% under ambient conditions owing to a combination of ratcheting and the prevention of emission through dark state population. In the slow extraction limit the achievable current enhancement exceeds hundreds of percent.

We show that when the repulsion between particles is very large the system can be approached analytically. To illustrate this analytical approach we consider a simple system of three distinguishable particles, which can be addressed experimentally. For this system we show that for infinite repulsion the energy spectrum is sixfold degenerate. We also show that this degeneracy is partially lifted for finitely large repulsion for which we find and describe corresponding wave functions.

abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton [SN] equation describes the effect of self-gravity on the evolution of a quantum system, and it has been proposed that gravitationally induced decoherence drives the system to one of the stationary solutions of the SN equation. However, the equation by itself lacks a decoherence mechanism, because it does not possess any stochastic feature. In the present work we derive a stochastic modification of the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, starting from the Einstein-Langevin equation in the theory of stochastic semiclassical gravity. We specialize this equation to the case of a single massive point particle, and by using Karolyhazy's phase variance method, we derive the Di\'osi - Penrose criterion for the decoherence time. We obtain a (nonlinear) master equation corresponding to this stochastic SN equation. This equation is however linear at the level of the approximation we use to prove decoherence, hence the no-signalling requirement is met. Lastly, we use physical arguments to obtain expressions for the decoherence length of extended objects.

abstract: Proposed models of closed timelike curves (CTCs) have been shown to enable powerful information-processing protocols. We examine the simulation of models of CTCs both by other models of CTCs and by physical systems without access to CTCs. We prove that the recently proposed transition probability CTCs (T-CTCs) are physically equivalent to postselection CTCs (P-CTCs), in the sense that one model can simulate the other with reasonable overhead. As a consequence, their information-processing capabilities are equivalent. We also describe a method for quantum computers to simulate Deutschian CTCs (but with a reasonable overhead only in some cases). In cases for which the overhead is reasonable, it might be possible to perform the simulation in a table-top experiment. This approach has the benefit of resolving some ambiguities associated with the equivalent circuit model of Ralph et al. Furthermore, we provide an explicit form for the state of the CTC system such that it is a maximum-entropy state, as prescribed by Deutsch.

abstract: This thesis is mainly devoted to the study of the quantum properties of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), which are nowadays the sources of the highest-quality quantum-correlated light, apart from fundamental tools in the classical-optics realm, allowing for the conversion of laser light into virtually all regions of the optical spectrum. Regarding its content, the thesis might seem a bit unusual, because two thirds of it are devoted to a self-contained (though dense) introduction to quantum optics, including the quantum physics of harmonic oscillators, the quantization of the electromagnetic field in an open optical cavity and the detection of its output light, as well as the derivation of the basic model and known properties of OPOs. Hence, all the original results of the thesis are contained in the last third, were it is proven that all OPOs can be understood as multi-mode devices whose quantum properties can be explained in terms of three basic phenomena: bifurcation squeezing, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and pump clamping, which are introduced through simple, yet realistic examples.

abstract: We study the problem of closing the detection loophole in three-qubit Bell tests, the experimentally most relevant case beyond the usual bipartite scenario, and show that the minimal detection efficiencies required can be considerably lowered compared to the two-qubit case. The lowest reported detection efficiency thresholds for two and three qubits so far are $\sim66.7\%$ and $60\%$, respectively. Using the three-qubit W state and a 3-setting Bell inequality, we beat these thresholds and with an 8-setting Bell inequality we reach $50.13\%$. We also investigate generic three-qubit states which allow us to attain a detection efficiency of $50\%$ in a 4-setting Bell test. We conjecture that the limit of $50\%$ is unbeatable using three-qubit states and any number of measurements.

abstract: Magic state distillation is a crucial component in the leading approaches to implementing universal fault tolerant quantum computation, with existing protocols for both qubit and higher dimensional systems. Early work focused on determining the region of distillable states for qubit protocols, yet comparatively little is known about which states can be distilled and with what distillable region for d>2. Here we focus on d=3 and present new four-qutrit distillation schemes that improve upon the known distillable region, and achieve distillation tight to the boundary of undistillable states for some classes of state. As a consequence of recent results, this implies that there is a family of quantum states that enable universality if and only if they exhibit contextuality with respect to stabilizer measurements. We also identify a new routine whose fixed point is a magic state with maximal sum-negativity i.e., it is maximally non-stabilizer in a specific sense.

abstract: We derive an extension to the quantum regression theorem which facilitates the calculation of two-time correlation functions and emission spectra for systems undergoing non-Markovian evolution. The derivation exploits projection operator techniques, with which we obtain explicit equations of motion for the correlation functions, making only a second order expansion in the system-environment coupling strength, and invoking the Born approximation at a fixed initial time. The results are used to investigate a driven semiconductor quantum dot coupled to an acoustic phonon bath, where we find the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics has observable signatures in the form of phonon sidebands in the resonance fluorescence emission spectrum.

abstract: We utilize a discrete (sequential) measurement protocol to investigate quantum process tomography of a single two-level quantum system, with an unknown initial state, undergoing Rabi oscillations. The ignorance of the dynamical parameters is encoded into a continuous-variable classical system which is coupled to the two-level quantum system via a generalized Hamiltonian. This combined estimate of the quantum state and dynamical parameters is updated using the information obtained from sequential measurements on the quantum system and, after a sufficient waiting period, faithful state monitoring and parameter determination is obtained. Numerical evidence is used to demonstrate the convergence of the state estimate to the true state of the hybrid system.

abstract: The readout fidelity of superconducting transmon and Xmon qubits is partially limited by the qubit energy relaxation through the resonator into the transmission line, which is also known as the Purcell effect. One way to suppress this energy relaxation is to employ a filter which impedes microwave propagation at the qubit frequency. We present semiclassical and quantum analyses for the bandpass Purcell filter realized by E.\ Jeffrey \textit{et al}.\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ 112, 190504 (2014)]. For typical experimental parameters, the bandpass filter suppresses the qubit relaxation rate by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining the same measurement rate. We also show that in the presence of a microwave drive the qubit relaxation rate further decreases with increasing drive strength.

abstract: Duan and Winter studied the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations, and formulated this problem as a semidefinite program depending only on the Kraus operator space of the channel. For the class of classical-quantum channels, they showed that the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations, minimized over all classical-quantum channels with a confusability graph $G$, is exactly $\log \vartheta(G)$, where $\vartheta(G)$ is the celebrated Lov\'{a}sz theta function. In this paper, we show that the same result holds in the one-shot setting for a class of circulant graphs defined by equal-sized cyclotomic cosets, which include the cycle graphs of odd length, the Paley graphs of prime vertices, and the cubit residue graphs of prime vertices. Examples of other graphs are also discussed. This endows the Lov\'{a}sz $\theta$ function with a more straightforward operational meaning.

abstract: The momentum signatures in nonperturbative multiphoton pair production for general elliptic polarization electric fields are investigated by employing the real-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. For a linearly polarized electric field we find that the positions of the nodes in momenta spectra of created pairs depend only on the electric field frequency. The polarization of external fields could not only change the node structures or even make the nodes disappear but also change the thresholds of pair production. The momentum signatures associated to the node positions in which the even-number-photon pair creation process is forbid could be used to distinguish the orbital angular momentum of created pairs on the momenta spectra. These distinguishable momentum signatures could be relevant for providing the output information of created particles and also the input information of ultrashort laser pulses.

abstract: We study multifractal properties in the spectrum of effective time-independent Hamiltonians obtained using a perturbative method for a class of delta-kicked systems. The evolution operator in the time-dependent problem is factorized into an initial kick, an evolution dictated by a time-independent Hamiltonian, and a final kick. We have used the double kicked $SU(2)$ system and the kicked Harper model to study butterfly spectrum in the corresponding effective Hamiltonians. We have obtained a generic class of $SU(2)$ Hamiltonians showing self-similar spectrum. The statistics of the generalized fractal dimension is studied for a quantitative characterization of the spectra.

abstract: We develop a numerical procedure to efficiently model the nonequilibrium steady state of one-dimensional arrays of open quantum systems, based on a matrix-product operator ansatz for the density matrix. The procedure searches for the null eigenvalue of the Liouvillian superoperator by sweeping along the system while carrying out a partial diagonalization of the single-site stationary problem. It bears full analogy to the density-matrix renormalization group approach to the ground state of isolated systems, and its numerical complexity scales as a power law with the bond dimension. The method brings considerable advantage when compared to the integration of the time-dependent problem via Trotter decomposition, as it can address arbitrarily long-ranged couplings. Additionally, it ensures numerical stability in the case of weakly dissipative systems thanks to a slow tuning of the dissipation rates along the sweeps. We have tested the method on a driven-dissipative spin chain, under various assumptions for the Hamiltonian, drive, and dissipation parameters, and compared the results to those obtained both by Trotter dynamics and Monte-Carlo wave function. Accurate and numerically stable convergence was always achieved when applying the method to systems with a gapped Liouvillian and a non-degenerate steady-state.

abstract: There exist two formulations for quantum heat engine. One is semi-classical scenario, and the other is full quantum scenario. The former is formulated as a unitary evolution for the internal system (working body and heat baths), and is adopted by the community of statistical mechanics. The latter is formulated as a unitary for the work storage and the internal system. It is adopted by the community of quantum information. However, these formulations do not consider measurement process. In this paper, we formulate the quantum heat engine based on the quantum measurement theory, because the amount of extracted work should be observed in a practical situation. With using our formulation, we derive two trade-off relations that show the semi-classical scenario does not work when the amount of extracted work is observed, i.e., we can hardly know the amount of the extracted work when the time evolution of the internal system is close to unitary. Next, based on our formulation, we derive the optimal efficiency of quantum heat engines with the finite-size heat baths, without assuming the existence of quasi-static processes. Using the strong large deviation theory, we asymptotically expand the optimal efficiency up to the third order. The first term is shown to be Carnot efficiency, and the higher order terms are shown to be the finite-size effects of the heat baths. We can construct the optimal work extraction as an energy-preserving unitary evolution among the internal system and the work storage. During the optimal work extraction, the entropy gain of the work storage is so negligibly small as compared with the energy gain of the work storage.

abstract: Transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems, ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices. It has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment. We report the first experimental demonstration of such environment-assisted quantum transport, using an engineered network of laser-written waveguides, with relative energies and inter-waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired Hamiltonian. Controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination, yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case. We show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target Hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence.

abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equations for the evolution of the magnetization, in presence of an external torque, can be cast in the form of the Lorenz equations and, thus, can describe chaotic fluctuations. To study quantum effects, we describe the magnetization by matrices, that take values in a Lie algebra. The finite dimensionality of the representation encodes the quantum fluctuations, while the non-linear nature of the equations can describe chaotic fluctuations. We identify a criterion, for the appearance of such non-linear terms. This depends on whether an invariant, symmetric tensor of the algebra can vanish or not. This proposal is studied in detail for the fundamental representation of $\mathfrak{u}(2)=\mathfrak{u}(1)\times\mathfrak{su}(2)$. We find a knotted structure for the attractor, a bimodal distribution for the largest Lyapunov exponent and that the dynamics takes place within the Cartan subalgebra, that does not contain only the identity matrix, thereby can describe the quantum fluctuations.

abstract: Basing on the analogy between the coherent states of light and separable states of $N$ bosons, we demonstrate that the violation Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for any-order correlation function signals the entanglement among the constituent particles. Rather than restricting to the correlations between the positions of particles, we consider the broadest set of measurements allowed by quantum mechanics. Our result is general -- it applies to any quantum system of bosons, even when the number of particles is not fixed, provided that there is no coherence between different number states. We also demonstrate that the compact expression for the separable state of bosons can be used to relate some known metrological quantities to the particle entanglement in a very simple way.

abstract: We investigate the strong coupling regime of a self-assembled quantum dot in a tunable microcavity with dark-field laser spectroscopy. The high quality of the spectra allows the lineshapes to be analyzed revealing subtle quantum interferences. Agreement with a model calculation is achieved only by including exciton dephasing which reduces the cooperativity from a bare value of 9.0 to the time-averaged value 5.5. In the pursuit of high cooperativity, besides a high-Q and low mode-volume cavity, we demonstrate that equal efforts need to be taken towards lifetime-limited emitter linewidths.

abstract: Among the (in)famous differences between classical and quantum mechanics, quantum counterfactuals seem to be the most intriguing. At the same time, they seem to underlie many quantum oddities. In this article, we propose a simple explanation for counterfactuals, on two levels. Quantum Oblivion (QO) is a fundamental type of quantum interaction that we prove to be the origin of quantum counterfactuals. It also turns out to underlie several well-known quantum effects. This phenomenon is discussed in the first part of the article, yielding some novel predictions. In the second part, a hypothesis is offered regarding the unique spacetime evolution underlying QO, termed Quantum Hesitation (QH). The hypothesis invokes advanced actions and interfering weak values, as derived first by the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF). Here too, weak values are argued to underlie the familiar "strong" quantum values. With these, an event that appears to have never occurred can exert causal effects and then succumb to QO by another time-evolution involving negative weak values that eliminate them. We conclude with briefly discussing the implications of these ideas on the nature of time.

abstract: Field-orthogonal temporal modes of photonic quantum states provide a new framework for quantum information science (QIS). They intrinsically span a high-dimensional Hilbert space and lend themselves to integration into existing single-mode fiber communication networks. We show that the three main requirements to construct a valid framework for QIS -- the controlled generation of resource states, the targeted and highly efficient manipulation of temporal modes and their efficient detection -- can be fulfilled with current technology. We suggest implementations of diverse QIS applications based on this complete set of building blocks.

abstract: Recently the first physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of Santha-Vazirani sources using a finite number of no-signaling devices and with a constant rate of noise has been proposed, however there still remained the open question whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness amplification using only two no-signaling devices and in a situation where the violation of a Bell inequality implies only an upper bound for some outcome probability for some setting combination? Here, we solve this problem and present the first device-independent protocol for the task of randomness amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of only two non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not fully deterministic into a totally random source while tolerating a constant noise rate and prove the security of the protocol against general no-signaling adversaries. The minimum requirement for a device-independent Bell inequality based protocol for obtaining randomness against no-signaling attacks is that every no-signaling box that obtains the observed Bell violation has the conditional probability $P(\textbf{x}| \textbf{u})$ of at least a single input-output pair $(\textbf{u}, \textbf{x})$ bounded from above. We show how one can construct protocols for randomness amplification in this minimalistic scenario.

abstract: We analyze the entanglement between two matter modes in a hybrid quantum system consists of a microcavity, a quantum well, and a mechanical oscillator. Although the exciton mode in the quantum well and the mechanical oscillator are initially uncoupled, their interaction through the microcavity field results in an indirect exciton-mechanical mode coupling. We show that this coupling is a Fano-Agarwal-type coupling induced by the decay of the exciton and the mechanical modes caused by the leakage of photons through the microcavity to the environment. Using experimental parameters and for slowly varying microcavity field, we show that the generated coupling leads to an exciton-mechanical mode entanglement. The maximum entanglement is achieved at the avoided level crossing frequency, where the hybridization of the two modes is maximum. The entanglement is also very robust to the phonon thermal bath temperature.

Hofstadter's butterfly is plotted by direct diagonalization of a position operator with an originally vanishing diagonal. This is equivalent to a one-dimensional hamiltonian without potential.

abstract: Conversion of entangled states under (Stochastic) Local Operations and Classical Communication admits the phenomenon of catalysis. Here we explore the possibility of the initial state to perform as a catalyst , which we call a self-catalytic process. We show explicit examples of self-catalysis. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the phenomenon to take place are discussed. We numerically estimate how frequent it is and we show that increasing the number of copies used as catalyst usually increases the probability of conversion, but do not make the process deterministic. By the end we conjecture that under LOCC and SLOCC, the probability of finding a self-catalytic reaction increases monotonically with the dimensions.

Using justified approximations, a closed analytical expression for the time evolution and number operators were obtained. We found that the generation of photons from quantum vacuum is strongly affected by the presence of the Kerr medium, sharing physical features with the case of two two-level atoms in a cavity with oscillating walls. Our analytical results are in good agreement with exact numerical calculations for times shorter than the revival time.

abstract: A negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been recognized as a good solid-state qubit. A system consisting of the electronic spin of the NV center and hyperfine-coupled nitrogen and additionally nearby carbon nuclear spins can form a quantum register of several qubits for quantum information processing or as a node in a quantum repeater. Several impressive experiments on the hybrid electron and nuclear spin register have been reported, but fidelities achieved so far are not yet at or below the thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Using quantum optimal control theory based on the Krotov method, we show here that fast and high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates in the universal quantum gate set for FTQC, taking into account the effects of the leakage state, nearby noise qubits and distant bath spins, can be achieved with errors less than those required by the threshold theorem of FTQC.

abstract: Since 1984, various optical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and examined. In all of them, the rate of secret key generation decays exponentially with distance. A natural and fundamental question is then whether there are yet-to-be discovered optical QKD protocols (without quantum repeaters) that could circumvent this rate-distance tradeoff. This paper provides a major step towards answering this question. We show that the secret-key-agreement capacity of a lossy and noisy optical channel assisted by unlimited two-way public classical communication is limited by an upper bound that is solely a function of the channel loss, regardless of how much optical power the protocol may use. Our result has major implications for understanding the secret-key-agreement capacity of optical channels---a long-standing open problem in optical quantum information theory---and strongly suggests a real need for quantum repeaters to perform QKD at high rates over long distances.

Dukes (2014) considered the periodicity of more general quantum walks on C_N and showed T_2 =2, T_4=8, T_8=24 for the Hadamard walk case. We prove that the Hadamard walk does not have any period except for his case, i.e., N=2, 4, 8. Our method is based on a path counting and cyclotomic polynomials which is different from his approach based on the property of eigenvalues for unitary matrix that determines the evolution of the walk.

abstract: In this paper we show that electron-positron pairs can be pumped inexhaustibly with a constant production rate from the one dimensional potential well with oscillating depth or width. Bound states embedded in the the Dirac sea can be pulled out and pushed to the positive continuum, and become scattering states. Pauli block, which dominant the saturation of pair creation in the static super-critical potential well, can be broken by the ejection of electrons. We find that the width oscillating mode is more efficient that the depth oscillating mode. In the adiabatic limit, pair number as a function of upper boundary of the oscillating, will reveal the diving of the bound states.

As a consequence, we show that any such semigroup satisfies the quantum detailed balance condition with respect to an invariant state if and only if all semigroups generated by each $\mathcal{L}_\omega$ so do with respect to the same invariant state.

abstract: We introduce with geometric means a density matrix decomposition of a multipartite quantum system of a finite dimension into two density matrices: a separable one, also known as the best separable approximation, and an essentially entangled one, which contains no product states components. We show that this convex decomposition can be achieved in practice with the help of an algorithm based on linear programming, which in the general case scales polynomially with the dimension of the multipartite system. Furthermore, we suggest methods for analyzing the multipartite entanglement content of the essentially entangled component and derive analytically an upper bound for its rank. We illustrate the algorithm at an example of a composed system of total dimension 12 undergoing loss of coherence due to classical noise and we trace the time evolution of its essentially entangled component. We suggest a "geometric" description of entanglement dynamics and show how it explains the well-known phenomena of sudden death and revival of multipartite entanglement.

abstract: The idea of detecting the entanglement of a given bipartite state by searching for symmetric extensions of this state was first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialeri. The complete family of separability tests it generates, often referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already proved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the efficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we essentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of separable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are, depending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the $k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding one for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased as follows: on $\mathbf{C}^d\otimes\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\sqrt{k})/d$, while random states obtained as partial traces over an environment $\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the $k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$. Both statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed, $k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even though any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed by $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent) value.

The difficulty raised by incompatible sets of observables is overcome within an epistemic enrichment of classical logic that provides the means for distinguishing between the value of a variable and its observation while retaining the classical connectives.

abstract: We establish a connection between non-Markovian memory effects and thermodynamical quantities such as work. We show how memory effects can be interpreted as revivals of work that can be extracted from a quantum system. We prove that non-Markovianity may allow an increase in the extractable work even when the entropy of the system is increasing. Our results have important implications both in quantum thermodynamics and in quantum information theory. In the former context they pave the way to the understanding of concepts like work in a non-Markovian open system scenario. In the latter context they lead to interesting consequences for quantum state merging protocols in presence of noise.

abstract: Weak measurements are supposed to be essential for the so called direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction [Nature (London) 474, 188 (2011)]. Here we show that direct measurement of the wavefunction can be obtained by using measurements of arbitrary strength. In particular, in the case of strong (i.e. projective) measurements, we compared the precision and the accuracy of the two methods, by showing that strong measurements outperform weak measurements in both. We also give the exact expression of the reconstructed wavefunction obtained by the weak measurement approach, allowing to define the range of applicability of such method.

abstract: With improved gate calibrations reducing unitary errors, we achieve a benchmarked single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.95% with superconducting qubits in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We present a method for distinguishing between unitary and non-unitary errors in quantum gates by interleaving repetitions of a target gate within a randomized benchmarking sequence. The benchmarking fidelity decays quadratically with the number of interleaved gates for unitary errors but linearly for non-unitary, allowing us to separate systematic coherent errors from decoherent effects. With this protocol we show that the fidelity of the gates is not limited by unitary errors, but by another drive-activated source of decoherence such as amplitude fluctuations.

abstract: We show how general graph states, an important resource state for multipartite quantum protocols, can be distributed over large distances using intermediate repeater stations. To this aim we describe a one way quantum repeater scheme using encoding in the language of graph states. For a general Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code we do a refined error analysis that allows to correct qubit errors and erasures caused by imperfect preparation, gates, transmission, detection, etc.. We analyze the cost and repeater rate for this general scheme. The concept is exemplified by the 7-qubit Steane code and the quantum Golay code.

abstract: A model of the asymmetric coherent scattering process (caused by initial atomic wave-packet splitting in the momentum space) taking place at the large detuning and adiabatic course of interaction for an effective two-state system interacting with a standing wave of laser radiation is discussed. We show that the same form of initial wave-packet splitting may lead to different, in general, diffraction patterns for opposite, adiabatic and resonant, regimes of the standing-wave scattering. We show that the scattering of the Gaussian wave packet in the adiabatic case presents refraction (a limiting form of the asymmetric scattering) in contrast to the bi-refringence (the limiting case of the high-order narrowed scattering) occurring in the resonant scattering.

Here, transverse optical field is used to control the phenomenon of EIT in the output probe laser field. The output probe laser field can efficiently be amplified or attenuated depending on the strength of transverse optical field. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Fano resonances in the output field spectra and discuss the controlled behavior of Fano resonances using transverse optical field. To observe this phenomena in laboratory, we suggest a certain set of experimental parameters.

abstract: In the paper we study the nonlinear mechanical cooling processes in the intrinsic quadratically optomechanical coupling system without linearizing the optomechanical interaction. We apply the scattering theory to calculate the transition rates between different mechanical Fock states with the use of the resolvent of Hamiltonian, which allows for a direct identification of the underlying physical processes, where only even-phonon transitions are permitted and odd-phonon transitions are forbidden. We verify the feasibility of the approach by comparing the steady-state mean phonon number obtained from transition rates with the simulation of the full quantum master equation, and also discuss the analytical results in the weak coupling limit that coincide with two-phonon mechanical cooling processes. Furthermore, to evaluate the statistical properties of steady mechanical state, we respectively apply the Mandel Q parameter to show that the oscillator can be in a nonclassical mechanical states, and the phonon number uctuations F to display that the even-phonon transitions favor to suppress the phonon number uctuations compared to the linear coupling optomechanical system.

abstract: We discuss the numerical solution methods available when solving for the steady-state density matrix of a time-independent open quantum optical system, where the system operators are expressed in a suitable basis representation as sparse matrices. In particular, we focus on the difficulties posed by the non-Hermitian structure of the Lindblad super operator, and the numerical techniques designed to mitigate these pitfalls. In addition, we introduce a doubly iterative inverse-power method that can give reduced memory and runtime requirements in situations where other iterative methods are limited due to poor bandwidth and profile reduction. The relevant methods are demonstrated on several prototypical quantum optical systems where it is found that iterative methods based on iLU factorization using reverse Cuthill-Mckee ordering tend to outperform other solution techniques in terms of both memory consumption and runtime as the size of the underlying Hilbert space increases. For eigenvalue solving, Krylov iterations using the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method outperform generalized minimal residual methods. In contrast, minimal residual methods work best for solvers based on direct LU decomposition. This work serves as a guide for solving the steady-state density matrix of an arbitrary quantum optical system, and points to several avenues of future research that will extend the applicability of these classical algorithms in absence of a quantum computer.

abstract: It is shown that Quantum Mechanics is ambiguous when predicting relative frequencies for an entangled system if the measurements of both subsystems are performed in spatially separated events. This ambiguity gives way to unphysical consequences: the projection rule could be applied in one or the other temporal(?) order of measurements (being non local in any case), but symmetry of the roles of both subsystems would be broken. An alternative theory is presented in which this ambiguity does not exist. Observable relative frequencies differ from those of orthodox Quantum Mechanics, and a {\it gendaken} experiment is proposed to falsify one or the other theory. In the alternative theory, each subsystem has an individual state in its own Hilbert space, and the total system state is direct product (rank one) of both, so there is no entanglement. Correlation between subsystems appears through a hidden label that prescribes the output of arbitrary hypothetical measurements. Measurement is treated as a usual reversible interaction, and this postulate allows to determine relative frequencies when the value of a magnitude is known without in any way perturbing the system, by measurement of the correlated companion. It is predicted the existence of an accompanying system, the de Broglie wave, introduced in order to preserve the action reaction principle in indirect measurements, when there is no interaction of detector and particle. Some action on the detector, different from the one cause by a particle, should be observable.

abstract: The periodically kicked quantum rotor is known for non-classical effects such as quantum localisation in angular momentum space or quantum resonances in rotational excitation. These phenomena have been studied in diverse systems mimicking the kicked rotor, such as cold atoms in optical lattices, or coupled photonic structures. Recently, it was predicted that several solid state quantum localisation phenomena - Anderson localisation, Bloch oscillations, and Tamm-Shockley surface states - may manifest themselves in the rotational dynamics of laser-kicked molecules. Here, we report the first observation of rotational Bloch oscillations in a gas of nitrogen molecules kicked by a periodic train of femtosecond laser pulses. A controllable detuning from the quantum resonance creates an effective accelerating potential in angular momentum space, inducing Bloch-like oscillations of the rotational excitation. These oscillations are measured via the temporal modulation of the refractive index of the gas. Our results introduce room-temperature laser-kicked molecules as a new laboratory for studies of localisation phenomena in quantum transport.

abstract: The notion of equality between two observables will play many important roles in foundations of quantum theory. However, the standard probabilistic interpretation based on the conventional Born formula does not give the probability of equality relation for a pair of arbitrary observables, since the Born formula gives the probability distribution only for a commuting family of observables. In this paper, quantum set theory developed by Takeuti and the present author is used to systematically extend the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory to define the probability of equality relation for a pair of arbitrary observables. Applications of this new interpretation to quantum measurement theory are discussed briefly.

abstract: Strong nonlinear interactions between photons enable logic operations for both classical and quantum-information technology. Unfortunately, nonlinear interactions are usually feeble and therefore all-optical logic gates tend to be inefficient. A quantum emitter deterministically coupled to a propagating mode fundamentally changes the situation, since each photon inevitably interacts with the emitter, and highly correlated many-photon states may be created . Here we show that a single quantum dot in a photonic-crystal waveguide can be utilized as a giant nonlinearity sensitive at the single-photon level. The nonlinear response is revealed from the intensity and quantum statistics of the scattered photons, and contains contributions from an entangled photon-photon bound state. The quantum nonlinearity will find immediate applications for deterministic Bell-state measurements and single-photon transistors and paves the way to scalable waveguide-based photonic quantum-computing architectures.

abstract: We present a study of quantum contextuality of three-dimensional mixed states for the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) and the Kurzy\'{n}ski-Kaszlikowski (KK) noncontextuality inequalities. For any class of states whose eigenvalues are arranged in decreasing order, a universal set of measurements always exists for the KK inequality, whereas none does for the KCBS inequality. This difference can be reflected from the spectral distribution of the overall measurement matrix. Our results would facilitate the error analysis for experimental setups, and our spectral method in the paper combined with graph theory could be useful in future studies on quantum contextuality.

abstract: The (negative-weighted) quantum adversary bound is a tight characterisation of the quantum query complexity for any partial function. We analyse the extent to which this bound can be generalised. Ambainis et al. [arXiv:1012.2112] and Lee et al. [arXiv:1011.3020] generalised this bound to the state generation and state conversion problems, respectively. Using the ideas by Lee et al., we get even further generalisations of the bound. We obtain a version of the bound for general input oracles, which are just arbitrary unitaries. We also generalise the bound to the problem of implementing arbitrary unitary transformations. Similarly to the bound by Lee et al., our bound is a lower bound for exact transformation and an upper bound for approximate transformation. This version of the bound possesses the tight composition property. Using this construction, we also obtain lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of functions and relations with general input oracles.

abstract: We introduce two families of sum-of-squares (SOS) decompositions for the Bell operators associated with the tilted CHSH expressions introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 100402 (2012). These SOS decompositions provide tight upper bounds on the maximal quantum value of these Bell expressions. Moreover, they establish algebraic relations that are necessarily satisfied by any quantum state and observables yielding the optimal quantum value. These algebraic relations are then used to show that the tilted CHSH expressions provide robust self-tests for any partially entangled two-qubit state. This application to self-testing follows closely the approach of Phys. Rev. A 87, 050102 (2013), where we identify and correct two non-trivial flaws.

abstract: Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate numerical quantities which are hard to compute deterministically. One important example is the use in statistical physics of rapidly mixing Markov chains to approximately compute partition functions. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm which can accelerate Monte Carlo methods in a very general setting. The algorithm estimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomised or quantum subroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of quantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms with rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use multiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can also be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability distributions efficiently.

abstract: Entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics, and yet it is not specifically quantum. More specific to quantum mechanics is the connection between entanglement and thermodynamics, which leads to an identification between entropies and measures of pure state entanglement. Here we search for the roots of this connection, investigating the relation between entanglement and thermodynamics in the framework of general probabilistic theories. We first address the question whether an entangled state can be transformed into another by means of local operations and classical communication. Under two operational requirements, we prove a general version of the Lo-Popescu theorem, which lies at the foundations of the theory of pure-state entanglement. We then consider a resource theory of purity where free operations are random reversible transformations, modelling the scenario where an agent has limited control over the dynamics of a closed system. Our key result is a duality between the resource theory of entanglement and the resource theory of purity, valid for every physical theory where all processes arise from pure states and reversible interactions at the fundamental level. As an application of the main result, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between entropies and measures of pure bipartite entanglement and exploit it to define entanglement measures in the general probabilistic framework. In addition, we show a duality between the task of information erasure and the task of entanglement generation, whereby the existence of entropy sinks (systems that can absorb arbitrary amounts of information) becomes equivalent to the existence of entanglement sources (correlated systems from which arbitrary amounts of entanglement can be extracted).

This leads to some interesting problems concerning the distribution of the number operator and also tomographic complexity.

abstract: A missing piece in quantum information theory, with very few exceptions, has been to provide the random coding exponents for quantum information-processing protocols. We remedy the situation by providing these exponents for a variety of protocols including those at the top of the family tree of protocols. Our line of attack is to provide an exponential bound on the decoupling error for a restricted class of completely positive maps where a key term in the exponent is in terms of a R\'enyi $\alpha$-information-theoretic quantity for any $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Among the protocols covered are fully quantum Slepian-Wolf, quantum state merging, quantum state redistribution, quantum/classical communication across channels with side information at the transmitter with or without entanglement assistance, and quantum communication across broadcast channels.

abstract: We propose the continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol based on the Gaussian modulation of a single quadrature of the coherent states of light, which is aimed to provide simplified implementation compared to the symmetrically modulated Gaussian coherent-state protocols. The protocol waives the necessity in phase quadrature modulation and the corresponding channel transmittance estimation. The security of the protocol against collective attacks in a generally phase-sensitive Gaussian channels is analyzed and is shown achievable upon certain conditions. Robustness of the protocol to channel imperfections is compared to that of the symmetrical coherent-state protocol. The simplified unidimensional protocol is shown possible at a reasonable quantitative cost in terms of key rate and of tolerable channel excess noise.

abstract: We motivate and introduce a class of "hierarchical" quantum superposition states of $N$ coupled quantum oscillators. Unlike other well-known multimode photonic Schr\"{o}dinger cat states such as entangled coherent states, the hierarchical superposition states are characterized as two-branch superpositions of tensor products of single-mode Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. In addition to analyzing the photon statistics and quasiprobability distributions of prominent examples of these nonclassical states, we consider their usefulness for high-precision quantum metrology of nonlinear optical Hamiltonians and quantify their mode entanglement. We propose two methods for generating hierarchical superpositions in $N=2$ coupled microwave cavities which exploit currently existing quantum optical technology for generating entanglement between spatially separated electromagnetic field modes.

abstract: Weak measurements and weak values have recently attracted wide attention because of their novel applications. However, the current theory and experiments are all based on the perturbative ap- proach with risky approximations. The weakness of the system-pointer coupling leads to problems including deviation between data and predictions of weak value, inefficiency or low signal-to-noise ratio, and systematical bias in weak-value state reconstruction. Here we propose a non-perturbative approach to quantum measurements with post-selections, solving the above problems simultaneously by slightly modifying the current weak-measurement scheme, where coupling-deformed pointer ob- servables are measured. Our result paves the way to put the weak-value and weak-measurement related applications on a more precise and solid foundation.

abstract: We use the entanglement sampling techniques developed by Dupuis, Fawzi and Wehner to find a lower bound on the entanglement needed by a coalition of cheater attacking the quantum position verification protocol using the four BB84 states in the scenario where the cheaters have no access to a quantum channel but share a (possibly mixed) entangled state $\tilde{\Phi}$. For a protocol using n qubits, a necessary condition for cheating is that the max- relative entropy of entanglement $E_{\max}(\tilde{\Phi})\ge n-O(\log n)$. This improves previously known best lower bound by a factor $\sim4$, and it is essentially tight, since this protocol is vulnerable to a teleportation based attack using $n-O(1)$ ebits of entanglement.

abstract: Mutual information is the reciprocal information that is common to or shared by two or more parties. Quantum mutual information (QMI) for bipartite quantum systems is non-negative, and bears the interpretation of total correlation between the two subsystems.This may, however, be no longer true for three or more party quantum systems. It is possible that three-party QMI can be negative. That QMI can assume negative value is confronting, and we give operational definition of QMI which is non-negative. We then define multiparty operational quantum discord, and give some examples. Interestingly, we observe that quantum discord increases when measurement is performed on larger number of subsystems. Consequently, the symmetric version of quantum discord, which involves measurement on all parties, reveals the maximal quantumness. This raises question on the interpretation of measured mutual information as classical correlation.

abstract: In this paper we solve two equivalent time optimal control problems. On one hand, we design the control field to implement in minimum time the SWAP (or equivalent) operator on a two-level system, assuming that it interacts with an additional, uncontrollable, two-level system. On the other hand, we synthesize the SWAP operator simultaneously, in minimum time, on a pair of two-level systems subject to opposite drifts. We assume that it is possible to perform three independent control actions, and that the total control strength is bounded. These controls either affect the dynamics of the target system, under the first perspective, or, simultaneously, the dynamics of both systems, in the second view. We obtain our results by using techniques of geometric control theory on Lie groups. In particular, we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, and provide a complete characterization of singular and non-singular extremals. Our analysis shows that the problem can be formulated as the motion of a material point in a central force, a well known system in classical mechanics. Although we focus on obtaining the SWAP operator, many of the ideas and techniques developed in this work apply to the time optimal implementation of an arbitrary unitary operator.

abstract: We consider a thermofield approach to analyze the evolution of an open quantum system coupled to an environment at finite temperature. In this approach, the finite temperature environment is exactly mapped onto two virtual environments at zero temperature. These two environments are then unitarily transformed into two different chains of oscillators, leading to a one dimensional structure that can be numerically studied using tensor network techniques.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.07251
abstract: A Markov chain is a tripartite quantum state $\rho_{ABC}$ whose $C$-part can be recovered from the $B$-part only, i.e., there exists a recovery map $\mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}$ such that $\rho_{ABC} = \mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}(\rho_{AB})$. More generally, an approximate Markov chain $\rho_{ABC}$ is a state whose distance to the closest recovered state $\mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}(\rho_{AB})$ is small. As proved recently in [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664], this distance can be bounded from above by the conditional mutual information $I(A : C | B)$ of the state. While the proof is non-constructive, one may expect that the recovery is universal, in the sense that the same map $\mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}$ works for all states with a given marginal $\rho_{BC}$. Here we show that this is indeed the case.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an improvement of $0.7\pm 0.1$ dB in the noise figure in a low noise fiber-optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) with the injection of correlated quantum fields generated from spontaneous four-wave mixing in fibers. The noise performance of the amplifier is characterized with homodyne detectors. The experimental result shows that the noise levels in the two output ports (signal and idler) of the amplifier are both $1.0\pm 0.1$ dB lower than a regular FOPA with vacuum at the unused input port. In addition, we demonstrate the scheme can be used as a quantum information tap with a combined information transfer efficiency (signal and tap) as $T_{sig}+T_{tap} =1.47\pm 0.2$, which is larger than the classical limit of 1. This low noise FOPA can be applied to the low noise amplification in the measurement of weak signals.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are considered to be the leading venue for fabricating on-demand sources of single photons. However, the generation of long-lived dark excitons imposes significant limits on the efficiency of these sources. We demonstrate a technique that optically pumps the dark exciton population and converts it to a bright exciton population, using intermediate excited biexciton states. We show experimentally that our method considerably reduces the DE population while doubling the triggered bright exciton emission, approaching thereby near-unit fidelity of quantum dot depletion.

abstract: We investigate the excitation of quantum plasmonic states of light in graphene using end-fire and prism coupling. In order to model the excitation process quantum mechanically we quantize the transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes in graphene. A selection of regimes are then studied that enable the excitation of SPPs by photons and we show that efficient coupling of photons to graphene SPPs is possible at the quantum level. Futhermore, we study the excitation of quantum states and their propagation under the effects of loss induced from the electronic degrees of freedom in the graphene. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to protect quantum information using quantum error correction techniques. We find that these techniques provide a robust-to-loss method for transferring quantum states of light in graphene over large distances.

abstract: In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the construction of a proper measure of quantum non-Markovianity. However, those proposed measures are shown to be at variance with different situations. In this work, we utilize the theory of $k$-positive maps to generalize a hierarchy of $k$-divisibility and develop a powerful tool, called $k$-divisibility phase diagram, which can provide a further insight into the nature of quantum non-Markovianity. By exploring the phase diagram with several paradigms, we can explain the origin of the discrepancy between two frequently used measures and find the condition under which the two measures coincide with each other.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.07375
abstract: We formulate Grover's unstructured search algorithm as a chiral quantum walk, where transitioning in one direction has a phase conjugate to transitioning in the opposite direction. For small phases, this breaking of time-reversal symmetry is too small to significantly affect the evolution: the system still approximately evolves in its ground and first excited states, rotating to the marked vertex in time $\pi \sqrt{N} / 2$. Increasing the phase does not change the runtime, but rather changes the support for the 2D subspace, so the system evolves in its first and second excited states, or its second and third excited states, and so forth. Apart from the critical phases corresponding to these transitions in the support, which become more frequent as the phase grows, this reveals that our model of quantum search is robust against time-reversal symmetry breaking.

abstract: According to the Schwinger mechanism, a uniform electric field brings about pair productions in vacuum; the relationship between the production rate and the electric field is different, depending on the dimension of the system. In this paper, we make an offer of another model for the pair productions, in which weak values are incorporated: energy fluctuations trigger the pair production, and a weak value appears as the velocity of a particle there. Although our model is only available for the approximation of the pair production rates, the weak value reveals a new aspect of the pair production. Especially, within the first order, our estimation approximately agrees with the exponential decreasing rate of the Landau-Zener tunneling through the mass energy gap. In other words, such tunneling can be associated with energy fluctuations via the weak value, when the tunneling gap can be regarded as so small due to the high electric field.

abstract: We show that the Dirac quantum cellular automaton [Ann. Phys. 354 (2015) 244] shares many properties in common with the discrete-time quantum walk. These similarities can be exploited to redefine the automaton as a unitary process that takes place at regular time steps on a one-dimensional lattice with an arbitrary lattice spacing. In this way, it becomes an alternative to the quantum walk, with a dispersion relation that can be controlled by a mass parameter, playing a similar role to the coin angle in the quantum walk. Moreover, the Dirac Hamiltonian is recovered under a suitable limit. We also provide two independent analytical approximations to the long term probability distribution. It is shown that, starting from localized conditions, the asymptotic value of the entropy of entanglement between internal and motional degrees of freedom overcomes the known limit that is approached by the quantum walk for the same initial conditions, and are similar to the ones achieved by highly localized states of the Dirac equation.

abstract: A moving boundary separating two otherwise homogeneous regions of a dielectric is known to emit radiation from the quantum vacuum. An analytical framework based on the Hopfield model, describing a moving refractive index step in 1+1 dimensions for realistic dispersive media has been developed in [1]. We expand the use of this model to calculate explicitly spectra of all modes of positive and negative norm. Furthermore, for lower step heights we obtain a novel set of mode configurations. This leads to a realistic emission spectrum featuring black hole- and white hole emission for different frequencies. We also present spectra as measured in the laboratory frame that include all modes, in particular a dominant negative norm mode, which is the partner mode in any Hawking-type emission. We find that the emission spectrum is highly structured into intervals of emission with black hole-, white hole-, and no horizons. Finally we estimate the number of photons emitted as a function of the step height and find a power law of 2.5 for low step heights.

abstract: The Wigner rotation angle for a particle in a circular motion in the Schwarzschild spacetime is obtained via the Fermi-Walker transport of spinors. Then, by applying the WKB approximation, a possible application of the Fermi-Walker transport of spinors in relativistic EPR correlations is discussed, where it is shown that the spins of the correlated particle undergo a precession in an analogous way to that obtained by Terashima and Ueda [H. Terashima and M. Ueda, Phys. Rev. A {\bf69}, 032113 (2004)] via the application of successive infinitesimal Lorentz transformations. Moreover, from the WKB approach, it is also shown that the degree of violation of the Bell inequality depends on the Wigner rotation angle obtained via the Fermi-Walker transport. Finally, the relativistic effects from the geometry of the spacetime and the accelerated motion of the correlated particles is discussed in the nonrelativistic limit.

abstract: We study the dynamics of the collision between two fermions in Hubbard model with on-site interaction strength $U$. The exact solution shows that the scattering matrix for two-wavepacket collision is separable into two independent parts, operating on spatial and spin degrees of freedom, respectively. The S-matrix for spin configuration is equivalent to that of Heisenberg-type pulsed interaction with the strength depending on $U$ and relative group velocity $\upsilon _{r}$. This can be applied to create distant EPR pair, through a collision process for two fermions with opposite spins in the case of $\left\vert \upsilon _{r}/U\right\vert =1$,\ without the need for temporal control and measurement process. Multiple collision process for many particles is also discussed.

abstract: Intense terahertz-frequency pulses induce coherent rotational dynamics and orientation of polar molecular ensembles. Exact numerical methods for rotational dynamics are computationally not feasible for the vast majority of molecular rotors - the asymmetric top molecules at ambient temperatures. We exemplify the use of Random Phase Wave Functions (RPWF) by calculating the terahertz-induced rotational dynamics of sulfur dioxide (SO2) at ambient temperatures and high field strengths and show that the RPWF method gains efficiency with the increase in temperature and in the THz-field strengths. The presented method provides wide-ranging computational access to rotational dynamical responses of molecules at experimental conditions which are far beyond the reach of exact numerical methods.

abstract: The Navier-Stokes equation contains two terms which have been subjected to slight modification: (a) the viscosity term depends of time (the viscosity in average on time is zero, but its variance is nonzero); (b) the pressure gradient contains an added term describing the entropy gradient multiplied by the pressure. Owing to these modifications, the Navier-Stokes equation can be reduced to the Schr\"odinger equation describing behavior of a particle into the vacuum, where the vacuum is a superfluid medium. Vortex structures arising in this medium show infinitely long life owing to zero average viscosity. The nonzero variance describes exchange of the vortex energy with zero-point energy of the vacuum. Radius of the vortex trembles around some average value. This observation sheds the light to the Zitterbewegung phenomenon. The vortex has a non-zero core where the vortex velocity vanishes. Its organization is discussed with the point of view of the Calabi-Yau manifold.

abstract: Entanglement is widely considered the cornerstone of quantum information and an essential resource for relevant quantum effects, such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, or the speed-up of quantum computing, as in Shor's algorithm. However, up to now, there is no general characterization of entanglement for many-body systems. In this sense, it is encouraging that quantum states connected by stochastic local operations assisted with classical communication (SLOCC), which perform probabilistically the same quantum tasks, can be collected into entanglement classes. Nevertheless, there is an infinite number of classes for four or more parties that may be gathered, in turn, into a finite number of entanglement families. Unfortunately, we have not been able to relate all classes and families to specific properties or quantum information tasks, although a few of them have certainly raised experimental interest. Here, we present a novel entanglement classification for quantum states according to their matrix-product-state structure, exemplified for the symmetric subspace. The proposed classification relates entanglement families to the interaction length of Hamiltonians, establishing the first connection between entanglement classification and condensed matter. Additionally, we found a natural nesting property in which the families for $N$ parties carry over to the $N+1$ case. We anticipate our proposal to be a starting point for the exploration of the connection between entanglement classification properties and condensed-matter models.

abstract: Basic explanations of the double slit diffraction phenomenon include a description of waves that emanate from two slits and interfere. The locations of the interference minima and maxima are determined by the phase difference of the waves. An optical wave, which has a wavelength ${\lambda}$ and propagates a distance $L$, accumulates a phase of $2{\pi}L{/}{\lambda}$. A matter wave, also having wavelength ${\lambda}$ and propagating the same distance $L$, accumulates a phase of ${\pi}L{/}{\lambda}$, which is a factor of two different from the optical case. Nevertheless, the phase difference, ${\Delta}{\phi}$, for interfering matter waves that propagate distances that differ by ${\Delta}L$, is approximately $2{\pi}{\Delta}L{/}{\lambda}$, which is the same value computed in the optical case. The difference between the matter and optical case hinders conceptual explanations of diffraction from two slits based on the matter-optics analogy. In the following article we provide a path integral description for matter waves with a focus on conceptual explanation. A thought experiment is provided to illustrate the validity range of the approximation ${\Delta}{\phi}{\approx}2{\pi}{\Delta}L{/}{\lambda}$.

abstract: Many quantum information tasks rely on entanglement, which is used as a resource, for example, to enable efficient and secure communication. Typically, noise, accompanied by loss of entanglement, reduces the efficiency of quantum protocols. We demonstrate experimentally a superdense coding scheme with noise, where the decrease of entanglement in Alice's encoding state does not reduce the efficiency of the information transmission. Having almost fully dephased classical two-photon polarization state at the time of encoding, we reach values of mutual information close to 1.52 (1.89) with 3-state (4-state) encoding. This high efficiency relies both on non-Markovian features, that Bob exploits just before his Bell-state measurement, and on very high visibility (99.6$\%$) of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference within the experimental set-up. Our proof-of-principle results pave the way for exploiting non-Markovianity to improve the efficiency and security of quantum information processing tasks.

abstract: We study entanglement creation between two independent XX chains, which are repeatedly coupled locally to spin-1/2 Bell pairs. We show analytically that in the steady state the entanglement of the Bell pairs is perfectly transferred to the chains, generating large-scale interchain pair correlations. However, before the steady state is reached, within a growing causal region around the interacting locus the chains are found in a current driven nonquilibrium steady state (NESS). In the NESS, the chains cross entanglement decays exponentially with respect to the distance to the boundary sites with a typical length scale which is inversely proportional to the driving current.

abstract: A scheme to utilize atom-like emitters coupled to nanophotonic waveguides is proposed for the generation of many-body entangled states and for the reversible mapping of these states of matter to photonic states of an optical pulse in the waveguide. Our protocol makes use of decoherence-free subspaces (DFS) for the atomic emitters with coherent evolution within the DFS enforced by strong dissipative coupling to the waveguide. By switching from subradiant to superradiant states, entangled atomic states are mapped to photonic states with high fidelity. An implementation using ultracold atoms coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide is discussed.

abstract: Quantum systems usually travel a multitude of different paths when evolving through time from an initial to a final state. In general, the possible paths will depend on the future and past boundary conditions, as well as the system's dynamics. We present a gedankenexperiment where mutually exclusive paths are followed deterministically and simultaneously, by the same system, depending on which measurement was performed. We show how this `paradoxical' behavior is interpreted in the weak measurement formalism where the back action of the measurement cannot be used to account for the strange behavior. To support our predictions we present a method for performing both the strong and weak measurement.

abstract: Postselected weak measurement has aroused broad interest for its distinctive ability to amplify small physical quantities. However, the low postselection efficiency to obtain a large weak value has been a big obstacle to its application in practice, since it may waste resources, and reduce the measurement precision. An improved protocol was proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 030401 (2014)] to make the postselected weak measurement dramatically more efficient by using entanglement. Such a protocol can increase the Fisher information of the measurement to approximately saturate the well-known Heisenberg limit. In this paper, we review the entanglement-assisted protocol of postselected weak measurement in detail, and study its robustness against technical noises. We focus on readout errors. Readout errors can greatly degrade the performance of postselected weak measurement, especially when the readout error probability is comparable to the postselection probability. We show that entanglement can significantly reduce the two main detrimental effects of readout errors: inaccuracy in the measurement result, and the loss of Fisher information. We extend the protocol by introducing a majority vote scheme to postselection to further compensate for readout errors. With a proper threshold, almost no Fisher information will be lost. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of entanglement in protecting postselected weak measurement against readout errors.

abstract: What can one do with a given tunable quantum device? We provide complete symmetry criteria deciding whether some effective target interaction(s) can be simulated by a set of given interactions. Symmetries lead to a better understanding of simulation and permit a reasoning beyond the limitations of the usual explicit Lie closure. Conserved quantities induced by symmetries pave the way to a resource theory for simulability. On a general level, one can now decide equality for any pair of compact Lie algebras just given by their generators without determining the algebras explicitly. Several physical examples are illustrated, incl. entanglement invariants, the relation to unitary gate membership problems as well as the central spin model.

Thus the problem of preparation of these type of states is very important in quantum information theory. But the factor which prohibit the generation of the above mentioned pure states shared between two and three distant partners is decoherence. When we send one qubit, from a two qubit state, through decoherence channel like amplitude damping channel, the purity of the qubit is lost and it ends up with a mixed state. Therefore it is very difficult to keep the pure maximally entangled state in a maximally entangled pure state or in an entangled state with high entanglement. In this work we have provided a method by which one can generate experimentally a maximally entangled Bell states shared between distant parties with a non-zero probability when a qubit, from a two qubit general state, passes through decoherence channel. Therefore, despite of the fact that qubit is interacting with the noisy channel, we are able to generate Bell state shared between two distant partners. Further, we have shown that it is possible to generate pure three-qubit W-type states shared between three distant partners using economical quantum cloning machine and weak-measurement based feed-forward control scheme, even though the second and third qubit is interacting with the noisy channel. Lastly, we have shown that the generated three-qubit W-type states can be used in teleporting one of the two non-orthogonal states.

abstract: Entanglement has been studied extensively for unveiling the mysteries of non-classical correlations between quantum systems. In the bipartite case, there are well known measures for quantifying entanglement such as concurrence, relative entropy of entanglement (REE) and negativity, which cannot be increased via local operations. It was found that for sets of non-maximally entangled states of two qubits, comparing these entanglement measures may lead to different entanglement orderings of the states. On the other hand, although it is not an entanglement measure and not monotonic under local operations, due to its ability of detecting multipartite entanglement, quantum Fisher information (QFI) has recently received an intense attraction generally with entanglement in the focus. In this work, we revisit the state ordering problem of general two qubit states. Generating a thousand random quantum states and performing an optimization based on local general rotations of each qubit, we calculate the maximal QFI for each state. We analyze the maximized QFI in comparison with concurrence, REE and negativity and obtain new state orderings. We show that there are pairs of states having equal maximized QFI but different values for concurrence, REE and negativity and vice versa.

abstract: Security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems usually assume that the users have access to source of perfect randomness. State-of-the-art QKD systems run at frequencies in the GHz range, requiring a sustained GHz rate of generation and acquisition of quantum random numbers. In this paper we demonstrate such a high speed random number generator. The entropy source is based on amplified spontaneous emission from an erbium-doped fibre, which is directly acquired using a standard small form-factor pluggable (SFP) module. The module connects to the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) of a QKD system. A real-time randomness extractor is implemented in the FPGA and achieves a sustained rate of 1.25 Gbps of provably random bits.

abstract: We introduce the local quantum thermal susceptibility (LQTS) functional, which quantifies the best achievable accuracy for the temperature estimation of a composite system via local measurements. In this way we provide an operative strategy to address the local thermal response of arbitrary quantum systems at equilibrium. Our method relies on basic concepts of quantum estimation theory and is irrespective of the structure of thermal states. At low temperatures LQTS is an indicator of the local distinguishability of the ground-state with respect to the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a powerful method to identify, for example, quantum phase transitions.

abstract: Stern-Gerlach experiment by free electron is very important experiment because it answered some questions that remain unanswered for almost a century. Bohr and Pauli considered its objective observation as impossible while some other scientists considered such observation as possible. The experiment on free electrons has not been conducted so far because the high magnetic field gradient predicted there was thought as impossible to generate. This paper proves that it is not only possible but also observable using a high vacuum lamp which is deionized well. To obtain a high magnetic field gradient, it is not necessary to have a very strong magnetic field and it is possible to observe the phenomenon using a very sharp pointed magnet and adjusting the voltage in a certain distance from free electron beams. that objective observation requires your consideration of some technical points simultaneously.In this experiment, no electric field and no magnetic field does not change with time.

abstract: The paper deals with the problem of dynamics of externally driven open quantum systems. Using the path integral methods we found an analytical expression for time-dependent density matrix of two externally driven coupled quantum oscillators interacting with different baths of oscillators. It is shown that at the zeroing of external forces the density matrix becomes identical to the previously obtained one for freely developing coupled oscillators. Mean values of observables are computed by using the Hermitian part of the matrix. All elements of the covariance matrix composed by coordinates and momenta of two driven coupled oscillators are calculated. The time-dependent mean values, dispersions and covariances of coordinates of coupled oscillators at given external forces are numerically studied. It is shown that the larger the coupling constant the larger is the disturbances of the second oscillator due to external action on the first oscillator. Coupled dynamics of forced oscillators at relatively large coupling constant is demonstrated at different thermodynamic conditions.

abstract: For many optimization algorithms the time-to-solution depends not only on the problem size but also on the specific problem instance and may vary by many orders of magnitude. It is then necessary to investigate the full distribution and especially its tail. Here we analyze the distributions of annealing times for simulated annealing and simulated quantum annealing (by path integral quantum Monte Carlo) for random Ising spin glass instances. We find power-law distributions with very heavy tails, corresponding to extremely hard instances, but far broader distributions - and thus worse performance for hard instances - for simulated quantum annealing than for simulated annealing. Fast, non-adiabatic, annealing schedules can improve the performance of simulated quantum annealing for very hard instances by many orders of magnitude.

abstract: We use the class of commuting quantum computations known as IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) to strengthen the conjecture that quantum computers are hard to simulate classically. We show that, if either of two plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then IQP computations are hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. One conjecture relates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition function for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns approximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe that both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case complexity. We arrive at these conjectures by deriving spin-based generalisations of the Boson Sampling problem that avoid the so-called permanent anticoncentration conjecture.

abstract: We propose a practical quantum cryptographic scheme which combines high information capacity, such as provided by high-dimensional quantum entanglement, with the simplicity of a two-dimensional Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell test for security verification. By applying a state combining entanglement in a two-dimensional degree of freedom, such as photon polarization, with high-dimensional correlations in another degree of freedom, such as photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) or path, the scheme provides a considerably simplified route towards security verification in quantum key distribution (QKD) aimed at exploiting high-dimensional quantum systems for increased secure key rates. It also benefits from security against collective attacks and is feasible using currently available technologies.

Our scheme makes use of quantum polynomial codes to encode quantum information and generalizes teleportation based error correction for multilevel systems to repetitively correct photon erasures and operation errors. We discuss the application of our scheme for one-way quantum repeaters and discuss their physical implementation using atom mediated multiqubit gates.

abstract: We combine the ideas of Dirac's orthonormal representation, Everett's relative state, and 't Hooft's ontological basis to define the notion of a world for quantum mechanics. Mathematically, for a quantum system $\mathcal{Q}$ with an associated Hilbert space $\mathbb{H},$ a world of $\mathcal{Q}$ is defined to be an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{H}.$ The evolution of the system is governed by Schr\"{o}dinger's equation for the worlds of it. An observable in a certain world is a self-adjoint operator diagonal under the corresponding basis. Moreover, a state is defined in an associated world but can be uniquely extended to the whole system as proved recently by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava. Although the states described by unit vectors in $\mathbb{H}$ may be determined in different worlds, there are the so-called topology-compact states which must be determined by the totality of a world. We can apply the Copenhagen interpretation to a world for regarding a quantum state as an external observation, and obtain the Born rule of random outcomes. Therefore, we present a mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on the notion of a world instead of a quantum state.

abstract: We investigate the properties of the optical output fields from a cavity optomechanical system, where the cavity is driven by a strong coupling and a weak probe optical fields and the mechanical resonator is driven by a coherent mechanical pump. When the frequency of the mechanical pump matches the frequency difference between the coupling and probe optical fields, due to the interference between the different optical components at the same frequency, we demonstrate that the large positive or negative group delay of the output field at the frequency of probe field can be achieved and tuned by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the mechanical driving field. Moreover, the strength of the output field at the frequency of optical four-wave-mixing (FWM) field also can be controlled (enhanced and suppressed) by tuning the phase and amplitude of the mechanical pump. We show that the power of the output field at the frequency of the optical FWM field can be suppressed to zero or enhanced so much that it can be comparable with and even larger than the power of the input probe optical field.

abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Langevin (SL) equation is considered as an effective open quantum system formalism suitable for phenomenological applications. We focus on two open issues relative to its solutions. We first show that the Madelung/polar transformation of the wavefunction leads to a nonzero friction for the excited states of the quantum subsystem. We then study analytically and numerically the SL equation ability to bring a quantum subsystem to the thermal equilibrium of statistical mechanics. To do so, concepts about statistical mixed states, quantum noises and their production are discussed and a detailed analysis is carried with two kinds of noise and potential.

Quantum resources are known to enable RACs that break classical limitations. Here, we study quantum and classical RACs with high-level communication. We derive average performances of classical RACs and present families of high-level quantum RACs. Our results show that high-level quantum systems can significantly increase the advantage of quantum RACs over the classical counterparts. We demonstrate our findings in an experimental realization of a quantum RAC with four-level communication.

abstract: Inherent binary or collective interactions in ensembles of quantu emitters induce a spread in the energy and lifetime of their collective eigenstates. While this causes fast decay and dephasing, with a specifically tailored choice of laser power, frequency and a suitable configuration of control fields it is possible to prepare entangled collectiv states with optimal properties for spectroscopy, precision measurements or information storage. We demonstrate this by efficiently preparing strongly subradiant entangled states of a chain of dipole-dipole coupled spins. Frequency-selective pulsed laser excitation enables the selection of almost pure collective target states. The prepared state fidelity and its entanglement depth is improved further via spatial excitation phase engineering or tailored magnetic fields.

abstract: In recent years, the gap between theory and practice in quantum key distribution (QKD) has been significantly narrowed, particularly for QKD systems with arbitrarily awed optical receivers. The status for QKD systems with imperfect light sources is however less satisfactory, in the sense that the resulting secure key rates are often overly-dependent on the quality of state preparation. This is especially the case when the channel loss is high. Very recently, to overcome this limitation, Tamaki et al proposed a QKD protocol based on the so-called rejected data analysis, and showed that its security|in the limit of infinitely long keys|is almost independent of any encoding flaw in the qubit space, being this protocol compatible with the decoy state method. Here, as a step towards practical QKD, we show that a similar conclusion is reached in the finite-key regime, even when the intensity of the light source is unstable. More concretely, we derive security bounds for a wide class of realistic light sources and show that the bounds are also efficient in the presence of high channel loss. Our results strongly suggest the feasibility of long distance provably-secure communication with imperfect light sources.

abstract: We derive the effective low energy Hamiltonian for the tight-binding model with the hopping integral slowly varying along the chain. The effective Hamiltonian contains the kinetic energy with position dependent mass, which is inverse to the hopping integral, and effective potential energy. Changing of ordering in the kinetic energy leads to change of the effective potential energy and leaves the Hamiltonian the same one. Therefore, we can choose arbitrary von Roos ordering parameters in the kinetic energy without changing the Hamiltonian. Moreover, we propose a more general form for the kinetic energy than that of von Roos, which nevertheless together with the effective potential energy represent the same Hamiltonian.

abstract: The Ekert quantum key distribution protocol uses pairs of entangled qubits and performs checks based on a Bell inequality to detect eavesdropping. The N-DEB protocol uses instead pairs of entangled qudits to achieve better noise resistance than the Ekert protocol. It performs checks based on the Bell CGLMP inequality for qudits. In this paper, we present the generalization for qudits of our protocol h3DEB (for qutrits). This protocol also uses pairs of entangled qudits, but achieves even better noise resistance than N-DEB and is showed to be secure against the same family of cloning attacks than N-DEB. This gain of performance is obtained by using another inequality called here hCHSH-$d$. For each party, the hCHSH-$d$ inequality involves $2d$ observables. We explain how the parties can measure these observables and thus are able to check the violation of hCHSH-$d$. In the presence of noise, this violation allows the parties to ensure the secrecy of the key because it guarantees the absence of a local Trojan horse attack. The advantage of our proposed scheme is that it results in an increased resistance to noise while remaining secure against individual attacks.

The monogamy relations related to the $\alpha$th power of negativity and the Convex- Roof Extended Negativity are obtained for N-qubit states. We also give a tighter bound of hierarchical monogamy inequality for the entanglement of formation. We find that the GHZ state and W state can be used to distinguish the $\alpha$th power the concurrence for $0<\alpha<2$. Furthermore, we compare concurrence with negativity in terms of monogamy property and investigate the difference between them.

Entropic inequalities can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of experimental data and the value of mutual information, deduced from them, may charachterize correlations between different degrees of freedom in a noncomposite system.

abstract: We improve the precision of the interferometric weak-value-based beam deflection measurement by introducing a power recycling mirror, creating a resonant cavity. This results in \emph{all} the light exiting to the detector with a large deflection, thus eliminating the inefficiency of the rare postselection. The signal-to-noise ratio of the deflection is itself magnified by the weak value. We discuss ways to realize this proposal, using a transverse beam filter and different cavity designs.

However, given an unknown state, assessing its entanglement is a challenging task. To attack this problem, we investigate the use of random local measurements, from which entanglement witnesses are then constructed via semidefinite programming methods. We propose a scheme of successively increasing the number of measurements until the presence of entanglement can be unambiguously concluded, and investigate its performance in various examples.

abstract: We simulate the collective dynamics in spin lattices with long range interactions and collective decay in one, two and three dimensions. Starting from a dynamical mean-field approach derived by local factorization of the density operator we improve the numerical approximation of the full master equation by including pair correlations at any distance. This truncations enable us to drastically increase the number of spins in our numerical simulations from about ten spins in case of the full quantum model to several ten-thousands in the mean-field approximation and a few hundreds if pair correlations are included. Extensive numerical tests help us identify interaction strengths and geometric configurations where these approximations perform well and allow us to state fairly simple error estimates. By simulating systems of increasing size we show that in one and two dimensions we can include as many spins as needed to capture the properties of infinite size systems with high accuracy, while in 3D the method does not converge to desired accuracy within the system sizes we can currently implement. Our approach is well suited to give error estimates of magic wavelength optical lattices for atomic clock applications and corresponding super radiant lasers.

abstract: The estimation of high dimensional quantum states is an important statistical problem arising in current quantum technology applications. A key example is the tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state preparation in ion trap experiments \cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography becomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to investigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior information about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such models. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient estimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist in first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to an appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues below a certain "noise level" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or normalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the space dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as $r\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a lower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling is optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive simulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the number of measurement repetitions. We find that all estimators perform significantly better that the least squares, with the "physical estimator" (which is a bona fide density matrix) slightly outperforming the other estimators.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of intrinsically random processes. Contrary to classical randomness, this lack of predictability can not be attributed to ignorance or lack of control. Here we propose a method to quantify the amount of randomness that can be extracted in two scenarios: (i) the quantum steering scenario, where two parties measure a bipartite system in an unknown state but one of them does not trust his measurement apparatus, and (ii) the prepare-and-measure scenario, where additionally the quantum state is known. We use our methods to compute the maximal amount of local randomness that can be certified by measuring systems subject to noise and losses and show that randomness can be certified from a single measurement if and only if the detectors used in the test have detection efficiency higher than 50%.

A singly resonant optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operated below threshold, in combination with external filters, generates high-rate ($>2.5\cdot10^6~{\rm s}^{-1}$) narrowband photon pairs ($\sim 7$ MHz bandwidth); the signal photons are tuned to resonance with an atomic transition in Ca$^+$, while the idler photons are at telecom wavelength. Quantum interface operation is demonstrated through high-rate absorption of single photons by a single trapped ion ($\sim 670~{\rm s}^{-1}$), heralded by coincident telecom photons.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality stands as a resource for Device Independent Quantum Information Processing (DIQIP), as, for instance, Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution. We investigate experimentally the assumption of limited Measurement Dependence, i.e., that the measurement settings used in Bell inequality tests or DIQIP are partially influenced by the source of entangled particle and/or by an adversary. Using a recently derived Bell-like inequality [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 190402] and a 99% fidelity source of partially entangled polarization photonic qubits, we obtain a clear violation of the inequality, excluding a much larger range of measurement dependent local models than would be possible with an adapted Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality. It is therefore shown that the Measurement Independence assumption can be widely relaxed while still demonstrating quantum nonlocality.

The mobility edge in the model we consider results in a many body energy regime where the non-interacting many body extended states coexist with the partially localized many body states. We show that in the presence of interactions the states in this mixed regime are non-ergodic in nature, giving rise to an energy dependent violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also propose a practical scheme to engineer mobility edges in atomic optical lattice experiments to detect signatures of our proposed energy-dependent MBL phase.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the quantum oscillator-like states recently observed experimentally in polariton condensates (Nat. Phys. 8, 190 (2012)). We consider a complex Gross-Pitaevskii type model which includes the effects of self-interactions, and creation and decay of exciton-polaritons. We develop a perturbation theory for approximate solutions to this non-equilibrium condensate model and compare the results with numerically calculated solutions for both repulsive and attractive polariton-polariton interactions. While the nonlinearity has a weak effect on the mode selection their density profiles are modified at moderate gain strengths and becomes more dominant when a very large gain of polaritons implies an extended cloud with high condensate densities. Finally, we identify the relation of the observed patterns to the input pump configuration, and suggest this may serve as a generalized NOR gate in the tradition of optical computing.

abstract: We introduce a scheme that combines photon-assisted tunneling by a moving optical lattice with strong Hubbard interactions, and allows for the quantum simulation of paradigmatic quantum many-body models. We show that, in a certain regime, this quantum simulator yields an effective Hubbard Hamiltonian with tunable bond-charge interactions, a model studied in the context of strongly-correlated electrons. In a different regime, we show how to exploit a correlated destruction of tunneling to explore Nagaoka ferromagnetism at finite Hubbard repulsion. By changing the photon-assisted tunneling parameters, we can also obtain a $t$-$J$ model with independently controllable tunneling $t$, super-exchange interaction $J$, and even a Heisenberg-Ising anisotropy. Hence, the full phase diagram of this paradigmatic model becomes accessible to cold-atom experiments, departing from the region $t\gg J$ allowed by standard single-band Hubbard Hamiltonians in the strong-repulsion limit. We finally show that, by generalizing the photon-assisted tunneling scheme, the quantum simulator yields models of dynamical Gauge fields, where atoms of a given electronic state dress the tunneling of the atoms with a different internal state, leading to Peierls phases that mimic a dynamical magnetic field.

abstract: We argue that an infinite circumference limit can be obtained in 2-dimensional conformal field theory by adopting $L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2$ as a Hamiltonian instead of $L_0$. The theory obtained has a circumference of infinite length and hence exhibits a continuous and heavily degenerated spectrum as well as the continuous Virasoro algebra. The choice of this Hamiltonian was inspired partly by the so-called sine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of quantum statistical systems. The enigmatic behavior of sine-square deformed systems such as the sharing of their vacuum states with the closed boundary systems can be understood by the appearance of an infinite circumference.

abstract: The local convertibility of quantum states, measured by the R\'enyi entropy, is concerned with whether or not a state can be transformed into another state, using only local operations and classical communications. We found that in the one-dimensional Kitaev chain with quenched chemical potential $\mu$, the convertibility between the state for $\mu$ and that for $\mu+\delta\mu$, depends on the quantum phases of the system ($\delta\mu$ is a perturbation). This is similar to the adiabatic case where the ground state is considered. Specifically, when the quenched system has edge modes and the subsystem size for the partition is much larger than the correlation length of the Majorana fermions which forms the edge modes, the quenched state is locally inconvertible. We give a physical interpretation for the result, based on analyzing the interactions between the two subsystems for various partitions. Our work should help to better understand the many-body phenomena in topological systems and also the entanglement properties in the Majorana fermionic quantum computation.

abstract: We describe a method for simulating the real time evolution of extended quantum systems in two dimensions. The method combines the benefits of integrability and matrix product states in one dimension to avoid several issues that hinder other applications of tensor based methods in 2D. In particular it can be extended to infinitely long cylinders. As an example application we present results for quantum quenches in the 2D quantum (2+1 dimensional) Ising model. In quenches that cross a phase boundary we find that the return probability shows non-analyticities in time.

abstract: We analyze the energetic and dynamical properties of bright-bright (BB) soliton pairs in a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates subjected to the action of a combined optical lattice, acting as an external potential for the first species, while modulating the intraspecies coupling constant of the second. In particular, we use a variational approach and direct numerical integrations to investigate the existence and stability of BB solitons in which the two species are either spatially separated (split soliton) or located at the same optical lattice site (overlapped soliton). The dependence of these solitons on the interspecies interaction parameter is explicitly investigated. For repulsive interspecies interaction we show the existence of a series of critical values at which transitions from an initially overlapped soliton to split solitons occur. For attractive interspecies interaction only single direct transitions from split to overlapped BB solitons are found. The possibility to use split solitons for indirect measurements of scattering lengths is also suggested.

The phase of permutation is not a representation but the word metric of the permutation group . Amazingly the interchange phase yields a finite capacity of one quantum state interpolating between Fermion and Boson and the mutual exchange phase has no explicit effect on statistics. Finite capacity of quantum state is defined as Gentile statistics and it is different from the fractional exclusion statistics. Some discussion on the general model is also given.

abstract: We measure the angular dependence of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two individual Rydberg atoms with controlled relative positions. By applying a combination of static electric and magnetic fields on the atoms, we demonstrate the possibility to isolate a single interaction channel at a F\"orster resonance, that shows a well-defined angular dependence. We first identify spectroscopically the F\"orster resonance of choice and we then perform a direct measurement of the interaction strength between the two atoms as a function of the angle between the internuclear axis and the quantization axis. Our results show good agreement with the expected angular dependence $\propto(1-3\cos^2\theta)$, and represent an important step towards quantum state engineering in two-dimensional arrays of individual Rydberg atoms.

abstract: In the present work, we investigate the intrinsic relation between quantum fidelity susceptibility (QFS) and the dynamical structure factor. We give a concise proof of the QFS beyond the perturbation theory. With the QFS in the Lehmann representation, we point out that the QFS actually the negative-two-power moment of dynamical structure factor, and illuminate the inherent relation between physical quantities in the linear response theory. Moreover, we discuss the generalized fidelity susceptibility (GFS) of any quantum relevant operator, that may not be coupled to the driving parameter, present similar scaling behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that the QFS can not capture the fourth-order quantum phase transition in a spin-1/2 anisotropic XY chain in the transverse alternating field, while a lower-order GFS can seize the criticalities.

This scheme is useful to characterize the space of the unitary evolution operators that describe the dynamics of the microstates of extremal black holes in four spacetime dimensions. Using techniques from algebraic number theory to evaluate the transition amplitudes, we remark that the regularization scheme expresses the fast quantum computation capability of black holes as well as its chaotic nature.

abstract: The numerical extraction of resonant states of open quantum systems is usually a difficult problem. Regularization techniques, such as the mapping to complex coordinates or the addition of Complex Absorbing Potentials are typically employed, as they render resonant wavefunctions localized and therefore normalizable. Physically relevant metastable states have energies that do not depend on the chosen regularization method. Their identification therefore involves cumbersome comparisons between multiple regularised calculations, often performed graphically, which require fine-tuning and specific intuition to avoid approximated, if not wrong, results. In this Letter, we define an operator that explicitly measures such invariance, valid for any arbitrary mapping of spatial coordinates. Resonant states of the system can eventually simply be identified evaluating the expectation value of this operator. Our method eases the extraction of resonant states even for numerical potentials that are difficult to scale to complex coordinates, and avoids the need for ad hoc complex absorbing potentials. We provide explicit evidence of our findings discussing one-dimensional case-studies,also in the presence of external electric fields.

abstract: We consider the time-dependent bi-coherent states that are essentially the Gazeau-Klauder coherent states for the two dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator. Starting from some q-deformations of the oscillator algebra for which the entire deformed Fock space can be constructed explicitly, we define the q-deformed bi-coherent states. We verify the generalized Heisenberg's uncertainty relations projected onto these states. For the initial value in time, the states are shown to satisfy a generalized version of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations. For the initial value in time and for the parameter of noncommutativity $\theta =0$, the inequalities are saturated for the simultaneous measurement of the position-momentum observables. When the time evolves the uncertainty products are different from their values at the initial time and do not always respect the generalized uncertainty relations.

abstract: We investigate the propagation of microwave photons in a one-dimensional waveguide interacting with a number of artificial atoms (qubits). Within the formalism of projection operators and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach we develop a one-photon approximation scheme for the calculation of the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal in a waveguide which contains an arbitrary number \emph{N} of non-interacting qubits. It is shown that for identical qubits in the long-wave limit a coherent superradiance state is formed with the width being equal to the sum of the widths of spontaneous transitions of \emph{N} individual qubits.

Together with similar correspondence between the Calogero-oscillator and oscillator models, this observation permits to claim that most of properties of Coulomb and oscillator systems can be lifted to their Calogero-extended analogs by the proper replacement of momenta by Dunkl momenta operators.

abstract: We review recent progress on constructing non-equilibrium steady state density operators of boundary driven locally interacting quantum chains, where driving is implemented via Markovian dissipation channels attached to the chain's ends. We discuss explicit solutions in three different classes of quantum chains, specifically, the paradigmatic (anisotropic) Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain, the Fermi-Hubbard chain, and the Lai-Sutherland spin-1 chain, and discuss universal concepts which characterize these solutions, such as matrix product ansatz and a more structured walking graph state ansatz. The central theme is the connection between the matrix product form of nonequilibrium states and the integrability structures of the bulk Hamiltonian, such as the Lax operators and the Yang-Baxter equation. However, there is a remarkable distinction with respect to the conventional quantum inverse scattering method, namely addressing nonequilibrium steady state density operators requires non-unitary irreducible representations of Yang-Baxter algebra which are typically of infinite dimensionality. Such constructions result in non-Hermitian, and often also non-diagonalisable families of commuting transfer operators which in turn result in novel conservation laws of the integrable bulk Hamiltonians. For example, in the case of anisotropic Heisenberg model, quasi-local conserved operators which are odd under spin reversal (or spin flip) can be constructed, whereas the conserved operators stemming from orthodox Hermitian transfer operators (via logarithmic differentiation) are all even under spin reversal.

abstract: Rare earth ions in crystals exhibit narrow spectral features and hyperfine-split ground states with exceptionally long coherence times. These features make them ideal platforms for quantum information processing in the solid state. Recently, we reported on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of single Pr$^{3+}$ ions in yttrium orthosilicate (YSO) nanocrystals. While in that work we examined the less explored $^3$H$_4$-$^3$P$_0$ transition at a wavelength of 488 nm, here we extend our investigations to the $^3$H$_4$-$^1$D$_2$ transition at 606 nm. In addition, we present measurements of the second-order autocorrelation function, fluorescence lifetime, and emission spectra of single ions as well as their polarization dependencies on both transitions; these data were not within the reach of the first experiments reported earlier. Furthermore, we show that by a proper choice of the crystallite, one can obtain narrower spectral lines and, thus, resolve the hyperfine levels of the excited state. We expect our results to make single-ion spectroscopy accessible to a larger scientific community.

abstract: We present Floquet-Keldysh non-equilibrium dynamical mean field calculations (DMFT) with an iterative perturbative solver (IPT) for high pump-power induced Stark states yielding a closing gap within semiconductor bulk and nano-cavities. Our model predicts unusual broadening of bands in systems like ZnO random lasers. This can be explained as an exciton-polariton coupling within the single crystalline pillar meeting the Mie resonance condition. Extraordinary enhancement of the lifetime of electronic states within the gap can lead to stable lasing modes and gain narrowing.

abstract: Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (i.e., non-Hermitian) quantum system: it requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localisation, and dynamical properties. Using a spatially-structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies -- exceptional points. These are known to cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption, and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the nontrivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe the mode switching and topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which can lead to novel functionalities of polariton-based devices.

abstract: We consider interacting fermions in a magnetic field on a two-dimensional lattice with the periodic boundary conditions. In order to measure the Hall current, we apply an electric potential with a compact support. Then, due to the Lorentz force, the Hall current appears along the equipotential line. Introducing a local current operator at the edge of the potential, we derive the Hall conductance as a linear response coefficient. For a wide class of the models, we prove that if there exists a spectral gap above the degenerate ground state, then the Hall conductance of the ground state is fractionally quantized without averaging over the fluxes. This is an extension of the topological argument for the integrally quantized Hall conductance in noninteracting fermion systems on lattices.

abstract: We present a calculation of the Casimir torque acting on a liquid crystal near a birefringent crystal. In this system, a liquid crystal bulk is uniformly aligned at one surface and is twisted at the other surface by a birefringent crystal, e.g. barium titanate. The liquid crystal is separated from the solid crystal by an isotropic, transparent material such as SiO$_2$. By varying the thickness of the deposited layer, we can observe the effect of retardation on the torque (which differentiates it from the close-range van der Waals torque). We find that a barium titanate slab would cause 5CB (4-cyano-4$'$-pentylbiphenyl) liquid crystal to rotate by 10$^\circ$ through its bulk when separated by 35 nm of SiO$_2$. The optical technique for measuring this twist is also outlined.

abstract: Entanglement in random states has turned into a useful approach to quantum thermalization and black hole physics. In this article, we refine and extend the `random unitaries framework' to quantum field theories (QFT), and to include conserved charges. We show that in QFT, the connection between typical states, reduced subsystems and thermal dynamics is more transparent within the Fock basis. We provide generic formulae for the typical reduced density matrices and entanglement entropies of any given subset of particles. To illustrate our methods, we apply the generic framework to the simplest but non trivial cases, a massless scalar field in two dimensions and its generalization to the case of N scalar fields, including the large N limit. We find the effective temperature, by matching the reduced dynamics to a Gibbs ensemble, and derive the equation of state of the QFT. The deviations from perfect thermality are shown to be of order 1/S instead of exp(-S), a result which might be relevant for black hole physics. Finally we describe the analogue of the so-called `Page curve' in the QFT scenario as a function of the energy scale which divides high from low energy degrees of freedom.

abstract: We propose a totally corrective boosting algorithm with explicit cardinality regularization. The resulting combinatorial optimization problems are not known to be efficiently solvable with existing classical methods, but emerging quantum optimization technology gives hope for achieving sparser models in practice. In order to demonstrate the utility of our algorithm, we use a distributed classical heuristic optimizer as a stand-in for quantum hardware. Even though this evaluation methodology incurs large time and resource costs on classical computing machinery, it allows us to gauge the potential gains in generalization performance and sparsity of the resulting boosted ensembles. Our experimental results on public data sets commonly used for benchmarking of boosting algorithms decidedly demonstrate the existence of such advantages. If actual quantum optimization were to be used with this algorithm in the future, we would expect equivalent or superior results at much smaller time and energy costs during training. Moreover, studying cardinality-penalized boosting also sheds light on why unregularized boosting algorithms with early stopping often yield better results than their counterparts with explicit convex regularization: Early stopping performs suboptimal cardinality regularization. The results that we present here indicate it is beneficial to explicitly solve the combinatorial problem still left open at early termination.

abstract: We propose a trapped ion scheme en route to realize spin Hamiltonians on a Kagome lattice which, at low energies, are described by emergent Z2 gauge fields, and support a topological quantum spin liquid ground state. The enabling element in our scheme is the hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions in a 2D ion crystal. For this, the phonon-mode spectrum of the crystal is engineered by standing-wave optical potentials or by using Rydberg excited ions, thus generating localized phonon-modes around a hexagon of ions selected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can mediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when subject to state-dependent optical dipole forces. We discuss how these interactions can be employed to emulate a generalized Balents-Fisher-Girvin model in minimal instances of one and two plaquettes. This model is an archetypical Hamiltonian in which gauge fields are the emergent degrees of freedom on top of the classical ground state manifold. Under realistic situations, we show the emergence of a discrete Gauss's law as well as the dynamics of a deconfined charge excitation on a gauge-invariant background using the two-plaquettes trapped ions spin-system. The proposed scheme in principle allows further scaling in a future trapped ion quantum simulator, and we conclude that our work will pave the way towards the simulation of emergent gauge theories and quantum spin liquids in trapped ion systems.

abstract: In a multi-terminal setup, when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic field, the heat flows can be managed by designing a device with programmable Boolean behavior. We show that such device can be used to implement operations like on/off switching, reversal, selected splitting and swap of the heat currents. For each feature, the switching from one working condition to the other is obtained by inverting the magnetic field. This offers interesting opportunities of conceiving a programmable setup, whose operation is controlled by an external parameter (the magnetic field) without need to alter voltage and thermal biases applied to the system. Our results, generic within the framework of linear response, are illustrated by means of a three-terminal electronic interferometer model.

abstract: We study the fluctuation-electromagnetic interaction and dynamics of a small polarizable particle with own rotation and relativistic velocity moving in a vacuum background of arbitrary temperature. A full set of equations describing decelerating tangential force, frictional torque (at arbitrary direction of angular velocity) and intensity of nonthermal and thermal radiation is obtained, along with equations describing the particle dynamics and kinetics of heating. An interplay between different parameters is discussed. Numerical calculations are given in the case of graphite particles.

abstract: We consider a disordered quantum metamaterial formed by an array of superconducting flux qubits coupled to microwave photons in a cavity. We map the system on the Tavis-Cummings model accounting for the disorder in frequencies of the qubits. The complex transmittance is calculated with the parameters taken from state-of-the-art experiments. We demonstrate that photon phase shift measurements allow to distinguish individual resonances in the metamaterial with up to 100 qubits, in spite of the decoherence spectral width being remarkably larger than the effective coupling constant. Our simulations are in agreement with the results of the recently reported experiment.

abstract: In this letter we report the first direct observation of gap-less Majorana QPs which appear as Andreev bound states on the surface of superfluid $^3$He-B. We made the precise measurements of superfluid 3He-B heat capacity at the limit of extremely low temperatures. We have separated the heat capacity of bulk Bogolyubov QPs and the surface Majorana QPs by its different temperature dependence. We have found that at 0.11 mK the Majorana fermions constitute half of the bolometer heat capacity under the conditions of our experiments.

abstract: We introduce an exactly solvable model of interacting Majorana fermions realizing $Z_2$ topological order with a $Z_2$ fermion parity grading and lattice symmetries permuting the three fundamental anyon types. We propose a concrete physical realization by utilizing quantum phase slips in an array of phase-locked $s$-wave superconducting islands on a topological insulator surface. Our model finds a natural application as a Majorana fermion surface code for universal quantum computation, with a single-step stabilizer measurement requiring no physical ancilla qubits, increased error tolerance, and simpler logical gates than a surface code with bosonic physical qubits. We thoroughly discuss protocols for stabilizer measurements, encoding and manipulating logical qubits, and gate implementations.

The wave functions have been expressed by hypergeometric functions via the functional analysis approach. An extension to rotational-vibrational energy eigenvalues of some diatomic molecules are also presented. It is shown that the calculated energy levels are in good agreement with the ones obtained previously $E_{n\ell}-D$ (shifted Deng-Fan).

abstract: We outline a general method of constructing finite-range cloaking potentials which render a given finite-range real or complex potential $v(x)$ unidirectionally reflectionless or invisible at a wavenumber $k_0$ of our choice. We give explicit analytic expressions for three classes of cloaking potentials which achieve this goal while preserving some or all of the other scattering properties of $v(x)$. The cloaking potentials we construct are the sum of up to three constituent unidirectionally invisible potentials. We also discuss their application in making $v(x)$ bidirectionally invisible at $k_0$, and demonstrate the application of our method to obtain anti-reflection and invisibility cloaks for a Bragg reflector.

abstract: The three-dimensional potential equation, motivated by representations of quantum mechanics, is investigated in four different scenarios: (i) In the usual Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}_{3}$ where the potential is singular but invariant under the continuous inhomogeneous orthogonal group $\mathcal{I}O(3)$. The invariance under the translation subgroup is compared to the corresponding unitary transformation in the Schr\"{o}dinger representation of quantum mechanics. This scenario is well known but serves as a reference point for the other scenarios. (ii) Next, the discrete potential equation as a partial difference equation in a three-dimensional lattice space is studied. In this arena the potential is non-singular but invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$ is broken. This is the usual picture of lattice theories and numerical approximations. (iii) Next we study the six-dimensional continuous phase space. Here a phase space representation of quantum mechanics is utilized. The resulting potential is singular but possesses invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$. (iv) Finally, the potential is derived from the discrete phase space representation of quantum mechanics, which is shown to be an \emph{exact} representation of quantum mechanics. The potential function here is both non-singular and possesses invariance under $\mathcal{I}O(3)$, and this is proved via the unitary transformations of quantum mechanics in this representation.

abstract: We investigate the transport of excitations through a chain of atoms with non-local dissipation introduced through coupling to additional short-lived states. The system is described by an effective spin-1/2 model where the ratio of the exchange interaction strength to the reservoir coupling strength determines the type of transport, including coherent exciton motion, incoherent hopping and a regime in which an emergent length scale leads to a preferred hopping distance far beyond nearest neighbors. For multiple impurities, the dissipation gives rise to strong nearest-neighbor correlations and entanglement. These results highlight the importance of non-trivial dissipation, correlations and many-body effects in recent experiments on the dipole-mediated transport of Rydberg excitations.

abstract: A seminal result of Cleve (STOC 1986) showed that fairness, in general, is impossible to achieve in case of two-party computation if one of them is malicious. Ben-Or et al. and Chaum et al. (STOC 1988) showed that absolute correctness can be achieved in case of multiparty computation when one third players are faulty. However, they analyzed the problem in broadcasting channel model. In non-simultaneous channel model, Gordon et al. (STOC 2008) observed that there exist some functions for which fairness can be achieved even though one of the two parties is malicious. One of the functions considered by Gordon et al. is exactly the millionaires' problem (Yao, FOCS 1982) or, equivalently, the `greater than' function. The problem deals with two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who are interested in finding who amongst them is richer, without revealing their actual wealth to each other. We, for the first time, study this problem in presence of rational players. In particular, we show that Gordon's protocol no longer remains fair when the players are rational. Next, we design a protocol with rational players, that not only achieves fairness, but also achieves correctness and strict Nash equilibrium for natural utilities. Gordon et al. (JACM, 2011) showed that any function over polynomial-size domains which does not contain an "embedded XOR" can be converted into the greater than function. Thus, the proposed protocol is applicable for any function except embedded XOR. We, also for the first time, provide a solution to the quantum version of millionaires' problem with rational players, that achieves fairness, correctness and strict Nash equilibrium. Both our classical and quantum protocols follow a unified approach; both use a rational third party and get rid of the requirement of the online dealer of Groce et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012).

abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum dot coupled to fermionic and bosonic environments, naturally occurring in electrical circuits. The fermionic environments consist of two electronic reservoir leads and the bosonic baths are either external impedances modeled as tunable transmission lines or LC resonators (single-mode cavities). The differing sizes of the zero-point fluctuations of the quantum vacuum break the spatial symmetry of the system if the quantum dot is coupled to two reservoirs or two junctions with different bosonic environments. We show how this permits the rectification of the electrical current in both non-resonant and resonant tunneling cases.

Numerical results regarding the asymptotic behavior of the localization are also presented.

abstract: We study the role of quantum statistics in the performance of Otto cycles. First, we show analytically that the work distributions for bosonic and fermionic working fluids are identical for cycles driven by harmonic trapping potentials. Subsequently, in the case of non-harmonic potentials, we find that the interplay between different energy level spacings and particle statistics strongly affects the performances of the engine cycle. To demonstrate this, we examine three trapping potentials which induce different (single particle) energy level spacings: monotonically decreasing with the level number, monotonically increasing, and the case in which the level spacing does not vary monotonically.

abstract: We show the presence of universal features in the entanglement entropy of regularized boundary states for (1+1)-d conformal field theories on a circle when the reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing over right/left-moving modes. We derive a general formula for the left-right entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge and the modular S matrix of the theory. When the state is chosen to be an Ishibashi state, this measure of entanglement is shown to reproduce the spatial entanglement entropy of a (2+1)-d topological quantum field theory. We explicitly evaluate the left-right entanglement entropies for the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model and the su(2)_k WZW model as examples.

First we illustrate the intimate connection between Z_3-symmetric "spin" chains and one-dimensional parafermion lattice models, highlighting how the latter host a topological phase featuring protected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory realization of parafermion zero modes -- focusing on quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional topological insulators -- and describe striking experimental fingerprints that they provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum Hall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware for a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer.

abstract: Entanglement is an essential property of quantum many-body systems. However, its local detection is challenging and was so far limited to spin degrees of freedom in ion chains. Here we measure entanglement between the spins of atoms located on two lattice sites in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain which features both local spin- and particle-number fluctuations. Starting with an initially localized spin impurity, we observe an outwards propagating entanglement wave and show quantitatively how entanglement in the spin sector rapidly decreases with increasing particle-number fluctuations in the chain.

In order to demonstrate quantum light-matter interaction, we establish coupling of quantum dots to our tunable NFBC and achieve an emission enhancement by a factor of 2.7.

abstract: We evaluate the entanglement entropy of exactly solvable Hamiltonians corresponding to general families of three-dimensional topological models. We show that the modification to the entropic area law due to three-dimensional topological properties is richer than the two-dimensional case. In addition to the reduction of the entropy caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of contractible loop operators a new topological invariant appears that increases the entropy if the model consists of non-trivially braiding anyons. As a result the three-dimensional topological entanglement entropy provides only partial information about the two entropic topological invariants.

abstract: Ultracold atoms confined by engineered magnetic or optical potentials are ideal systems for studying phenomena otherwise difficult to realize or probe in the solid state because their atomic interaction strength, number of species, density, and geometry can be independently controlled. This review focuses on quantum transport phenomena in atomic gases that mirror and oftentimes either better elucidate or show fundamental differences with those observed in mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems. We discuss significant progress in performing transport experiments in atomic gases, contrast similarities and differences between transport in cold atoms and in condensed matter systems, and survey inspiring theoretical predictions that are difficult to verify in conventional setups. These results further demonstrate the versatility offered by atomic systems in the study of nonequilibrium phenomena and their promise for novel applications.

abstract: A two dimensional electron gas on a cylindrical surface with a screw dislocation is considered. More precisely, we investigate how both the geometry and the deformed potential due to a lattice distortion affect the Landau levels of such system. The case showing the deformed potential can be thought in the context of 3D common semiconductors where the electrons are confined on a cylindrical shell. We will show that important quantitative differences exist due to this lattice distortion. For instance, the effective cyclotron frequency is diminished by the deformed potential, which in turn enhances the Hall conductivity.

abstract: We review our recent works on the dynamical localization in the quantum kicked rotator (QKR) and the related properties of the classical kicked rotator (the standard map, SM). We introduce the Izrailev $N$-dimensional model of the QKR and analyze the localization properties of the Floquet eigenstates [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 87}, 062905 (2013)], and the statistical properties of the quasienergy spectra. We survey normal and anomalous diffusion in the SM, and the related accelerator modes [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 89}, 022905 (2014)]. We analyze the statistical properties [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 91},042904 (2015)] of the localization measure, and show that the reciprocal localization length has an almost Gaussian distribution which has a finite variance even in the limit of the infinitely dimensional model of the QKR, $N\rightarrow \infty$. This sheds new light on the relation between the QKR and the Anderson localization phenomenon in the one-dimensional tight-binding model. It explains the so far mysterious strong fluctuations in the scaling properties of the QKR. The reason is that the finite bandwidth approximation of the underlying Hamilton dynamical system in the Shepelyansky picture [{\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 56}, 677 (1986)] does not apply rigorously. These results call for a more refined theory of the localization length in the QKR and in similar Floquet systems, where we must predict not only the mean value of the inverse of the localization length but also its (Gaussian) distribution. We also numerically analyze the related behavior of finite time Lyapunov exponents in the SM and of the $2\times2$ transfer matrix formalism.

abstract: Constructing a universal operation scheme for Majorana qubits remains a central issue for the topological quantum computation. We study the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference in a Majorana qubit and show that this interference can be used to achieve controllable operations. The Majorana qubit consists of an rf SQUID with a topological nanowire Josephson junction which hosts Majorana bound states. In the SQUID, a magnetic flux pulse can drive the quantum evolution of the Majorana qubit. The qubit experiences two Landau-Zener transitions when the amplitude of the pulse is tuned around the superconducting flux quanta $2e/\hbar$. The Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference between the two transitions rotates the Majorana qubit, with the angle controlled by the time scale of the pulse. This rotation operation implements a high-speed single-qubit gate on the Majorana qubit, which is a necessary ingredient for the topological quantum computation.

abstract: For the first time, we have observed the annihilation of multiple eigenstates of the parent potentials and redistribution of the energy in the deformed potentials in the system with spontaneously breaking of parity-time symmetry while preserving the SUSY of the system. We have observed that the deformation of the potentials is sensitive to initial conditions. This first experimental observation enables the localization of eigenspectra in lateral space (so-called time) and the localization of eigenstates in longitudinal space in the deformed potentials by experimentally applying the SUSY higher-order transformations on tilted and disordered parent potentials, respectively. The former shows a decrease in the slope of the profile of eigenspectrum (bands) due to the localization in lateral space, while the latter shows an increase in the slope due to localization in longitudinal space. This allows the formation of deterministic bandgaps and Bloch waves while retaining the SUSY. In this configuration, the phase transition emerges naturally in the SUSY deformed potentials, which are revealed as the quantum Zeno effect and a peculiar Anderson localization, respectively. The Anderson localization shows the features of effective amplification and quantum Anti-Zeno effect. The experimental results are in full agreement with the theory of SUSY deformed potentials of higher-order transformations. Besides enhancing the understanding of nature, our results can also provide an experimental platform to originate new classes of effective and synthetic materials, and are also significantly important for unifying the interaction dynamics of condensed matter and photonic systems, and the implementation of universal quantum computation.

abstract: Bell's theorem sets a boundary between the classical and quantum realms, by providing a strict proof of the existence of entangled quantum states with no classical counterpart. An experimental violation of Bell's inequality demands simultaneously high fidelities in the preparation, manipulation and measurement of multipartite quantum entangled states. For this reason the Bell signal has been tagged as a single-number benchmark for the performance of quantum computing devices. Here we demonstrate deterministic, on-demand generation of two-qubit entangled states of the electron and the nuclear spin of a single phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. By sequentially reading the electron and the nucleus, we show that these entangled states violate the Bell/CHSH inequality with a Bell signal of 2.50(10). An even higher value of 2.70(9) is obtained by mapping the parity of the two-qubit state onto the nuclear spin, which allows for high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurement (QND) of the parity. Furthermore, we complement the Bell inequality entanglement witness with full two-qubit state tomography exploiting QND measurement, which reveals that our prepared states match the target maximally entangled Bell states with $>$96\% fidelity. These experiments demonstrate complete control of the two-qubit Hilbert space of a phosphorus atom, and show that this system is able to maintain its simultaneously high initialization, manipulation and measurement fidelities past the single-qubit regime.

abstract: We demonstrate an efficient high-precision optical spectroscopy technique for single trapped ions with non-closed transitions. In a double-shelving technique, the absorption of a single photon is first amplified to several phonons of a normal motional mode shared with a co-trapped cooling ion of a different species, before being further amplified to thousands of fluorescence photons emitted by the cooling ion using the standard electron shelving technique. We employ this extension of the photon recoil spectroscopy technique to perform the first high precision absolute frequency measurement of the $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{2}$P$_{1/2}$ transition in $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$, resulting in a transition frequency of $f=346\, 000\, 234\, 867(96)$ kHz. Furthermore, we determine the isotope shift of this transition and the $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{2}$P$_{1/2}$ transition for $^{42}$Ca$^{+}$, $^{44}$Ca$^{+}$ and $^{48}$Ca$^{+}$ ions relative to $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ with an accuracy below 100 kHz. Improved field and mass shift constants of these transitions as well as changes in mean square nuclear charge radii are extracted from this high resolution data.

The trial run is the quantization of the free radiation field that will be addressed by following a strategy that is free from operators or quantum-mechanical concepts

abstract: We construct minimax optimal non-asymptotic confidence sets for low rank matrix recovery algorithms such as the Matrix Lasso or Dantzig selector. These are employed to devise adaptive sequential sampling procedures that guarantee recovery of the true matrix in Frobenius norm after a data-driven stopping time $\hat n$ for the number of measurements that have to be taken. With high probability, this stopping time is minimax optimal. We detail applications to quantum tomography problems where measurements arise from Pauli observables. We also give a theoretical construction of a confidence set for the density matrix of a quantum state that has optimal diameter in nuclear norm. The non-asymptotic properties of our confidence sets are further investigated in a simulation study.

abstract: We present a new type of transmon split-junction qubit which can be tuned by Meissner screening currents in the adjacent superconducting film electrodes. The best detected relaxation time ($T_1$) was of the order of 50 $\mu$s and the dephasing time ($T_2$) about 40 $\mu$s. The achieved period of oscillation with magnetic field was much smaller than in usual SQUID-based transmon qubits, thus a strong effective field amplification has been realized. This Meissner qubit allows an efficient coupling to superconducting vortices. We present a quantitative analysis of the radiation-free energy relaxation in qubits coupled to Abrikosov vortices. The observation of coherent quantum oscillations provides strong evidence that vortices can exist in coherent quantum superpositions of different position states. According to our suggested model, the wave function collapse is defined by Caldeira-Leggett dissipation associated with viscous motion of the vortex cores.

abstract: Using an optical interferomertric method, the homogeneous cavitation density of superfluid helium at $T=0.96\,$K is measured and found to be $\rho_{cav}=0.1338\pm0.0002\rm\,g.cm^{-3}$. A well established equation of state for liquid helium at negative pressures converts this to the cavitation pressure $P_{cav}=-5.1\pm0.1\,$bar. This cavitation pressure is consistent with a model taking into account the presence of quantized vortices, but disagrees with previously published experimental values of $P_{cav}$.

abstract: Many-body interactions govern a variety of important quantum phenomena ranging from superconductivity and magnetism in condensed matter to solvent effects in chemistry. Understanding those interactions beyond mean field is a holy grail of modern sciences. AMO physics with advanced laser technologies has recently emerged as a new platform to study quantum many-body systems. One of its latest developments is the study of long-range interactions among ultracold particles to reveal the effects of many-body correlations. Rydberg atoms distinguish themselves by their large dipole moments and tunability of dipolar interactions. Most of ultracold Rydberg experiments have been performed with narrow-band lasers in the Rydberg blockade regime. Here we demonstrate an ultracold Rydberg gas in a complementary regime, where electronic coherence is created using a broadband picosecond laser pulse, thus circumventing the Rydberg blockade to induce strong many-body correlations. The effects of long-range Rydberg interactions have been investigated by time-domain Ramsey interferometry with attosecond precision. This approach allows for the real-time observation of coherent and ultrafast many-body dynamics in which the electronic coherence is modulated by the interaction-induced correlations. The modulation evolves more rapidly than expected for two-body correlations by several orders of magnitude. We have actively controlled such ultrafast many-body dynamics by tuning the principal quantum number and the population of the Rydberg state. The observed Ramsey interferograms are well reproduced by a theoretical model beyond mean-field approximation, which can be relevant to other similar many-body phenomena in condensed matter physics and chemistry. Our new approach opens a new avenue to observe and manipulate nonequilibrium dynamics of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on the ultrafast timescale.

abstract: Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life. Many branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For example, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication channel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum information theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where chemical reaction equations such as \[ \mathrm{2H_2 + O_2} \to \mathrm{2H_2O} \] are concerned both with a convertibility relation "$\to$" and a combination operation "$+$". We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and functional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should have applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of conversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are also of purely mathematical interest, we exemplify our results with the ordered commutative monoid of graphs. While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's constructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a theorem of Lieb and Yngvason on thermodynamics. Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can be developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e. in which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation. For example, notions like cancellativity or torsion-freeness are still sensible and very natural concepts in our ordered setting.

abstract: Recent innovations in fabricating nanoscale confined spin systems have enabled investigation of fundamental quantum correlations between single quanta of photons and matter states. Realization of quantum state transfer from photon polarization to electron spin using gate defined quantum dots (QDs) may give evidence of preserved coherence of angular momentum basis states at the photon-spin interface. The interface would enlarge the concept of quantum information technology, in which single photogenerated electron spins are manipulated with the dots, but this remains a serious challenge. Here, we report the detection of single electron spins generated by polarized single photons via a double QD (DQD) to verify the angular momentum transfer from single photons to single electrons. Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is used to project the photoelectron spin state onto the up or down spin state. Our result promises the realization of coherent quantum state transfer and development of hybrid photon and spin quantum technology.

abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, until now, have been characterized by a real, parity-symmetric, kinetic Hamiltonian and a non-Hermitian, balanced gain-loss potential. We present a new class of discrete models in which the tunneling Hamiltonian is not parity-symmetric, and yet the models have a nonzero $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking threshold in presence of a pair of gain-loss impurities $\pm i\gamma$ located at reflection-symmetric sites. We uncover a hidden symmetry that is instrumental to the finite threshold strength. We show that such models have topological edge-states that remain robust in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase. Our predictions substantially broaden possible realizations of a $\mathcal{PT}$ system, particularly in optical waveguide arrays or coupled microstructures, by eliminating the parity-symmetry constraint.

abstract: We show that the Siegel upper half space $\Sigma_{d}$ is identified with the Marsden-Weinstein quotient obtained by symplectic reduction of the cotangent bundle $T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{2d^{2}}$ with $\mathsf{O}(2d)$-symmetry. The reduced symplectic form on $\Sigma_{d}$ corresponding to the standard symplectic form on $T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{2d^{2}}$ turns out to be a constant multiple of the symplectic form on $\Sigma_{d}$ obtained by Siegel. Our motivation is to understand the geometry behind two different formulations of the Gaussian wave packet dynamics commonly used in semiclassical mechanics. Specifically, we show that the two formulations are related via the symplectic reduction.

abstract: Exotic topologically protected zero modes with parafermionic statistics (also called fractionalized Majorana modes) have been proposed to emerge in devices fabricated from a fractional quantum Hall system and a superconductor. The fractionalized statistics of these modes takes them an important step beyond the simplest non-Abelian anyons, Majorana fermions. Building on recent advances towards the realization of fractional quantum Hall states of bosonic ultracold atoms, we propose a realization of parafermions in a system consisting of Bose-Einstein-condensate trenches within a bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that parafermionic zero modes emerge at the endpoints of the trenches and give rise to a topologically protected degeneracy. We also discuss methods for preparing and detecting these modes.

abstract: In this letter we present, in a number conserving framework, a model of interacting fermions in a two-wire geometry supporting non-local zero-energy Majorana-like edge excitations. The model has an exactly solvable line, on varying the density of fermions, described by a topologically non-trivial ground state wave-function. Away from the exactly solvable line we study the system by means of the numerical density matrix renormalization group. We characterize its topological properties through the explicit calculation of a degenerate entanglement spectrum and of the braiding operators which are exponentially localized at the edges. Furthermore, we establish the presence of a gap in its single particle spectrum while the Hamiltonian is gapless, and compute the correlations between the edge modes as well as the superfluid correlations. The topological phase covers a sizeable portion of the phase diagram, the solvable line being one of its boundaries.

The model is based on a double-wire setup with local interactions in a particle number conserving setting. A compelling property of this model is the exact solvability for its ground states and low energy excitations. We demonstrate the appearance of topologically protected edge states and derive their braiding properties on a microscopic level. We find the non-abelian statistics of Ising anyons, which can be interpreted as Majorana-like edge states.

abstract: We study a finite basic structure that possibly underlies the observed elementary quantum fields with gauge and gravitational interactions. Realistic wave functions of locally interacting quantum fields emerge naturally as low-resolution descriptions of the generic distribution of many quantifiable properties of arbitrary static objects. We prove that in any quantum theory with the superposition principle, evolution of a current state unavoidably continues along alternate routes with every Hamiltonian that possesses pointer states. Then for a typical system the Hamiltonian changes unpredictably during evolution. This applies to the emergent quantum fields too. Yet the Hamiltonian is unambiguous for isolated emergent systems with sufficient symmetry, e.g., local supersymmetry. The other emergent systems, without specific physical laws, cannot be inhabitable. The acceptable systems are eternally inflating universes with reheated regions. We see how eternal inflation perpetually creates new short-scale physical degrees of freedom and why they are initially in the ground state. In the emergent quantum worlds probabilities follow from the first principles. The Born rule is not universal but there are reasons to expect it in a typical world. The emergent quantum evolution is necessarily Everettian (many-world). However, for a finite underlying structure the Everett branches with the norm below a positive threshold cease to exist. Hence some experiments that could be motivated by taking the Everett view too literally will be fatal for the participants.

abstract: This paper derives Langevin equations for an optical cavity where the dominant nonlinearity arises from free-carrier dispersion. We define a generalized Wigner function, compute a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the master equation, and convert this to a system of stochastic differential equations. These equations are similar to the Wigner equations for an optical Kerr cavity, but have additional noise terms due to the incoherent carrier excitation and decay processes. We use these equations to simulate a phase-sensitive amplifier and latch and compare the results to a Kerr model.

abstract: At strong pump powers, a semiconductor optical cavity passes through a Hopf bifurcation and undergoes self-oscillation. We simulate this device using semiclassical Langevin equations and assess the effect of quantum fluctuations on the dynamics. Below threshold, the cavity acts as a phase-insensitive linear amplifier, with noise $\sim 5\times$ larger than the Caves bound. Above threshold, the limit cycle acts as an analog memory, and the phase diffusion is $\sim 10\times$ larger than the bound set by the standard quantum limit. We also simulate entrainment of this oscillator and propose an optical Ising machine and classical CNOT gate based on the effect.

abstract: Highest resolution imaging in astronomy is achieved by interferometry, connecting telescopes over increasingly longer distances, and at successively shorter wavelengths. Here, we present the first diffraction-limited images in visual light, produced by an array of independent optical telescopes, connected electronically only, with no optical links between them. With an array of small telescopes, second-order optical coherence of the sources is measured through intensity interferometry over 180 baselines between pairs of telescopes, and two-dimensional images reconstructed. The technique aims at diffraction-limited optical aperture synthesis over kilometre-long baselines to reach resolutions showing details on stellar surfaces and perhaps even the silhouettes of transiting exoplanets. Intensity interferometry circumvents problems of atmospheric turbulence that constrain ordinary interferometry. Since the electronic signal can be copied, many baselines can be built up between dispersed telescopes, and over long distances. Using arrays of air Cherenkov telescopes, this should enable the optical equivalent of interferometric arrays currently operating at radio wavelengths.

By making use of the generalized star-triangle transformation, we map the initial model onto an effective Ising one on a Husimi lattice, which we solve then exactly by applying the recursive method. Expressing the entanglement of the Heisenberg spins, that we quantify by means of the concurrence, in terms of the magnetic quantities of the system, we demonstrate its bifurcation and chaotic behavior. Furthermore, we show that the underlying chaos may slightly enhance the amount of the entanglement, and present on the phase diagram the transition lines from the uniform to periodic and from the periodic to chaotic regimes.

abstract: Atomic projection noise limits the ultimate precision of all atomic sensors, including clocks, inertial sensors, magnetometers, etc. The independent quantum collapse of $N$ atoms into a definite state (for example spin up or down) leads to an uncertainty $\Delta \theta_{SQL}=1/\sqrt{N}$ in the estimate of the quantum phase accumulated during a Ramsey sequence or its many generalizations. This phase uncertainty is referred to as the standard quantum limit. Creating quantum entanglement between the $N$ atoms can allow the atoms to partially cancel each other's quantum noise, leading to reduced noise in the phase estimate below the standard quantum limit. Recent experiments have demonstrated up to $10$~dB of phase noise reduction relative to the SQL by making collective spin measurements. This is achieved by trapping laser-cooled Rb atoms in an optical cavity and precisely measuring the shift of the cavity resonance frequency by an amount that depends on the number of atoms in spin up. Detecting the probe light with high total efficiency reduces excess classical and quantum back-action of the probe. Here we discuss recent progress and a technique for reducing the relative frequency noise between the probe light and the optical cavity, a key requirement for further advances.

abstract: In arXiv:1502.06589 it has been introduced an algorithm extending the Van-Brunt and Visser result, leading to new closed forms of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. In particular, there are closed forms even when the commutator $[X,Y]$ also contains elements of the algebra different from $X$ and $Y$. In arXiv:1503.08198 it has been shown that there are {\it 13 types} of such commutator algebras. We show, by providing the explicit solutions, that these include the semisimple complex Lie algebras. In particular, if $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are three generators of the Cartan-Weyl basis, we find, for a wide class of cases, $W$, linear combination of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, such that $$ e^X e^Y e^Z=e^W $$ It turns out that the relevant commutator algebras are {\it type 1c-i}, {\it type 4} and {\it type 5}.

abstract: At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones.

abstract: We present and utilize a simple formalism for the smooth creation of boundary conditions within relativistic quantum field theory. We consider a massless scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions and imagine smoothly transitioning from there being no boundary condition to there being a two-sided Dirichlet mirror. The act of doing this, expectantly, generates a flux of real quanta that emanates from the mirror as it is being created. We show, surprisingly, that the local stress-energy tensor of this flux is finite only if an infrared cutoff is introduced, no matter how slowly the mirror is created. We then consider the limit of instantaneous mirror creation, a scenario of interest in regards to vacuum entanglement and black hole firewalls. While the total energy injected into the field is ultraviolet divergent in the instantaneous creation limit, we show that the response of an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector passing through the infinite burst of energy nevertheless remains finite, although dependent on the infrared cutoff.

abstract: In this work, we consider the Casimir effect due to massless fermionic fields in the presence of long cylinders. More precisely, we consider the interaction between a cylinder parallel to a plate, between two parallel cylinders outside each other, and between a cylinder lying parallelly inside another cylinder. We derive the explicit formulas for the Casimir interaction energies and compute the leading and the next-to-leading order terms of the small separation asymptotic expansions. As expected, the leading order terms coincide with the proximity force approximations. We compare the results of the next-to-leading order terms of different quantum fields, and show that our results support the ansatz of derivative expansions.

We further extend these studies to non-linear ramps and periodic drive protocols and identify the optimal ramp protocol for minimal cooling and entanglement generation time. We qualitatively address the effect of noise arising out of fluctuation of the intensity of the laser used to generate entanglement and provide a detailed discussion of a realistic experimental setup which may serve as a test bed for our theory.

The single-particle spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$ (corresponding to toy gravitons forming the black hole), and a gapless continuous spectrum (to accommodate for the Hawking radiation with energy $\omega>m$). Each constituent is in a superposition of the ground state and a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature in the continuum. We first find that, assuming the Hawking radiation is the leading effect of the internal scatterings, the corresponding $N$-particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy $M=N\,m$ and a Planckian distribution for $E>M$ at the same Hawking temperature. From this collective state, we compute the partition function and obtain an entropy which reproduces the usual area law with a logarithmic correction precisely related with the Hawking component. By means of the horizon wave-function for the system, we finally show the backreaction of modes with $\omega>m$ reduces the Hawking flux. Both corrections, to the entropy and to the Hawking flux, suggest the evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass, if the black hole is in this particular quantum state.

abstract: We report a thorough investigation of finite-temperature effects on three-body recombination near a triatomic Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. Our measurements cover a wide range from a near-ideal realization of the zero-temperature limit to a strongly temperature-dominated regime. The experimental results are analyzed within a recently introduced theoretical model based on a universal zero-range theory. The temperature-induced shift of the resonance reveals a contribution that points to an energy-dependence of the three-body parameter. We interpret this contribution in terms of the finite range of the van der Waals interaction in real atomic systems and we quantify it in an empirical way based on length scale arguments. A universal character of the corresponding resonance shift is suggested by observations related to other Efimov resonances and the comparison with a theoretical finite-temperature approach that explicitly takes the van der Waals interaction into account. Our findings are of importance for the precise determination of Efimov resonance positions from experiments at finite temperatures.

abstract: In this paper we applied the no-signaling in time (NSIT) formalism discussed by Kofler and Brukner to investigate temporal entanglement between binary human behavioral unconscious choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2. NSIT consists of a set of inequalities and represents mathematical conditions for macro-realism which require only two measurements in time. The analyses of three independent experiments show a strong violation of NSIT in two out of three of them, supporting the hypothesis of a quantum-like temporal entanglement between human choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2

abstract: This article is a review of results on the nonlinear Schroedinger / Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLS / GP). Nonlinear bound states and aspects of their stability theory are discussed from variational and bifurcation perspectives. Nonlinear bound states, in the particular cases where the potential is a single-well, double-well potential and periodic potential, are discussed in detail. We then discuss particle-like dynamics of solitary wave solutions interacting with a potential over a large, but finite, time interval. Finally we turn to the very long time behavior of solutions. We focus on the important resonant radiation damping mechanism that drives the relaxation of the system to a nonlinear ground state and underlies the phenomena of {\it Ground State Selection} and {\it Energy Equipartition}. We also analyze linear and nonlinear "toy minimal models", which illustrate these mechanisms. Regarding the overall style of this article, we seek to emphasize the key ideas and therefore do not present all technical details, leaving that to the references.

abstract: Photosynthesis -- the conversion of sunlight to chemical energy -- is fundamental for supporting life on our planet. Despite its importance, the physical principles that underpin the primary steps of photosynthesis, from photon absorption to electronic charge separation, remain to be understood in full. Previously, electronic coherence within tightly-packed light-harvesting (LH) units or within individual reaction centers (RCs) has been recognized as an important ingredient for a complete understanding of the excitation energy transfer dynamics. However, the electronic coherence across RC and LH units has been consistently neglected as it does not play a significant role during these relatively slow transfer processes. Here, we turn our attention to the absorption process, which occurs on much shorter timescales. We demonstrate that the - often overlooked - spatially extended but short-lived excitonic delocalization across RC and LH units plays a relevant role in general photosynthetic systems, as it causes a redistribution of direct absorption towards the charge separation unit. Using the complete core complex of Rhodospirillum rubrum, we verify experimentally an 80 % increase in the direct optical absorption of the RC in situ as compared to isolated RCs. Numerical calculations reveal that similar enhancements can be expected for a wide variety of photosynthetic units in both plant and bacterial systems, suggesting that this mechanism is conserved across species and providing a clear new design principle for light-harvesting nanostructures

Radiation is detected over a broad range of detuning configurations between the dot energy levels with pronounced maxima occurring in resonance with a capacitively coupled transmission line resonator. The power emitted for forward and reverse resonant detuning is found to be in good agreement with a rate equation model, which considers the hybridization of the individual dot charge states.

abstract: The shifted Tietz-Wei (sTW) oscillator is as good as traditional Morse potential in simulating the atomic interaction in diatomic molecules. By using the Pekeris-type approximation to deal with the centrifugal term, we obtain the bound-state solutions of the radial Schr\"odinger equation with this typical molecular model via the exact quantization rule (EQR). The energy spectrum for a set of diatomic molecules ($NO \left(a^4\Pi_i\right)$, $NO \left(B^2\Pi_r\right)$, $NO \left(L'^2\phi\right)$, $NO \left(b^4\Sigma^{-}\right)$, $ICl\left(X^1\Sigma_g^{+}\right)$, $ICl\left(A^3\Pi_1\right)$ and $ICl\left(A'^3\Pi_2\right)$ for arbitrary values of $n$ and $\ell$ quantum numbers are obtained. For the sake of completeness, we study the corresponding wavefunctions using the formula method.

abstract: We theoretically discuss an implementation of a Sagnac interferometer with cold atoms. In contrast to currently existing schemes our protocol does not rely on any free propagation of atoms. Instead it is based on superpositions of fully confined atoms and state-dependent transport along a closed path. Using Ramsey sequences for an atomic clock, the accumulated Sagnac phase is encoded in the resulting population imbalance between two internal (clock) states. Using minimal models for the above protocol we analytically quantify limitations arising from atomic dynamics and finite temperature. We discuss an actual implementation of the interferometer with adiabatic radio-frequency potentials that is inherently robust against common mode noise as well as phase noise from the reference oscillator.

abstract: Using the recently derived representation for the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time allowing an analytic continuation to the entire plane of complex frequencies, we obtain simple analytic expressions for the reflection coefficients of graphene at nonzero Matsubara frequencies. In the framework of the Lifshitz theory, these coefficients are shown to lead to nearly exact results for the Casimir free energy and pressure between two graphene sheets. The constituent parts of large thermal effect, arising in the Casimir interaction at short separations due to an explicit parametric dependence of the polarization tensor on the temperature and an implicit dependence through a summation over the Matsubara frequencies, are calculated. It is demonstrated that an explicit thermal effect exceeds an implicit one at shorter separations, both effects are similar in magnitudes at moderate separations, and that an implicit effect becomes a larger one with further increase of separation. Possible applications of the developed formalism, other than the Casimir effect, are discussed.

abstract: Equilibrium phase transitions have a non-equilibrium analog in quantum real-time evolution -- coined dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) -- which is driven by progressing time instead of conventional control parameters such as temperature. While the occurrence of DQPTs has recently been reported in various systems, the characterization of the dynamical phases separated by a DQPT in terms of order parameters has remained elusive so far. Here, studying quantum quenches in two-banded Bogoliubov de Gennes models, we identify for the first time a dynamical order parameter that physically distinguishes the involved dynamical phases. More specifically, this novel topological quantum number is a momentum space winding number of the Pancharatnam geometric phase which changes its discrete value only at a DQPT.

abstract: Mesoscopic thermoelectric heat engine is much anticipated as a new device which allows us to utilize wasted heat inaccessible by the conventional heat engine with high efficiency. Most theoretical studies so far, however, have been limited to the linear-response regime; its thermodynamics beyond the regime still remains unclear. In this Letter, we give a clear-cut definition of the heat current of the engine beyond the linear-response regime. It resolves the confusion in the definition of the heat current in the linear-response regime. After verifying its thermodynamic consistency, we find the following two interesting results: the efficiency of the mesoscopic thermoelectric engine reaches the Carnot efficiency if and only if the transmission function is a delta function at a specific energy; the unitarity of the scattering matrix guarantees the second law of thermodynamics, invalidating Benenti et al.'s argument in the linear-response regime that one could obtain a finite power with the Carnot efficiency under broken time-reversal symmetry.

abstract: We investigate fluorescence detection using a standing wave of blue-detuned light of one or more atoms held in a deep, microscopic dipole trap. The blue-detuned standing wave realizes a Sisyphus laser cooling mechanism so that an atom can scatter many photons while remaining trapped. When imaging more than one atom, the blue detuning limits loss due to inelastic light-assisted collisions. Using this standing wave probe beam, we demonstrate that we can count from one to the order of 100 atoms in the microtrap with sub-poissonian precision.

The investigation is carried out for a model problem - the particle in the field of a central potential. A system of linear equations is derived to determine the coefficients of the T-matrix expansion in the oscillator functions. We selected four potentials (Gaussian, exponential, Yukawa, and square-well ones) to demonstrate peculiarities of the T-matrix and its dependence on the potential shape. We also study how the T-matrix expansion coefficients depend on the parameters of the oscillator basis such as the oscillator length and the number of basis functions involved in calculations.

In this representation the eigenproblem of the considered quantum model is described by a system of two linear differential equations with one independent variable. The system has only one irregular singular point at infinity. We show how the quantisation of the model is related to asymptotic behaviour of solutions in a vicinity of this point. The explicit formulae for the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the model follow from an analysis of the Stokes phenomenon. An interpretation of the obtained results in terms of differential Galois group of the system is also given.

abstract: We theoretically study spin and charge currents through finite-size two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor/uniform ferromagnet/s-wave superconductor (SFS) junctions with intrinsic spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs) using a quasiclassical approach. Considering experimentally realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the combination of spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and lack of inversion symmetry can result in spontaneously accumulated spin currents at the edges of finite-size two-dimensional magnetic SF hybrids. Due to the spontaneous edge spin accumulation, the corners of the F wire host the maximum spin current density. We further reveal that this type edge phenomena are robust and independent of either the actual type of ISOIs or exchange field orientation. Moreover, we study spin current-phase relations in these diffusive spin-orbit coupled SFS junctions. Our results unveil net spin currents, not accompanied by charge supercurrent, that spontaneously accumulate at the sample edges through a modulating superconducting phase difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental implementations to observe these edge phenomena.

abstract: We study theoretically the far-from-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of spin spiral states in the three dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model. The investigated problem serves as an archetype for understanding quantum dynamics of isolated many-body systems in the vicinity of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. We present a field-theoretical formalism that systematically improves on mean-field for describing the real-time quantum dynamics of generic spin-1/2 systems. This is achieved by mapping spins to Majorana fermions followed by a 1/N expansion of the resulting two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action. Our analysis reveals rich fluctuation-induced relaxation dynamics in the unitary evolution of spin spiral states. In particular, we find the sudden appearance of long-lived prethermalized plateaus with diverging lifetimes as the spiral winding is tuned toward the thermodynamically stable ferro- or antiferromagnetic phases. The emerging prethermalized states are characterized by different bosonic modes being thermally populated at different effective temperatures, and by a hierarchical relaxation process reminiscent of glassy systems. Spin-spin correlators found by solving the non-equilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation provide further insight into the dynamic formation of correlations, the fate of unstable collective modes, and the emergence of fluctuation-dissipation relations. Our predictions can be verified experimentally using recent realizations of spin spiral states [S. Hild, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 147205 (2014)].

abstract: The nontrivial evolution of Wannier functions (WF) for the occupied bands is a good starting point to understand topological insulator. By modifying the definition of WFs from the eigenstates of the projected position operator to those of the projected modular position operator, we are able to extend the usage of WFs to Weyl metal where the WFs in the old definition fails because of the lack of band gap at the Fermi energy. This extension helps us to universally understand topological insulator and topological semi-metal in a same framework. Another advantage of using the modular position operators in the definition is that the higher dimensional WFs for the occupied bands can be easily obtained. We show one of their applications by schematically explaining why the winding numbers $\nu_{3D}=\nu_{2D}$ for the 3D topological insulators of DIII class presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 016801(2015).

abstract: Control of hyperfine interactions is a fundamental requirement for quantum computing architecture schemes based on shallow donors in silicon. However, at present, there is lacking an atomistic approach including critical effects of central-cell corrections and non-static screening of the donor potential capable of describing the hyperfine interaction in the presence of both strain and electric fields in realistically sized devices. We establish and apply a theoretical framework, based on atomistic tight-binding theory, to quantitatively determine the strain and electric field dependent hyperfine couplings of donors. Our method is scalable to millions of atoms, and yet captures the strain effects with an accuracy level of DFT method. Excellent agreement with the available experimental data sets allow reliable investigation of the design space of multi-qubit architectures, based on both strain-only as well as hybrid (strain+field) control of qubits. The benefits of strain are uncovered by demonstrating that a hybrid control of qubits based on (001) compressive strain and in-plane (100 or 010) fields results in higher gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations, for all of the four donor species considered (P, As, Sb, and Bi). The comparison between different donor species in strained environments further highlights the trends of hyperfine shifts, providing predictions where no experimental data exists. Whilst faster gate operations are realisable with in-plane fields for P, As, and Sb donors, only for the Bi donor, our calculations predict faster gate response in the presence of both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, truly benefiting from the proposed planar field control mechanism of the hyperfine interactions.

abstract: The connection between maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in a prime-power dimensional Hilbert space and finite phase-space geometries is well known. In this article we classify MUBs according to their degree of covariance with respect to the natural symmetries of a finite phase-space, which are the group of its affine symplectic transformations. We prove that there exist maximal sets of MUBs that are covariant with respect to the full group only in odd prime-power dimensional spaces, and in this case their equivalence class is actually unique. Despite this limitation, we show that in even-prime power dimension covariance can still be achieved by restricting to proper subgroups of the symplectic group, that constitute the finite analogues of the oscillator group. For these subgroups, we explicitly construct the unitary operators yielding the covariance.

abstract: We take a closer look at the fundamental Casimir-Polder interaction between quantum particles and dispersive dielectric surfaces with surface polariton or plasmon resonances. Linear response theory shows that in the near field, van der Waals, regime the free energy shift of a particle contains a thermal component that depends exclusively on the population/excitation of the evanescent surface polariton/plasmon modes. Our work makes evident the link between particle surface interaction and near field thermal emission and demonstrates how this can be used to engineer Casimir-Polder forces. We also examine how the exotic effects of surface waves are washed out as the distance from the surface increases. In the case of molecules or excited state atoms, far field approximations result in a classical dipole-dipole interaction which depends on the surface reflectivity and the mean number of photons at the frequency of the atomic/molecular transition. Finally we present numerical results for the CP interaction between Cs atoms and various dielectric surfaces with a single polariton resonance and discuss the implications of temperature and retardation effects for specific spectroscopic experiments.

abstract: We study the quantum Hall effect in a monolayer graphene by using an approach based on thermodynamical properties. This can be done by considering a system of Dirac particles in an electromagnetic field and taking into account of the edges effect as a pseudo-potential varying continuously along the $x$ direction. At low temperature and in the weak electric field limit, we explicitly determine the thermodynamical potential. With this, we derive the particle numbers in terms of the quantized flux and therefore the Hall conductivity immediately follows.

abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals crystals have recently enabled new scientific and technological breakthroughs across a variety of disciplines in materials science, nanophotonics and physics. However, non-classical photon emission from these materials has not been achieved to date. Here we report room temperature quantum emission from hexagonal boron nitride nanoflakes. The single photon emitter exhibits a combination of superb quantum optical properties at room temperature that include the highest brightness reported in the visible part of the spectrum, narrow line width, absolute photo-stability, a short excited state lifetime and a high quantum efficiency. Density functional theory modeling suggests that the emitter is the antisite nitrogen vacancy defect that is present in single and multi-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Our results constitute the unprecedented potential of van der Waals crystals for nanophotonics, optoelectronics and quantum information processing.

abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices allow looking in the quantum realm with an undeniable control, which enabled numerous interdisciplinary discoveries. However, studies of systems trapped in prescribed potentials created by classical laser beams start meeting their boundaries. Here we make a step further, introducing the quantumness of light. We show that novel emergent phases appear not only due to the coupled light-matter dynamics, but even solely due to quantum correlations between them. We suggest mechanisms for imprinting quantum patterns on many-body nonlocal interactions of atoms. Even using single-mode cavities, the patterns are spatially multimode. This induces various types of orders because symmetries are broken and inherited from light. We show that competition between light-field and matter-field coherences leads to novel phases (e.g. delocalized dimers), beyond density-induced orders such as multimode generalizations of density waves and supersolid-like states. Some phases can be protected by an energy gap, thus having topological character.

abstract: The Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) is a tensor network that provides an efficient way of variationally estimating the ground state of a critical quantum system. The network geometry resembles a discretization of spatial slices of an AdS spacetime and "geodesics" in the MERA reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy of a boundary region in terms of bulk properties. It has therefore been suggested that there could be an AdS/MERA correspondence, relating states in the Hilbert space of the boundary quantum system to ones defined on the bulk lattice. Here we investigate this proposal and derive necessary conditions for it to apply, using geometric features and entropy inequalities that we expect to hold in the bulk. We show that, perhaps unsurprisingly, the MERA lattice can only describe physics on length scales larger than the AdS radius. Further, using the covariant entropy bound in the bulk, we show that there are no conventional MERA parameters that completely reproduce bulk physics even on super-AdS scales. We suggest modifications or generalizations of this kind of tensor network that may be able to provide a more robust correspondence.

abstract: The quantization of vortex lines in superfluids requires the introduction of their density $\C L(\B r,t)$ in the description of quantum turbulence. The space homogeneous balance equation for $\C L(t)$, proposed by Vinen on the basis of dimensional and physical considerations, allows a number of competing forms for the production term $\C P$. Attempts to choose the correct one on the basis of time-dependent homogeneous experiments ended inconclusively. To overcome this difficulty we announce here an approach that employs an inhomogeneous channel flow which is excellently suitable to distinguish the implications of the various possible forms of the desired equation. We demonstrate that the originally selected form which was extensively used in the literature is in strong contradiction with our data. We therefore present a new inhomogeneous equation for $\C L(\B r,t)$ that is in agreement with our data and propose that it should be considered for further studies of superfluid turbulence.

abstract: This paper aims to determine the fault tolerant quantum filter and fault detection equation for a class of open quantum systems coupled to laser fields and subject to stochastic faults. In order to analyze open quantum systems where the system dynamics involve both classical and quantum random variables, a quantum-classical probability space model is developed. Using a reference probability approach, a fault tolerant quantum filter and a fault detection equation are simultaneously derived for this class of open quantum systems. An example of two-level open quantum systems subject to Poisson-type faults is presented to illustrate the proposed method. These results have the potential to lead to a new fault tolerant control theory for quantum systems.

abstract: We provide an introduction to complex photonic media, that is, composite materials with spatial inhomogeneities that are distributed over length scales comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light. This blossoming field is firmly rooted in condensed matter physics, in optics, and in materials science. Many stimulating analogies exist with other wave phenomena such as sound and seismology, X-rays, neutrons. The field has a rich history, which has led to many applications in lighting, novel lasers, light harvesting, microscopy, and bio optics. We provide a brief overview of complex photonic media with different classes of spatial order, varying from completely random to long-periodically ordered structures, quasi crystalline and aperiodic structures, and arrays of cavities. In addition to shaping optical waves by suitable photonic nanostructures, the realization is quickly arising that the spatial shaping of optical wavefronts with spatial light modulators dramatically increases the number of control parameters. As a result, it is becoming possible for instance to literally see through completely opaque complex media. We discuss a unified view of complex photonic media by means of a photonic interaction strength parameter. This parameter gauges the interaction of light with any complex photonic medium, and allows to compare complex media from different classes for similar applications.

abstract: The intriguing phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL) has attracted significant interest recently, but a complete characterization is still lacking. In this work, we introduce the total correlations, a concept from quantum information theory capturing multi-partite correlations, to the study of this phenomenon. We demonstrate that the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble provides a meaningful diagnostic tool to pin-down, probe, and better understand the MBL transition and ergodicity breaking in quantum systems. In particular, we show that the total correlations has sub-linear dependence on the system size in delocalized, ergodic phases, whereas we find that it scales extensively in the localized phase developing a pronounced peak at the transition. We exemplify the power of our approach by means of an exact diagonalization study of a Heisenberg spin chain in a disordered field.

abstract: We investigate thermodynamic phase diagrams for magnetic analogue of "three states of matter," namely, spin liquid, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered phases, by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our simulations are carried out for Kitaev's toric codes in two and three dimensions, i.e., the simplest realizations of gapped topological $Z_2$ spin liquids, extended by a nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Ising coupling. We find that the ordered phase borders on the spin liquid by a discontinuous transition line in three dimensions, while it grows continuously from the quantum critical point in two dimensions. In both cases, our results elucidate peculiar proximity effects to nearby spin liquids in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, even when the ground state is magnetically ordered. The thorough study of magnetic three states of matter is achieved by introducing the "fictitious vertex" method into the directed loop algorithm. This provides a generic prescription to simulate models with off-diagonal multi-spin interactions, in which the conventional scheme may suffer from intrinsic ergodicity breakdown as in the present case.

abstract: We show that $so(N)_1$ universality class quantum criticality emerges when one-dimensional generalized cluster models -- the N-cluster models -- are perturbed with Ising or Zeeman terms. Each critical point is described by a low-energy theory of N linearly dispersing fermions, whose spectrum we show to precisely match the prediction by $so(N)_1$ conformal field theory. Furthermore, by an explicit construction we show that the N-cluster models are dual to N non-locally coupled transverse field Ising chains, which enables to identify local representations for the primary fields and shows that the N-cluster models provide the simplest representation of the recently introduced hierarchy of $so(N)_1$ critical spin models. For the experimentally most realistic case of N=3, that corresponds to the original one-dimensional cluster model, our results show that $su(2)_2 \simeq so(3)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model can emerge in a local, translationally invariant and Jordan-Wigner solvable spin-1/2 model.

abstract: We introduce the first designs for high-Q photonic cavities in slab architectures in hyperuniform disordered solids displaying isotropic band gaps. Despite their disordered character, hyperuniform disordered structures have the ability to tightly confine the TE-polarised radiation in slab configurations that are readily fabricable. The architectures are based on carefully designed local modifications of otherwise unperturbed hyperuniform dielectric structures. We identify a wide range of confined cavity modes, which can be classified according to their approximate symmetry (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.) of the confined electromagnetic wave pattern. We demonstrate that quality factors ($Q$) $Q>10^{9}$ can be achieved for purely 2D structures, and that for three--dimensional finite-height photonic slabs, quality factors $Q>20,000$ can be maintained.

abstract: The Jacobi theta-functions admit a definition through the autonomous differential equations (dynamical system); not only through the famous Fourier theta-series. We study this system in the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and find corresponding Poisson brackets. Availability of these ingredients allows us to state the problem of a canonical quantization to these equations and disclose some important problems. In a particular case the problem is completely solvable in the sense that spectrum of the Hamiltonian can be found. The spectrum is continuous, has a band structure with infinite number of lacunae, and is determined by the Mathieu equation: the Schr\"odinger equation with a periodic cos-type potential.

To illustrate this, we consider a simple infinite MPS for a spin-1/2 chain and derive an inhomogeneous open Haldane-Shastry model. For the spin-1/2 open Haldane-Shastry model, we derive an exact expression for the two-point spin correlation function. We also provide an SU($n$) generalization of the open Haldane-Shastry model and determine its twisted Yangian generators responsible for the highly degenerate multiplets in the energy spectrum.

abstract: We characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators $h=-\Delta+v$ acting on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_+)$ in terms of the limiting behavior of the Landauer-B\"uttiker and Thouless conductances of the associated finite samples. The finite sample is defined by restricting $h$ to a finite interval $[1,L]\cap\mathbb{Z}_+$ and the conductance refers to the charge current across the sample in the open quantum system obtained by attaching independent electronic reservoirs to the sample ends. Our main result is that the conductances associated to an energy interval $I$ are non-vanishing in the limit $L\to\infty$ iff ${\rm sp}_{\rm ac}(h)\cap I=\emptyset$. We also discuss the relationship between this result and the Schr\"odinger Conjecture.

abstract: Properties of doped and natural impurities in Lithium Niobate single crystals are studied using the Whispering Gallery Mode method at low temperatures as a function of magnetic field. The study reveals considerable coupling of microwave photon modes to the Fe$^{3+}$ spin ensemble in iron-doped and non-doped crystals. The $S=5/2$ structure of the Fe$^{3+}$ impurities demonstrate Zero Field Splittings of $11.21$ and $20.96$ GHz, significant asymmetry of the Zeeman lines and additional lines with anomalous $\text{g}$-factors of $1.37$ and $3.95$. Also, interactions between different transitions of the Fe$^{3+}$ ion is observed. An additional ion impurity ensemble with a splitting of about $1.7$ GHz is shown to couple to the dominating Fe$^{3+}$ spins and the effect on $Q$-factors of microwave photon modes due to the Fe$^{3+}$ ion ensemble is also demonstrated. Measurements down to less than one photon level are made with a loss tangent of order $10^{-5}$ determined.

abstract: We theoretically study homogeneously trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates where all three momentum components couple to a pseudo-spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom. Tuning the anisotropies of spin-orbit coupling and the spin-dependent interactions is shown to provide access to a rich phase diagram with a tetracritical point, first-order phase transitions, and multiple metastable phases of stripe and plane-wave character. The elementary excitation spectrum of the axial plane-wave phase features an anisotropic roton feature and can be used to probe the phase diagram. In addition to providing a versatile laboratory for studying fundamental concepts in statistical physics, the emergence of metastable phases creates new opportunities for observing false-vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in ultra-cold-atom experiments.

abstract: Most behavioral and social experiments aimed at revealing contextuality are confined to cyclic systems with binary outcomes. In quantum physics, this broad class of systems includes as special cases Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky-type, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell-type, and Suppes-Zanotti-Leggett-Garg-type systems. The theory of contextuality known as Contextuality-by-Default allows one to define and measure contextuality in all such system, even if there are context-dependent errors in measurements, or if something in the contexts directly interacts with the measurements. This makes the theory especially suitable for behavioral and social systems, where direct interactions of "everything with everything" are ubiquitous. For cyclic systems with binary outcomes the theory provides necessary and sufficient conditions for noncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain quantum systems. We review several behavioral and social data sets (from polls of public opinion to visual illusions to conjoint choices to word combinations to psychophysical matching), and none of these data provides any evidence for contextuality. Our working hypothesis is that this may be a general rule: behavioral and social systems are noncontextual, i.e., all "contextual effects" in them result from the ubiquitous dependence of response distributions on the elements of contexts other than the ones to which the response is presumably or normatively directed.

abstract: We study how tensor products of representations decompose when restricted from a compact Lie algebra to one of its subalgebras. In particular, we are interested in tensor squares which are tensor products of a representation with itself. We show in a classification-free manner that the sum of multiplicities and the sum of squares of multiplicities in the corresponding decomposition of a tensor square into irreducible representations has to strictly grow when restricted from a compact semisimple Lie algebra to a proper subalgebra. The sum of squares of multiplicities is equal to the dimension of the commutant of the tensor square representation. Hence, our results offer a test to decide if a subalgebra of a compact semisimple Lie algebra is a proper one which uses only linear-algebra computations on sets of generators without calculating the relevant Lie closures. This test can be naturally applied in the field of controlled quantum systems.

abstract: In this paper we investigate a possible energy scale dependence of the quantization rules and in particular, from a phenomenological point of view, an energy scale dependence of an effective $\hbar$. We set a bound on the deviation from the value of $\hbar$ at the muon scale from its usual value using measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Assuming that inflation took place, we can conclude that nature is described by a quantum theory at least up to an energy scale of about $10^{16}$ GeV.

abstract: We propose a scheme to simulate and explore Weyl semimetal physics with ultracold fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional square optical lattice subjected to experimentally realizable spin-orbit coupling and an artificial dimension from an external parameter space, which may increase experimental feasibility compared with the cases in three dimensional optical lattices. It is shown that this system with a tight-binding model is able to describe essentially three-dimensional Weyl semimetals with tunable Weyl points. The relevant topological properties are also addressed by means of the Chern number and the gapless edge states. Furthermore, we illustrate that the mimicked Weyl points can be experimentally detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener oscillation, and the characteristic topological invariant can be measured with the particle pumping approach.

abstract: The devil's staircase is a fractal structure that characterizes the ground state of one-dimensional classical lattice gases with long-range repulsive convex interactions. Its plateaus mark regions of stability for specific filling fractions which are controlled by a chemical potential. Typically such staircase has an explicit particle-hole symmetry, i.e., the staircase at more than half-filling can be trivially extracted from the one at less than half filling by exchanging the roles of holes and particles. Here we introduce a quantum spin chain with competing short-range attractive and long-range repulsive interactions, i.e. a non-convex potential, whose classical limit possesses an exact solution. We identify a new mechanism for the formation of a complete devil's staircase without explicit particle-hole symmetry. In our system the particle-hole symmetry is lifted due to the fact that the staircase is controlled through a two-body interaction rather than a one-body chemical potential. The ground state features two sub-staircases of generalized Wigner crystals that --- depending on the filling fraction --- are either composed of dimer particles or dimer holes. The introduction of quantum fluctuations through a transverse field melts the staircase and ultimately makes the system enter a paramagnetic phase. For intermediate transverse field strengths, however, we identify a region, where the density-density correlations suggest the emergence of quasi long-range order. We discuss how this physics can be explored with Rydberg-dressed atoms held in a lattice.

abstract: In order to formulate mathematical conjectures likely to be true, a number of base cases must be determined. However, many combinatorial problems are NP-hard and the computational complexity makes this research approach difficult using a standard brute force approach on a typical computer. One sample problem explored is that of finding a minimum identifying code. To work around the computational issues, a variety of methods are explored and consist of a parallel computing approach using Matlab, a quantum annealing approach using the D-Wave computer, and lastly using satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and corresponding SMT solvers. Each of these methods requires the problem to be formulated in a unique manner. In this paper, we address the challenges of computing solutions to this NP-hard problem with respect to each of these methods.

abstract: We examine a Kerr phase gate in a semiconductor quantum well structure based on the tunnelling interference effect. We show that there exist a specific signal field detuning, at which the absorption/amplification of the probe field will be eliminated with the increase of the tunnelling interference. Simultaneously, the probe field will acquire a -\pi phase shift at the exit of the medium. We demonstrate with numerical simulations that a complete 180^\circ phase rotation for the probe field at the exit of the medium is achieved, which may result in many applications in information science and telecommunication.

This can be probed by transient excitation of the passive optical resonator.

abstract: We present a cluster Gutzwiller mean-field study for ground states and time-evolution dynamics in the Bose-Hubbard ladder (BHL), which can be realized by loading Bose atoms in double-well optical lattices. In our cluster mean-field approach, we treat each double-well unit of two lattice sites as a coherent whole for composing the cluster Gutzwiller ansatz, which may remain some residual correlations in each two-site unit. For a unbiased BHL, in addition to conventional superfluid phase and integer Mott insulator phases, we find that there are exotic fractional insulator phases if the inter-chain tunneling is much stronger than the intra-chain one. The fractional insulator phases can not be found by using a conventional mean-field treatment based upon the single-site Gutzwiller ansatz. For a biased BHL, we find there appear single-atom tunneling and interaction blockade if the system is dominated by the interplay between the on-site interaction and the inter-chain bias. In the many-body Landau-Zener process, in which the inter-chain bias is linearly swept from negative to positive or vice versa, our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation [Nat. Phys. \textbf{7}, 61 (2011)]. Our cluster bosonic Gutzwiller treatment is of promising perspectives in exploring exotic quantum phases and time-evolution dynamics of bosonic particles in superlattices.

abstract: We develop a new approach in magneto-optical imaging (MOI), applying for the first time a ghost imaging (GI) protocol to perform Faraday microscopy. MOI is of the utmost importance for the investigation of magnetic properties of material samples, through Weiss domains shape, dimension and dynamics analysis. Nevertheless, in some extreme conditions such as e. g. cryogenic temperatures or high magnetic fields application, there exists a lack of domains images due to the difficulty in creating an efficient imaging system in such environments. Here we present an innovative MOI technique that separates the imaging optical path from the one illuminating the object. The technique is based on thermal light GI and exploits correlations between light beams to retrieve the image of magnetic domains. As a proof of principle, the proposed technique is applied to the Faraday magneto-optical observation of the remanence domain structure of an yttrium iron garnet sample.

abstract: We theoretically show that buckled two-dimensional graphene-like materials (silicene and germanene) subjected to a femtosecond strong optical pulse can be controlled by the optical field component normal to their plane. In such strong fields, these materials are predicted to exhibit non-reciprocal reflection, optical rectification and generation of electric currents both parallel and normal to the in-plane field direction. Reversibility of the conduction band population is also field- and carrier-envelope phase controllable. There is a net charge transfer along the material plane that is also dependent on the normal field component. Thus a graphene-like buckled material behaves analogously to a field-effect transistor controlled and driven by the electric field of light with subcycle (femtosecond) speed.
