abstract: It is an open problem to characterize the class of languages recognized by quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a subclass of regular languages we get a condition which is necessary and sufficient. Also, we prove that the class of languages recognizable by a QFA is not closed under union or any other binary Boolean operation where both arguments are significant.
