abstract: In a remarkably insightful pair of papers recently, Sica demonstrated that: dichotomic data taken in any experiment that violates Bell's inequalities ``cannot represent any data streams that could possibly exist or be imagined'' if it is to be consistent with the derivation of the inequalities.\cite{sica} The present writer maintains, however, that corrections in the formulation of Bell's analysis loosen restrictions imposed by Bell inequalities. Moreover, it is argued that the resolution proposed by Sica for the conflict arising from the fact that real data does violate Bell inequalities, namely that the functional form of the correlations considered by Bell must be amended, is untenable on physical grounds. Finally, an alternate resolution is proposed.

abstract: These notes discuss the quantum algorithms we know of that can solve problems significantly faster than the corresponding classical algorithms. So far, we have only discovered a few techniques which can produce speed up versus classical algorithms. It is not clear yet whether the reason for this is that we do not have enough intuition to discover more techniques, or that there are only a few problems for which quantum computers can significantly speed up the solution.

abstract: Ambiguity in the contact between laboratory instruments and equations of quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of responses of the instruments to commands transmitted to them by a Classical digital Process-control Computer (CPC); in this way instruments are distinguished from quantum-mechanical models (sets of equations) that specify what is desired of the instruments. Results include: (1) a formulation of quantum mechanics adapted to computer-controlled instruments; (2) a lower bound on the precision of unitary transforms required for quantum searching and a lower bound on sample size needed to show that instruments implement a desired model at that precision; (3) a lower bound on precision of timing required of a CPC in directing instruments; (4) a demonstration that guesswork is necessary in ratcheting up the precision of commands.

abstract: A laser cooling method for trapped atoms is described which achieves ground state cooling by exploiting quantum interference in a driven Lambda-shaped arrangement of atomic levels. The scheme is technically simpler than existing methods of sideband cooling, yet it can be significantly more efficient, in particular when several motional modes are involved, and it does not impose restrictions on the transition linewidth. We study the full quantum mechanical model of the cooling process for one motional degree of freedom and show that a rate equation provides a good approximation.

abstract: The claim of Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) that finite precision measurement nullifies the Kochen-Specker theorem is criticised. It is argued that, although MKC have nullified the Kochen-Specker theorem strictly so-called, there are other, related propositions which are not nullified. The argument given is an elaboration of some of Mermin's critical remarks. Although MKC allow for the fact that the observables to be measured cannot be precisely specified, they continue to assume that the observables which are actually measured are strictly commuting. As Mermin points out, this assumption is unjustified. Consequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs to investigate the predictions their models make regarding approximate joint measurements of non-commuting observables. Such an investigation is carried out, using methods previously developed in connection with approximate joint measurements of position and momentum. It is shown that a form of contextuality then re-emerges.

abstract: We present a study of collapse-revival patterns that appear in the changes of atomic populations induced by the interaction of ultracold two-level atoms with electromagnetic cavities in resonance with an $m$-photon transition of the atoms ($m$-photon mazer). In particular, sech$^2$ and gaussian cavity mode profiles are considered and differences in the collapse-revival patterns are reported. The quantum theory of the $m$-photon mazer is written in the framework of the dressed-state coordinate formalism. Simple expressions for the atomic populations, the cavity photon statistics, and the reflection and transmission probabilities are given for any initial state of the atom-field system. Evidence for the population trapping phenomenon which suppress the collapse-revivals in the $m$-photon mazer is given.

abstract: An entanglement witness (EW) is an operator that allows to detect entangled states. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for such operators to be optimal, i.e. to detect entangled states in an optimal way. We show how to optimize general EW, and then we particularize our results to the non-decomposable ones; the latter are those that can detect positive partial transpose entangled states (PPTES). We also present a method to systematically construct and optimize this last class of operators based on the existence of ``edge'' PPTES, i.e. states that violate the range separability criterion [Phys. Lett. A{\bf 232}, 333 (1997)] in an extreme manner. This method also permits the systematic construction of non-decomposable positive maps (PM). Our results lead to a novel sufficient condition for entanglement in terms of non-decomposable EW and PM. Finally, we illustrate our results by constructing optimal EW acting on $H=\C^2\otimes \C^4$. The corresponding PM constitute the first examples of PM with minimal ``qubit'' domain, or - equivalently - minimal hermitian conjugate codomain.

abstract: We study the standard generic quantum computer model, which describes a realistic isolated quantum computer with fluctuations in individual qubit energies and residual short-range inter-qubit couplings. It is shown that in the limit where the fluctuations and couplings are small compared to one-qubit energy spacing the spectrum has a band structure and a renormalized Hamiltonian is obtained which describes the eigenstate properties inside one band. The studies are concentrated on the central band of the computer (``core'') with the highest density of states. We show that above a critical inter-qubit coupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of the computer eigenstates. In this regime the ideal qubit structure disappears, the eigenstates become complex and the operability of the computer is quickly destroyed. We confirm that the quantum chaos border decreases only linearly with the number of qubits n, although the spacing between multi-qubit states drops exponentially with n. The investigation of time-evolution in the quantum computer shows that in the quantum chaos regime, an ideal (noninteracting) state quickly disappears and exponentially many states become mixed after a short chaotic time scale for which the dependence on system parameters is determined. Below the quantum chaos border an ideal state can survive for long times and be used for computation. The results show that a broad parameter region does exist where the efficient operation of a quantum computer is possible.

abstract: Process of quantum tunneling of particles in various physical systems can be effectively controlled even by a weak and slow varying in time electromagnetic signal if to adapt specially its shape to a particular system. During an under-barrier motion of a particle such signal provides a "coherent" assistance of tunneling by the multi-quanta absorption resulting in a strong enhancement of the tunneling probability. The semiclassical approach based on trajectories in the complex time is developed for tunneling in a non-stationary field. Enhancement of tunneling occurs when a singularity of the signal coincides in position at the complex time plane with a singularity of the classical Newtonian trajectory of the particle. The developed theory is also applicable to the over-barrier reflection of particles and to reflection of classical waves (electromagnetic, hydrodynamic, etc.) from a spatially-smooth medium.

abstract: In this paper we give a definition for quantum Kolmogorov complexity. In the classical setting, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of the shortest program that can produce this string as its output. It is a measure of the amount of innate randomness (or information) contained in the string. We define the quantum Kolmogorov complexity of a qubit string as the length of the shortest quantum input to a universal quantum Turing machine that produces the initial qubit string with high fidelity. The definition of Vitanyi (Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, 2000) measures the amount of classical information, whereas we consider the amount of quantum information in a qubit string. We argue that our definition is natural and is an accurate representation of the amount of quantum information contained in a quantum state.

abstract: A canonical formulation of coupled classical-quantum dynamics is presented. The theory is named symmetric hybrid dynamics. It is proved that under some general conditions its predictions are consistent with the full quantum ones. Moreover symmetric hybrid dynamics displays a fully consistent canonical structure. Namely, it is formulated over a Lie algebra of observables, time evolution is unitary and the solution of a hybrid type Schr\"odinger equation. A quantization prescription from classical mechanics to hybrid dynamics is presented. The quantization map is a Lie algebra isomorphism. Finally some possible applications of the theory are succinctly suggested.

I show that an entangled photon pair is literally no more than a 1-bit hologram, that the quantum state formalism is completely derivable from general considerations of representation of physical information, and that both the probabilistic aspects of quantum theory and the constancy of h are exactly predicted by the thermodynamics of representation, without precluding a fundamental, relative difference in spatial scale between non-colocated observers, leading to logical foundations of relativity and cosmology that show the current thinking in that field to be simplistic and erroneous.

abstract: There are a few obstacles, which bring about imperfect quantum teleportation of a continuous variable state, such as unavailability of maximally entangled two-mode squeezed states, inefficient detection and imperfect unitary transformation at the receiving station. We show that all those obstacles can be understood by a combination of an {\it asymmetrically-decohered} quantum channel and perfect apparatuses for other operations. For the asymmetrically-decohered quantum channel, we find some counter-intuitive results; one is that teleportation does not necessarily get better as the channel is initially squeezed more and another is when one branch of the quantum channel is unavoidably subject to some imperfect operations, blindly making the other branch as clean as possible may not result in the best teleportation result. We find the optimum strategy to teleport an unknown field for a given environment or for a given initial squeezing of the channel.

abstract: Despite the fact that the fundamental physical laws are symmetric in time, most observed processes do not show this symmetry. Especially the phenomenon of decay seems to involve a kind of irreversibility that makes the definition of a microscopic arrow of time possible. Such an intrinsic irreversibility is incorporated within the Rigged Hilbert Space quantum mechanics of the Brussels School, contrasting to the statements of standard quantum mechanics. As shown in this paper, the formalism bears significant advantages in the description of decaying systems, however the breaking of time symmetry can be avoided.

abstract: The Penrose-Hameroff (`Orch OR') model of quantum computation in brain microtubules has been criticized as regards the issue of environmental decoherence. A recent report by Tegmark finds that microtubules can maintain quantum coherence for only $10^{-13}$ s, far too short to be neurophysiologically relevant. Here, we critically examine the assumptions behind Tegmark's calculation and find that: 1) Tegmark's commentary is not aimed at an existing model in the literature but rather at a hybrid that replaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch OR' theory with a soliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts decreasing decoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the observed behavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark's equation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR' model (superposition separation, charge vs. dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens the decoherence time to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical assumption of Tegmark's derivation, 4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to the collective dynamics ordering water in the vicinity of microtubules at a rate exceeding that of decoherence can counter decoherence effects (in the same way that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature), and 5) phases of actin gelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule bundles, further increasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and the decoherence time to $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ s. These revisions bring microtubule decoherence into a regime in which quantum gravity can interact with neurophysiology.

abstract: Starting with the quantum Liouville equation, we write the density operator as the product of elements respectively in the left and right ideals of an operator algebra and find that the Schrodinger picture may be expressed through two representation independent algebraic forms in terms of the density and phase operators. These forms are respectively the continuity equation, which involves the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the density operator, and an equation for the time development of the phase operator that involves the anti-commutator of the Hamiltonian with this density operator. We show that this latter equation plays two important roles: (i) it expresses the conservation of energy in a system where energy is well defined and (ii) it provides a simple way to evaluate the gauge changes that occur in the Aharonov-Bohm, the Aharonov-Casher, and Berry phase effects. Both these operator (i.e. purely algebraic) equations also allow us to re-examine the Bohm interpretation, showing that it is in fact possible to construct Bohm interpretations in representations other than the x-representation. We discuss the meaning of the Bohm interpretation in the light of these new results in terms of non-commutative structures and this enables us to clarify its relation to standard quantum mechanics.

We investigate the general case of two entangled quNits, i.e. quantum systems defined in an N-dimensional Hilbert space. Via a numerical linear optimization method we show that violations of local realism are stronger for two maximally entangled quNits (N=3,4,...,9), than for two qubits and that they increase with N. The two quNit measurements can be experimentally realized using entangled photons and unbiased multiport beamsplitters.

abstract: The effects of decoherence for quantum system coupled with a bosonic field are investigated. An application of the stochastic golden rule shows that in the stochastic limit the dynamics of such a system is described by a quantum stochastic differential equation. The corresponding master equation describes convergence of a system to equilibrium. In particular it predicts exponential damping for off-diagonal matrix elements of the system density matrix, moreover these elements for a generic system will decay at least as \exp(-tN{kT\over\hbar}), where N is a number of particles in the system. As an application of the described technique a derivation from first principles (i.e. starting from a Hamiltonian description) of a quantum extension of the Glauber dynamics for systems of spins is given.

abstract: A Darboux-type method of solving the nonlinear von Neumann equation $i\dot \rho=[H,f(\rho)]$, with functions $f(\rho)$ commuting with $\rho$, is developed. The technique is based on a representation of the nonlinear equation by a compatibility condition for an overdetermined linear system. von Neumann equations with various nonlinearities $f(\rho)$ are found to possess the so-called self-scattering solutions. To illustrate the result we consider the Hamiltonian $H$ of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and $f(\rho)=\rho^q-2\rho^{q-1}$ with arbitary real $q$. It is shown that self-scattering solutions possess the same asymptotics for all $q$ and that different nonlinearities may lead to effectively indistinguishable evolutions. The result may have implications for nonextensive statistics and experimental tests of linearity of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We analyze the entangling capabilities of unitary transformations $U$ acting on a bipartite $d_1\times d_2$-dimensional quantum system. To this aim we introduce an entangling power measure $e(U)$ given by the mean linear entropy produced acting with $U$ on a given distribution of pure product states. This measure admits a natural interpretation in terms of quantum operations. For a uniform distribution explicit analytical results are obtained using group-theoretic arguments. The behaviour of the features of $e(U)$ as the subsystem dimensions $d_1$ and $d_2$ are varied is studied both analytically and numerically. The two-qubit case $d_1=d_2=2$ is argued to be peculiar.

abstract: Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S={(phi in R mod 2pi, p>0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of the group SO(1,2) the present paper proposes an application of those results to the old problem of quantizing modulus and phase in interference phenomena: The self-adjoint Lie algebra generators K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group correspond to the classical observables p cos(phi), -p sin(phi) and p > 0 the Poisson brackets of which obey that Lie algebra, too. For the irreducible unitary representations of the positive series the modulus operator K_3 has the positive discrete spectrum {n+k, n=0,1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators for cos(phi) and sin(phi) can then be defined as (K_3^{-1}K_1 + K_1 K_3^{-1})/2 and - (K_3^{-1} K_2 + K_2 K_3^{-1})/2 which have the theoretically desired properties for k >0.32. Some matrix elements with respect to number eigenstates and with respect to coherent states are calculated. One conclusion is that group theoretical quantization may be tested by quantum optical experiments.

abstract: We consider a two-dimensional particle of charge $e$ interacting with a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and a potential well which is transported along a closed loop in the plane. We show that a bound state corresponding to a simple isolated eigenvalue acquires at that Berry's phase equal to $2\pi {\rm sgn} e$ times the number of flux quanta through the oriented area encircled by the loop. We also argue that this is a purely quantum effect since the corresponding Hannay angle is zero.

abstract: We discuss heating and decoherence in traps for ions and neutral particles close to metallic surfaces. We focus on simple trap geometries and compute noise spectra of thermally excited electromagnetic fields. If the trap is located in the near field of the substrate, the field fluctuations are largely increased compared to the level of the blackbody field, leading to much shorter coherence and life times of the trapped atoms. The corresponding time constants are computed for ion traps and magnetic traps. Analytical estimates for the size dependence of the noise spectrum are given. We finally discuss prospects for the coherent transport of matter waves in integrated surface waveguides.

abstract: We present a new method to derive low-lying N-dimensional quantum wave functions by quadrature along a single trajectory. The N-dimensional Schroedinger equation is cast into a series of readily integrable first order ordinary differential equations. Our approach resembles the familiar W.K.B. approximation in one dimension, but is designed to explore the classically forbidden region and has a much wider applicability than W.K.B.. The method also provides a perturbation series expansion and the Green's functions of the wave equation in N-dimension, all by quadratures along a single trajectory. A number of examples are given for illustration, including a simple algorithm to evaluate the Stark effect in closed form to any finite order of the electric field.

Then the difference among several models, i.e., the perfect models and the non-perfect models, is studied. Our teleportation models are constructed by means of coherent states in some Fock space with counting measures, so that our model can be treated in the frame of usual optical communication.

The interaction is linear in the coordinates and the momenta. The model has an analytical solution that is used to study the time evolution of the reduced density operator. It is derived in a closed form, in the one-particle sector of the model. The irreversible behavior of the Brownian particle is described by a reduced density matrix.

abstract: After carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantum channel, the parties Alice and Bob must process the raw key in order to end up with identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information. In principle, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this processing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful. We prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent eavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in their classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if and only if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. In addition, we provide evidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in every situation. Consequently, many techniques and results from quantum information theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory, and vice versa. For instance, it was previously believed that two parties can carry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share some intrinsic information in the adversary's view. The analysis of this purely classical problem from the quantum information-theoretic viewpoint shows that this is true in the binary case, but false in general. More explicitly, bound entanglement, i.e., entanglement that cannot be purified by any quantum protocol, has a classical counterpart. This "bound intrinsic information" cannot be distilled to a secret key by any classical protocol. As another application we propose a measure for entanglement based on classical information-theoretic quantities.

abstract: The cloning of continuous quantum variables is analyzed based on the concept of Gaussian cloning machines, i.e., transformations that yield copies that are Gaussian mixtures centered on the state to be copied. The optimality of Gaussian cloning machines that transform N identical input states into M output states is investigated, and bounds on the fidelity of the process are derived via a connection with quantum estimation theory. In particular, the optimal N-to-M cloning fidelity for coherent states is found to be equal to MN/(MN+M-N).

In this general context, we determine the eigenstates, eigenvalues, the time evolution matrix and the population inversion matrix factor.

abstract: An analysis is made of the effect of a strong field on the shape of the amplification spectral line for mono-velocity V-type three-level atoms. There are three strong-field contributions, differing in their dependence on the set of relaxation parameters of the medium and on the differences among the populations corresponding to the Raman transitions. An analysis is made of the conditions under which each of the contributions is predominant. The change in the line shape by an intensified external field is found for each case. Neon atoms are discussed as an example. The results are compared with those corresponding to a Maxwellian velocity distribution.

abstract: Due to a transient quantum interference during a wavepacket collision with a potential barrier, a particular momentum, that depends on the potential parameters but is close to the initial average momentum, becomes suppressed. The hole left pushes the momentum distribution outwards leading to a significant constructive enhancement of lower and higher momenta. This is explained in the momentum complex-plane language in terms of a saddle point and two contiguous ``structural'' poles, which are not associated with resonances but with incident and transmitted components of the wavefunction.

abstract: The quantum state of a particle can be completely specified by a position at one instant of time. This implies a lack of information, hence a symmetry, as to where the particle will move. We here study the consequences for free particles of spin 0 and spin 1/2. On a cubic spatial lattice a hopping equation is derived, and the continuum limit taken. Spin 0 leads to the Schroedinger equation, and spin 1/2 to the Weyl equation. Both Hamiltonians are hermitian automatically, if time-reversal symmetry is assumed. Hopping amplitudes with a "slight" inhomogeneity lead to the Weyl equation in a metric-affine space-time.

abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamics of multiply charged hydrogenic ions in near-optical linearly polarized laser fields with intensities of order 10^16 to 10^17 W/cm^2. Depending on the charge state Z of the ion the relation of strength between laser field and ionic core changes. We find around Z=12 typical multiphoton dynamics and for Z=3 tunneling behaviour, however with clear relativistic signatures. In first order in v/c the magnetic field component of the laser field induces a Z-dependent drift in the laser propagation direction and a substantial Z-dependent angular momentum with repect to the ionic core. While spin oscillations occur already in first order in v/c as described by the Pauli equation, spin induced forces via spin orbit coupling only appear in the parameter regime where (v/c)^2 corrections are significant. In this regime for Z=12 ions we show strong splittings of resonant spectral lines due to spin-orbit coupling and substantial corrections to the conventional Stark shift due to the relativistic mass shift while those to the Darwin term are shown to be small. For smaller charges or higher laser intensities, parts of the electronic wavepacket may tunnel through the potential barrier of the ionic core, and when recombining are shown to give rise to keV harmonics in the radiation spectrum. Some parts of the wavepacket do not recombine after ionisation and we find very energetic electrons in the weakly relativistic regime of above threshold ionization.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the joint probability distributions of the outcomes of simultaneous measurements of commuting observables, but the current formulation lacks the operational definition of simultaneous measurements. In order to provide foundations of joint statistics of local general measurements on entangled systems in a general theoretical framework, the question is answered as to under what condition the outputs of two measuring apparatuses satisfy the joint probability formula for simultaneous measurements of their observables. For this purpose, all the possible state changes caused by measurements of an observable are characterized and the notion of disturbance in measurement is formalized in terms of operations derived by the measuring interaction.

abstract: Consider a Boolean function $\chi: X \to \{0,1\}$ that partitions set $X$ between its good and bad elements, where $x$ is good if $\chi(x)=1$ and bad otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.

We investigate protocols which achieve this using local operations, classical communication and shared entanglement (LOCCSE). Lower bounds on the necessary entanglement and classical communication are determined using causality and the linearity of quantum mechanics. We examine in particular detail the resources required if the remote control is to be implemented as a classical black box. Under these circumstances, we prove that the required resources are, necessarily, those needed for implementation by bidirectional state teleportation.

For two qutrit isotropic states we determine the convex hull and we have strong evidence for its exact form for arbitrary dimension. Unlike for two qubits, the entanglement of formation for two qutrits or more is found to be a nonanalytic function of the maximally entangled fraction in the regime where the density matrix is entangled.

abstract: The process of teleportation of a completely unknown one-particle state of a free relativistic quantum field is considered. In contrast to the non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the teleportation of an unknown state of the quantum field cannot be in principle described in terms of a measurement in a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces to which the unknown state and the state of the EPR-pair belong. The reason is of the existence of a cyclic (vacuum) state common to both the unknown state and the EPR-pair. Due to the common vacuum vector and the microcausality principle (commutation relations for the field operators), the teleportation amplitude contains inevitably contributions which are irrelevant to the teleportation process. Hence in the relativistic theory the teleportation in the sense it is understood in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics proves to be impossible because of the impossibility of the realization of the appropriate measurement as a tensor product of the measurements related to the individual subsystems so that one can only speak of the amplitude of the propagation of the field as a whole.

abstract: The process of teleportation of a completely unknown single-photon relativistic state is considered. Analysis of the relativistic case reveals that the teleportation as it is understood in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics is impossible if no {\it a priori} information on the state to be teleported is available. It is only possible to speak of the amplitude of the propagation of the field (taking into account the measurement procedure) since the existence of a common vacuum state together with the microcausality principle (the field operators commutation relations) make the concept of the propagation amplitude for the individual subsystems physically meaningless. When partial {\it a priori} information is available (for example, only the polarization state of the photon is unknown while its spatial state is specified beforehand), the teleportation does become possible in the relativistic case. In that case the {\it a priori} information can be used to ``label'' the identical particles to make them effectively distinguishable.

We show that entanglement of three-qubit GHZ state can be partially broadcasted with the help of local or non-local copying processes. It is found that non-local cloning is much more efficient than local cloning for the broadcasting of entanglement.

abstract: Classical properties of an open quantum system emerge through its interaction with other degrees of freedom (decoherence). We treat the case where this interaction produces a Markovian master equation for the system. We derive the corresponding distinguished local basis (pointer basis) by three methods. The first demands that the pointer states mimic as close as possible the local non-unitary evolution. The second demands that the local entropy production be minimal. The third imposes robustness on the inherent quantum and emerging classical uncertainties. All three methods lead to localized Gaussian pointer states, their formation and diffusion being governed by well-defined quantum Langevin equations.

abstract: We provide a physical prescription based on interferometry for introducing the total phase of a mixed state undergoing unitary evolution, which has been an elusive concept in the past. We define the parallel transport condition that provides a connection-form for obtaining the geometric phase for mixed states. The expression for the geometric phase for mixed state reduces to well known formulas in the pure state case when a system undergoes noncyclic and unitary quantum evolution.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of interference effects induced by macroscopic quantum-mechanical superpositions of almost othogonal coherent states - a Schroedinger cats state - in a resonant microcavity. Despite the fact that a single atom, used as a probe of the cat state, on the average only change the mean number of photons by one unit, we show that this single atom can change the system drastically. Interference between the initial and almost orthogonal macroscopic quantum states of the radiation field can now take place. Dissipation under current experimental conditions is taken into account and it is found that this does not necessarily change the intereference effects dramatically.

abstract: Quantum information processing by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy uses pseudo-pure states to mimic the evolution and observations on true pure states. A new method of preparing pseudo-pure states is described, which involves the selection of the spatially labeled states of an ancilla spin with which the spin system of interest is correlated. This permits a general procedure to be given for the preparation of pseudo-pure states on any number of spins, subject to the limitations imposed by the loss of signal from the selected subensemble. The preparation of a single pseudo-pure state is demonstrated by carbon and proton NMR on 13C-labeled alanine. With a judicious choice of magnetic field gradients, the method further allows encoding of up to 2^N pseudo-pure states in independent spatial modes in an N+1 spin system. Fast encoding and decoding schemes are demonstrated for the preparation of four such spatially labeled pseudo-pure states.

abstract: The chiral symmetry-breaking term of the Skyrme model with massive pion is modified to obtain the hedgehog profile function which is in best coincidence with the kink-like profile function. For the modified Lagrangian, the minimum of the energy of the B=2 twisty skyrmion configuration is lower than the values for both the cases of the Skyrme Lagrangian with and without the non-modified symmetry-breaking term. The equations of motion for the time-dependent hedgehog of this model and for a generalizated Skyrme model including sixth-order stabilizing term are derived and integrated nummerically. The time evolution of soliton is obtained. We have observed the seft-exitation of soliton because of the fast developement of fluctuation.

abstract: A new measure of information in quantum mechanics is proposed which takes into account that for quantum systems the only feature known before an experiment is performed are the probabilities for various events to occur. The sum of the individual measures of information for mutually complementary observations is invariant under the choice of the particular set of complementary observations and conserved if there is no information exchange with an environment. That operational quantum information invariant results in N bits of information for a system consisting of N qubits.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005085
abstract: We compare theoretical expectations for the Casimir force with the results of precise measurements. The force is calculated at finite temperature for multilayered covering of the bodies using the Lifshitz theory. We argue that the dielectric function of the metallization has to be directly measured to reach the necessary precision in the force calculation. Without knowledge of this function one can establish a well defined upper limit on the force using parameters of perfect single-crystal materials. The force measured in the torsion pendulum experiment does not contradict to the upper limit. Importance of a thin Au/Pd layer in the atomic force microscope experiments is stressed. The force measured with the microscope is larger than the upper limit at small separations between bodies. The discrepancy is significant and reproduced for both performed measurements. The origin of the discrepancy is discussed. The simplest modification of the experiment is proposed allowing to make its results more reliable and answer the question if the discrepancy has any relation with the existence of a new force.

abstract: We report an improved precision measurement of the Casimir force using metallic gold surfaces. The force is measured between a large gold coated sphere and flat plate using an Atomic Force Microscope. The use of gold surfaces removes some theoretical uncertainties in the interpretation of the measurement. The forces are also measured at smaller surface separations. The complete dielectric spectrum of the metal is used in the comparison of theory to the experiment. The average statistical precision remains at the same 1% of the forces measured at the closest separation. These results should lead to the development of stronger constraints on hypothetical forces.

It is shown that level splitting can be detected spectroscopically even if it is below the Doppler width. Conditions for distinguishing interference effects from those due to nonequilibrium velocity distribution are determined. In the case of large Doppler broadening the correction for atomic motion is equivalent to the substitution of an "effective immobile atom" for the moving atom ensemble. The spectral manifestation of nonlinear effects is analyzed in detail. The influence of nonlinear interference effects on the generation characteristics in the presence of external field is investigated.

abstract: In order to relate the probabilistic predictions of quantum theory uniquely to measurement results, one has to conceive of an ensemble of identically prepared copies of the quantum system under study. Since the universe is the total domain of physical experience, it cannot be copied, not even in a thought experiment. Therefore, a quantum state of the whole universe can never be made accessible to empirical test. Hence the existence of such a state is only a metaphysical idea. Despite prominent claims to the contrary, recent developments in the quantum-interpretation debate do not invalidate this conclusion.

In this case, the dynamics is characterized by two time scales. First, an equilibrium is reached on a fast time scale within the degenerated subspaces of the system. Then, an equilibrium between these subspaces is reached on a slow time scale.

Both classical communication requirements and entanglement consumption are investigated. We present general statements on the minimal resource requirements and present optimal procedures for a number of important gates, including CNOT and Toffoli gates. We show that one bit of classical communication in each direction is both necessary and sufficient for the non-local implementation of the quantum CNOT, while in general two bits in each direction is required for the implementation of a general two bit quantum gate. In particular, the state-swapper requires this maximum classical communication overhead. Extensions of these ideas to multi-party gates are presented.

We assume strict locality for the probability amplitudes instead of local realism for the outcomes, and calculate an amplitude correlation function.Then the experimentally observed correlation of outcomes is calculated from the square of the amplitude correlation function. Locality of amplitudes implies that the measurement on one particle does not collapse the companion particle to a definite state. Apart from resolving the EPR puzzle, this approach shows that the physical interpretation of apparently `nonlocal' effects like quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping are different from what is usually assumed. Bell type measurements do not change distant states. Yet the correlations are correctly reproduced, when measured, if complex probability amplitudes are treated as the basic local quantities. As examples we discuss the quantum correlations of two-particle maximally entangled states and the three-particle GHZ entangled state.

abstract: One of the most intriguing facts about communication using quantum states is that these states cannot be used to transmit more classical bits than the number of qubits used, yet there are ways of conveying information with exponentially fewer qubits than possible classically. Moreover, these methods have a very simple structure---they involve little interaction between the communicating parties. We look more closely at the ways in which information encoded in quantum states may be manipulated, and consider the question as to whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum protocol of similar efficiency. By a simpler protocol, we mean a protocol that uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a problem such that its k+1 message classical communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity, thus answering the above question in the negative. Our result builds on two primitives, local transitions in bi-partite states (based on previous work) and average encoding which may be of significance in other applications as well.

abstract: We consider collective laser cooling of atomic gas in the Festina lente regime, when the heating effects associated with photon reabsorptions are suppressed. We demonstrate that an appropriate sequence of laser pulses allows to condense a gas of trapped bosonic atoms into the ground level of the trap in the presence of collisions. Such condensation is robust and can be achieved in experimentally feasible traps. We extend significantly the validity of our previous numerical studies, and present new analytic results concerning condensation in the limit of rapid thermalization. We discuss in detail necessary conditions to realize all optical condensate in weak condensation regime and beyond.

abstract: The problem of understanding quantum mechanics is in large measure the problem of finding appropriate ways of thinking about the spatial and temporal aspects of the physical world. The standard, substantival, set-theoretic conception of space is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, and so is the doctrine of local realism, the principle of local causality, and the mathematical physicist's golden calf, determinism. The said problem is made intractable by our obtruding onto the physical world a theoretical framework that is more detailed than the physical world. This framework portraits space and time as infinitely and intrinsically differentiated, whereas the physical world is only finitely differentiated spacewise and timewise, namely to the extent that spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by facts. This has the following consequences: (i) The contingent properties of the physical world, including the times at which they are possessed, are indefinite and extrinsic. (ii) We cannot think of reality as being built "from the bottom up", out of locally instantiated physical properties. Instead we must conceive of the physical world as being built "from the top down": By entering into a multitude of spatial relations with itself, "existence itself" takes on both the aspect of a spatially differentiated world and the aspect of a multiplicity of formless relata, the fundamental particles. At the root of our interpretational difficulties is the "cookie cutter paradigm", according to which the world's synchronic multiplicity is founded on the introduction of surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three-dimensional cookie cutters. The neurophysiological underpinnings of this insidious notion are discussed.

abstract: Interplay between the effects of coherent radiation and localization of light is analysed. A system of two-level atoms is placed in a medium interacting with electromagnetic field. The matter-light interaction can result in the appearance of a band gap in the spectrum of polariton states. If an atom with a resonance frequency inside the gap is incorporated into such a medium, the atomic spontaneous emission is suppressed, which is termed the localization of light. However, a system of resonance atoms inside the gap can radiate due to their coherent interactions. The peculiarity of the coherent radiation by a system of atoms, under the localization of light for a single atom, is studied.

abstract: Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communcication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the GHZ state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.

abstract: Experimental implementations of quantum computer architectures are now being investigated in many different physical settings. The full set of requirements that must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is daunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In this report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that can be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2], and using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these approaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable Heisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\vec S}_i\cdot{\vec S}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control of a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials and device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence rate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these solid-state implementations of quantum computation.

This is an example of true superadditivity of distillable entanglement. We also show that unlockable bound-entangled states cannot be asymptotically unentangled, providing the first proof that some states are truly bound-entangled in the sense of being both non-distillable and non-separable asymptotically.

abstract: An influence of nonlinear interference processes at quantum transitions under strong resonance electromagnetic fields on absorption, amplification and refractive indices as well as on four-wave mixing processes is investigated. Doppler broadening of the coupled transitions, incoherent excitation, relaxation processes, as well as power saturation processes associated with the coupled levels are taken into account. Both closed (ground state is involved) and open (only excited states are involved) energy level configurations are considered. Common expressions are obtained which allow one to analyze the optical characteristics (including gain without inversion and enhanced refractive index at vanishing absorption) for various V, Lambda and H configurations of interfering transitions by a simple substitution of parameters. Similar expressions for resonant four-wave mixing in Raman configurations are derived too. Crucial role of Doppler broadening is shown. The theory is applied to numerical analysis of some recent and potential experiments.

abstract: We investigate exponential phase moments of the s-parametrized quasidistributions (smoothed Wigner functions). We show that the knowledge of these moments as functions of s provides, together with photon-number statistics, a complete description of the quantum state. We demonstrate that the exponential phase moments can be directly sampled from the data recorded in balanced homodyne detection and we present simple expressions for the sampling kernels. The phase moments are Fourier coefficients of phase distributions obtained from the quasidistributions via integration over the radial variable in polar coordinates. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the homodyne detection and we demonstrate the feasibility of direct sampling of the moments and subsequent reconstruction of the phase distribution.

abstract: The paper discusses the reconstruction of potentials for quantum systems at finite temperatures from observational data. A nonparametric approach is developed, based on the framework of Bayesian statistics, to solve such inverse problems. Besides the specific model of quantum statistics giving the probability of observational data, a Bayesian approach is essentially based on "a priori" information available for the potential. Different possibilities to implement "a priori" information are discussed in detail, including hyperparameters, hyperfields, and non--Gaussian auxiliary fields. Special emphasis is put on the reconstruction of potentials with approximate periodicity. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated for a numerical model.

abstract: There is an ongoing effort to quantify entanglement of quantum pure states for systems with more than two subsystems. We consider three approaches to this problem for three-qubit states: choosing a basis which puts the state into a standard form, enumerating ``local invariants,'' and using operational quantities such as the number of maximally entangled states which can be distilled. In this paper we evaluate a particular standard form, the {\it Schmidt form}, which is a generalization of the Schmidt decomposition for bipartite pure states. We show how the coefficients in this case can be parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful local invariants; we use this form to prove the efficacy of a particular distillation technique for GHZ triplets; and we relate the yield of GHZs to classes of states with unusual entanglement properties, showing that these states represent extremes of distillability as functions of two local invariants.

abstract: It is known that entanglement swapping can be used to realize entanglement purifying. By this way, two particles belong to different non-maximally entangled pairs can be projected probabilisticly to a maximally entangled state or to a less entangled state. In this report, we show, when the less entangled state is obtained, if a unitary transformation is introduced locally, then a maximally entangled state can be obtained probabilisticly from this less entangled state. The total successful probability of our scheme is equal to the entanglement of a single pairpurification (if two original pairs are in the same non-maximally entangled states) or to the smaller entanglement of a single pair purification of these two pairs (if two original pairs are not in the same non-maximally entangled states). The advantage of our scheme is no continuous indefinite iterative procedure is needed to achieve optimal purifying.

abstract: Feedback in compound quantum systems is effected by using the output from one sub-system (``the system'') to control the evolution of a second sub-system (``the ancilla'') which is reversibly coupled to the system. In the limit where the ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the system, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master equation for the system alone. This is very significant as it decreases the necessary basis size for numerical simulation and allows the effect of the ancilla to be understood more easily. We consider two types of ancilla: a two-level ancilla (e.g. a two-level atom) and an infinite-level ancilla (e.g. an optical mode). For each, we consider two forms of feedback: coherent (for which a quantum mechanical description of the feedback loop is required) and incoherent (for which a classical description is sufficient). We test the master equations we obtain using numerical simulation of the full dynamics of the compound system. For the system (a parametric oscillator) and feedback (intensity-dependent detuning) we choose, good agreement is found in the limit of heavy damping of the ancilla. We discuss the relation of our work to previous work on feedback in compound quantum systems, and also to previous work on adiabatic elimination in general.

abstract: A quantum computer is a multi-particle interferometer that comprises beam splitters at both ends and arms, where the n two-level particles undergo the interactions among them. The arms are designed so that relevant functions required to produce a computational result is stored in the phase shifts of the 2^n arms. They can be detected by interferometry that allows us to utilize quantum parallelism. Quantum algorithms are accountable for what interferometers to be constructed to compute particular problems. A standard formalism for constructing the arms has been developed by the extension of classical reversible gate arrays. By its nature of sequential applications of logic operations, the required number of gates increases exponentially as the problem size grows. This may cause a crucial obstacle to perform a quantum computation within a limited decoherence time. We propose a direct and concurrent construction of the interferometer arms by one-time evolution of a physical system with arbitrary multi-particle interactions. It is inherently quantum mechanical and has no classical analogue. Encoding the functions used in Shor's algorithm for prime factoring, Grover's algorithm and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm requires only one-time evolution of such a system regardless of the problem size n as opposed to its standard sequential counterpart that takes O(n^3), O(n) and O(n2^n).

abstract: Within the scope of the relativistic quantum theory for electron-laser interaction in a medium and using the resonant approximation for the two degenerated states of an electron in a monochromatic radiation field [1] a nonperturbative solution of the Dirac equation (nonlinear over field solution of the Hill type equation) are obtained. The multiphoton cross sections of electrons coherent scattering on the plane monochromatic wave at the Cherenkov resonance are obtained taking into account the specificity of induced Cherenkov process [1, 2] and spin-laser interaction as well. In the result of this resonant scattering the electron beam quantum modulation at high frequencies occurs that corresponds to a quantity of an electron energy exchange at the coherent reflection from the ''phase lattice'' of slowed plane wave in a medium. So, we can expect to have a coherent X-ray source in induced Cherenkov process, since such beam is a potential source of coherent radiation itself.

abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of constructing measurements optimized to distinguish between a collection of possibly non-orthogonal quantum states. We consider a collection of pure states and seek a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) consisting of rank-one operators with measurement vectors closest in squared norm to the given states. We compare our results to previous measurements suggested by Peres and Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 1119 (1991)] and Hausladen et al. [Phys. Rev. A 54, 1869 (1996)], where we refer to the latter as the square-root measurement (SRM). We obtain a new characterization of the SRM, and prove that it is optimal in a least-squares sense. In addition, we show that for a geometrically uniform state set the SRM minimizes the probability of a detection error. This generalizes a similar result of Ban et al. [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 36, 1269 (1997)].

The interference pattern of cavity QED and trapping fields in space makes the trapping wells distinguishable from one another. This adds considerable flexibility to creating effective trapping and cooling conditions and to detection possibilities.

abstract: Excitation spectrum of a half-quantum vortex in a p-wave superconductor contains a zero-energy Majorana fermion. This results in a degeneracy of the ground state of the system of several vortices. From the properties of the solutions to Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations in the vortex core we derive the non-abelian statistics of vortices identical to that for the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) quantum Hall state.

abstract: We consider the correlation of the electromagnetic field to determine spatial coherence inside a sonoluminescing bubble. We explicitly calculate the first order correlation function for two limiting cases of the excitation field: a blackbody spectrum and a discrete multifrequency spectrum. The correlation length for blackbody fields at temperatures between 3000 K and 10000 K is found to be on the order of the optical wavelength, increasing with decreasing temperatures. We predict spectral lines in the emission spectrum of single bubble sonoluminescence in cooler bubbles with interior temperatures below 10000 K.

abstract: Effect of the spin-involved interaction of electrons with impurity atoms or defects to the transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas is described by using a simplifying two-component model. Components representing spin-up and spin-down states are supposed to be coupled at a discrete set of points within a conduction channel. The used limit of the short-range interaction allows to solve the relevant scattering problem exactly. By varying the model parameters different transport regimes of two-terminal devices with ferromagnetic contacts can be described. In a quasi-ballistic regime the resulting difference between conductances for the parallel and antiparallel orientation of the contact magnetization changes its sign as a function of the length of the conduction channel if appropriate model parameters are chosen. The effect is in agreement with recent experimental observations.

abstract: The development of integrated, waveguide-based atom optical devices requires a thorough understanding of nonlinear matter-wave mixing processes in confined geometries. This paper analyzes the stability of counterpropagating two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in such a geometry. The steady state field equations of this system are solved analytically, predicting a multivalued relation between the input and output field intensities. The spatio-temporal linear stability of these solutions is investigated numerically, leading to the prediction of a self-oscillation threshold that can be expressed in terms of a matter-wave analog of the Fresnel number in optics.

abstract: We comment on a formulation of quantum statistical mechanics, which incorporates the statistical inference of Shannon. Our basic idea is to distinguish the dynamical entropy of von Neumann, $H = -k Tr \hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}$, in terms of the density matrix $\hat{\rho}(t)$, and the statistical amount of uncertainty of Shannon, $S= -k \sum_{n}p_{n}\ln p_{n}$, with $p_{n}=< n|\hat{\rho}|n>$ in the representation where the total energy and particle numbers are diagonal. These quantities satisfy the inequality $S\geq H$. We propose to interprete Shannon's statistical inference as specifying the {\em initial conditions} of the system in terms of $p_{n}$. A definition of macroscopic observables which are characterized by intrinsic time scales is given, and a quantum mechanical condition on the system, which ensures equilibrium, is discussed on the basis of time averaging. An interesting analogy of the change of entroy with the running coupling in renormalization group is noted. A salient feature of our approach is that the distinction between statistical aspects and dynamical aspects of quantum statistical mechanics is very transparent.

abstract: In this work we introduce two experimental proposals that could shed some light upon the inertial properties of intrinsic spin. In particular we will analyze the role that the gravitomagnetic field of the Earth could have on a quantum system with spin 1/2. We will deduce the expression for Rabi transitions, which depend, explicitly, on the coupling between the spin of the quantum system and the gravitomagnetic field of the Earth. Afterwards, the continuous measurement of the energy of the spin 1/2 system is considered, and an expression for the emerging quantum Zeno effect is obtained. Thus, it will be proved that gravitomagnetism, in connection with spin 1/2 systems, could induce not only Rabi transitions but also a quantum Zeno effect.

abstract: In this thesis the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics is applied to canonical quantum gravity. It is shown that, irrespective of any regularization or choice of factor ordering of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the unique relevant quantum effect which does not break spacetime is the change of its signature from lorentzian to euclidean. The other quantum effects are either trivial or break the four-geometry of spacetime. A Bohm-de Broglie picture of quantum geometrodynamics is constructed, which allows the investigation of these latter structures. For instance, it is shown that any real solution of the Wheeler-De Witt equation yields a generate four-geometry compatible with the strong gravity limit of General Relativity and the Carroll group. We prove that quantum geometrodynamics in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation is consistent for any quantum potential. As a previous step to introduce our metodology, we study the quantum theory of fields in Minkowski spacetime in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation and exhibit a concrete example where Lorentz invariance of individual events is broken.

abstract: In this work the possibility of detecting the presence of a Yukawa term, as an additional contribution to the usual Newtonian gravitational potential, is introduced. The central idea is to analyze the effects at quantum level employing interference patterns (at this respect the present proposal resembles the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment), and deduce from it the possible effects that this Yukawa term could have. We will prove that the corresponding interference pattern depends on the phenomenological parameters that define this kind of terms. Afterwards, using the so called restricted path integral formalism, the case of a particle whose position is being continuously monitored, is analyzed, and the effects that this Yukawa potential could have on the measurement outputs are obtained. This allows us to obtain another scheme that could lead to the detection of these terms. This last part also renders new theoretical predictions that could enable us to confront the restricted path integral formalism against some future experiments.

abstract: Naked singularity occurs in the gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous dust ball from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. We show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the naked singularity. The energy flux is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-3/2}$ for a minimally coupled massless scalar field, while is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-1}$ for a conformally coupled massless scalar field, where $t_{\rm CH}-t$ is the `remained time' until the distant observer could observe the singularity if the naked singularity was formed. As a consequence, the radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields. The amount of the power and the energy depends on parameters which characterize the initial density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud. In particular, there is characteristic frequency $\nu_{s}$ of singularity above which the divergent energy is radiated. The energy flux is dominated by particles of which the wave length is about $t_{\rm CH}-t$ at each moment. The observed total spectrum is nonthermal, i.e., $\nu dN/d\nu \sim (\nu/\nu_{s})^{-1}$ for $\nu>\nu_{s}$. If the naked singularity formation could continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is radiated, the radiated energy would reach about $10^{54}(M/M_{\odot})$ erg. The calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out to be consistent as a rough order estimate. The analysis does not depend on whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning. This phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultra high energy cosmic rays or a central engine of gamma ray bursts.

It turns out that $\hat{Q}[\omega]$ is diagonalized in this basis, and it is a well defined self-adjoint operator on ${\cal H}$. The same conclusions are also tenable on the SU(2) gauge invariant Hilbert space with the gauge invariant spin network basis.

abstract: Evading formation of the domain walls in cosmological phase transitions is one of the key problems to be solved for getting agreement with the observed large-scale homogeneity of the Universe. The previous attempts to get around this obstacle led to imposing severe observational constraints on the parameters of the fields involved. Our aim is to show that yet another way to overcome the above problem is accounting for EPR effect. Namely, if the scalar (Higgs) field was presented by a single quantum state at the initial instant of time, then its reduction during a phase transition at some later instant should be correlated even at distances exceeding the local cosmological horizon. By considering a simplest 1D model with Z_2 Higgs field, we demonstrate that EPR effect really can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation of the domain walls.

abstract: In this article we investigate the metric signature as a non-differentiable ({\it i.e.} discrete as opposed to continuous) degree of freedom. The specific model is a vacuum 7D Universe on the principal bundle with an SU(2) structural group. An analytical solution is found which to a 4D observer appears as a flat Universe with a fluctuating metric signature, and frozen extra dimensions with an SU(2) instanton gauge field. A piece of this solution with linear size of the Planck length ($\approx l_{Pl}$) can be considered as seeding the quantum birth of a regular Universe. A boundary of this piece can initiate the formation of a Lorentzian Universe filled with the gauge fields and in which the extra dimensions have been ``frozen''.

abstract: Lisi, Marrone, and Montanino have recently proposed a test for quantum gravity induced decoherence effects in neutrino oscillations observed at Super-Kamiokande. We comment here that their equations have the same qualitative form as the energy conserving objective state vector reduction equations discussed by a number of authors. However, using the Planckian parameter value proposed to explain state vector reduction leads to a neutrino oscillation effect many orders of magnitude smaller than would be detectable at Super-Kamiokande. Similar estimates hold for the Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber spontaneous localization approach to state vector reduction, and our remarks are relevant as well to proposed $K$ meson and $B$ meson tests of gravity induced decoherence.

abstract: It is shown that the generator of the nonstandard fermion-monopole supersymmetry uncovered by De Jonghe, Macfarlane, Peeters and van Holten, and the generator of its standard N=1/2 supersymmetry have to be supplemented by their product operator to be treated as independent supercharge. As a result, the fermion-monopole system possesses the nonlinear N=3/2 supersymmetry having the nature of the 3D spin-1/2 free particle's supersymmetry generated by the supercharges represented in a scalar form. Analyzing the supercharges' structure, we trace how under reduction of the fermion-monopole system to the spherical geometry the nonlinear N=3/2 superalgebra comprising the Hamiltonian and the total angular momentum as even generators is transformed into the standard linear N=1 superalgebra with the Hamiltonian to be the unique even generator.

abstract: We propose a natural differential equation with respect to mass(es) to analyze the scheme dependence problem. It is shown that the vertex functions subtracted at an arbitrary Euclidean momentum (MOM) do not satisfy such differential equations, as extra unphysical mass dependence is introduced which is shown to lead to the violation of the canonical form of the Slavnov-Taylor identities, a notorious fact with MOM schemes. By the way, the traditional advantage of MOM schemes in decoupling issue is shown to be lost in the context of Callan-Symanzik equations.

abstract: The Unruh effect can be correctly treated only by using the Minkowski quantization and a model of a "particle" detector, not by using the Rindler quantization. The energy produced by a detector accelerated only for a short time can be much larger than the energy needed to change the velocity of the detector. Although the measuring process lasts an infinite time, the production of the energy can be qualitatively explained by a time-energy uncertainty relation.

abstract: We suggest that quantum mechanics and gravity are intimately related. In particular, we investigate the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the case of two free particles and show that the quantum potential, which is attractive, may generate the gravitational potential. The investigation, related to the formulation of quantum mechanics based on the equivalence postulate, is based on the analysis of the reduced action. A consequence of this approach is that the quantum potential is always non-trivial even in the case of the free particle. It plays the role of intrinsic energy and may in fact be at the origin of fundamental interactions. We pursue this idea, by making a preliminary investigation of whether there exists a set of solutions for which the quantum potential can be expressed with a gravitational potential leading term which alone would remain in the limit hbar \to 0. A number of questions are raised for further investigation.

abstract: The issues related to the integrability of quantum Calogero-Moser models based on any root systems are addressed. For the models with degenerate potentials, i.e. the rational with/without the harmonic confining force, the hyperbolic and the trigonometric, we demonstrate the following for all the root systems: (i) Construction of a complete set of quantum conserved quantities in terms of a total sum of the Lax matrix (L), i.e. (\sum_{\mu,\nu\in{\cal R}}(L^n)_{\mu\nu}), in which ({\cal R}) is a representation space of the Coxeter group. (ii) Proof of Liouville integrability. (iii) Triangularity of the quantum Hamiltonian and the entire discrete spectrum. Generalised Jack polynomials are defined for all root systems as unique eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. (iv) Equivalence of the Lax operator and the Dunkl operator. (v) Algebraic construction of all excited states in terms of creation operators. These are mainly generalisations of the results known for the models based on the (A) series, i.e. (su(N)) type, root systems.

This approach is applied to the spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry of a nuclear Hamiltonian. It is shown that the excitation operator of the isovector low-lying angular oscillations in deformed nuclei is a linear combination between angular momentum operators, which generate static rotations, and "angle" operators, which generate the transition to a rotating frame.

abstract: The paper is devoted to a model of a mesoscopic system consisting of a pair of parallel planar waveguides separated by an infinitely thin semitransparent boundary modeled by a transverse delta interaction. We develop the Birman-Schwinger theory for the corresponding generalized Schroedinger operator. The spectral properties become nontrivial if the barrier coupling is not invariant with respect to longitudinal translations, in particular, there are bound states if the barrier is locally more transparent in the mean and the coupling parameter reaches the same asymptotic value in both directions along the guide axis. We derive the weak-coupling expansion of the ground-state eigenvalue for the cases when the perturbation is small in the supremum and the L^1-norms. The last named result applies to the situation when the support of the leaky part shrinks: the obtained asymptotics differs from that of a double guide divided by a pierced Dirichlet barrier. We also derive an upper bound on the number of bound states.

abstract: We propose to extend ``invertibility'' to ``regularity'' for categories in general abstract algebraic manner. Higher regularity conditions and ``semicommutative'' diagrams are introduced. Distinction between commutative and ``semicommutative'' cases is measured by non-zero obstruction proportional to the difference of some self-mappings (obstructors) $e^{(n)}$ from the identity. This allows us to generalize the notion of functor and to ``regularize'' braidings and related structures in monoidal categories. A ``noninvertible'' analog of the Yang-Baxter equation is proposed.

abstract: The two-parametric quantum superalgebra $U_{p,q}[gl(2/2)]$ and its induced representations are considered. A method for constructing all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of this quantum superalgebra is also described in detail. It turns out that finite-dimensional representations of the two-parametric $U_{p,q}[gl(2/2)]$, even at generic deformation parameters, are not simply trivial deformations from those of the classical superalgebra $gl(2/2)$, unlike the one-parametric cases.

abstract: By the quantization condition compact quantizable Kaehler manifolds can be embedded into projective space. In this way they become projective varieties. The quantum Hilbert space of the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization (and of the geometric quantization) is the projective coordinate ring of the embedded manifold. This allows for generalization to the case of singular varieties. The set-up is explained in the first part of the contribution. The second part of the contribution is of tutorial nature. Necessary notions, concepts, and results of algebraic geometry appearing in this approach to quantization are explained. In particular, the notions of projective varieties, embeddings, singularities, and quotients appearing in geometric invariant theory are recalled.

abstract: The velocity dependence of the stopping power of swift protons and deuterons in low energy collisions is investigated. At low projectile energies the stopping is mainly due to nuclear stopping and charge exchange of the electron. The second mechanism dominates after Ep >=200 eV. A dynamical treatment of the charge exchange mechanism based on two-center electronic wavefunctions yields very transparent results for the exchange probability. We predict that the stopping cross sections vary approximately as v to the 1.35 power for projectile protons on hydrogen targets in the 1 keV energy region.

abstract: A rotationally invariant random interaction ensemble was realized in a single-j fermion model. The dominance of ground states with zero and maximum spin was confirmed and explained with a statistical approach based on the random coupling of individual angular momenta. The interpretation is supported by the structure of the ground state wave functions.

abstract: We propose a distinction between the physical and the mathematical parts of gauge field theories. The main problem we face is to uphold a strong and meaningful criterion of what is physical. We like to call it "Field's dilemma", referring to Hartry Field's nominalist proposal which we consider to be inadaequate. The resolution to the dilemma, we believe, is implicitly provided by the so-called fiber bundle formalism. We shall demonstrate, in detail, that the bundle structure underlying modern quantum and gravitational gauge field theories allows for a genuine distinction between the physically significant and the merely mathematical parts of these theories.
