abstract: The zero-voltage state of a Josephson junction biased with constant current consists of a set of metastable quantum energy levels. We probe the spacings of these levels by using microwave spectroscopy to enhance the escape rate to the voltage state. The widths of the resonances give a measurement of the coherence time of the two states involved in the transitions. We observe a decoherence time shorter than that expected from dissipation alone in resonantly isolated 20 um x 5 um Al/AlOx/Al junctions at 60 mK. The data is well fit by a model including dephasing effects of both low-frequency current noise and the escape rate to the continuum voltage states. We discuss implications for quantum computation using current-biased Josephson junction qubits, including the minimum number of levels needed in the well to obtain an acceptable error limit per gate.

abstract: Based on a quantum analysis of two capacitively coupled current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose two fundamental two-qubit quantum logic gates. Each of these gates, when supplemented by single-qubit operations, is sufficient for universal quantum computation. Numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation demonstrate that these operations can be performed with good fidelity.

abstract: Enhancement of entanglement enhancement is necessary for most quantum communication protocols many of which are defined in Hilbert spaces larger than two. In this work we present the experimental realization of entanglement concentration of orbital angular momentum entangled photons produced in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process which have been shown to provide a source for higher dimensional entanglement. We investigate the specific case of three dimensions and the possibility of generating different entangled states out of an initial state. The results presented here are of importance for pure states as well as for mixed states.

abstract: We propose a scheme allowing a conditional implementation of suitably truncated general single- or multi-mode operators acting on states of traveling optical signal modes. The scheme solely relies on single-photon and coherent states and applies beam splitters and zero- and single-photon detections. The signal flow of the setup resembles that of a multi-mode quantum teleportation scheme thus allowing the individual signal modes to be spatially separated from each other. Some examples such as the realization of cross-Kerr nonlinearities, multi-mode mirrors, and the preparation of multi-photon entangled states are considered.

abstract: We consider successive measurements of position and momentum of a single particle. Let P be the conditional probability to measure the momentum k with precision dk, given a previously successful position measurement q with precision dq. Several upper bounds for the probability P are determined. For arbitrary, but given precision dq, dk, these bounds refer to the variation of q, k and the state vector of the particle. A weak bound is given by the inequality P <= dkdq/h, where h is Planck's quantum of action. It is non-trivial for all measurements with dkdq < h. A sharper bound is obtained by applying the Hilbert-Schmidt-norm. As our main result the least upper bound of P is determined. All bounds are independent of the order with which the measuring of position and momentum is made.

abstract: We consider a single copy of a mixed state of two qubits and derive the optimal trace-preserving local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) such as to maximize the fidelity of teleportation that can be achieved with this state. These optimal local operations turn out to be implementable by one-way communication, and always yields a teleportation fidelity larger than 2/3 if the original state is entangled. This maximal achievable fidelity is an entanglement measure and turns out to quantify the minimal amount of mixing required to destroy the entanglement in a quantum state.

abstract: We suggest an efficient scheme for quantum computation with linear optical elements utilizing "linked" photon states. The linked states are designed according to the particular quantum circuit one wishes to process. Once a linked-state has been successfully prepared, the computation is pursued deterministically by a sequence of teleportation steps. The present scheme enables a significant reduction of the average number of elementary gates per logical gate to about 20-30 CZ_{9/16} gates.

abstract: We analyze the security of quantum cryptography schemes for $d$-level systems using 2 or $d+1$ maximally conjugated bases, under individual eavesdropping attacks based on cloning machines and measurement after the basis reconciliation. We consider classical advantage distillation protocols, that allow to extract a key even in situations where the mutual information between the honest parties is smaller than the eavesdropper's information. In this scenario, advantage distillation protocols are shown to be as powerful as quantum distillation: key distillation is possible using classical techniques if and only if the corresponding state in the entanglement based protocol is distillable.

abstract: We propose a linear optics scheme with SPDC process to test the fault tolerance property of quantum error correction code. To transmit an unknown qubit robustly through the noisy channel, one may first encode it into a certain quantum error correction code and then transmit it. The remote party decodes it and stores it. Sending a qubit in such a way can significantly reduces the error rate compared with directly sending the qubit itself. Here we show how to realize such a scheme by linear optics.

abstract: Multiparametric statistical model providing stable reconstruction of parameters by observations is considered. The only general method of this kind is the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a squared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a psi function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi function is represented by an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that the introduction of the psi function allows one to represent the Fisher information matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the state vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms.

Estimation of quantum states by the results of coordinate, momentum, and polarization (spin) measurements is considered.

The generalized ''maximally entangled mixed states'' (MEMS) were also synthetized for the first time and their exotic properties investigated by means of a quantum tomographic technique.

The procedure requires the sender and the recipient to share a maximally entangled state. We deal with the concrete problem of aligning reference frames or trihedra by means of a quantum system. We find the optimal covariant measurement and compute the corresponding average error, which has a remarkably simple close form. The connection of this procedure with that of estimating unitary transformations on qubits is briefly discussed.

abstract: By using the Green-function concept of quantization of the electromagnetic field in dispersing and absorbing media, the quantized field in the presence of a dispersing and absorbing dielectric multilayer plate is studied. Three-dimensional input-output relations are derived for both amplitude operators in the ${\bf k}$-space and the field operators in the coordinate space. The conditions are discussed, under which the input-output relations can be expressed in terms of bosonic operators. The theory applies to both (effectively) free fields and fields, created by active atomic sources inside and/or outside the plate, including also evanescent-field components.

abstract: Two trapped ions that are kilometers apart can be entangled by the joint detection of two photons, each coming from one of the ions, in a basis of entangled states. Such a detection is possible with linear optical elements. The use of two-photon interference allows entanglement distribution without interferometric sensitivity to the path length of the photons. The present method of creating entangled ions also opens up the possibility of a loophole-free test of Bell's inequalities.

The transition from coherence to decoherence is examined in terms of an equation for the time dependence of the density matrix. It is explained how the decoherence rate parameter arising in this description is related to the ``unitarity defect'' in interactions with the environment as well as the growth in entropy of the system. Applications to the ``Zeno-Watched Pot Effect'' and gravitational interactions are given. Finally, some recent results on applications to macroscopic coherence with the rf SQUID, where the transition from quantum to classical behavior could be studied experimentally, are shown.

abstract: The system of an atom couples to two distinct optical cavities with phase decoherence is studied by making use of a dynamical algebraic method. We adopt the concurrence to characterize the entanglement between atom and cavities or between two optical cavities in the presence of the phase decoherence. It is found that the entanglement between atom and cavities can be controlled by adjusting the detuning parameter. Finally, we show that even if the atom is initially prepared in a maximally mixed state, it can also entangle the two mode cavity fields.

abstract: The long-time evolution of a system in interaction with an external environment is usually described by a family of linear maps g_t, generated by master equations of Block-Redfield type. These maps are in general non-positive; a widely adopted cure for this physical inconsistency is to restrict the domain of definition of the dynamical maps to those states for which g_t remains positive. We show that this prescription has to be modified when two systems are immersed in the same environment and evolve with the factorized dynamics g_t x g_t starting from an entangled initial state.

We demonstrate that stochastic processes driven by these random sources must be described using an probability amplitude formalism in a close resemblance to Quantum Theory. This fact shows, for the first time, that probability amplitudes are a general concept and is not exclusive to the formalism of Quantum Theory. Application of these rules to a noisy, one-dimensional motion, leds to a probability structure homomorphic to Quantum Mechanics.

We show how appropriate families of two- and three component ``Schroedinger cat states'' are able to support non-trivial correlations between the position and momentum observables leading to contractive behavior. The existence of contractive Schroedinger cat states is suggestive of potential novel roles of non-classical states for precision measurement schemes.

Particular attention is paid to the Hamiltonian x_A p_B that describes the effective off-resonant interaction of light with the collective atomic spin.

abstract: We propose a semiclassical version of Shor's quantum algorithm to factorize integer numbers, based on spin-1/2 SU(2) generalized coherent states. Surprisingly, we find evidences that the algorithm's success probability is not too severely modified by our semiclassical approximation. This suggests that it is worth pursuing practical implementations of the algorithm on semiclassical devices.

abstract: Complete and precise characterization of a quantum dynamical process can be achieved via the method of quantum process tomography. Using a source of correlated photons, we have implemented several methods investigating a wide range of processes, e.g., unitary, decohering, and polarizing. One of these methods, ancilla-assisted process tomography (AAPT), makes use of an additional ``ancilla system,'' and we have theoretically determined the conditions when AAPT is possible. All prior schemes for AAPT make use of entangled states. Our results show that, surprisingly, entanglement is not required for AAPT, and we present process tomography data obtained using an input state that has no entanglement. However, the use of entanglement yields superior results.

abstract: A unitary operator U=\sum u_{j,k} |k><j| is called diagonal when u_{j,k}=0 unless j=k. The definition extends to quantum computations, where j and k vary over the 2^n binary expressions for integers 0,1 ..., 2^n-1, given n qubits. Such operators do not affect outcomes of the projective measurement {<j| ; 0 <= j <= 2^n-1} but rather create arbitrary relative phases among the computational basis states {|j> ; 0 <= j <= 2^n-1}. These relative phases are often required in applications. Constructing quantum circuits for diagonal computations using standard techniques requires either O(n^2 2^n) controlled-not gates and one-qubit Bloch sphere rotations or else O (n 2^n) such gates and a work qubit. This work provides a recursive, constructive procedure which inputs the matrix coefficients of U and outputs such a diagram containing 2^{n+1}-3 alternating controlled-not gates and one-qubit z-axis Bloch sphere rotations. Up to a factor of two, these circuits are the smallest possible. Moreover, should the computation U be a tensor of diagonal one-qubit computations of the form R_z(\alpha)=e^{-i \alpha/2}|0><0|+ e^{i \alpha/2} |1><1|, then a cancellation of controlled-not gates reduces our circuit to that of an n-qubit tensor.

Currently, all physically allowable combinations of polarization entanglement and mixture can be produced, including maximally-entangled mixed states. The states are experimentally measured and refined via computer-automated quantum-state tomography, and this system has also been used to perform single-qubit and ancilla-assisted quantum process tomography.

abstract: Can Grover's algorithm speed up search of a physical region - for example a 2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to be needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show that this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by Benioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time O(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More generally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs, motivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly the holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this model include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a generalized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties, not just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for unitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an O(sqrt(n))-qubit communication protocol for the disjointness problem, which improves an upper bound of Hoyer and de Wolf and matches a lower bound of Razborov.

This is a square root improvement over all known classical procedures. Our study relies strictly on the random matrix conjecture. We also present numerical results for the nonlinear kicked top.

abstract: We employ a basic formalism from convex analysis to show a simple relation between the entanglement of formation $E_F$ and the conjugate function $E^*$ of the entanglement function $E(\rho)=S(\trace_A\rho)$. We then consider the conjectured strong superadditivity of the entanglement of formation $E_F(\rho) \ge E_F(\rho_I)+E_F(\rho_{II})$, where $\rho_I$ and $\rho_{II}$ are the reductions of $\rho$ to the different Hilbert space copies, and prove that it is equivalent with subadditivity of $E^*$. As an application, we show that strong superadditivity would follow from multiplicativity of the maximal channel output purity for all non-trace-preserving quantum channels, when purity is measured by Schatten $p$-norms for $p$ tending to 1.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303046
abstract: The fundamentals of a quantum heat engine are derived from first principles. The study is based on the equation of motion of a minimum set of operators which is then used to define the state of the system. The relation between the quantum framework and thermodynamical observables is examined. A four stroke heat engine model with a coupled two-level-system as a working fluid is used to explore the fundamental relations. In the model used, the internal Hamiltonian does not commute with the external control field which defines the two adiabatic branches. Heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot and cold reservoirs under constant field values. Explicit quantum equation of motion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches. The dynamics on the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form. On the adiabats, a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular analytic solution. These solutions are combined to construct the cycle of operation. The engine is then analyzed in terms of frequency-entropy and entropy-temperature graphs. The irreversible nature of the engine is the result of finite heat transfer rates and friction-like behavior due to noncommutability of the internal and external Hamiltonian.

abstract: A philosophically consistent axiomatic approach to classical and quantum mechanics is given. The approach realizes a strong formal implementation of Bohr's correspondence principle. In all instances, classical and quantum concepts are fully parallel: the same general theory has a classical realization and a quantum realization. Extending the `probability via expectation' approach of Whittle to noncommuting quantities, this paper defines quantities, ensembles, and experiments as mathematical concepts and shows how to model complementarity, uncertainty, probability, nonlocality and dynamics in these terms. The approach carries no connotation of unlimited repeatability; hence it can be applied to unique systems such as the universe. Consistent experiments provide an elegant solution to the reality problem, confirming the insistence of the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation on that there is nothing but ensembles, while avoiding its elusive reality picture. The weak law of large numbers explains the emergence of classical properties for macroscopic systems.

abstract: To observe or control a quantum system, one must interact with it via an interface. This letter exhibits simple universal quantum interfaces--quantum input/output ports consisting of a single two-state system or quantum bit that interacts with the system to be observed or controlled. It is shown that under very general conditions the ability to observe and control the quantum bit on its own implies the ability to observe and control the system itself. The interface can also be used as a quantum communication channel, and multiple quantum systems can be connected by interfaces to become an efficient universal quantum computer. Experimental realizations are proposed, and implications for controllability, observability, and quantum information processing are explored.

abstract: We study the quantum summation (QS) algorithm of Brassard, Hoyer, Mosca and Tapp, that approximates the arithmetic mean of a Boolean function defined on N elements. We improve error bounds presented in [1] in the worst-probabilistic setting, and present new error bounds in the average-probabilistic setting. In particular, in the worst-probabilistic setting, we prove that the error of the QS algorithm using $M - 1$ queries is $3\pi /(4M)$ with probability $8/\pi^2$, which improves the error bound $\pi M^{-1} + \pi^2 M^{-2}$ of Brassard et al. We also present bounds with probabilities $p\in (1/2, 8/\pi^2]$ and show they are sharp for large $M$ and $NM^{-1}$. In the average-probabilistic setting, we prove that the QS algorithm has error of order $\min\{M^{-1}, N^{-1/2}\}$ if $M$ is divisible by 4. This bound is optimal, as recently shown in [10]. For M not divisible by 4, the QS algorithm is far from being optimal if $M \ll N^{1/2}$ since its error is proportional to $M^{-1}^$.

abstract: An analysis is made of Deutsch's recent claim to have derived the Born rule from decision-theoretic assumptions. It is argued that Deutsch's proof must be understood in the explicit context of the Everett interpretation, and that in this context, it essentially succeeds. Some comments are made about the criticism of Deutsch's proof by Barnum, Caves, Finkelstein, Fuchs, and Schack; it is argued that the flaw which they point out in the proof does not apply if the Everett interpretation is assumed. A longer version of this paper, entitled "Quantum Probability and Decision Theory, Revisted", is also available online.

abstract: Irreducible second-order Darboux transformations are applied to the periodic Schrodinger's operators. It is shown that for the pairs of factorization energies inside of the same forbidden band they can create new non-singular potentials with periodicity defects and bound states embedded into the spectral gaps. The method is applied to the Lame and periodic piece-wise transparent potentials. An interesting phenomenon of translational Darboux invariance reveals nonlocal aspects of the supersymmetric deformations.

abstract: We study the problem of secret key distillation from bipartite states in the scenario where Alice and Bob can only perform measurements at the single-copy level and classically process the obtained outcomes. Even with these limitations, secret bits can be asymptotically distilled by the honest parties from any two-qubit entangled state, under any individual attack. Our results point out a complete equivalence between two-qubit entanglement and secure key distribution: a key can be established through a one-qubit channel if and only if it allows to distribute entanglement. These results can be generalized to higher dimension for all those states that are one-copy distillable.

abstract: With many Hamiltonians one can naturally associate a |Psi|^2-distributed Markov process. For nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, this process is in fact deterministic, and is known as Bohmian mechanics. For the Hamiltonian of a quantum field theory, it is typically a jump process on the configuration space of a variable number of particles. We define these processes for regularized quantum field theories, thereby generalizing previous work of John S. Bell [Phys. Rep. 137, 49 (1986)] and of ourselves [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36, 4143 (2003)]. We introduce a formula expressing the jump rates in terms of the interaction Hamiltonian, and establish a condition for finiteness of the rates.

abstract: Bipartite quantum states are classified into three categories: separable states, bound entangled states, and free entangled states. It is of great importance to characterize these families of states for the development of quantum information science. In this paper, I show that the separable states and the bound entangled states have a common spectral property. More precisely, I prove that for undistillable -- separable and bound entangled -- states, the eigenvalue vector of the global system is majorized by that of the local system. This result constitutes a new sufficient condition for distillability of bipartite quantum states. This is achieved by proving that if a bipartite quantum state satisfies the reduction criterion for distillability, then it satisfies the majorization criterion for separability.

abstract: Sequences of actions do not commute.. For example, the tick of a clock and the measurement of a position do not commute with one another, since the position will have moved to the next position after the tick. We adopt non-commutative calculus, with derivatives represented by commutators. In the beginning distinct derivatives do not commute with one another, providing curvature formalism so that the form of the curvature of a gauge field appears almost as soon as the calculus is defined. This provides context for the Feynman-Dyson derivation of electromagnetic formalism from commutators, and generalizations including the early appearance of the form of the Levi-Civita connection dervived from the Jacobi identity. In this version of non-commutative physics bare quantum mechanics (its commutation relations) appears as the flat background for all other constructions. Ascent to classical physics is obtained by replacing commutators with Poisson brackets that satisfy the Leibniz rule. An appendix on matrix algebra from a discrete point of view (Iterants) is provided. This paper will appear in the proceedings of the ANPA conference held in Cambridge, England in the summer of 2002.

abstract: The zero point field is an ordinary field existing in the dark, which cannot be separated from the total electromagnetic field in an excited mode. The total field is in equilibrium with matter that it polarizes temporarily and reversibly. This polarisation is exceptionally large enough to allow the energy of an atom reach and cross a pass between two minimums of potential, stimulating an emission or an absorption. A paradox of quantum electrodynamics is explained classically: The nearly plane wave generally used in stimulated emission experiments must be decomposed into an efficient spherical wave and a scattered wave, so that the plane wave is two times less efficient than the zero point component of the spherical mode. The classical electromagnetism does not need the quantum postulate "reduction of the wave packet" and it has no paradox such as EPR. De Broglie's waves may be the linear part of solitons of a field which may be a high frequency electromagnetic field. These solitons may lead to a physical interpretation of the superstrings theory.

We extend the concept of asymmetric telecloning from qubits to d-dimensional systems. We investigate the broadcasting of entanglement by using local 1->2 optimal universal asymmetric Pauli machines and show that the maximal fidelities of the two final entangled states are obtained when symmetric machines are applied. Cloning of entanglement is studied using a nonlocal optimal universal asymmetric cloning machine and we show that the symmetric machine optimally copies the entanglement. The "many-to-many" teleportation scheme is applied in order to distribute entanglement shared between two observers to two pairs of spatially separated observers.

abstract: The implementation of a quantum computer requires the realization of a large number of N-qubit unitary operations which represent the possible oracles or which are part of the quantum algorithm. Until now there are no standard ways to uniformly generate whole classes of N-qubit gates. We have developed a method to generate arbitrary controlled phase shift operations with a single network of one-qubit and two-qubit operations. This kind of network can be adapted to various physical implementations of quantum computing and is suitable to realize the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm as well as Grover's search algorithm.

abstract: If conscious observers are to be included in the quantum mechanical universe, we need to find the rules that engage observers with quantum mechanical systems. The author has proposed five rules that are discovered by insisting on empirical completeness; that is, by requiring the rules to draw empirical information from Schrodinger's solutions that is more complete than is currently possible with the (Born) probability interpretation. I discard Born's interpretation, introducing probability solely through probability current. These rules tell us something about brains. They require the existence of observer brain states that are neither conscious nor unconscious. I call them 'ready' brain states because they are on stand-by, ready to become conscious the moment they are stochastically chosen. Two of the rules are selection rules involving ready brain states. The place of these rules in a wider theoretical context is discussed. Key Words: boundary conditions, consciousness, decoherence, macroscopic superposition, Penrose, state reduction, von Neumann, wave collapse.

abstract: Post-inflationary boundary conditions are essential to the existence of our highly structured universe, and these can only come about through quantum mechanical state reductions - i.e., through measurements. The choice is between: An 'objective' measurement that allows reduction to occur independent of conscious observers, and an 'observer' based measurement that ties reduction to the existence of a conscious observer. It is shown in this paper that that choice cannot be determined empirically; so how we finally understand state reduction will be decided by the way that reduction is used in a wider (future) theoretical framework. Key Words: consciousness, decoherence, stochastic choice, wave collapse.

Another interpretation of this equation seems to solve that problem, but then another difficulty arises. We conclude that the Penrose theory cannot reflect the timing implicit in the Hamiltonian dynamics unless it can be amended to take account of the probability current flow between competing states. Key Words: decoherence, probability current, stochastic choice, wave collapse.

title: Detecting N-particle interference patterns with linear balanced N-port analyzers

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A standard two-path interferometer fed into a linear N-port analyzer with coincidence detection of its output ports is analyzed. The N-port is assumed to be implemented as a discrete Fourier transformation $\cal F$, i.e., to be balanced. For unbound bosons it allows us to detect N-particle interference patterns with an N-fold reduction of the observed de Broglie wavelength, perfect visibility and minimal noise. Because the scheme involves heavy filtering a lot of the signal is lost, yet, it is surprisingly robust against common experimental imperfections, and can be implemented with current technology.

abstract: We have measured the deca-triplet s-wave scattering length of the bosonic chromium isotopes $^{52}$Cr and $^{50}$Cr. From the time constants for cross-dimensional thermalization in atomic samples we have determined the magnitudes $|a(^{52}Cr)|=(170 \pm 39)a_0$ and $|a(^{50}Cr)|=(40 \pm 15)a_0$, where $a_0=0.053nm$. By measuring the rethermalization rate of $^{52}$Cr over a wide temperature range and comparing the temperature dependence with the effective-range theory and single-channel calculations, we have obtained strong evidence that the sign of $a(^{52}Cr)$ is positive. Rescaling our $^{52}$Cr model potential to $^{50}$Cr strongly suggests that $a(^{50}Cr)$ is positive, too.

abstract: What is the time-optimal way of using a set of control Hamiltonians to obtain a desired interaction? Vidal, Hammerer and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002) 237902] have obtained a set of powerful results characterizing the time-optimal simulation of a two-qubit quantum gate using a fixed interaction Hamiltonian and fast local control over the individual qubits. How practically useful are these results? We prove that there are two-qubit Hamiltonians such that time-optimal simulation requires infinitely many steps of evolution, each infinitesimally small, and thus is physically impractical. A procedure is given to determine which two-qubit Hamiltonians have this property, and we show that almost all Hamiltonians do. Finally, we determine some bounds on the penalty that must be paid in the simulation time if the number of steps is fixed at a finite number, and show that the cost in simulation time is not too great.

abstract: By using the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation, the exact solutions of the {\it time-dependent} Schr\"{o}dinger equations which govern the various Lie-algebraic quantum systems in atomic physics, quantum optics, nuclear physics and laser physics are obtained. It is shown that the {\it explicit} solutions may also be obtained by working in a sub-Hilbert-space corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of the conserved generator ({\it i. e.}, the {\it time-independent} invariant) for some quantum systems without quasi-algebraic structures. The global and topological properties of geometric phases and their adiabatic limit in time-dependent quantum systems/models are briefly discussed.

abstract: We examine the possibility that a metastable quantum state could experiment a phenomenon similar to thermal activation but at zero temperature. In order to do that we study the real-time dynamics of the reduced Wigner function in a simple open quantum system: an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic potential linearly interacting with an environment of harmonic oscillators. Our results suggest that this activation-like phenomenon exists indeed as a consequence of the fluctuations induced by the environment and that its associated decay rate is comparable to the tunneling rate as computed by the instanton method, at least for the particular potential of the system and the distribution of frequencies for the environment considered in this paper. However, we are not able to properly deal with the term which leads to tunneling in closed quantum systems, and a definite conclusion cannot be reached until tunneling and activation-like effects are considered simultaneously.

Indeed, it is shown that this proof is essentially the only one which fulfils (a), (b), and (c).

abstract: The Bennett-Brassard cryptographic scheme (BB84) needs two bases, at least one of them linearly polarized. The problem is that linear polarization formulated in terms of helicities is not a relativistically covariant notion: State which is linearly polarized in one reference frame becomes depolarized in another one. We show that a relativistically moving receiver of information should define linear polarization with respect to projection of Pauli-Lubanski's vector in a principal null direction of the Lorentz transformation which defines the motion, and not with respect to the helicity basis. Such qubits do not depolarize.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a complex open quantum many-body system. The coupling to external degrees of freedom can be viewed as a coupling to a radiation field, to continuum states or to a measuring apparatus. This perturbation is treated in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The influence of such coupling on the properties of the many-body dynamics is discussed, with emphasis on new effects related to dynamical segregation of fast and slow decays and the phase transition to Dicke superradiance. Relations to quantum optics, continuum shell model, theory of measurement, quantum chaos, percolation theory, and to quantum reactions are stressed.

abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement is an approach to quantifying entanglement that is based on the Hilbert-space distance (or, equivalently, angle) between pure states and their best unentangled approximants. An entanglement witness is an operator that reveals entanglement for a given entangled state. A connection is identified between entanglement witnesses and the geometric measure of entanglement. This offers a new interpretation of the geometric measure of entanglement of a state, and renders it experimentally verifiable, doing so most readily for states that are pure.

abstract: This work is based on the idea that extension of physical and mathematical theories to include the amount of space, time, momentum, and energy resources required to determine properties of systems may influence what is true in physics and mathematics at a foundational level. Background material, on the dependence of region or system sizes on both the resources required to study the regions or systems and the indirectness of the reality status of the systems, suggests that one associate to each amount, r, of resources a domain, D_{r}, a theory, T_{r}, and a language, L_{r}. D_{r} is limited in that all statements in D_{r} require at most r resources to verify or refute. T_{r} is limited in that any theorem of T_{r} must be provable using at most r resources. Also any theorem of T_{r} must be true in D_{r}. L_{r} is limited in that all expressions in L_{r} require at most r resources to create, display, and maintain. A partial ordering of the resources is used to describe minimal use of resources, a partial ordering of the T_{r}, and motion of an observer using resources to acquire knowledge. Reflection principles are used to push the effect of Godel's incompleteness theorem on consistency up in the partial ordering. It is suggested that a coherent theory of physics and mathematics, or theory of everything, is a common extension of all the T_{r}.

abstract: We introduce a class of multiparticle entanglement purification protocols that allow us to distill a large class of entangled states. These include cluster states, GHZ states and various error correction codes all of which belong to the class of two-colorable graph states. We analyze these schemes under realistic conditions and observe that they are scalable, i.e. the threshold value for imperfect local operations does not depend on the number of parties for many of these states. When compared to schemes based on bipartite entanglement purification, the protocol is more efficient and the achievable quality of the purified states is larger. As an application we discuss an experimental realization of the protocol in optical lattices which allows one to purify cluster states.

In particular, there are $(2n+1)$-qubit states for which a one bit message doubles the optimal classical mutual information between measurement results on the subsystems, from $n/2$ bits to $n$ bits. States exhibiting this behavior need not be entangled. We study the range of states exhibiting this phenomenon and bound its magnitude.

abstract: We show unexpected connection of Set Theoretical Forcing with Quantum Mechanical lattice of projections over some separable Hilbert space. The basic ingredient of the construction is the rule of indistinguishability of Standard and some Nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic. The ingeneric reals introduced by M. Ozawa will correspond to simultaneous measurement of incompatible observables. We also discuss some results concerning model theoretical analysis of Small Exotic Smooth Structures on topological 4-space. Forcing appears rather naturally in this context and the rule of indistinguishability is crucial again. As an unexpected application we are able to approach Maldacena Conjecture on $AdS/CFT$ correspondence in the case of AdS_5xS^5 and Super YM Conformal Field Theory in 4 dimensions. We conjecture that there is possibility of breaking Supersymetry via sources of gravity generated in 4 dimensions by exotic smooth structures on R^4 emerging in this context.

This scheme could reveal itself as an efficient tool for quantizing physical systems for which more traditional methods like geometric quantization are uneasy to implement. The procedure is illustrated by (mostly two-dimensional) elementary examples in which the measure space is a $N$-element set and the unit interval. Spaces of states for the $N$-element set and the unit interval are the 2-dimensional euclidean $\R^2$ and hermitian $\C^2$ planes.

This result, which is in agreement with recent experiments, is confirmed by both a physical analysis of the problem and by a perturbative calculation in the weak coupling limit.

abstract: Consider two quantum systems A and B interacting according to a product Hamiltonian H = H_A x H_B. We show that any two such Hamiltonians can be used to simulate each other reversibly (i.e., without efficiency losses) with the help of local unitary operations and local ancillas. Accordingly, all non-local features of a product Hamiltonian -- including the rate at which it can be used to produce entanglement, transmit classical or quantum information, or simulate other Hamiltonians -- depend only upon a single parameter. We identify this parameter and use it to obtain an explicit expression for the entanglement capacity of all product Hamiltonians. Finally, we show how the notion of simulation leads to a natural formulation of measures of the strength of a nonlocal Hamiltonian.

abstract: We analyze the relation between the entanglement and spin-squeezing parameter in the two-atom Dicke model and identify the source of the discrepancy recently reported by Banerjee and Zhou et al that one can observe entanglement without spin squeezing. Our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for entanglement, one associated with the two-photon coherences that create two-photon entangled states, and the other associated with populations of the collective states. We find that the spin-squeezing parameter correctly predicts entanglement in the two-atom Dicke system only if it is associated with two-photon entangled states, but fails to predict entanglement when it is associated with the entangled symmetric state. This explicitly identifies the source of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without spin-squeezing. We illustrate these findings in three examples of the interaction of the system with thermal, classical squeezed vacuum and quantum squeezed vacuum fields.

However, in this paper I show that it is impossible to construct a photodetector with single-photon resolution when we are restricted to single-photon sources, linear optical elements and projective measurements with standard (non-photon-number discriminating) photodetectors. These devices include SPR detectors that sometimes fail to distinguish one- and two-photon inputs, but at the same time indicate this failure.

abstract: For chaotic systems there is a theory for the decay of the survival probability, and for the parametric dependence of the local density of states. This theory leads to the distinction between "perturbative" and "non-perturbative" regimes, and to the observation that semiclassical tools are useful in the latter case. We discuss what is "left" from this theory in the case of one-dimensional systems. We demonstrate that the remarkably accurate {\em uniform} semiclassical approximation captures the physics of {\em all} the different regimes, though it cannot take into account the effect of strong localization.

abstract: We demonstrate an alternative method for calculating the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete one-coin quantum walk on the infinite line, via the Jacobi polynomials that arise in the path integral representation. This is significantly easier to use than the Darboux method. It also provides a single integral representation for the wavefunction that works over the full range of positions, $n,$ including throughout the transitional range where the behaviour changes from oscillatory to exponential. Previous analyses of this system have run into difficulties in the transitional range, because the approximations on which they were based break down here. The fact that there are two different kinds of approach to this problem (Path Integral vs. Schr\"{o}dinger wave mechanics) is ultimately a manifestation of the equivalence between the path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the original formulation developed in the 1920s. We discuss how and why our approach is related to the two methods that have already been used to analyse these systems.

abstract: Pauli's theorem asserts that the canonical commutation relation $[T,H]=iI$ only admits Hilbert space solutions that form a system of imprimitivities on the real line, so that only non-self-adjoint time operators exist in single Hilbert quantum mechanics. This, however, is contrary to the fact that there is a large class of solutions to $[T,H]=iI$, including self-adjoint time operator solutions for semibounded and discrete Hamiltonians. Consequently the theorem has brushed aside and downplayed the rest of the solution set of the time-energy canonical commutation relation.

The bit is not encoded with the form of the quantum states, and delaying the measurement is required. Therefore the protocol will not be denied by the Mayers-Lo-Chau no-go theorem, and unconditional security is achieved.

This is defined as a sum of differences in partial knowledge over a complete set of mutually complementary measurements for the two states. It is shown that the measure is operationally invariant and it is equivalent to the Hilbert-Schmidt distance. The operational measure of distance provides a remarkable interpretation of the information distance between quantum states.

abstract: An ideal controlled-NOT gate followed by projective measurements can be used to identify specific Bell states of its two input qubits. When the input qubits are each members of independent Bell states, these projective measurements can be used to swap the post-selected entanglement onto the remaining two qubits. Here we apply this strategy to produce heralded two-photon polarization entanglement using Bell states that originate from independent parametric down-conversion sources, and a particular probabilistic controlled-NOT gate that is constructed from linear optical elements. The resulting implementation is closely related to an earlier proposal by Sliwa and Banaszek [quant-ph/0207117], and can be intuitively understood in terms of familiar quantum information protocols. The possibility of producing a ``pseudo-demand'' source of two-photon entanglement by storing and releasing these heralded pairs from independent cyclical quantum memory devices is also discussed.

abstract: In Everett's many worlds interpretation, where quantum measurements are seen as decoherence events, inexact decoherence may let large worlds mangle the memories of observers in small worlds, creating a cutoff in observable world size. I solve a growth-drift-diffusion-absorption model of such a mangled worlds scenario, and show that it reproduces the Born probability rule closely, though not exactly. Thus deviations from exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived in a many worlds approach via world counting, using a finite number of worlds and no new fundamental physics.

abstract: We develop and implement a method for modeling decoherence processes on an N-dimensional quantum system that requires only an $N^2$-dimensional quantum environment and random classical fields. This model offers the advantage that it may be implemented on small quantum information processors in order to explore the intermediate regime between semiclassical and fully quantum models. We consider in particular $\sigma_z\sigma_z$ system-environment couplings which induce coherence (phase) damping, though the model is directly extendable to other coupling Hamiltonians. Effective, irreversible phase-damping of the system is obtained by applying an additional stochastic Hamiltonian on the environment alone, periodically redressing it and thereby irreversibliy randomizing the system phase information that has leaked into the environment as a result of the coupling. This model is exactly solvable in the case of phase-damping, and we use this solution to describe the model's behavior in some limiting cases. In the limit of small stochastic phase kicks the system's coherence decays exponentially at a rate which increases linearly with the kick frequency. In the case of strong kicks we observe an effective decoupling of the system from the environment. We present a detailed implementation of the method on an nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor.

abstract: It has been argued [T. Rudolph and B.C. Sanders, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 077903 (2001)] that continuous-variable quantum teleportation at optical frequencies has not been achieved because the source used (a laser) was not `truly coherent'. Van Enk, and Fuchs [Phys. Rev. Lett, {\bf 88}, 027902 (2002)], while arguing against Rudolph and Sanders, also accept that an `absolute phase' is achievable, even if it has not been achieved yet. I will argue to the contrary that `true coherence' or `absolute phase' is always illusory, as the concept of absolute time on a scale beyond direct human experience is meaningless. All we can ever do is to use an agreed time standard. In this context, a laser beam is fundamentally as good a `clock' as any other. I explain in detail why this claim is true, and defend my argument against various objections. In the process I discuss super-selection rules, quantum channels, and the ultimate limits to the performance of a laser as a clock. For this last topic I use some earlier work by myself [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 4083 (1999)] and Berry and myself [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 65}, 043803 (2002)] to show that a Heisenberg-limited laser with a mean photon number $\mu$ can synchronize $M$ independent clocks each with a mean-square error of $\sqrt{M}/4\mu$ radians$^2$.

We show that, in the adiabatic approximantion, the preparation of the initial atomic state in the intermediate level |i> becomes crucial for obtaing the degenerated parametric amplification process.

abstract: A simple model of quantum particle is proposed in which the particle in a {\it macroscopic} rest frame is represented by a {\it microscopic d}-dimensional oscillator, {\it s=(d-1)/2} being the spin of the particle. The state vectors are defined simply by complex combinations of coordinates and momenta. It is argued that the observables of the system are Hermitian forms (corresponding uniquely to Hermitian matrices). Quantum measurements transforms the equilibrium state obtained after preparation into a family of equilibrium states corresponding to the critical values of the measured observable appearing as values of a random quantity associated with the observable. Our main assumptions state that: i) in the process of measurement the measured observable tends to minimum, and ii) the mean value of every random quantity associated with an observable in some state is proportional to the value of the corresponding observable at the same state. This allows to obtain in a very simple manner the Born rule.

The model is exactly solvable and exhibits several interesting features. Besides an amazingly robust absence of any PT symmetry breaking, we observe a quasi-degeneracy of the levels which occurs all over the energy range including the high-energy domain. This pattern is interpreted as a manifestation of certain "quantum beats".

abstract: Arbitrary quantum states cannot be copied. In fact, to make a copy we must provide complete information about the system. However, can a quantum system self-replicate? This is not answered by the no-cloning theorem. In the classical context, Von Neumann showed that a `universal constructor' can exist which can self-replicate an arbitrary system, provided that it had access to instructions for making copy of the system. We question the existence of a universal constructor that may allow for the self-replication of an arbitrary quantum system. We prove that there is no deterministic universal quantum constructor which can operate with finite resources. Further, we delineate conditions under which such a universal constructor can be designed to operate dterministically and probabilistically.

We also discuss how this method can be used for recently proposed single-photon two-qubit quantum cryptography protocol.

abstract: Limitation of computational resources is considered as a universal principle that for simulation is as fundamental as physical laws are. It claims that all experimentally verifiable implications of physical laws can be simulated by the effective classical algorithms. It is demonstrated through a completely deterministic approach proposed for the simulation of biopolymers assembly. A state of molecule during its assembly is described in terms of the reduced density matrix permitting only limited tunneling. An assembly is treated as a sequence of elementary scatterings of simple molecules from the environment on the point of assembly. A decoherence is treated as a forced measurement of quantum state resulted from the shortage of computational resource. All results of measurements are determined by a choice from the limited number of special options of the nonphysical nature which stay unchanged till the completion of assembly; we do not use the random numbers generators. Observations of equal states during the assembly always give the same result. We treat a scenario of assembly as an establishing of the initial states for elementary scatterings. The different scenarios are compared according to the distributions of the assembly results.

A \textit{universal} set of quantum gates is deemed available by means of all unitary single bit operations and a controlled-not (\textsc{cnot}) sequence. We use multi-dimensional MQC theory and time-dependent first order perturbation theory to analyze the model. Our calculations show that a two qubit arrangement, each having a diameter of 200nm, operating in the flux regime can be operated with a static magnetic field of $\sim 0.1$T, and an alternating dynamic magnetic field of amplitude $\sim 1$ Gauss and frequency $\sim 10$Hz. The operational time $\tau_{op}$ is estimated to be $\sim 10$ns.

abstract: Inherent gate errors can arise in quantum computation when the actual system Hamiltonian or Hilbert space deviates from the desired one. Two important examples we address are spin-coupled quantum dots in the presence of spin-orbit perturbations to the Heisenberg exchange interaction, and off-resonant transitions of a qubit embedded in a multilevel Hilbert space. We propose a ``dressed qubit'' transformation for dealing with such inherent errors. Unlike quantum error correction, the dressed qubits method does not require additional operations or encoding redundancy, is insenstitive to error magnitude, and imposes no new experimental constraints.

abstract: We show that, in a system with defects, two-particle states may experience destructive quantum interference, or antiresonance. It prevents an excitation localized on a defect from decaying even where the decay is allowed by energy conservation. The system studied is a qubit chain or an equivalent spin chain with an anisotropic ($XXZ$) exchange coupling in a magnetic field. The chain has a defect with an excess on-site energy. It corresponds to a qubit with the level spacing different from other qubits. We show that, because of the interaction between excitations, a single defect may lead to multiple localized states. The energy spectra and localization lengths are found for two-excitation states. The localization of excitations facilitates the operation of a quantum computer. Analytical results for strongly anisotropic coupling are confirmed by numerical studies.

abstract: Quantum algorithms for several problems in graph theory are considered. Classical algorithms for finding the lowest weight path between two points in a graph and for finding a minimal weight spanning tree involve searching over some space. Modification of classical algorithms due to Dijkstra and Prim allows quantum search to replace classical search and leads to more efficient algorithms. In the case of highly asymmetric complete bipartite graphs, simply replacing classical search with quantum search leads to a faster quantum algorithm. A fast quantum algorithm for computing the diameter of a complete graph is also given.

abstract: We unify the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) and the "bang-bang" (BB) decoupling method for suppressing decoherence in open quantum systems: in both cases strong coupling to an external system or apparatus induces a dynamical superselection rule that partitions the open system's Hilbert space into quantum Zeno subspaces. Our unification makes use of von Neumann's ergodic theorem and avoids making any of the symmetry assumptions usually made in discussions of BB. Thus we are able to generalize BB to arbitrary fast and strong pulse sequences, requiring no symmetry, and to show the existence of two alternatives to pulsed BB: continuous decoupling, and pulsed measurements. Our unified treatment enables us to derive limits on the efficacy of the BB method: we explicitly show that the inverse QZE implies that BB can in some cases accelerate, rather than inhibit, decoherence.

abstract: We obtain the solution of a relativistic wave equation and compare it with the solution of the Schroedinger equation for a source with a sharp onset and excitation frequencies below cut-off. A scaling of position and time reduces to a single case all the (below cut-off) nonrelativistic solutions, but no such simplification holds for the relativistic equation, so that qualitatively different ``shallow'' and ``deep'' tunneling regimes may be identified relativistically. The nonrelativistic forerunner at a position beyond the penetration length of the asymptotic stationary wave does not tunnel; nevertheless, it arrives at the traversal (semiclassical or B\"uttiker-Landauer) time "tau". The corresponding relativistic forerunner is more complex: it oscillates due to the interference between two saddle point contributions, and may be characterized by two times for the arrival of the maxima of lower and upper envelops. There is in addition an earlier relativistic forerunner, right after the causal front, which does tunnel. Within the penetration length, tunneling is more robust for the precursors of the relativistic equation.

abstract: The impact of the operator-valued commutator on nonclassical properties of continuous polarization variables is discussed. The definition of polarization squeezing is clarified to exclude those squeezed states which do not contain any new physics beyond quadrature squeezing. We present a consistent derivation of the general nonseparability criterion for the continuous variables with the operator-valued commutator, and apply it to the polarization variables.

abstract: We describe several different methods for generating the entangled ancilla states that are required for linear optics quantum computing. We show that post-selection can be used in combination with linear optical elements to generate the entangled ancilla, but with an exponentially-small efficiency. Alternatively, the ancilla can be efficiently generated using solid-state devices consisting of quantum wells coupled with tunnel junctions. Finally, we consider the possibility of using encoded ancilla in order to reduce the effects of decoherence and measurement errors.

abstract: We consider the class of functions whose value depends only on the intersection of the input X_1,X_2, ..., X_t; that is, for each F in this class there is an f_F: 2^{[n]} \to {0,1}, such that F(X_1,X_2, ..., X_t) = f_F(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap ... \cap X_t). We show that the t-party k-round communication complexity of F is Omega(s_m(f_F)/(k^2)), where s_m(f_F) stands for the `monotone sensitivity of f_F' and is defined by s_m(f_F) \defeq max_{S\subseteq [n]} |{i: f_F(S \cup {i}) \neq f_F(S)|. For two-party quantum communication protocols for the set disjointness problem, this implies that the two parties must exchange Omega(n/k^2) qubits. For k=1, our lower bound matches the Omega(n) lower bound observed by Buhrman and de Wolf (based on a result of Nayak, and for 2 <= k <= n^{1/4}, improves the lower bound of Omega(sqrt{n}) shown by Razborov. (For protocols with no restrictions on the number of rounds, we can conclude that the two parties must exchange Omega(n^{1/3}) qubits. This, however, falls short of the optimal Omega(sqrt{n}) lower bound shown by Razborov.)

abstract: Bipartite entanglement may be reduced if there are restrictions on allowed local operations. We introduce the concept of a generalized superselection rule (SSR) to describe such restrictions, and quantify the entanglement constrained by it. We show that ensemble quantum information processing, where elements in the ensemble are not individually addressable, is subject to the SSR associated with the symmetric group (the group of permutations of elements). We prove that even for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, each pair described by a pure Bell state, the entanglement per element constrained by this SSR goes to zero for a large number of elements.

abstract: It is well-known that the action of a quantum channel on a state can be represented, using an auxiliary space, as the partial trace of an associated bipartite state. Recently, it was observed that for the bipartite state associated with the optimal average input of the channel, the entanglement of formation is simply the entropy of the reduced density matrix minus the Holevo capacity. It is natural to ask if every bipartite state can be associated with some channel in this way. We show that the answer is negative.

abstract: The system whose Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the generators of SU(1,1) group with time-dependent coefficients is studied. It is shown that there is a unitary relation between the system and a system whose Hamiltonian is simply proportional to the generator of the compact subgroup of the SU(1,1). The unitary relation is described by the classical solutions of a time-dependent (harmonic) oscillator. Making use of the relation, the wave functions satisfying the Schr\"{o}dinger equation are given for a general unitary representation in terms of the matrix elements of a finite group transformation (Bargmann function). The wave functions of the harmonic oscillator with an inverse-square potential is studied in detail, and it is shown that, through an integral, the model provides a way of deriving the Bargmann function for the representation of positive discrete series of the SU(1,1).

abstract: The principal obstacle to quantum information processing with many qubits is decoherence. One source of decoherence is spontaneous emission which causes loss of energy and information. Inability to control system parameters with high precision is another possible source of error. Strategies aimed at overcoming one kind of error typically increase sensitivity to others. As a solution we propose quantum computing with dissipation-assisted quantum gates. These can be run relatively fast while achieving fidelities close to one. The success rate of each gate operation can, at least in principle, be arbitrary close to one.

It is shown that the minimal-coupling scheme and the multipolar-coupling scheme lead to essentially the same formula for the van der Waals potential. As an application, the vdW potential of an atom in the presence of a sphere is derived. Closed expressions for the long-distance (retardation) and short-distance (non-retardation) limits are given, and the effect of material absorption is discussed.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303153
abstract: In a previous article [H. Bergeron, J. Math. Phys. 42, 3983 (2001)], we presented a method to obtain a continuous transition from classical to quantum mechanics starting from the usual phase space formulation of classical mechanics. This procedure was based on a Koopman-von Neumann approach where classical equations are reformulated into a quantumlike form. In this article, we develop a different derivation of quantum equations, based on purely classical stochastic arguments, taking some elements from the Bohm-Fenyes-Nelson approach. This study starts from a remark noticed by different authors [M. Born, Physics in My Generation (Pergamon Press, London, 1956); E. Prugovecki, Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime (Reidel, Dordrecht, 1986)], suggesting that physical continuous observables are stochastic by nature. Following this idea, we study how intrinsic stochastic properties can be introduced into the framework of classical mechanics. Then we analyze how the quantum theory can emerge from this modified classical framework. This approach allows us to show that the transition from classical to quantum formalism (for a spinless particle) does not require real postulates, but rather soft generalizations.

abstract: We apply Renormalization Group (RG) techniques to Classical Information Theory, in the limit of large codeword size $n$. In particular, we apply RG techniques to (1) noiseless coding (i.e., a coding used for compression) and (2) noisy coding (i.e., a coding used for channel transmission). Shannon's "first" and "second" theorems refer to (1) and (2), respectively. Our RG technique uses composition class (CC) ideas, so we call our technique Composition Class Renormalization Group (CCRG). Often, CC's are called "types" instead of CC's, and their theory is referred to as the "Method of Types". For (1) and (2), we find that the probability of error can be expressed as an Error Function whose argument contains variables that obey renormalization group equations. We describe a computer program called WimpyRG-C1.0 that implements the ideas of this paper. C++ source code for WimpyRG-C1.0 is publicly available.

abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement, originated by Shimony and by Barnum and Linden, is determined for a family of tripartite mixed states consisting of aribitrary mixtures of GHZ, W, and inverted-W states. For this family of states, other measures of entanglement, such as entanglement of formation and relative entropy of entanglement, have not been determined. The results for the geometric measure of entanglement are compared with those for negativity, which are also determined. The results for the geometric measure of entanglement and the negativity provide examples of the determination of entanglement for nontrivial mixed multipartite states.

The main goal of the present effort is to show that the classical BBGKY hierarchical equation, for the $n$-particle reduced distribution function, is the ancestor of the $n$-particle Schr\"odinger equation. On the other hand we show that within the scenario of the subquantum structure of quantum particle, the Fisher information measure emerges naturally in quantum mechanics.

abstract: Computations with a future quantum computer will be implemented through the operations by elementary quantum gates. It is now well known that the collection of 1-bit and 2-bit quantum gates are universal for quantum computation, i.e., any n-bit unitary operation can be carried out by concatenations of 1-bit and 2-bit elementary quantum gates. Three contemporary quantum devices--cavity QED, ion traps and quantum dots--have been widely regarded as perhaps the most promising candidates for the construction of elementary quantum gates. In this paper, we describe the physical properties of these devices, and show the mathematical derivations based on the interaction of the laser field as control with atoms, ions or electron spins, leading to the following: (i) the 1-bit unitary rotation gates; and (ii) the 2-bit quantum phase gates and the controlled-not gate. This paper is aimed at providing a sufficiently self-contained survey account of analytical nature for mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists to aid interdisciplinary understanding in the research of quantum computation.

abstract: Bipartite entanglement is one of the fundamental quantifiable resources of quantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to the theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1 generalised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann measurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla. By considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement directions and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of entanglement cost E_min(M) of M. We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a given POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost and explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We prove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any dimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of the cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs. The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions symmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an analytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of any d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly than any other POVM with d>2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This strongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.

It is shown that two qubits can be encoded in a single qutrit in such a way that one can faithfully reconstruct the state of one qubit. Decision on which of these two qubits is to be reconstructed can be made long after the encoding took place. The scheme succeeds with the average probability of 2/3.

abstract: Harry Buhrman et al gave an Omega(sqrt n) lower bound for monotone graph properties in the adjacency matrix query model. Their proof is based on the polynomial method. However for some properties stronger lower bounds exist. We give an Omega(n^{3/2}) bound for Graph Connectivity using Andris Ambainis' method, and an O(n^{3/2} log n) upper bound based on Grover's search algorithm. In addition we study the adjacency list query model, where we have almost matching lower and upper bounds for Strong Connectivity of directed graphs.

abstract: In a recently proposed interpretation of quantum mechanics, U. Mohrhoff advocates original and thought-provoking views on space and time, the definition of macroscopic objects, and the meaning of probability statements. The interpretation also addresses a number of questions about factual events and the nature of reality. The purpose of this note is to examine several issues raised by Mohrhoff's interpretation, and to assess whether it helps providing solutions to the long-standing problems of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We consider the process of spin relaxation in the oscillating cantilever-driven adiabatic reversals technique in magnetic resonance force microscopy. We simulated the spin relaxation caused by thermal excitations of the high frequency cantilever modes in the region of the Rabi frequency of the spin sub-system. The minimum relaxation time obtained in our simulations is greater but of the same order of magnitude as one measured in recent experiments. We demonstrated that using a cantilever with nonuniform cross-sectional area may significantly increase spin relaxation time.

abstract: This paper investigates finite-dimensional representations of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians. In doing so, it clarifies some of the claims made in earlier papers on PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. In particular, it is shown here that there are two ways to extend real symmetric Hamiltonians into the complex domain: (i) The usual approach is to generalize such Hamiltonians to include complex Hermitian Hamiltonians. (ii) Alternatively, one can generalize real symmetric Hamiltonians to include complex PT-symmetric Hamiltonians. In the first approach the spectrum remains real, while in the second approach the spectrum remains real if the PT symmetry is not broken. Both generalizations give a consistent theory of quantum mechanics, but if D>2, a D-dimensional Hermitian matrix Hamiltonian has more arbitrary parameters than a D-dimensional PT-symmetric matrix Hamiltonian.

abstract: A quantum pump device involving magnetic barriers produced by the deposition of ferro magnetic stripes on hetero-structure's is investigated. The device for dc- transport does not provide spin-polarized currents, but in the adiabatic regime, when one modulates two independent parameters of this device, spin-up and spin-down electrons are driven in opposite directions, with the net result being that a finite net spin current is transported with negligible charge current. We also analyze our proposed device for inelastic-scattering and spin-orbit scattering. Strong spin-orbit scattering and more so inelastic scattering have a somewhat detrimental effect on spin/charge ratio especially in the strong pumping regime. Further we show our pump to be almost noiseless, implying an optimal quantum spin pump.

abstract: We investigate measurement of electron transport in quantum dot systems by using single-electron transistor as a noninvasive detector. It is demonstrated that such a detector can operate in the ``negative-result measurement'' regime. In this case the measured current is not distorted, providing that it is a non-coherent one. For a coherent transport, however, the possibility of observing a particular state out of coherent superposition leads to distortion of a measured current even in the ``negative-result measurement'' regime. The corresponding decoherence rate is obtained in the framework of quantum rate equations.

abstract: We investigate continuous variable quantum teleportation. We discuss the methods presently used to characterize teleportation in this regime, and propose an extension of the measures proposed by Grangier and Grosshans \cite{Grangier00}, and Ralph and Lam \cite{Ralph98}. This new measure, the gain normalized conditional variance product $\mathcal{M}$, turns out to be highly significant for continuous variable entanglement swapping procedures, which we examine using a necessary and sufficient criterion for entanglement. We elaborate on our recent experimental continuous variable quantum teleportation results \cite{Bowen03}, demonstrating success over a wide range of teleportation gains. We analyze our results using fidelity; signal transfer, and the conditional variance product; and a measure derived in this paper, the gain normalized conditional variance product.

abstract: We generate and characterise continuous variable polarization entanglement between two optical beams. We first produce quadrature entanglement, and by performing local operations we transform it into a polarization basis. We extend two entanglement criteria, the inseparability criteria proposed by Duan {\it et al.}\cite{Duan00} and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox criteria proposed by Reid and Drummond\cite{Reid88}, to Stokes operators; and use them to charactise the entanglement. Our results for the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox criteria are visualised in terms of uncertainty balls on the Poincar\'{e} sphere. We demonstrate theoretically that using two quadrature entangled pairs it is possible to entangle three orthogonal Stokes operators between a pair of beams, although with a bound $\sqrt{3}$ times more stringent than for the quadrature entanglement.

abstract: We discuss the security implications of noise for quantum coin tossing protocols. We find that if quantum error correction can be used, so that noise levels can be made arbitrarily small, then reasonable security conditions for coin tossing can be framed so that results from the noiseless case will continue to hold. If, however, error correction is not available (as is the case with present day technology), and significant noise is present, then tossing a single coin becomes problematic. In this case, we are led to consider random n-bit string generation in the presence of noise, rather than single-shot coin tossing. We introduce precise security criteria for n-bit string generation and describe an explicit protocol that could be implemented with present day technology. In general, a cheater can exploit noise in order to bias coins to their advantage. We derive explicit upper bounds on the average bias achievable by a cheater for given noise levels.

abstract: We report an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementation of a quantum lattice gas algorithm for the diffusion equation. The algorithm employs an array of quantum information processors sharing classical information, a novel architecture referred to as a type-II quantum computer. This concrete implementation provides a test example from which to probe the strengths and limitations of this new computation paradigm. The NMR experiment consists of encoding a mass density onto an array of 16 two-qubit quantum information processors and then following the computation through 7 time steps of the algorithm. The results show good agreement with the analytic solution for diffusive dynamics. We also describe numerical simulations of the NMR implementation. The simulations aid in determining sources of experimental errors, and they help define the limits of the implementation.

abstract: The security of a cryptographic key that is generated by communication through a noisy quantum channel relies on the ability to distill a shorter secure key sequence from a longer insecure one. For an important class of protocols, which exploit tomographically complete measurements on entangled pairs of any dimension, we show that the noise threshold for classical advantage distillation is identical with the threshold for quantum entanglement distillation. As a consequence, the two distillation procedures are equivalent: neither offers a security advantage over the other.

abstract: A 2-level atom with degenerate ground state interacting with a quantum field is investigated. We show, that the field drives the state of the atom to a stationary state, which is non-unique, but depends on the initial state of the system through some conserved quantities. This non-uniqueness follows from the degeneracy of the ground state of the atom, and when the ground subspace is two-dimensional, the family of stationary states will depend on a one-dimensional parameter. Only one of the stationary states in this family is a pure state, and this state coincides with the known non-coupled population trapped state (zero population in the excited level. Another one stationary state corresponds to an equal weight mixture of the excited level and of the coupled state.

abstract: We introduce the quantum complexity class FQMA. This class describes the complexity of generating a quantum state that serves as a witness for a given QMA problem. In a certain sense, FQMA is the quantum analogue of FNP (function problems associated with NP). The latter describes the complexity of finding a succinct proof for a NP decision problem. Whereas all FNP problems can be reduced to NP, there is no obvious reduction of FQMA to QMA since the solution of FQMA is a quantum state and the solution of QMA the answer yes or no. We consider quantum state generators that get classical descriptions of 3-local Hamiltonians on n qubits as input and prepare low energy states for these systems as output. We show that such state generators can be used to prepare witnesses for QMA problems. Hence low energy state preparation is FQMA-complete. Our proofs are extensions of the proofs by Kitaev et al. and Kempe and Regev for the QMA-completeness of k-local Hamiltonian problems. We show that FQMA can be solved by preparing thermal equilibrium states with an appropriate temperature decreasing as the reciprocal of a polynomial in n.

The method is illustrated with the help of a calculation of quantum mean first passage time in a cubic potential to demonstrate quantum Kramers turnover and quantum Arrhenius plot.

abstract: An ultra cold atomic Bose gas in an optical lattice is shown to provide an ideal system for the controlled analysis of disordered Bose lattice gases. This goal may be easily achieved under the current experimental conditions, by introducing a pseudo-random potential created by a second additional lattice or, alternatively, by placing a speckle pattern on the main lattice. We show that for a non commensurable filling factor, in the strong interaction limit, a controlled growing of the disorder drives a dynamical transition from superfluid to Bose-glass phase. Similarly, in the weak interaction limit, a dynamical transition from superfluid to Anderson-glass phase may be observed. In both regimes, we show that even very low-intensity disorder-inducing lasers cause large modifications of the superfluid fraction of the system.

abstract: We have measured the relaxation time, T1, of the spin of a single electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot (a proposed quantum bit). In a magnetic field, applied parallel to the two-dimensional electron gas in which the quantum dot is defined, Zeeman splitting of the orbital states is directly observed by measurements of electron transport through the dot. By applying short voltage pulses, we can populate the excited spin state with one electron and monitor relaxation of the spin. We find a lower bound on T1 of 50 microseconds at 7.5 T, only limited by our signal-to-noise ratio. A continuous measurement of the charge on the dot has no observable effect on the spin relaxation.

abstract: A quantum-mechanical model for the interaction of Josephson vortices (fluxons) embedded in superconducting transmission line is presented. The vortices interact through emission and absorption of linear waves (electromagnetic cavity modes). We show that in a classical regime this peculiar type of interaction is determined by the product of instantaneous velocities of fluxons. In a quantum regime, this property provides tunable coupling between vortices which can be used for entanglement of vortex qubits. The physical mechanism of the vortex interaction is similar to that proposed for qubits based on trapped ions. Different types of transmission lines mediating the vortex interaction are proposed.

abstract: We determine a lower bound for the entanglement of pairs of electron spins injected into a mesoscopic conductor. The bound can be expressed in terms of experimentally accessible quantities, the zero-frequency current correlators (shot noise power or cross-correlators) after transmission through an electronic beam splitter. The effect of spin relaxation (T_1 processes) and decoherence (T_2 processes) during the ballistic coherent transmission of the carriers in the wires is taken into account within Bloch theory. The presence of a variable inhomogeneous magnetic field allows the determination of a useful lower bound for the entanglement of arbitrary entangled states. The decrease in entanglement due to thermally mixed states is studied. Both the entanglement of the output of a source (entangler) and the relaxation (T_1) and decoherence (T_2) times can be determined.

We extend this approach to formulate reactive flux theory in terms of quantum phase space distribution functions and to derive a time dependent quantum transmission coefficient - a quantum analogue of classical Kramers'-Grote-Hynes coefficient in the spirit of Kohen and Tannor's classical formulation. The theory is valid for arbitrary noise correlation and temperature. The specific forms of this coefficient in the Markovian as well as in the non-Markovian limits have been worked out in detail for intermediate to strong damping regime with an analysis of quantum effects. While the classical transmission coefficient is independent of temperature, its quantum counterpart has significant temperature dependence particularly in the low temperature regime.

The new class of NLSEs is obtained starting from the most general nonlinear classical kinetics compatible with a constant diffusion coefficient D=\hbar/2m. Finally, in the case of s-stationary states, we propose a transformation which linearizes the NLSEs here proposed.

Spin-orbit coupling enters as a small spin precession when electrons tunnel between dots. For adiabatic pulses the resulting gate is described by a unitary operator acting on the four-dimensional Hilbert space of two qubits. If the precession axis is fixed, time-symmetric pulsing constrains the set of possible gates to those which, when combined with single qubit rotations, can be used in a simple CNOT construction. Deviations from time-symmetric pulsing spoil this construction. The effect of time asymmetry is studied by numerically integrating the Schr\"odinger equation using parameters appropriate for GaAs quantum dots. Deviations of the implemented gate from the desired form are shown to be proportional to dimensionless measures of both spin-orbit coupling and time asymmetry of the pulse.

abstract: We compute the shift of the transition temperature for a homogenous weakly interacting Bose gas in leading order in the scattering length a for given particle density n. Using variational perturbation theory through six loops in a classical three-dimensional scalar field theory, we obtain Delta T_c/T_c = 1.25+/-0.13 a n^(1/3), in agreement with recent Monte-Carlo results.

abstract: We propose a spin-independent scheme to generate and detect two-particle entanglement in a mesoscopic normal-superconductor system. A superconductor, weakly coupled to the normal conductor, generates an orbitally entangled state by injecting pairs of electrons into different leads of the normal conductor. The entanglement is detected via violation of a Bell inequality, formulated in terms of zero-frequency current cross-correlators. It is shown that the Bell inequality can be violated for arbitrary strong dephasing in the normal conductor.

abstract: An all-optical scheme to polarize nuclear spins in a single quantum dot is analyzed. The hyperfine interaction with randomly oriented nuclear spins presents a fundamental limit for electron spin coherence in a quantum dot; by cooling the nuclear spins, this decoherence mechanism could be suppressed. The proposed scheme is inspired by laser cooling methods of atomic physics and implements a "controlled Overhauser effect" in a zero-dimensional structure.

abstract: We develop a consistent perturbation theory in quantum fluctuations around the classical evolution of a system of interacting bosons. The zero order approximation gives the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the next order we recover the truncated Wigner approximation, where the evolution is still classical but the initial conditions are distributed according to the Wigner transform of the initial density matrix. Further corrections can be characterized as quantum scattering events, which appear in the form of a nonlinear response of the observable to an infinitesimal displacement of the field along its classical evolution. At the end of the paper we give a few numerical examples to test the formalism.

abstract: We consider dynamics of boson condensates in finite optical lattices under a slow external perturbation which brings the system to the unstable equilibrium. It is shown that quantum fluctuations drive the condensate into the maximally entangled state. We argue that the truncated Wigner approximation being a natural generalization of the Gross-Pitaevskii classical equations of motion is adequate to correctly describe the time evolution including both collapse and revival of the condensate.

abstract: Using perturbation theory in the strong coupling regime, that is, the dual Dyson series, and renormalization group techniques to re-sum secular terms, we obtain the perturbation series of the two-level system driven by a sinusoidal field till second order. The third order correction to the energy levels is obtained proving how this correction does not modify at all the localization condition for a strong field as arising from the zeros of the zero-th Bessel function of integer order. A comparison with weak coupling perturbation theory is done showing how the latter is contained in the strong coupling expansion in the proper limits. This computation gives an explicit analytical form to Floquet eigenstates and quasi-energies for this problem, supporting recent theoretical and experimental findings for quantum devices expected to give a representation for qubits in quantum computation.

abstract: We have observed signatures of resonant tunneling in an Al three-junction qubit, inductively coupled to a Nb LC tank circuit. The resonant properties of the tank oscillator are sensitive to the effective susceptibility (or inductance) of the qubit, which changes drastically as its flux states pass through degeneracy. The tunneling amplitude is estimated from the data. We find good agreement with the theoretical predictions in the regime of their validity.

abstract: The maximum entropy that can be stored in a bounded region of space is in dispute: it goes as volume, implies (non-gravitational) microphysics; it goes as the surface area, asserts the "holographic principle." Here I show how the holographic bound can be derived from elementary flat-spacetime quantum field theory when the total energy of Fock states is constrained gravitationally. This energy constraint makes the Fock space dimension (whose logarithm is the maximum entropy) finite for both Bosons and Fermions. Despite the elementary nature of my analysis, it results in an upper limit on entropy in remarkable agreement with the holographic bound.

We show that the high phase velocity in the slow light regime ensures that the system cannot be used as an analog displaying Hawking radiation. Even though an appropriately designed slow-light set-up may simulate classical features of black holes -- such as horizon, mode mixing, Bogoliubov coefficients, etc. -- it does not reproduce the related quantum effects.

abstract: A new approach is suggested to the problem of quantising causal sets, or topologies, or other such models for space-time (or space). The starting point is the observation that entities of this type can be regarded as objects in a category whose arrows are structure-preserving maps. This motivates investigating the general problem of quantising a system whose `configuration space' (or history-theory analogue) can be regarded as the set of objects in a category. In this first of a series of papers, we study this question in general and develop a scheme based on constructing an analogue of the group that is used in the canonical quantisation of a system whose configuration space is a manifold $Q\simeq G/H$ where G and H are Lie groups. In particular, we choose as the analogue of G the monoid of `arrow fields' on the category. Physically, this means that an arrow between two objects in the category is viewed as some sort of analogue of momentum. After finding the `category quantisation monoid', we show how suitable representations can be constructed using a bundle of Hilbert spaces over the set of objects.

abstract: In the present work the role that a generalized uncertainty principle could play in the quantization of the electromagnetic field is analyzed. It will be shown that we may speak of a Fock space, a result that implies that the concept of photon is properly defined. Nevertheless, in this new context the creation and annihilation operators become a function of the new term that modifies the Heisenberg algebra, and hence the Hamiltonian is not anymore diagonal in the occupation number representation. Additionally, we show the changes that the energy expectation value suffers as result of the presence of an extra term in the uncertainty principle. The existence of a deformed dispersion relation is also proved.

abstract: From the latest experimental readouts in this context an intriguing discrepancy has been elicited. Indeed, theory and experiment dissent by one per cent, and though this fact could be a consequence of the mounting of the experimental device, it might also embody a difference between the way in which gravity behaves in classical and quantum mechanics. In this work the effects, upon the interference pattern, of space--time torsion will be analyzed heeding its coupling with the spin of the neutron beam. It will be proved that, even with this contribution, there is enough leeway for a further discussion of the validity of the equivalence principle in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

We generalize the consideration to the Ermakov systems and construct the action for the time dependent oscillator. Its symmetry group is also the $SL(2,R) \sim SU(1,1)$ group embedded in the Virasoro group in a more complicated way.

abstract: A number of physical systems exhibit a particular form of asymptotic conformal invariance: within a particular range of distances, they are characterized by a long-range conformal interaction (inverse square potential), the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra. Examples from molecular physics to black holes are provided and discussed within a unified treatment. When such systems are physically realized in the appropriate strong-coupling regime,the occurrence of quantum symmetry breaking is possible. This anomaly is revealed by the failure of the symmetry generators to close the algebra in a manner shown to be independent of the renormalization procedure.

abstract: The Dirac equation is solved for a pseudoscalar Coulomb potential in a two-dimensional world. An infinite sequence of bounded solutions are obtained. These results are in sharp contrast with those ones obtained in 3+1 dimensions where no bound-state solutions are found. Next the general two-dimensional problem for pseudoscalar power-law potentials is addressed consenting us to conclude that a nonsingular potential leads to bounded solutions. The behaviour of the upper and lower components of the Dirac spinor for a confining linear potential nonconserving- as well as conserving-parity, even if the potential is unbounded from below, is discussed in some detail.

abstract: After recalling episodes from Pascual Jordan's biography including his pivotal role in the shaping of quantum field theory and his much criticized conduct during the NS regime, I draw attention to his presentation of the first phase of development of quantum field theory in a talk presented at the 1929 Kharkov conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of the beginnings of quantum theory, emphasising that particle-like properties arise as a consequence of treating wave-motions quantum-mechanically. He then goes on to his recent discovery of quantization of ``wave fields'' and problems of gauge invariance. The most surprising aspect of Jordan's presentation is however his strong belief that his field quantization is a transitory not yet optimal formulation of the principles underlying causal, local quantum physics. The expectation of a future more radical change coming from the main architect of field quantization already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite startling. I try to answer the question to what extent Jordan's 1929 expectations have been vindicated. The larger part of the present essay consists in arguing that Jordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical correspondence crutches'', i.e. for an intrinsic approach (which avoids classical fields altogether), is successfully addressed in past and recent publications on local quantum physics.

The discrete spectrum is investigated also in the situation when the ring is placed into a homogeneous magnetic field or threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux and the system exhibits persistent currents.

abstract: It is noted that two-by-two S-matrices in multilayer optics can be represented by the Sp(2) group whose algebraic property is the same as the group of Lorentz transformations applicable to two space-like and one time-like dimensions. It is noted also that Wigner's little groups have a sliderule-like property which allows us to perform multiplications by additions. It is shown that these two mathematical properties lead to a cyclic representation of the S-matrix for multilayer optics, as in the case of ABCD matrices for laser cavities. It is therefore possible to write the N-layer S-matrix as a multiplication of the N single-layer S-matrices resulting in the same mathematical expression with one of the parameters multiplied by N. In addition, it is noted, as in the case of lens optics, multilayer optics can serve as an analogue computer for the contraction of Wigner's little groups for internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles.

abstract: We use the stochastic limit method to study long time quantum dynamics of a test particle interacting with a dilute Bose gas. The case of arbitrary form-factors and an arbitrary, not necessarily equilibrium, quasifree low density state of the Bose gas is considered. Starting from microscopic dynamics we derive in the low density limit a quantum white noise equation for the evolution operator. This equation is equivalent to a quantum stochastic equation driven by a quantum Poisson process with intensity $S-1$, where $S$ is the one-particle $S$ matrix. The novelty of our approach is that the equations are derived directly in terms of correlators, without use of a Fock-antiFock (or Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal) representation. Advantages of our approach are the simplicity of derivation of the limiting equation and that the algebra of the master fields and the Ito table do not depend on the initial state of the Bose gas. The notion of a causal state is introduced. We construct master fields (white noise and number operators) describing the dynamics in the low density limit and prove the convergence of chronological (causal) correlators of the field operators to correlators of the master fields in the causal state.

abstract: We investigate a class of generalized Schr\"{o}dinger operators in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with a singular interaction supported by a smooth curve $\Gamma$. We find a strong-coupling asymptotic expansion of the discrete spectrum in case when $\Gamma$ is a loop or an infinite bent curve which is asymptotically straight. It is given in terms of an auxiliary one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a potential determined by the curvature of $\Gamma$. In the same way we obtain an asymptotics of spectral bands for a periodic curve. In particular, the spectrum is shown to have open gaps in this case if $\Gamma$ is not a straight line and the singular interaction is strong enough.

abstract: Given a completely positive (CP) map $T$, there is a theorem of the Radon-Nikodym type [W.B. Arveson, Acta Math. {\bf 123}, 141 (1969); V.P. Belavkin and P. Staszewski, Rep. Math. Phys. {\bf 24}, 49 (1986)] that completely characterizes all CP maps $S$ such that $T-S$ is also a CP map. This theorem is reviewed, and several alternative formulations are given along the way. We then use the Radon-Nikodym formalism to study the structure of order intervals of quantum operations, as well as a certain one-to-one correspondence between CP maps and positive operators, already fruitfully exploited in many quantum information-theoretic treatments. We also comment on how the Radon-Nikodym theorem can be used to derive norm estimates for differences of CP maps in general, and of quantum operations in particular.

Let further $\{S_{\epsilon}\}_{0\le\epsilon<\eta}$ be a family of measurable subsets of $\Sigma$ such that $\sup_{x\in S_{\epsilon}}|x|= {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)$ as $\epsilon\to 0$. We derive an asymptotic expansion for the discrete spectrum of the Schr{\"o}dinger operator $-\Delta -\beta\delta(\cdot-\Sigma \setminus S_{\epsilon})$ in $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant, as $\epsilon\to 0$. An analogous result is given also for geometrically induced bound states due to a $\delta$ interaction supported by an infinite planar curve.

abstract: Following the Caldeira-Leggett approach to describe dissipative quantum systems the structure function for a harmonic oscillator with Ohmic dissipation is evaluated by an analytic continuation from euclidean to real time. The analytic properties of the Fourier transform of the structure function with respect to the energy transfer (the ``characteristic function'') are studied and utilized. In the one-parameter model of Ohmic dissipation we show explicitly that the broadening of excited states increases with the state number without violating sum rules. Analytic and numerical results suggest that this is a phenomenologically relevant, consistent model to include the coupling of a single (sub-)nuclear particle to unobserved and complex degrees of freedom.

abstract: A generalized contour deformation method (GCDM) which combines complex rotation and translation in momentum space, is discussed. GCDM gives accurate results for bound, virtual (antibound), resonant and scattering states starting with a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. It provides a basis for full off-shell $t$-matrix calculations both for real and complex input energies. Results for both spectral structures and scattering amplitudes compare perfectly well with exact values for the separable Yamaguchi potential. Accurate calculation of virtual states in the Malfliet-Tjon and the realistic CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon interactions are presented. GCDM is also a promising method for the computation of in-medium properties such as the resummation of particle-particle and particle-hole diagrams in infinite nuclear matter. Implications for in-medium scattering are discussed.

abstract: An algorithm and a computer program in Fortran 95 are presented which enumerate the Hugenholtz diagram representation of the many-body perturbation series for the ground state energy with a two-body interaction. The output is in a form suitable for post-processing such as automatic code generation. The results of a particular application, generation of LaTeX code to draw the diagrams, is shown.
