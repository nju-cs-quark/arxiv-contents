abstract: We illustrate a technique for specifying piecewise constant controls for classes of switched electrical networks, typically used in converting power in a dc-dc converter. This procedure makes use of decompositions of SU(2) to obtain controls that are piecewise constant and can be constrained to be bang-bang with values 0 or 1. Complete results are presented for a third order network first. An example, which shows that the basic strategy is viable for fourth order circuits, is also given. The former evolves on SO(3), while the latter evolves on SO(4). Since the former group is intimately related to SU(2) while the latter is related to SU(2)xSU(2), the methodology of this paper uses factorizations of SU(2). The systems in this paper are single input systems with drift. In this paper, no approximations or other artifices are used to remove the drift. Instead, the drift is important in the determination of the controls. Periodicity arguments are rarely used.

abstract: Using the subdynamical kinetic equation for an open quantum system, a formulation is presented for performing decoherence-free (DF) quantum computing in Rigged Liouville Space (RLS). Three types of interactions were considered, and in each case, stationary and evolutionary states were evaluated for DF behavior in both the total space and the projected subspace. Projected subspaces were found using the subdynamics kinetic equation. It was shown that although the total space may be decoherent, the subspace can be DF. In the projected subspace, the evolution of the density operator may be time asymmetric. Hence, a formulation for performing quantum computing in RLS or rigged Hilbert space (RHS) was proposed, and a quantum Controlled-Not Logical gate with corresponding operations in RLS (RHS) was constructed. A generalized quantum Turing machine in RHS was also discussed. Key Words: Quantum Computing, Subdynamics, Rigged Liouvile Space, Decoherence, Open System PACS: 05.30.-d+85.30+82.20.Db+84.35.+i

We use a time-dependent, fully three dimensional approach to study the quantum dynamics of the hydrogen atom subject to high intensity, short wavelength laser pulses. We find enhanced survival probability as the field is increased under fixed envelope conditions. We also confirm wavepacket dynamics seen in prior time-dependent computations restricted to two dimensions.

abstract: Suppose that the Hamiltonian acting on a quantum system is unknown and one wants to determine what is the Hamiltonian. We show that in general this requires a time $\Delta t$ which obeys the uncertainty relation $\Delta t \Delta H \gtrsim 1$ where $\Delta H$ is a measure of how accurately the unknown Hamiltonian must be estimated. We then apply this result to the problem of measuring the energy of an unknown quantum state. It has been previously shown that if the Hamiltonian is known, then the energy can in principle be measured in an arbitrarily short time. On the other hand we show that if the Hamiltonian is not known then an energy measurement necessarily takes a minimum time $\Delta t$ which obeys the uncertainty relation $\Delta t \Delta E \gtrsim 1$ where $\Delta E$ is the precision of the energy measurement. Several examples are studied to address the question of whether it is possible to saturate these uncertainty relations. Their interpretation is discussed in detail.

I then discuss why black holes behave as 1-D objects when emitting entropy, which suggests that a black hole swallows information at a rate restricted by the one-channel information capacity. I discuss fundamental limitations on the information borne by signal pulses in curved spacetime, from which I verify the mentioned bound on the rate of information disposal by a black hole.

abstract: The class MA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by classical probabilistic verifiers using a single classical certificate, and the class QMA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by quantum verifiers using a single quantum certificate. Suppose that a verifier receives not only one but multiple certificates. In the classical setting, it is obvious that a classical verifier with multiple classical certificates is essentially the same with the one with a single classical certificate. However, in the quantum setting where a quantum verifier is given a set of quantum certificates in tensor product form (i.e. each quantum certificate is not entangled with others), the situation is different, because the quantum verifier might utilize the structure of the tensor product form. This suggests a possibility of another hierarchy of complexity classes, namely the QMA hierarchy. From this point of view, we extend the definition of QMA to QMA(k) for the case quantum verifiers use k quantum certificates, and analyze the properties of QMA(k). To compare the power of QMA(2) with that of QMA(1) = QMA, we show one interesting property of ``quantum indistinguishability''. This gives a strong evidence that QMA(2) is more powerful than QMA(1). Furthermore, we show that, for any fixed positive integer $k \geq 2$, if a language L has a one-sided bounded error QMA(k) protocol with a quantum verifier using k quantum certificates, L necessarily has a one-sided bounded error QMA(2) protocol with a quantum verifier using only two quantum certificates.

abstract: We demonstrate how to construct a lorentz-invariant, hidden-variable interpretation of relativistic quantum mechanics based on particle trajectories. The covariant theory that we propose employs a multi-time formalism and a lorentz-invariant rule for the coordination of the space-time points on the individual particle trajectories. In this way we show that there is no contradiction between nonlocality and lorentz invariance in quantum mechanics. The approach is illustrated for relativistic bosons, using a simple model to discuss the individual non-locally correlated particle motion which ensues when the wavefunction is entangled. A simple example of measurement is described.

abstract: An atom that couples to two distinct leaky optical cavities is driven by an external optical white noise field. We describe how entanglement between the light fields sustained by two optical cavities arises in such a situation. The entanglement is maximized for intermediate values of the cavity damping rates and the intensity of the white noise field, vanishing both for small and for large values of these parameters and thus exhibiting a stochastic-resonance-like behaviour. This example illustrates the possibility of generating entanglement by exclusively incoherent means and sheds new light on the constructive role noise may play in certain tasks of interest for quantum information processing.

These algorithms are quantum entropy increasing.

abstract: We study the problem of general entanglement purification protocols. Suppose Alice and Bob share a bipartite state $\rho$ which is ``reasonably close'' to perfect EPR pairs. The only information Alice and Bob possess is a lower bound on the fidelity of $\rho$ and a maximally entangled state. They wish to ``purify'' $\rho$ using local operations and classical communication and create a state that is arbitrarily close to EPR pairs. We prove that on average, Alice and Bob cannot increase the fidelity of the input state significantly. We also construct protocols that may fail with a small probability, and otherwise will output states arbitrarily close to EPR pairs with very high probability. Our constructions are efficient, i.e., they can be implemented by polynomial-size quantum circuits.

Our results will be important for the observation of quantum interference with even larger and more complex objects.

We show that even in the weak-coupling regime, where the Markov approximation applies, entanglement up to 0.35 ebits between two atoms can be created. However, larger entanglement and violation of Bell's inequality can only be achieved in the strong-coupling regime.

abstract: Magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is shown to be a promising technique for implementing quantum computing. The theory underlying the principles of quantum computing with nuclear spin systems undergoing MAS is formulated in the framework of formalized quantum Floquet theory. The procedures for realizing state labeling, state transformation and coherence selection in Floquet space are given. It suggests that by this method, the largest number of qubits can easily surpass that achievable with other techniques. Unlike other modalities proposed for quantum computing, this method enables one to adjust the dimension of the working state space, meaning the number of qubits can be readily varied. The universality of quantum computing in Floquet space with solid state NMR is discussed and a demonstrative experimental implementation of Grover's search is given.

In this paper we propose a generalized search hamiltonian, $H_{g}$. Then the known search hamiltonians become special cases of $H_{g}$. From the generalized search hamiltonian, we present remarkable results that searching with 100% is subject only to the phase factor in $H_{g}$ and independent to the number of states or initialization.

Specifically, I will explore the relation between the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and a fundamental \emph{classicality} property of observables -- their \emph{coexistence}. A derivation of Bell's inequalities for unsharp spins will be given which follows a reconstruction by Mittelstaedt and Stachow of the original EPR argument. In this context we discuss the need for a consistent relativistic description of localised measurements, carried out in spacelike separated regions of spacetime on spatially extended, entangled systems.

abstract: A formulation for performing quantum computing in a projected subspace is presented, based on the subdynamical kinetic equation (SKE) for an open quantum system. The eigenvectors of the kinetic equation are shown to remain invariant before and after interaction with the environment. However, the eigenvalues in the projected subspace exhibit a type of phase shift to the evolutionary states. This phase shift does not destroy the decoherence-free (DF) property of the subspace because the associated fidelity is 1. This permits a universal formalism to be presented - the eigenprojectors of the free part of the Hamiltonian for the system and bath may be used to construct a DF projected subspace based on the SKE. To eliminate possible phase or unitary errors induced by the change in the eigenvalues, a cancellation technique is proposed, using the adjustment of the coupling time, and applied to a two qubit computing system. A general criteria for constructing a DF projected subspace from the SKE is discussed. Finally, a proposal for using triangulation to realize a decoherence-free subsystem based on SKE is presented. The concrete formulation for a two-qubit model is given exactly. Our approach is novel and general, and appears applicable to any type of decoherence.

abstract: Noisy teleportation of nonclassical quantum states via a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state is studied with the completely positive map and the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. Using the nonclassical depth as a measure of transmission performance, we compare the teleportation scheme with the direct transmission through a noisy channel. The noise model is based on the coupling to the vacuum field. It is shown that the teleportation channel has better transmission performance than the direct transmission channel in a certain region. The bounds for such region and for obtaining the nonvanished nonclassicality of the teleported quantum states are also discussed. Our model shows a reasonable agreement with the observed teleportation fidelity in the experiment by Furusawa et al. [Science {\bf 282}, 706 (1998)]. We finally mention the required conditions for transmitting nonclassical features in real experiments.

We show that for diagonal atomic density matrix the parameter of Sorensen et al. fails to show entangled nature of collective atomic state whereas same state is inseparable in accordance with Peres-Horodecki criterion.

A non--unitary step where the evolution operator for the density matrix mimics the effect of diffusion in the semiclassical (large $N$) limit. The process of decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical behavior are analyzed in detail by means of numerical and analitic tools. The existence of a regime where the entropy grows with a rate which is independent of the strength of the diffusion coefficient is demonstrated. The nature of the processes that determine the production of entropy is analyzed.

We directly observe the sought item being found in $\sim\sqrt{N}$ iterations, in the form of a growing intensity peak on this profile. Although the lack of quantum entanglement limits the {\em size} of our database, our results show that entanglement is neither necessary for the algorithm itself, nor for its efficiency.

abstract: The formal solution of a general stargenvalue equation is presented, its properties studied and a geometrical interpretation given in terms of star-hypersurfaces in quantum phase space. Our approach deals with discrete and continuous spectra in a unified fashion and includes a systematic treatment of non-diagonal stargenfunctions. The formalism is used to obtain a complete formal solution of Wigner quantum mechanics in the Heisenberg picture and to write a general formula for the stargenfunctions of Hamiltonians quadratic in the phase space variables in arbitrary dimension. A variety of systems is then used to illustrate the former results.

They satisfy a unity resolution relation in the $C_{\lambda}$-extended oscillator Fock space (or in some subspace thereof) and give rise to Bargmann representations of the latter, wherein the generators of the $C_{\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebra are realized as differential-operator-valued matrices.

abstract: It was recently shown (quant-ph/9909074) that parasitic random interactions between the qubits in a quantum computer can induce quantum chaos and put into question the operability of a quantum computer. In this work I investigate whether already the interactions between the qubits introduced with the intention to operate the quantum computer may lead to quantum chaos. The analysis focuses on two well--known quantum algorithms, namely Grover's search algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform. I show that in both cases the same very unusual combination of signatures from chaotic and from integrable dynamics arises.

abstract: This paper studies privacy and secure function evaluation in communication complexity. The focus is on quantum versions of the model and on protocols with only approximate privacy against honest players. We show that the privacy loss (the minimum divulged information) in computing a function can be decreased exponentially by using quantum protocols, while the class of privately computable functions (i.e., those with privacy loss 0) is not enlarged by quantum protocols. Quantum communication combined with small information leakage on the other hand makes certain functions computable (almost) privately which are not computable using either quantum communication without leakage or classical communication with leakage. We also give an example of an exponential reduction of the communication complexity of a function by allowing a privacy loss of $o(1)$ instead of privacy loss 0.

abstract: Although universal continuous-variable quantum computation cannot be achieved via linear optics (including squeezing), homodyne detection and feed-forward, inclusion of ideal photon counting measurements overcomes this obstacle. These measurements are sometimes described by arrays of beam splitters to distribute the photons across several modes. We show that such a scheme cannot be used to implement ideal photon counting and that such measurements necessarily involve nonlinear evolution. However, this requirement of nonlinearity can be moved "off-line," thereby permitting universal continuous-variable quantum computation with linear optics.

abstract: The commonly used circuit model of quantum computing leaves out the problems of imprecision in the initial state preparation, particle statistics (indistinguishability of particles belonging to the same quantum state), and error correction (current techniques cannot correct all small errors). The initial state in the circuit model computation is obtained by applying potentially imprecise Hadamard gate operations whereas useful quantum computation requires a state with no uncertainty. We review some limitations of the circuit model and speculate on the question if a hierarchy of quantum-type computing models exists.

We use realistic molecular parameters to recognize that, as the problem size expands, shaped pulses must be tailored to maintain fidelity of the algorithm.

abstract: The internal symmetry group U(3,1) of the neutral vector fields with two spins 0 and 1 is investigated. Massless fields correspond to the generalized Maxwell equations with the gradient term. The symmetry transformations in the coordinate space are integro-differential transformations. Using the method of the Hamiltonian formalism the conservation tensors are found, and the quantized theory is studied. The necessity to introduce an indefinite metric is shown. The internal symmetry group U(3,1) being considered, after the transition to electrodynamics, reduces to the U(2) group. It is shown that the group of dual transformations is the subgroup of the group under consideration. All the linearly independent solutions of the equation for a free particle obtained in terms of the projection matrix-dyads.

abstract: Purifying noisy entanglement is a protocol which can increase the entanglement of a mixed state (as a source)at expense of the entanglement of others(as an ancilla)by collective measurement. A protocol with which one can get a pure entangled state from a mixed state is defined as purifying mixed states. We address a basic question: can one get a pure entangled state from a mixed state? We give a necessary and sufficient condition of purifying a mixed state by fit local operations and classical communication and show that for a class of source states and ancilla states in arbitrary bipartite systems purifying mixed states is impossible by finite rounds of purifying protocols. For $2\otimes 2$ systems, it is proved that arbitrary states cannot be purified by individual measurement. The possible application and meaning of the conclusion are discussed.

abstract: It is well known that any entangled mixed state in $2\otimes 2$ systems can be purified via infinite copies of the mixed state. But can one distill a pure maximally entangled state from finite copies of a mixed state in any bipartite system by local operation and classical communication? This is more meaningful in practical application. We give a necessary and sufficient condition of this distillability. This condition can be expressed as: there exists distillable-subspaces. According to this condition, one can judge whether a mixed state is distillable or not easily. We also analyze some properties of distillable-subspaces, and discuss the most efficient purification protocols. Finally, we discuss the distillable enanglement of two-quibt system for the case of finite copies.

abstract: Entangled photon pairs -- discrete light quanta that exhibit non-classical correlations -- play a crucial role in quantum information science (for example in demonstrations of quantum non-locality and quantum cryptography). At the macroscopic optical field level non-classical correlations can also be important, as in the case of squeezed light, entangled light beams and teleportation of continuous quantum variables. Here we use stimulated parametric down-conversion to study entangled states of light that bridge the gap between discrete and macroscopic optical quantum correlations. We demonstrate experimentally the onset of laser-like action for entangled photons. This entanglement structure holds great promise in quantum information science where there is a strong demand for entangled states of increasing complexity.

It is suggested to use a Mach-Zehnder setup and feed both input ports with light generated by a single non-degenerate down-conversion source. The strong quantum correlations of the light in conjunction with boson-enhancement at the input beam splitter allow to detect a two- and fourfold decrease in the observed de Broglie wavelength with perfect visibility. This allows a reduction of the observed de Broglie wavelength below the wavelength of the source.

abstract: A coherent technique for the control of photon propagation in optically thick media and its application for quantum memories is discussed. Raman adiabatic passage with an externally controlled Stokes field can be used to transfer the quantum state of a light pulse (``flying'' qubit) to a collective spin-excitation (stationary qubit) and thereby slow down its propagation velocity to zero. The process is reversible and has a potential fidelity of unity without the necessity for strongly coupling resonators. A simple quasi-particle picture (dark-state polariton) of the transfer is presented. The analytic theory is supplemented with exact numerical solutions. Finally the influence of decoherence mechanisms on collective storage states, which are N-particle entangled states, is analyzed.

abstract: I show that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) predicts a sort of uncertainty principle on the number of the "soft photons" that can be produced in coincidence with the particles that are observed in any EPR experiment. This result is argued to be sufficient to remove the original EPR paradox. A signature of this soft-photons solution of the EPR paradox would be the observation of apparent symmetry violation in single events. On the other hand, in the case of the EPR experiments that have actually been realized, the QED correlations are argued to be very close to those calculated by the previous, incomplete treatment, which showed a good agreement with the data. Finally, the usual interpretation of the correlations themselves as a real sign of nonlocality is also criticized.

abstract: An elementary family of local Hamiltonians $H_{\c ,\ell}, \ell = 1,2,3, ldots$, is described for a $2-$dimensional quantum mechanical system of spin $={1/2}$ particles. On the torus, the ground state space $G_{\circ,\ell}$ is $(\log)$ extensively degenerate but should collapse under $\l$perturbation" to an anyonic system with a complete mathematical description: the quantum double of the $SO(3)-$Chern-Simons modular functor at $q= e^{2 \pi i/\ell +2}$ which we call $DE \ell$. The Hamiltonian $H_{\circ,\ell}$ defines a \underline{quantum} \underline{loop}\underline{gas}. We argue that for $\ell = 1$ and 2, $G_{\circ,\ell}$ is unstable and the collapse to $G_{\epsilon, \ell} \cong DE\ell$ can occur truly by perturbation. For $\ell \geq 3$, $G_{\circ,\ell}$ is stable and in this case finding $G_{\epsilon,\ell} \cong DE \ell$ must require either $\epsilon > \epsilon_\ell > 0$, help from finite system size, surface roughening (see section 3), or some other trick, hence the initial use of quotes ${\l}\quad$". A hypothetical phase diagram is included in the introduction.

abstract: This paper presents some results on some aspects of the two-level atom interacting with a single-mode with the privileged field mode being in the squeezed displaced Fock state (SDFS). The exact results are employed to perform a careful investigation of the temporal evolution of the atomic inversion, entropy and phase distribution. It is shown that the interference between component states leads to non-classical oscillations in the photon number distribution. At mid revival time the field is almost in the pure state. We have briefly discussed the evolution of the Q function of the cavity field. The connection between the field entropy and the collapses and revivals of the atomic inversion has been established. We find that the phase probability distribution of the field reflect the collapses and revivals of the level occupation probabilities in most situations. The interaction brings about the symmetrical splitting of the phase probability distribution. The general conclusions reached are illustrated by numerical results.

The cases x=0 and x=1 correspond respectively to fully random spins and to a fully entangled state. In the first of these series we consider special states $|\tilde{\phi}>$ invariant under charge conjugation, that generalizes the N=2 spin S=1/2 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state, and in the second one we consider generalizations of the Weber density matrices. The evaluation of the critical point $x_c$ was done through bounds coming from the partial transposition method of Peres and the conditional nonextensive entropy criterion. Our results suggest the conjecture that whenever the bounds coming from both methods coincide the result of $x_c$ is the exact one. The results we present are relevant for the discussion of quantum computing, teleportation and cryptography.

abstract: The dynamics of the nuclear-spin quantum computer with large number (L=1000) of qubits is considered using a perturbation approach, based on approximate diagonalization of exponentially large sparse matrices. Small parameters are introduced and used to compute the error in implementation of entanglement between remote qubits, by applying a sequence of resonant radio-frequency pulses. The results of the perturbation theory are tested using exact numerical solutions for small number of qubits.

One of the entangled spins drives the resonant cantilever vibrations, while the other remote spin does not interact directly with the quasiclassical cantilever. The Schr\"odinger cat state of the cantilever reveals two possible outcomes of the measurement for both entangled spins.

abstract: In the present work we solve the motion equations of a particle in a Paul trap embeded in the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass. One of the ideas behind this work concerns the analysis of the effects that the gravity--induced quantum noise, stemming from the bodies in the neighborhood of the Paul trap, could have upon the enhancement of the quantum behavior of this system. This will be done considering a series expansion for the gravitational field of the source, and including in the Hamiltonian of the Paul trap only the first two terms. Higher--order contributions will be introduced as part of the environment of the system, and in consequence will not appear in the Hamiltonian. In other words, we put forward an argument that allows us to differentiate those gravitational degrees of freedom that will appear as an uncontrollable influence on the Paul trap. Along the ideas of the so called restricted path integral formalism, we take into account the continuous monitoring of the position of our particle, and in consequence the corresponding propagators and probabilities, associated with the different measurements outputs, are obtained. Afterwards, the differential equation related to a quantum nondemolition variable is posed and solved, i.e., a family of quantum nondemolition parameters is obtained. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the effects on the system, of the gravity--induced environment, will be done.

abstract: We predict and study the quantum-electrodynamical effect of parametric self-induced excitation of a molecule moving above the dielectric or conducting medium with periodic grating. In this case the radiation reaction force modulates the molecular transition frequency which results in a parametric instability of dipole oscillations even from the level of quantum or thermal fluctuations. The present mechanism of instability of electrically neutral molecules is different from that of the well-known Smith-Purcell and transition radiation in which a moving charge and its oscillating image create an oscillating dipole. We show that parametrically excited molecular bunches can produce an easily detectable coherent radiation flux of up to a microwatt.

abstract: We consider alternative models to quantum mechanics, that have been proposed in the recent years in order to explain the EPR correlations between two particles. These models allow in principle local hidden variables produced at the source, and some superluminal "hidden communication" (or "influences") to reproduce the non-local correlations. Moving to the case of three particles, we show that these alternative models lead to signaling when "hidden communication" alone is considered as the origin of the correlations.

Light scattered from the object is detected in this confined space entirely without the benefit of spatial resolution. Quantum holography offers this possibility by virtue of the fourth-order quantum coherence inherent in entangled beams.

Apart from simple cases (low dimensions, few particles, pure states), however, the mathematical structure of entanglement is not yet fully understood. This tutorial is an introduction to our present knowledge about how to decide whether a given state is separable or entangled, how to characterize entanglement via witness operators, how to classify entangled states according to their usefulness (i.e. distillability), and how to quantify entanglement with appropriate measures.

abstract: The self-consistent propagation of generalized $D_{1}$ [coherent-product] states and of a class of gaussian density matrix generalizations is examined, at both zero and finite-temperature, for arbitrary interactions between the localized lattice (electronic or vibronic) excitations and the phonon modes. It is shown that in all legitimate cases, the evolution of $D_{1}$ states reduces to the disentangled evolution of the component $D_{2}$ states. The self-consistency conditions for the latter amount to conditions for decoherence-free propagation, which complement the $D_{2}$ Davydov soliton equations in such a way as to lift the nonlinearity of the evolution for the on-site degrees of freedom. Although it cannot support Davydov solitons, the coherent-product ansatz does provide a wide class of exact density-matrix solutions for the joint evolution of the lattice and phonon bath in compatible systems. Included are solutions for initial states given as a product of a [largely arbitrary] lattice state and a thermal equilibrium state of the phonons. It is also shown that external pumping can produce self-consistent Frohlich-like effects. A few sample cases of coherent, albeit not solitonic, propagation are briefly discussed.

abstract: We describe an experiment in which two non communicating computers, starting from a common input in the form of sequences of pseudo--random numbers in the interval $[0,2\pi]$, and computing deterministic $\{\pm 1\}$--valued functions, chosen at random and independently, produce sequences of numbers whose correlations coincide with the EPR correlations and therefore violate Bell's inequality. The experiment is the practical implementation of a mathematical model of a classical, deterministic system whose initial state is chosen at random from its state space, with a known initial probability distribution, and whose dynamics exhibits the chameleon effect described below. Such a system satisfies the constraints of pre--determination, locality, causality, local independent choices, singlet law and reproduces the EPR correlations.

abstract: We discuss the possibility that dense antihydrogen could provide a path towards a mechanism for a deep space propulsion system. We concentrate at first, as an example, on Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) antihydrogen. In a Bose-Einstein Condensate, matter (or antimatter) is in a coherent state analogous to photons in a laser beam, and individual atoms lose their independent identity. This allows many atoms to be stored in a small volume. In the context of recent advances in producing and controlling BECs, as well as in making antihydrogen, this could potentially provide a revolutionary path towards the efficient storage of large quantities of antimatter, perhaps eventually as a cluster or solid.

We consider a model in which the system is a qubit, and reaches equilibrium after several successive two-qubit interactions (thermalizing machines) with qubits of a reservoir. We characterize completely the family of thermalizing machines. The model shows a tight link between dissipation, fluctuations, and the maximal entanglement that can be generated by the machines. The interplay of quantum and classical information processes that give rise to practical irreversibility is discussed.

abstract: We consider a strategic problem of the Evesdropping to quantum key distribution. Evesdropper hopes to obtain the maxium information given the disturbance to the qubits is often For this strategy, the optimized individual attack have been extensively constructed under various conditions. However, it seems a difficult task in the case of coherent attack, i.e., Eve may treat a number of intercepted qubits collectively, including the collective unitary transformations and the measurements. It was conjectured by Cirac and Gisin that no coherent attack can be more powerful for this strategy for BB84 protocol. In this paper we give a general conclusion on the role of coherent attacks for the strategy of maxmizing the information given the disturbance. Suppose in a quantum key distribution(QKD) protocol, all the transmitted bits from Alice are independent and only the individual disturbances to each qubits are examined by Alice and Bob. For this type of protocols(so far almost all QKD protocols belong to this type), in principle no coherent attack is more powerful than the product of optimized individual attack to each individual qubits. All coherent attacks to the above QKD protocols can be disregarded for the strategy above.

Also equation for the charge with this spin is derived when electromagnetic field is included. In one example it is shown that the modulus of the spin changes with the gradient of the magnetic field.

abstract: We investigate several classes of state-dependent quantum cloners for three-level systems.

Three distinct classes of qutrit cloners can be distinguished, depending on two, three, or four maximally-conjugate bases are cloned as well (the latter case simply corresponds to the universal qutrit cloner). These results apply to symmetric as well as asymmetric cloners, so that the balance between the fidelity of the two clones can also be analyzed.

abstract: As the first useful Quantum Computers will be quantum simulators, here the minimum number of qubits necessary for the solution of the Schroedinger equation in simple test problems is evaluated. From the present preliminary results it appears that it is possible to realize a useful quantum simulator with a register of only 10-15 qbits. The intrinsic sensitivity to some errors appears to be moderate without the need of error correcting methods. At present there is at least some indication that the amplitude errors are more dangerous than phase and decoherence errors. So corrections limited to amplitude errors may be very useful.

abstract: In this paper, we study decoherence on Grover's quantum searching algorithm using a perturbative method. We assume that each two-state system (qubit) suffers \sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\leq p\leq 1) independently at every step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which Grover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit. (In this large n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\geq 0) can take any real positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an arbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth order term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative parameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of probability P_{th} or more. It satisfies 2Mnp<(8/5)(1-P_{th}) around 2Mnp\simeq 0 and P_{th}\simeq 1, and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of P_{th} approximately. This observation is similar to a result obtained by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani concerning accuracy of quantum gates for general algorithms. We cannot investigate a quantum to classical phase transition of the algorithm, because it is outside the reliable domain of our perturbation theory.

abstract: Quantum entanglement was first recognized as a feature of quantum mechanics in the famous paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [18]. Recently it has been realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper, we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed states in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the physical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In this way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these algebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum enatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important topics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved the algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed states are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low rank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3) simulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive Hamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the corresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples of the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions (thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new separability criterion. On the other hand many examples of entangled mixed states with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view.

abstract: It is proposed that superoscillations play an important role in the interferences which give rise to superluminal effects. To exemplify that, we consider a toy model which allows for a wave packet to travel, in zero time and negligible distortion a distance arbitrarily larger than the width of the wave packet. The peak is shown to result from a superoscillatory superposition at the tail. Similar reasoning applies to the dwell time.

abstract: We address the use of entanglement to improve the precision of generalized quantum interferometry, i.e. of binary measurements aimed to determine whether or not a perturbation has been applied by a given device. For the most relevant operations in quantum optics, we evaluate the optimal detection strategy and the ultimate bounds to the minimum detectable perturbation. Our results indicate that entanglement-assisted strategies improve the discrimination in comparison with conventional schemes. A concrete setup to approach performances of the optimal strategies is also suggested.

abstract: Although Bohr's reply to the EPR argument is supposed to be a watershed moment in the development of his philosophy of quantum theory, it is difficult to find a clear statement of the reply's philosophical point. Moreover, some have claimed that the point is simply that Bohr is a radical positivist. In this paper, we show that such claims are unfounded. In particular, we give a mathematically rigorous reconstruction of Bohr's reply to the \emph{original} EPR argument that clarifies its logical structure, and which shows that it does not rest on questionable philosophical assumptions. Rather, Bohr's reply is dictated by his commitment to provide "classical" and "objective" descriptions of experimental phenomena.

abstract: The original canonical coherent states could be defined in several ways. As applications for other sets of coherent states arose, the rules of definition were correspondingly changed. Among such rule changes were a change of group and relaxation of the analytic nature of the labels. Recent developments have done away with the group connections altogether and thereby allowed sets of coherent states to be defined that are temporally stable for a wide variety of dynamical systems including the hydrogen atom. This article outlines some of the current trends in the definitions and properties of present-day coherent states.

Since the classical ray trajectories (including ray splitting) in such systems are strongly chaotic, this result provides the first explicit quantization of a classically chaotic system.

abstract: We describe a novel tool for the quantum characterization of optical devices. The experimental setup involves a stable reference state that undergoes an unknown quantum transformation and is then revealed by balanced homodyne detection. Through tomographic analysis on the homodyne data we are able to characterize the signal and to estimate parameters of the interaction, such as the loss of an optical component, or the gain of an amplifier. We present experimental results for coherent signals, with application to the estimation of losses introduced by simple optical components, and show how these results can be extended to the characterization of more general optical devices.

abstract: We describe a protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states from decoherence that incorporates design principles from both quantum error correction and quantum feedback control. Our protocol uses continuous measurements and Hamiltonian operations, which are weaker control tools than are typically assumed for quantum error correction. We develop a cost function appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize our state-estimate feedback. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study our protocol for the three-qubit bit-flip code in detail and demonstrate that it can improve the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable using quantum error correction when the time between quantum error correction cycles is limited.

A nonzero DC magnetization component in y direction is a result of broken symmetries. A pairwise interaction between two spins is shown to resonantly increase the induced magnetization by one order of magnitude. We discuss the mechanism of this enhancement, which is due to additional avoided crossings in the level structure of the system.

abstract: Every Bose-Einstein condensate is in a highly entangled state, as a consequence of the fact that the particles in a condensate are distributed over space in a coherent way. It is proved that any two regions within a condensate of finite particle number are entangled. This entanglement does not depend on the distance between the two regions. Criteria for the presence of entanglement are derived in the context of interference experiments. For separable states there is a trade-off between fluctuations in particle number and interference visibility.

abstract: Multisimultaneity is a causal model of relativistic quantum physics which assigns a real time ordering to any set of events, much in the spirit of the pilot-wave picture. Contrary to standard quantum mechanics, it predicts a disappearance of the correlations in a Bell-type experiment when both analysers are in relative motion such that, each one in its own inertial reference frame, is first to select the output of the photons. We tested this prediction using acousto-optic modulators as moving beam-splitters and interferometers separated by 55 m. We didn't observe any disappearance of the correlations, thus refuting Multisimultaneity.

abstract: Light in which the quantum fluctuations have been squeezed is often proposed as a means of obtaining an improved phase reference compared to that available from coherent light. Such a phase reference contains information about the phase of the squeezed light, so it is important to calculate the limits to the amount of ``phase information'' available. I define a phase resolution and show how this scales as we increase the number of photons available when using squeezed light generated by a parametric oscillator. Simple schemes for creating squeezed coherent light using a beam-splitter and an interferometer are analyzed, and it is shown that the results agree with earlier claims [Kinsler] that when using squeezed coherent light as a phase reference, the gain is not one of improved accuracy, but of lower power.

This approach opens the possibility to scale, parallelize, and miniaturize atom optics for new investigations in fundamental research and applications towards quantum computing with neutral atoms. The exploitation of the unique features of the quantum mechanical behavior of matter waves and the capabilities of powerful state-of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication techniques lend this approach a special attraction.

abstract: Given two linearly independent matrices in $so(3)$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, every rotation matrix $X_f \in SO(3)$ can be written as the product of alternate elements from the one dimensional subgroups corresponding to $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, namely $X_f=e^{Z_1 t_1}e^{Z_2 t_2}e^{Z_1t_3} \cdot \cdot \cdot e^{Z_1t_s}$. The parameters $t_i$, $i=1,...,s$ are called {\it generalized Euler angles}. In this paper, we evaluate the minimum number of factors required for the factorization of $X_f \in SO(3)$, as a function of $X_f$, and provide an algorithm to determine the generalized Euler angles explicitly. The results can be applied to the bang bang control with minimum number of switches of some classical control systems and of two level quantum systems.

abstract: Strong, fast pulses, called ``bang-bang'' controls can be used to eliminate the effects of system-environment interactions. This method for preventing errors in quantum information processors is treated here in a geometric setting which leads to an intuitive perspective. Using this geometric description, we clarify the notion of group symmetrization as an averaging technique, and provide a geometric picture for evaluating errors due to imperfect bang-bang controls. This will provide additional support for the usefulness of such controls as a means for providing more reliable quantum information processing.

abstract: We discuss the energy level splitting $\Delta\epsilon$ due to quantum tunneling between congruent tori in phase space. In analytic cases, it is well known that $\Delta\epsilon$ decays faster than power of $\hbar$ in the semi-classical limit. This is not true in non-smooth cases, specifically, when the tori are connected by line on which the Hamiltonian is not smooth. Under the assumption that the non-smoothness depends only upon the x- or p-coordinate, the leading term in the semi-classical expansion of $\Delta\epsilon$ is derived, which shows that $\Delta \epsilon$ decays as $\hbar^{k+1}$ when $\hbar\to 0$ with k being the order of non-smoothness.

abstract: The impedance boundary condition is used to calculate the Casimir force in configurations of two parallel plates and a shpere (spherical lens) above a plate at both zero and nonzero temperature. The impedance approach allows one to find the Casimir force between the realistic test bodies regardless of the electromagnetic fluctuations inside the media. Although this approach is an approximate one, it has wider areas of application than the Lifshitz theory of the Casimir force. The general formulas of the impedance approach to the theory of the Casimir force are given and the formal substitution is found for connecting it with the Lifshitz formula. The range of micrometer separations between the test bodies which is interesting from the experimental point of view is investigated in detail. It is shown that at zero temperature the results obtained on the basis of the surface impedance method are in agreement with those obtained in framework of the Lifshitz theory within a fraction of a percent. The temperature correction to the Casimir force from the impedance method coincides with that from the Lifshitz theory up to four significant figures. The case of millimeter separations which corresponds to the normal skin effect is also considered. At zero temperature the obtained results have good agreement with the Lifshitz theory. At nonzero temperature the impedance approach is not subject to the interpretation problems peculiar to the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula in dissipative media.

We assume that Bob knows the source statistics, and that Alice and Bob have identical random number generators. We put in an information theoretic framework some recent results on visible compression for sources of states with commuting density operators, and remove the commutativity requirement. We derive a general achievable compression rate, which is for the noncommutative case still higher than the known lower bound. We also present several related problems of classical information theory, and show how they can be used to answer some questions of the mixed state compression problem.

abstract: We show that controlled interference of a particle's wavefunction can be used to perform a quantum mechanical measurement in an incomplete basis. This happens because the measurement projects the particle into a lower dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space of the incoming wave. It allows a sender (Alice) to signal the receiver (Bob) nonlocally, by Alice's choosing to measure in a complete or incomplete basis (in general: bases of differing incompleteness). If experimentally confirmed, it furnishes a new quantum communication act: nonlocal transmission of a bit without concomitant causal communication. However, the question of its compatibility with special relativity remains unresolved.

We discuss this relation and illustrate its nature by examples referring to a free particle and to a ground-state hydrogen atom.

abstract: We explore in the framework of Quantum Computation the notion of {\em Computability}, which holds a central position in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. A quantum algorithm for Hilbert's tenth problem, which is equivalent to the Turing halting problem and is known to be mathematically noncomputable, is proposed where quantum continuous variables and quantum adiabatic evolution are employed. If this algorithm could be physically implemented, as much as it is valid in principle--that is, if certain hamiltonian and its ground state can be physically constructed according to the proposal--quantum computability would surpass classical computability as delimited by the Church-Turing thesis. It is thus argued that computability, and with it the limits of Mathematics, ought to be determined not solely by Mathematics itself but also by Physical Principles.

abstract: An experimentally observed violation of Bell's inequality is supposed to show the failure of local realism to deal with quantum reality. However, finite statistics and the time sequential nature of real experiments still allow a loophole for local realism, known as the memory loophole. We show that the randomized design of the Aspect experiment closes this loophole. Our main tool is van de Geer's (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein (1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a not-heavier-than-Gaussian tail of the distribution of a sum of bounded supermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a public bet between the author and L. Accardi, who in recent papers (Accardi and Regoli, 2000a,b, 2001; Accardi, Imafuku and Regoli, 2002) has claimed to have produced a suite of computer programmes, to be run on a network of computers, which will simulate a violation of Bell's inequalites. At a sample size of thirty thousand, both error probabilities are guaranteed smaller than one in a million, provided we adhere to the sequential randomized design. The results also show that Hess and Philipp's (2001a,b) recent claims are mistaken that Bell's theorem fails because of time phenomena supposedly neglected by Bell.

abstract: We propose a scheme for conditional generation of two-mode N-photon path-entangled states of traveling light field. These states may find applications in quantum optical lithography and they may be used to improve the sensitivity of interferometric measurements. Our method requires only single-photon sources, linear optics (beam splitters and phase shifters), and photodetectors with single photon sensitivity.

abstract: We propose a new approach to the problem of defining the degree of entanglement between two particles in a pure state with Hilbert spaces of arbitrary finite dimensions. The central idea is that entanglement gives rise to correlations between the particles that do not occur in separable states. We individuate the contributions of these correlations to the joint and the conditional probabilities of local measurements outcomes. We use these probabilities to define the measure of entanglement. Our measure turns out to be proportional to the so-called 2-entropy and therefore satisfies the properties required for any measure of entanglement. We conclude with an outlook on the problem of extending our approach to the case of multipartite systems and mixed states.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate novel structures for the realisation of registers of atomic qubits: We trap neutral atoms in one and two-dimensional arrays of far-detuned dipole traps obtained by focusing a red-detuned laser beam with a microfabricated array of microlenses. We are able to selectively address individual trap sites due to their large lateral separation of 125 mu m. We initialize and read out different internal states for the individual sites. We also create two interleaved sets of trap arrays with adjustable separation, as required for many proposed implementations of quantum gate operations.

abstract: Merely by existing, all physical systems register information. And by evolving dynamically in time, they transform and process that information. The laws of physics determine the amount of information that a physical system can register (number of bits) and the number of elementary logic operations that a system can perform (number of ops). The universe is a physical system. This paper quantifies the amount of information that the universe can register and the number of elementary operations that it can have performed over its history. The universe can have performed no more than $10^{120}$ ops on $10^{90}$ bits.

abstract: We analyze surface codes, the topological quantum error-correcting codes introduced by Kitaev. In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.

abstract: Recently it was realized that linear optics and photo-detectors with feedback can be used for theoretically efficient quantum information processing. The first of three steps toward efficient linear optics quantum computation (eLOQC) was to design a simple non-deterministic gate, which upon post-selection based on a measurement result implements a non-linear phase shift on one mode. Here a computational strategy is given for finding non-deterministic gates for bosonic qubits with helper photons. A more efficient conditional sign flip gate is obtained.

The present analysis adds new weight to our previous conjecture that the topological features of vortex dynamics are to a large extent universal.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110148
abstract: It is emphasized that a many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory exists only to the extent that the associated basis problem is solved. The core basis problem is that the robust enduring states specified by environmental decoherence effects are essentially Gaussian wave packets that form continua of non-orthogonal states. Hence they are not a discrete set of orthogonal basis states to which finite probabilities can be assigned by the usual rules. The natural way to get an orthogonal basis without going outside the Schroedinger dynamics is to use the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix, and this idea is the basis of some recent attempts by many-worlds proponents to solve the basis problem. But these eigenstates do not enjoy the locality and quasi-classicality properties of the states defined by environmental decoherence effects, and hence are not satisfactory preferred basis states. The basis problem needs to be addressed and resolved before a many-worlds-type interpretation can be said to exist.

abstract: We show that two qubits can be entangled by local interactions with an entangled two-mode continuous variable state. This is illustrated by the evolution of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode squeezed state. Two modes of the squeezed field are injected respectively into two spatially separate cavities and the atoms are then sent into the cavities to resonantly interact with the cavity field. We find that the atoms may be entangled even by a two-mode squeezed state which has been decohered while penetrating into the cavity.

abstract: We show that the Landau quantum systems (or integer quantum Hall effect systems) in a plane, sphere or a hyperboloid, can be explained in a complete meaningful way from group-theoretical considerations concerning the symmetry group of the corresponding configuration space. The crucial point in our development is the role played by locality and its appropriate mathematical framework, the fiber bundles. In this way the Landau levels can be understood as the local equivalence classes of the symmetry group. We develop a unified treatment that supplies the correct geometric way to recover the planar case as a limit of the spherical or the hyperbolic quantum systems when the curvature goes to zero. This is an interesting case where a contraction procedure gives rise to nontrivial cohomology starting from a trivial one. We show how to reduce the quantum hyperbolic Landau problem to a Morse system using horocyclic coordinates. An algebraic analysis of the eigenvalue equation allow us to build ladder operators which can help in solving the spectrum under different boundary conditions.

The comprehensive approach provided here permits the engineering of quantum states suitable for quantum information schemes and new quantum technologies.

abstract: Localized scattering phenomena may result in the formation of stationary matter waves originating from a compact region in physical space. Mathematically, such waves are advantageously expressed in terms of quantum sources that are introduced into the Schr\"odinger equation. The source formalism yields direct access to the scattering wave function, particle distribution, and total current. As an example, we study emission from three-dimensional Gaussian sources into a homogeneous force field. This model describes the behaviour of an atom laser supplied by an ideal Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of gravity. We predict a strong dependence of the beam profile on the condensate size and the presence of interference phenomena recently observed in photodetachment experiments.

The ladder operators are constructed directly from the wave functions without introducing any auxiliary variable. It is shown that these operators are associated to the $su(2)$ algebra. Analytical expressions for the functions $\sinh(\alpha x)$ and $\frac{\cosh(\alpha x)}{\alpha} \frac{d}{dx}$ are evaluated from these ladder operators. The expansions of the coordinate $x$ and momentum $\hat p$ in terms of the $su(2)$ generators are presented. This analysis allows to establish an exact quantum-mechanical connection between the $su(2)$ vibron model and the traditional descriptions of molecular vibron.

We obtain a transcendental equation for calculating the energy of the bound state from the matching condition in the configuration space. The condition for existence of bound states is determined by the Sturm-Liouville theorem.

abstract: Quantum mechanics is interpreted by the adjacent vacuum that behaves as a virtual particle to be absorbed and emitted by its matter. As described in the vacuum universe model, the adjacent vacuum is derived from the pre-inflationary universe in which the pre-adjacent vacuum is absorbed by the pre-matter. This absorbed pre-adjacent vacuum is emitted to become the added space for the inflation in the inflationary universe whose space-time is separated from the pre-inflationary universe. This added space is the adjacent vacuum. The absorption of the adjacent vacuum as the added space results in the adjacent zero space (no space), Quantum mechanics is the interaction between matter and the three different types of vacuum: the adjacent vacuum, the adjacent zero space, and the empty space. The absorption of the adjacent vacuum results in the empty space superimposed with the adjacent zero space, confining the matter in the form of particle. When the absorbed vacuum is emitted, the adjacent vacuum can be anywhere instantly in the empty space superimposed with the adjacent zero space where any point can be the starting point (zero point) of space-time. Consequently, the matter that expands into the adjacent vacuum has the probability to be anywhere instantly in the form of wavefunction. In the vacuum universe model, the universe not only gains its existence from the vacuum but also fattens itself with the vacuum. During the inflation, the adjacent vacuum also generates the periodic table of elementary particles to account for all elementary particles and their masses in a good agreement with the observed values.

Relativity Theory is reconstructed in the context of a preferred frame, but so as to secure the Relativity Principle in every experiment except the measurement of the preferred frame, defined by a null result for the dipole component of the Microwave Background Radiation (MBR). The 3D soliton approach to physical modelling is found to be consistent with both Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanical Nonlocality, exemplified by the EPR paradox.

We employ a Hilbert bundle construction that is motivated by: (i) discussing the role of the external Lorentz group in the existing history quantum field theory \cite{SavQFT1}; and (ii) considering a specific representation of the extended history algebra obtained from the multi-symplectic representation of scalar field theory.

We analyse one solution for a bound state, which is equivalent to the attractive two-body interaction between a charged point particle and a second, which remains at rest. We show this yields energy and angular momentum eigenvalues that are identical to those found by the usual method of solving of the Dirac equation,(4) including fine structure. We complete our previous derivation(3) of QED from a set of rules for the two-body interaction and generalise these. We show that QED may be decomposed into a two-body interaction at every point in spacetime.

abstract: We design a universal quantum homogenizer, which is a quantum machine that takes as an input a system qubit initially in the state $\rho$ and a set of N reservoir qubits initially prepared in the same state $\xi$. In the homogenizer the system qubit sequentially interacts with the reservoir qubits via the partial swap transformation. The homogenizer realizes, in the limit sense, the transformation such that at the output each qubit is in an arbitratily small neighbourhood of the state $\xi$ irrespective of the initial states of the system and the reservoir qubits. This means that the system qubit undergoes an evolution that has a fixed point, which is the reservoir state $\xi$. We also study approximate homogenization when the reservoir is composed of a finite set of identically prepared qubits. The homogenizer allows us to understand various aspects of the dynamics of open systems interacting with environments in non-equilibrium states. In particular, the reversibility vs or irreversibility of the dynamics of the open system is directly linked to specific (classical) information about the order in which the reservoir qubits interacted with the system qubit. This aspect of the homogenizer leads to a model of a quantum safe with a classical combination.We analyze in detail how entanglement between the reservoir and the system is created during the process of quantum homogenization. We show that the information about the initial state of the system qubit is stored in the entanglement between the homogenized qubits.

abstract: It is shown that the natural framework for the solutions of any Schrodinger equation whose spectrum has a continuous part is the Rigged Hilbert Space rather than just the Hilbert space. The difficulties of using only the Hilbert space to handle unbounded Schrodinger Hamiltonians whose spectrum has a continuous part are disclosed. Those difficulties are overcome by using an appropriate Rigged Hilbert Space (RHS). The RHS is able to associate an eigenket to each energy in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, regardless of whether the energy belongs to the discrete or to the continuous part of the spectrum. The collection of eigenkets corresponding to both discrete and continuous spectra forms a basis system that can be used to expand any physical wave function. Thus the RHS treats discrete energies (discrete spectrum) and scattering energies (continuous spectrum) on the same footing.

abstract: We show that a qubit can be used to substitute for an arbitrarily large number of classical bits. We consider a physical system S interacting locally with a classical field phi(x) as it travels directly from point A to point B. The field has the property that its integrated value is an integer multiple of some constant. The problem is to determine whether the integer is odd or even. This task can be performed perfectly if S is a qubit. On the otherhand, if S is a classical system then we show that it must carry an arbitrarily large amount of classical information. We identify the physical reason for such a huge quantum advantage, and show that it also implies a large difference between the size of quantum and classical memories necessary for some computations. We also present a simple proof that no finite amount of one-way classical communication can perfectly simulate the effect of quantum entanglement.

The interaction takes place in the photon detectors. We also show that the same idea can be used to produce the entangled $N$-photon state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0,N>+|N,0>)$

abstract: We study how the spin-statistics theorem relates to the geometric structures on phase space that are introduced in quantisation procedures (namely a U(1) bundle and connection). The relation can be proved in both the relativistic and the non-relativistic domain (in fact for any symmetry group including internal symmetries) without quantum field theory, by the requirement that the exchange can be implemented smoothly by a class of symmetry transformations that project in the phase space of the joint system. We discuss the interpretation of this requirement, stressing the fact that any distinction of identical particles comes solely from the choice of coordinates. We then examine our construction in the geometric and the coherent-state-path-integral quantisation schemes. In the appendix we apply our results to exotic systems exhibiting continuous ``spin'' and ``fractional statistics''. This gives novel and unusual forms of the spin-statistics relation.

abstract: We address the question of which quantum states can be inter-converted under the action of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. In particular, we consider the problem applied to mixed states, and investigate the difference between pure and mixed-state controllability introduced in previous work. We provide a complete characterization of the eigenvalue spectrum for which the state is controllable under the action of the symplectic group. We also address the problem of which states can be prepared if the dynamical Lie group is not sufficiently large to allow the system to be controllable.

abstract: A formalism for two-photon Stokes parameters is introduced to describe the polarization entanglement of photon pairs. This leads to the definition of a degree of two-photon polarization, which describes the extent to which the two photons act as a pair and not as two independent photons. This pair-wise polarization is complementary to the degree of polarization of the individual photons. The approach provided here has a number of advantages over the density matrix formalism: it allows the one- and two-photon features of the state to be separated and offers a visualization of the mixedness of the state of polarization.

Second, we show that there exist three--partite NPPT states, with the property that two copies can neither be distilled, nor activated.

Antibunching has been observed in the fluorescence light under both continuous and pulsed excitation. Our source delivers 2*10^4 single-photon pulses per second at an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz. The number of two-photon pulses is reduced by a factor of five compared to strongly attenuated coherent sources.

abstract: The properties of deterministic LOCC transformations of three qubit pure states are studied. We show that the set of states in the GHZ class breaks into an infinite number of disjoint classes under this type of transformation. These classes are characterized by the value of a quantity that is invariant under these transformations, and is defined in terms of the coefficients of a particular canonical form in which only states in the GHZ class can be expressed. This invariant also imposes a strong constraint on any POVM that is part of a deterministic protocol. We also consider a transformation generated by a local 2-outcome POVM and study under what conditions it is deterministic, i.e., both outcomes belong to the same orbit. We prove that for real states it is always possible to find such a POVM and we discuss analytical and numerical evidence that suggests that this result also holds for complex states. We study the transformation generated in the space of orbits when one or more parties apply several deterministic POVMs in succession and use these results to give a complete characterization of the real states that can be obtained from the GHZ state with probability 1.

We point out some intrinsic pathologies in the earlier treatments of other authors and make an effort to go beyond these very simple zero order models. The tunneling amplitude may be calculated in the Thomas-Fermi approximation and beyond it; we find it depends on the number of the trapped atoms, through the chemical potential. Some suggestions are given for the observation of the Josephson oscillation and the MQST.

abstract: We analyze greying of the dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate in the limit of weak interaction between atoms. The condensate initially prepared in the excited dark soliton state is loosing atoms because of spontaneous quantum depletion. These atoms are depleted from the soliton state into single particle states with nonzero density in the notch of the soliton. As a result the image of the soliton is losing contrast. This quantum depletion mechanism is efficient even at zero temperature when a thermal cloud is absent.

Advantages of our scheme over other semiconductor-based proposals of quantum computation include the energy gap in the FQHE liquid that suppresses decoherence, and the topological nature of quasiparticle statistics that makes it possible to entangle two quasiparticles without their direct dynamic interaction.

abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate which is illuminated by a short resonant light pulse that coherently couples two internal states of the atoms. We show that the subsequent time evolution prepares the atoms in an interesting entangled state called a spin squeezed state. This evolution is analysed in detail by developing a Bogoliubov theory which describes the entanglement of the atoms. Our calculation is a consistent expansion in $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles in the condensate, and our theory predict that it is possible to produce spin squeezing by at least a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Within the Bogoliubov approximation this result is independent of temperature.

We generalize the Landau's theory for the classical orders and introduce projective symmetry group and Fermi surface topology to characterize different quantum orders.

abstract: Current enhancement- a novel quantum phenomena is found to occur in a mesoscopic hybrid ring at equilibrium. The hybrid system is described by a ring with bubble which is in turn coupled to a reservoir. In the system the ring encloses a magnetic flux $\Phi$ while the bubble does not enclose any flux. The novelty of this work lies in the fact that while earlier current enhancement was observed in non-equilibrium systems (e.g., a ring coupled to two reservoirs at different chemical potentials $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$), herein we prove that current enhancement can also arise in equilibrium. In addition, we show that the closed system analog of our chosen open hybrid ring system violates parity effects. Finally, we bring to focus the discrepancy between the equilibrium magnetic moment (obtained via energy eigenvalues) and that calculated from the currents in the system.

abstract: We present a theoretical study of a quantum regime of the resistive (whirling) state of dc driven anisotropic single plaquette containing three small Josephson junctions. The current-voltage characteristics of such a system display resonant steps that are due to the resonant interaction between the time dependent Josephson current and the excited electromagnetic oscillations (EOs). The voltage positions of the resonances are determined by the quantum interband transitions of EOs. We show that in the quantum regime as the system is driven on the resonance, coherent Rabi oscillations between the quantum levels of EOs occur. At variance with the classical regime the magnitude and the width of resonances are determined by the frequency of Rabi oscillations that in turn, depends in a peculiar manner on an externally applied magnetic field and the parameters of the system.

abstract: There are several formulations of the second law, and they may, in principle, have different domains of validity. Here a simple mathematical theorem is proven which serves as the most general basis for the second law, namely the Thomson formulation (`cyclic changes cost energy'), applied to equilibrium. This formulation of the second law is a property akin to particle conservation (normalization of the wavefunction). It has been stricktly proven for a canonical ensemble, and made plausible for a micro-canonical ensemble. As the derivation does not assume time-inversion-invariance, it is applicable to situations where persistent current occur. This clear-cut derivation allows to revive the ``no perpetuum mobile in equilibrium'' formulation of the second law and to criticize some assumptions which are widespread in literature. The result puts recent results devoted to foundations and limitations of the second law in proper perspective, and structurizes this relatively new field of research.

This mechanism provides a simple method to transform spatially stable condensates into unstable once and vice versa. It also provides a means to store a squeezed spin state by turning off the interaction for the internal states and thus allows to gain control over many body entangled states.

abstract: After the first treatments of quantum finite state automata by Moore and Crutchfield and by Kondacs and Watrous, a number of papers study the power of quantum finite state automata and their variants. This paper introduces a model of two-way quantum one-counter automata (2Q1CAs), combining the model of two-way quantum finite state automata (2QFAs) by Kondacs and Watrous and the model of one-way quantum one-counter automata (1Q1CAs) by Kravtsev. We give the definition of 2Q1CAs with well-formedness conditions. It is proved that 2Q1CAs are at least as powerful as classical two-way deterministic one-counter automata (2D1CAs), that is, every language L recognizable by 2D1CAs is recognized by 2Q1CAs with no error. It is also shown that several non-context-free languages including {a^n b^{n^2}} and {a^n b^{2^n}} are recognizable by 2Q1CAs with bounded error.

abstract: We address the question of radiation emission from both perfect and dispersive mirrors following prescribed relativistic trajectories. The trajectories considered are asymptotically inertial: the mirror starts from rest and eventually reverts to motion at uniform velocity. This enables us to provide a description in terms of in and out states. We calculate exactly the Bogolubov alpha and beta coefficients for a specific form of the trajectory, and stress the analytic properties of the amplitudes and the constraints imposed by unitarity. A formalism for the description of emission of radiation from a dispersive mirror is presented.

abstract: This is an introduction to the by now fifteen years old research field of canonical quantum general relativity, sometimes called "loop quantum gravity". The term "modern" in the title refers to the fact that the quantum theory is based on formulating classical general relativity as a theory of connections rather than metrics as compared to in original version due to Arnowitt, Deser and Misner. Canonical quantum general relativity is an attempt to define a mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative, background independent theory of Lorentzian quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions in the continuum. The approach is minimal in that one simply analyzes the logical consequences of combining the principles of general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics. The requirement to preserve background independence has lead to new, fascinating mathematical structures which one does not see in perturbative approaches, e.g. a fundamental discreteness of spacetime seems to be a prediction of the theory providing a first substantial evidence for a theory in which the gravitational field acts as a natural UV cut-off. An effort has been made to provide a self-contained exposition of a restricted amount of material at the appropriate level of rigour which at the same time is accessible to graduate students with only basic knowledge of general relativity and quantum field theory on Minkowski space.

Thereby any information-loss paradox is avoided because for closed systems pure states remain pure. The discussion is performed for a massless scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole, but the arguments should hold in general. The result is also compared to and contrasted with the situation in inflationary cosmology.

Also, we enlight some features of the QGN which are related to: i) the problem of causality at the Planck scale, ii) the quantum computational aspects of spacetime foam and decoherence, iii) the cosmological constant problem, iv) the "information loss" puzzle. The resulting picture is a self-organizing system of ultimate Internet-universes.

abstract: We argue that the temperature inversion symmetry present in the original Casimir setup and also in other Casimir systems for which symmetrical boundary conditions are imposed is not related to the duality transformations that in the context defined in Ref. [1] are transformations relating spatial extension and temperature, and pressure and energy density. We provide an example of a Casimir system for which in principle there is no temperature inversion symmetry but nevertheless these duality transformations can be found.

abstract: Positive frequency Wightman function and vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor are computed for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter and satisfying Robin boundary condition on a uniformly accelerated infinite plate. The both regions of the right Rindler wedge, (i) on the right (RR region) and (ii) on the left (RL region) of the plate are investigated. For the case (ii) the electromagnetic field is considered as well. The mode summation method is used with combination of a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula. This allows to present the expectation values in the form of a sum of the purely Rindler and boundary parts. Near the plate surface the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is dominated by the boundary term. At large distances from the plate and near the Rindler horizon the main contribution comes from the purely Rindler part. In the RL region the vacuum energy density of the electromagnetic field is negative near the horizon and is positive near the plate.

abstract: We demonstrate how one can describe explicitly the present arbitrariness in solutions of relativistic wave equations in external electromagnetic fields of special form. This arbitrariness is connected to the existence of a transformation, which reduces effectively the number of variables in the initial equations. Then we use the corresponding representations to construct new sets of exact solutions, which may have a physical interest. Namely, we present new sets of stationary and nonstationary solutions in magnetic field and in some superpositions of electric and magnetic fields.

abstract: The quantization rules recently proposed by M. Navarro (and independently I.V. Kanatchikov) for a finite-dimensional formulation of quantum field theory are applied to the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac fields to obtain the quantum equations of motion of both fields. In doing so several problems arise. Solving these difficulties leads us to propose a new classical canonical formalism, which, in turn, leads us to new, improved rules of quantization. We show that the new classical equations of motion and rules of quantization overcome several known unsatisfactory features of the previous formalism. We argue that the new formalism is a general improvement with respect to the previous one. Further we show that the quantum field theory of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon field describes particles with extra, harmonic-oscillator-like degrees of freedom. We argue that these degrees of freedom should give rise to a multi-particle interpretation of the formalism.

abstract: Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in phase-space is a special (Weyl) representation of the density matrix. It has been useful in describing quantum transport in quantum optics; nuclear physics; decoherence (eg, quantum computing); quantum chaos; "Welcher Weg" discussions; semiclassical limits. It is also of importance in signal processing. Nevertheless, a remarkable aspect of its internal logic, pioneered by Moyal, has only emerged in the last quarter-century: It furnishes a third, alternative, formulation of Quantum Mechanics, independent of the conventional Hilbert Space, or Path Integral formulations. In this logically complete and self-standing formulation, one need not choose sides--coordinate or momentum space. It works in full phase-space, accommodating the uncertainty principle. This is an introductory overview of the formulation with simple illustrations.

abstract: A recent notion in theoretical physics is that not all quantum theories arise from quantising a classical system. Also, a given quantum model may possess more than just one classical limit. These facts find strong evidence in string duality and M-theory, and it has been suggested that they should also have a counterpart in quantum mechanics. In view of these developments we propose "dequantisation", a mechanism to render a quantum theory classical. Specifically, we present a geometric procedure to "dequantise" a given quantum mechanics (regardless of its classical origin, if any) to possibly different classical limits, whose quantisation gives back the original quantum theory. The standard classical limit $\hbar\to 0$ arises as a particular case of our approach.

abstract: A path-integral approach for delta-function potentials is presented. Particular attention is paid to the two-dimensional case, which illustrates the realization of a quantum anomaly for a scale invariant problem in quantum mechanics. Our treatment is based on an infinite summation of perturbation theory that captures the nonperturbative nature of the delta-function bound state. The well-known singular character of the two-dimensional delta-function potential is dealt with by considering the renormalized path integral resulting from a variety of schemes: dimensional, momentum-cutoff, and real-space regularization. Moreover, compatibility of the bound-state and scattering sectors is shown.

abstract: We show that the nondemolition measurement of a spacelike Wilson loop operator W(C) is impossible in a relativistic non-Abelian gauge theory. In particular, if two spacelike-separated magnetic flux tubes both link with the loop C, then a nondemolition measurement of W(C) would cause electric charge to be transferred from one flux tube to the other, a violation of relativistic causality. A destructive measurement of W(C) is possible in a non-Abelian gauge theory with suitable matter content. In an Abelian gauge theory, many cooperating parties distributed along the loop C can perform a nondemolition measurement of the Wilson loop operator if they are equipped with a shared entangled ancilla that has been prepared in advance. We also note that Abelian electric charge (but not non-Abelian charge) can be transported superluminally, without any accompanying transmission of information.

abstract: Probability theory can be modified in essentially one way while maintaining consistency with the basic Bayesian framework. This modification results in copies of standard probability theory for real, complex or quaternion probabilities. These copies, in turn, allow one to derive quantum theory while restoring standard probability theory in the classical limit. The argument leading to these three copies constrain physical theories in the same sense that Cox's original arguments constrain alternatives to standard probability theory. This sequence is presented in some detail with emphasis on questions beyond basic quantum theory where new insights are needed.

abstract: A Green's function approach is presented for the D-dimensional inverse square potential in quantum mechanics. This approach is implemented by the introduction of hyperspherical coordinates and the use of a real-space regulator in the regularized version of the model. The application of Sturm-Liouville theory yields a closed expression for the radial energy Green's function. Finally, the equivalence with a recent path-integral treatment of the same problem is explicitly shown.

We use these results to show that every orthosupersymmetric system of order $p$ has a parasupersymmetry of order $p$ and a fractional supersymmetry of order $p+1$.

abstract: The characterization of systems of differential equations admitting a superposition function allowing us to write the general solution in terms of any fundamental set of particular solutions is discussed. These systems are shown to be related with equations on a Lie group and with some connections in fiber bundles. We develop two methods for dealing with such systems: the generalized Wei--Norman method and the reduction method, which is very useful when particular solutions of the original problem are known. The theory is illustrated with some applications in both classical and quantum mechanics.

abstract: Two complementary approaches of N = 2 fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics of order k are studied in this article. The first one, based on a generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra W(k) (that comprizes the affine quantum algebra Uq(sl(2)) with q to k = 1 as a special case), apparently contains solely one bosonic degree of freedom. The second one uses generalized bosonic and k-fermionic degrees of freedom. As an illustration, a particular emphasis is put on the fractional supersymmetric oscillator of order k.

abstract: We investigate low energy nucleon dynamics in the effective field theory (EFT) of nuclear forces. In leading order of the two-nucleon EFT we show that nucleon dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal-in-time interaction operator. This equation is shown to open new possibilities for applying the EFT approach to the description of low energy nucleon dynamics.
