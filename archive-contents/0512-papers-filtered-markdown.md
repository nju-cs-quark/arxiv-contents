**1.    The Problem of Quantum Measurement and Entangled States: Interactions Among States and Formation of Detector Images**  
Fariel Shafee

<blockquote>
<p>
We first review and critically examine some basic concepts and ambiguities related to quantum mechanics and quantum measurement to understand the success and shortcomings of current theories. We also touch on ideas regarding expression of variables within a complex system. Then we discuss a model for quantum measurement proposed by us, in which the quantum system is allowed to interact with its image created within the detector, followed by a first passage random walk in the Hilbert space. Definitions and ideas from the first part are used in the context of the model. In the end, we discuss the puzzling question of entanglement. We propose how borrowing concepts from our model for quantum measurement may enable us to formulate a hidden variable scenario that does not violate Bell's inequality.
