abstract: In this work we study various notions of uncertainty for angular momentum in the spin-s representation of SU(2). We characterize the "uncertainty regions'' given by all vectors, whose components are specified by the variances of the three angular momentum components. A basic feature of this set is a lower bound for the sum of the three variances. We give a method for obtaining optimal lower bounds for uncertainty regions for general operator triples, and evaluate these for small s. Further lower bounds are derived by generalizing the technique by which Robertson obtained his state-dependent lower bound. These are optimal for large s, since they are saturated by states taken from the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that, for all s, all variances are consistent with the so-called vector model, i.e., they can also be realized by a classical probability measure on a sphere of radius sqrt(s(s+1)). Entropic uncertainty relations can be discussed similarly, but are minimized by different states than those minimizing the variances for small s. For large s the Maassen-Uffink bound becomes sharp and we explicitly describe the extremalizing states. Measurement uncertainty, as recently discussed by Busch, Lahti and Werner for position and momentum, is introduced and a generalized observable (POVM) which minimizes the worst case measurement uncertainty of all angular momentum components is explicitly determined, along with the minimal uncertainty. The output vectors for the optimal measurement all have the same length r(s), where r(s)/s goes to 1 as s tends to infinity.

abstract: In recent years, several hacking attacks have broken the security of quantum cryptography implementations by exploiting the presence of losses and the ability of the eavesdropper to tune detection efficiencies. We present a simple attack of this form that applies to any protocol in which the key is constructed from the results of untrusted measurements performed on particles coming from an insecure source or channel. Because of its generality, the attack applies to a large class of protocols, from standard prepare-and-measure to device-independent schemes. The derived critical detection efficiencies for security imply that the implementation of most partly device independent solutions is, from the point of view of detection efficiency, almost as demanding as fully device-independent ones. We also show how our attack implies the existence of a form of bound randomness, namely non-local correlations in which a non-signalling eavesdropper can find out a posteriori the result of any implemented measurement.

abstract: The structural connections between the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem, pre- and post-selection (PPS) paradoxes, and anomalous weak values are explored in detail. All PPS paradoxes, such as the 3-box paradox, the Quantum Cheshire Cat, and the Quantum Pigeonhole principle, construct a particular type of ontological model that assigns an eigenvalue to each observable (independent of context) of a system such that these assignments are consistent with the PPS. It is shown that such an ontological model must be explicitly contextual in the sense of the KS theorem, or otherwise implies either a restriction on free random choice or explicitly retrocausal behavior. We call such models PPS-contextual. The structure of each paradox is always such that there are particular contexts of mutually commuting observables that violate the product rule or sum rule, when the ontological model is extended to include observables that are not measured during the experiment. These paradoxes are counterfactual, in the sense that they are not directly observed, and also because the product and sum rules are always obeyed by projective measurements in actual experiments. It is shown that by adopting an alternate ontological model, where all hidden variables are weak values (which are not always eigenvalues, but obey the sum rule by definition), the same contexts that presented the original paradox must also contain observables with anomalous weak values. These anomalous weak values are not counterfactual because they can be probed through weak measurements on an ensemble of identically pre- and post-selected states, allowing this localized signature of KS contextuality to be experimentally observed. The weak values of all observables of a system can in principle be measured during an experiment, making this model a promising candidate for describing PPS-contextual ontological `elements of reality.'

abstract: We show that it needs a more delicate potential to confine particles inside a well. The original model containing a vague notation of infinity in the potential energy is ambiguous. Using the Heaviside step function and the Dirac delta-function, we give a precise form for the confining potential. Although such form appears unusual, the ambiguities are resolved. This form also shows that the infinite square well is not the limit of a finite square well.

abstract: Continuous measurements play a pivotal role in the study of dynamical open quantum systems. `Dyne' detections are among the most widespread and efficient measurement schemes, and give rise to quantum diffusion of the conditioned state. In this work we study under what conditions the detector dependency of the conditional state of a quantum system subject to diffusive monitoring can be demonstrated experimentally, in the sense of ruling our any detector-independent pure-state dynamical model for the system. We consider an arbitrary number L of environments to which the system is coupled, and an arbitrary number K of different types of dyne detections. We prove that non-trivial necessary conditions for such a demonstration can be determined efficiently by semi-definite programming. To determine sufficient conditions, different physical environmental couplings and Hamiltonians for a qubit, and different sets of diffusive monitorings are scrutinized. We compare the threshold efficiencies that are sufficient in the various cases, as well as cases previously considered in the literature, to suggest the most feasible experimental options.

abstract: The $k$'th frequency moment of a sequence of integers is defined as $F_k = \sum_j n_j^k$, where $n_j$ is the number of times that $j$ occurs in the sequence. Here we study the quantum complexity of approximately computing the frequency moments in two settings. In the query complexity setting, we wish to minimise the number of queries to the input used to approximate $F_k$ up to relative error $\epsilon$. We give quantum algorithms which outperform the best possible classical algorithms up to quadratically. In the multiple-pass streaming setting, we see the elements of the input one at a time, and seek to minimise the amount of storage space, or passes over the data, used to approximate $F_k$. We describe quantum algorithms for $F_0$, $F_2$ and $F_\infty$ in this model which outperform the best possible classical algorithms almost quadratically.

abstract: We propose a simple method for constructing POVMs using any set of matrices which form an orthonormal basis for the space of complex matrices. Considering the orthonormal set of irreducible spherical tensors, we examine the properties of the construction on the $N+1$-dimensional subspace of the $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ qubits comprising the permutationally symmetric states. Similar in spirit to Neumark's result on realization of a POVM as a projective measurement, we present a method to physically realize the constructed POVMs for symmetric states using the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition of the tensor product of irreducible representations of the rotation group. We illustrate the proposed construction on a spin-1 system, and show that it is possible to generate entangled states from separable ones.

abstract: Quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing have garnered much attention recently as possible models for achieving a quantum advantage over classical approaches to optimization and other special purpose computations. Both techniques are probabilistic in nature and the minimum gap between the ground state and first excited state of the system during evolution is a major factor in determining the success probability. In this work we investigate a strategy for increasing the minimum gap and success probability by introducing intermediate Hamiltonians that modify the evolution path between initial and final Hamiltonians. We focus on an optimization problem relevant to recent quantum annealing implementations and present numerical evidence for the existence of a purely local intermediate Hamiltonian that achieve the optimum performance in terms of pushing the minimum gap to one of the end points of the evolution. We further study the effectiveness of random intermediate Hamiltonians on the minimum gap and success probability, and empirically find that random Hamiltonians have a significant probability of increasing the success probability, but only by a modest amount.

abstract: An example of exceptional points in the continuous spectrum of a real, pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian of von Neumann-Wigner type is presented and discussed. Remarkably, these exceptional points are associated with a double pole in the normalization factor of the Jost eigenfunctions normalized to unit flux at infinity. At the exceptional points, the two unnormalized Jost eigenfunctions are no longer linearly independent but coalesce to give rise to two Jordan cycles of generalized bound state eigenfunctions embedded in the continuum and a Jordan block representation of the Hamiltonian. The regular scattering eigenfunction vanishes at the exceptional point and the irregular scattering eigenfunction has a double pole at that point. In consequence, the time evolution of the regular scattering eigenfunction is unitary, while the time evolution of the irregular scattering eigenfunction is pseudounitary. The scattering matrix is a regular analytical function of the wave number $k$ for all $k$ including the exceptional points.

One promising avenue for global-scale quantum communication networks is to use low-Earth-orbit satellites. Here we report the first demonstration of QKD from a stationary transmitter to a receiver platform traveling at an angular speed equivalent to a 600 km altitude satellite, located on a moving truck. We overcome the challenges of actively correcting beam pointing, photon polarization and time-of-flight. Our system generates an asymptotic secure key at 40 bits/s.

abstract: We provide analytical expressions for classical and total trace-norm (Schatten 1-norm) geometric correlations in the case of two-qubit X states. As an application, we consider the open-system dynamical behavior of such correlations under phase and generalized amplitude damping evolutions. Then, we show that geometric classical correlations can characterize the emergence of the pointer basis of an apparatus subject to decoherence in either Markovian or non-Markovian regimes. In particular, as a non-Markovian effect, we obtain a time delay for the information to be retrieved from the apparatus by a classical observer. Moreover, we show that the set of initial X states exhibiting sudden transitions in the geometric classical correlation has nonzero measure.

Based on the fact that the initial state of such setup together with its environment cannot be known, we show that the independence of its generated output cannot be guaranteed. Some consequences of this theoretical limitation are discussed.

abstract: Entanglement between a single photon and a quantum memory forms the building blocks for quantum repeater and quantum network. Previous entanglement sources are typically with low retrieval efficiency, which limits future larger-scale applications. Here, we report a source of highly retrievable spinwave-photon entanglement. Polarization entanglement is created through interaction of a single photon with ensemble of atoms inside a low-finesse ring cavity. The cavity is engineered to be resonant for dual spinwave modes, which thus enables efficient retrieval of the spinwave qubit. An intrinsic retrieval efficiency up to 76(4)% has been observed. Such a highly retrievable atom-photon entanglement source will be very useful in future larger-scale quantum repeater and quantum network applications.

The relative entropy of entanglement is chosen as a measure of entanglement in an ancilla-free system. We provide an upper bound on the entangling rate which has a logarithmic dependence on a dimension of a smaller system in a bipartite cut. We also investigate the rate of change of quantum mutual information in an ancilla-assisted system and provide an upper bound independent of dimension of ancillas.

abstract: The set of Entanglement Saving (ES) quantum channels is introduced and characterized. These are completely positive, trace preserving transformations which when acting locally on a bipartite quantum system initially prepared into a maximally entangled configuration, preserve its entanglement even when applied an arbitrary number of times. In other words, a quantum channel $\psi$ is said to be ES if its powers $\psi^n$ are not entanglement-breaking for all integers $n$. We also characterize the properties of the Asymptotic Entanglement Saving (AES) maps. These form a proper subset of the ES channels that is constituted by those maps which, not only preserve entanglement for all finite $n$, but which also sustain an explicitly not null level of entanglement in the asymptotic limit~$n\rightarrow \infty$. Structure theorems are provided for ES and for AES maps which yield an almost complete characterization of the former and a full characterization of the latter.

abstract: In generalized resource theories, one aims to reformulate the problem of deciding whether a suitable transition (typically a transition that preserves the Gibbs state of the theory) between two given states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ exists or not, into the problem of checking whether a set of second-law--like inequalities hold or not. The aim of these preliminary notes is to show how the theory of statistical comparisons (in the sense of Blackwell, LeCam, and Torgersen) can be useful in such scenarios. In particular, we propose one construction, in which the second laws are formulated in terms of a suitable conditional min-entropy. Though a general, fully quantum result is also presented, stronger results are obtained for the case of qubits, and the case of $\sigma$ commuting with the Gibbs state.

abstract: We demonstrate that a tensor product structure and classical entanglement can be obtained by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical fields with two orthogonal modes. Using the classical entanglement, we discuss efficient simulation of several typical quantum states, including product state, Bell states, GHZ state, and W state. By performing quadrature demodulation scheme, we propose a sequence permutation mechanism to simulate certain quantum states and a generalized gate array model to simulate quantum algorithm, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The research on classical simulation of quantum states is important, for it not only enables potential beyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Randomized Benchmarking allows to efficiently and scalably characterize the average error of an unitary 2-design such as the Clifford group $\mathcal{C}$ on a physical candidate for quantum computation, as long as there are no non-computational leakage levels in the system. We investigate the effect of leakage errors on Randomized Benchmarking induced from an additional level per physical qubit and provide a modified protocol that allows to derive reliable estimates for the error per gate in their presence. We assess the variance of the sequence fidelity corresponding to the number of random sequences needed for valid fidelity estimation. Our protocol allows for gate dependent error channels without being restricted to perturbations. We show that our protocol is compatible with Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking and expand to benchmarking of arbitrary gates. This setting is relevant for superconducting transmon qubits, among other systems.

abstract: We demonstrate significant improvements of the spin coherence time of a dense ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond through optimized dynamical decoupling (DD). Cooling the sample down to $77$ K suppresses longitudinal spin relaxation $T_1$ effects and DD microwave pulses are used to increase the transverse coherence time $T_2$ from $\sim 0.7$ ms up to $\sim 30$ ms. We extend previous work of single-axis (CPMG) DD towards the preservation of arbitrary spin states. Following a theoretical and experimental characterization of pulse and detuning errors, we compare the performance of various DD protocols. We identify that the optimal control scheme for preserving an arbitrary spin state is a recursive protocol, the concatenated version of the XY8 pulse sequence. The improved spin coherence might have an immediate impact on improvements of the sensitivities of AC magnetometry. Moreover, the protocol can be used on denser diamond samples to increase coherence times up to NV-NV interaction time scales, a major step towards the creation of quantum collective NV spin states.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.00642
abstract: Modern cryptography is largely based on complexity assumptions, for example, the ubiquitous RSA is based on the supposed complexity of the prime factorization problem. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand how a quantum computer would eventually weaken these algorithms. In this paper, one follows Feynman's prescription for a computer to simulate the physics corresponding to the algorithm of factoring a large number $N$ into primes. Using Dirac-Jordan transformation theory one translates factorization into the language of quantum hermitical operators, acting on the vectors of the Hilbert space. This leads to obtaining the ensemble of factorization of $N$ in terms of the Euler function $\varphi(N)$, that is quantized. On the other hand, considering $N$ as a parameter of the computer, a Quantum Mechanical Prime Counting Function $\pi_{QM}(x)$, where $x$ factorizes $N$, is derived. This function converges to $\pi(x)$ when $N\gg x$. It has no counterpart in analytic number theory and its derivation relies on semiclassical quantization alone.

abstract: We present a new approach to incorporate self-assembled quantum dots into a Fabry-P\'{e}rot-like microcavity. Thereby a 3$\lambda$/4 GaAs layer containing quantum dots is epitaxially removed and attached by van der Waals bonding to one of the microcavity mirrors. We reach a finesse as high as 4,100 with this configuration limited by the reflectivity of the dielectric mirrors and not by scattering at the semiconductor - mirror interface, demonstrating that the epitaxial lift-off procedure is a promising procedure for cavity quantum electrodynamics in the solid state. As a first step in this direction, we demonstrate a clear cavity-quantum dot interaction in the weak coupling regime with a Purcell factor in the order of 3. Estimations of the coupling strength via the Purcell factor suggests that we are close to the strong coupling regime.

abstract: This is the second in a pair of articles that classify the configuration space and kinematic symmetry groups for $N$ identical particles in one-dimensional traps experiencing Galilean-invariant two-body interactions. These symmetries explain degeneracies in the few-body spectrum and demonstrate how tuning the trap shape and the particle interactions can manipulate these degeneracies. The additional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting limit and in the unitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are sufficient to algebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of the one-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the algebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or nearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\ independent of trap shape and details of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin are considered. This article analyzes the symmetries of $N$ particles in asymmetric, symmetric, and harmonic traps; the prequel article treats the one, two and three particle cases.

abstract: Characterization of qubit couplings in many-body quantum systems is essential for benchmarking quantum computation and simulation. We propose a tomographic measurement scheme to determine all the coupling terms in a general many-body Hamiltonian with arbitrary long-range interactions, provided the energy density of the Hamiltonian remains finite. Different from quantum process tomography, our scheme is fully scalable with the number of qubits as the required rounds of measurements increase only linearly with the number of coupling terms in the Hamiltonian. The scheme makes use of synchronized dynamical decoupling pulses to simplify the many-body dynamics so that the unknown parameters in the Hamiltonian can be retrieved one by one. We simulate the performance of the scheme under the influence of various pulse errors and show that it is robust to typical noise and experimental imperfections.

abstract: In this paper we will present a quantization method for SPP (Surface Plasmon Polariton) based on Green's tensor method, which is applied usually for quantization of EM-field in various dielectric media. This method will be applied for a semi-infinite structure, which contains metal and dielectric regions with one interface. Moreover, by introducing the quantized SPP, we will investigate the SPP propagation in the attenuating and amplifying systems. We will also consider two modes of SPP, i.e., coherent and squeezed states, and finally compare the propagation of these modes in the amplifying media.

abstract: The detection and characterization of a non-classical-squeezed state of light, by using two different schemes, will be presented . In the first one, in an one-dimensional cavity with moving mirror (non-stationary Casimir effect) in the principal mode, we study the photon creation rate for two modes (squeezed and coherent state) of driving field. Since the cavity with moving mirror (similar to an optomechanical system) can be considered analogue to a Kerr-like medium, so that in the second scheme, the probability amplitude for multi-photons absorption in a nonlinear (Kerr) medium will be quantum mechanically calculated. It is shown that because of presence of nonlinear effects, the responses of these two systems to the squeezed versus coherent state are considerably distinguishable. The drastic difference between the results of these two states of light can be viewed as a proposal for detecting of non-classical states.

abstract: The outstanding progress in nanostructure fabrication and cooling technologies allows what was unthinkable a few decades ago: bringing single-mode mechanical vibrations to the quantum regime. The coupling between photon and phonon excitations is a natural source of nonclassical states of light and mechanical vibrations, and its study within the field of cavity optomechanics is developing lightning-fast. Photonic crystal cavities are highly integrable architectures that have demonstrated the strongest optomechanical coupling to date, and should therefore play a central role for such hybrid quantum state engineering. In this context, we propose a realistic heralding protocol for the on-chip preparation of remotely entangled mechanical states, relying on the state-of-the-art optomechanical parameters of a silicon-based nanobeam structure. Pulsed sideband excitation of a Stokes process, combined with single photon detection, allows writing a delocalised mechanical Bell state in the system, signatures of which can then be read out in the optical field. A measure of entanglement in this protocol is provided by the visibility of a characteristic quantum interference pattern in the emitted light.

abstract: We propose the quantum simulation of the quantum Rabi model in all parameter regimes by means of detuned bichromatic sideband excitations of a single trapped ion. We show that current setups can reproduce, in particular, the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes of such a paradigmatic light-matter interaction. Furthermore, associated with these extreme dipolar regimes, we study the controlled generation and detection of their entangled ground states by means of adiabatic methods. Ion traps have arguably performed the first quantum simulation of the Jaynes-Cummings model, a restricted regime of the quantum Rabi model where the rotating-wave approximation holds. We show that one can go beyond and experimentally investigate the quantum simulation of coupling regimes of the quantum Rabi model that are difficult to achieve with natural dipolar interactions.

abstract: We characterise Gaussian quantum channels that are Gaussian incompatibility breaking, that is, transform every set of Gaussian measurements into a set obtainable from a joint Gaussian observable via Gaussian postprocessing. Such channels represent local noise which renders measurements useless for Gaussian EPR-steering, providing the appropriate generalisation of entanglement breaking channels for this scenario. Understanding the structure of Gaussian incompatibility breaking channels contributes to the resource theory of noisy continuous variable quantum information protocols.

abstract: Quantum optical fields offer numerous control knobs which are not available with classical light and may be used for monitoring the properties of matter by novel types of spectroscopy. It has been recently argued that such quantum spectroscopy signals can be obtained by a simple averaging of their classical spectroscopy counterparts over the Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distribution of the quantum field; the quantum light thus merely provides a novel gating window for the classical response functions. We show that this argument only applies to the linear response and breaks down in the nonlinear regime. The quantum response carries additional valuable information about response and spontaneous fluctuations of matter that may not be retrieved from the classical response by simple data processing. This is connected to the lack of a nonlinear fluctuation-dissipation relation.

abstract: In the recent years we have seen that Grover search algorithm [1] by using quantum parallelism has revolutionized the field of solving huge class of NP problems in comparison to classical systems. In this work we explore the idea of extending the Grover search algorithm to approximate algorithms. Here we try to analyze the applicability of Grover search to process an unstructured database with dynamic selection function as compared to the static selection function in the original work[1]. This allows us to extend the application of Grover search to the field of randomized search algorithms. We further use the Dynamic Grover search algorithm to define the goals for a recommendation system, and define the algorithm for recommendation system for binomial similarity distribution space giving us a quadratic speedup over traditional unstructured recommendation systems. Finally we see how the Dynamic Grover Search can be used to attack a wide range of optimization problems where we improve complexity over existing optimization algorithms.

abstract: Recently some alternatives of the measurement device independent quantum key distribution(MDI-QKD) based on the single-photon Bell state measurement (SBSM) have been proposed. Although these alternatives are not precisely as secure as MDI-QKD, they possess the advantage of high key rate of traditional BB84-like protocol and avoid the technical complexity of two-photon interference required in the MDI-QKD. However, the setups of these proposed schemes are rather complicated compared to commonly used BB84 systems. Here we propose a simple implementation of SBSM-based QKD which is directly built on the existing realization of BB84 QKD. Our proposal exhibits the hidden connection between SBSM-based QKD and traditional phase-coding QKD protocols. This finding discloses the physics behind these two different types of QKD protocols. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.00907
abstract: We introduce the notion of potential capacities of quantum channels in an operational way and provide upper bounds for these quantities, which quantify the ultimate limit of usefulness of a channel for a given task in the best possible context. Unfortunately, except for a few isolated cases, potential capacities seem to be as hard to compute as their "plain" analogues. We thus study upper bounds on some potential capacities: For the classical capacity, we give an upper bound in terms of the entanglement of formation. To establish a bound for the quantum and private capacity, we first "lift" the channel to a Hadamard channel and then prove that the quantum and private capacity of Hadamard channel is strongly additive, implying that for these channels, potential and plain capacity are equal. Employing these upper bounds we show that if a channel is noisy, however close it is to the noiseless channel, then it cannot be activated into the noiseless channel by any other contextual channel; this conclusion holds for all the three capacities. Although it is of less importance, we also discuss the so-called environment-assisted quantum capacity, because we are able to characterize its "potential" version.

abstract: Starting from a simple mapping of a generator of local stochastic dynamics to a quantum Hamiltonian, we derive a condition, which allows us to use the quasi-adiabatic evolution and so relate gapped quantum phases with non-equilibrium's. This leads us to a study of invertible matrix product operators. Finally, we present an ansatz for constructing local stochastic dynamics for which the Perron-Frobenius vector has a Matrix Product Representation. Additionally, we get for free that the dynamics satisfy a generalized form of detailed balance.

abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have emerged as promising quantum solid-state systems, with applications ranging from quantum information processing to magnetic sensing. One of the most useful properties of NVs is the ability to read their ground-state spin projection optically at room temperature. This work provides a theoretical analysis of Purcell enhanced NV optical coupling, through which we find optimal parameters for maximal Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the optical spin-state readout. We conclude that a combined increase in spontaneous emission (through Purcell enhancement) and in optical excitation could significantly increase the readout SNR.

abstract: We demonstrate optimal state estimation for a cavity optomechanical system through Kalman filtering. By taking into account nontrivial experimental noise sources, such as colored laser noise and spurious mechanical modes, we implement a realistic state-space model. This allows us to obtain the conditional system state, i.e., conditioned on previous measurements, with minimal least-square estimation error. We apply this method for estimating the mechanical state, as well as optomechanical correlations both in the weak and strong coupling regime. The application of the Kalman filter is an important next step for achieving real-time optimal (classical and quantum) control of cavity optomechanical systems.

abstract: This paper, following [M. Ozawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 385 (1988)], reports a refutation of the claim that for monitoring the position of a free mass such as gravitational-wave interferometers the sensitivity is limited by the so called standard quantum limit (SQL) due to the uncertainty principle. The latest proof of the SQL is analyzed to revleal an unsupported assumption on quantum measurements. Quantum measurement theory is introduced to give a general criterion for physically realizable measurements in quantum mechanics. A theory of approximate position measurements is developed to obtain a rigorous condition for the SQL and also to show that a precise position measurement can leave the object in an arbitrary family of states independent of the input state. This concludes that Yuen's proposal of breaking the SQL by a contractive state measurement, a measurement of the position leaving the free mass in a state with the position uncertainty decreasing in time, is physically realizable in principle. To enforce this conclusion, a model for error-free position measurement that leaves the object in a contractive state is constructed with a solvable Hamiltonian for measuring interaction. Finally, this model is shown to break the SQL with arbitrary accuracy.

abstract: Detection of symmetry is vital to problem solving. Most of the problems of computer vision and computer graphics and machine intelligence in general, can be reduced to symmetry detection problem. Unstructured search problem can also be looked upon from symmetry detection point of view. Unstructured search can be thought as searching a binary string satisfying some search condition in an unsorted list of binary strings. In this paper unstructured search problem is reduced to function bilateral symmetry detection problem with polynomial overhead in terms of the size of the input. Keywords: Unstructured Search, Quantum algorithm, Function bilateral symmetry detection, Decision Problem, Quantum Black Box, Solving NP complete problems.

abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are interesting for various reasons. The most attractive example of (a complete set of) MUB is the one constructed by Ivanovi\'c as well as Wootters and Fields, which is referred to as the canonical MUB. Nevertheless, little is known about anything that is unique to this MUB. We show that the canonical MUB in any prime power dimension is uniquely determined by an extremal orbit of the (restricted) Clifford group except in dimension 3, in which case the orbit defines a special symmetric informationally complete measurement (SIC), known as the Hesse SIC. Here the extremal orbit is the one with the smallest number of pure states. Quite surprisingly, this characterization does not rely on any concept that is related to bases or unbiasedness. As a corollary, the canonical MUB is the unique minimal 2-design covariant with respect to the Clifford group except in dimension 3. In addition, these MUB provide an infinite family of highly symmetric frames and positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), which are of independent interest.

abstract: Plausibility measures are structures for reasoning in the face of uncertainty that generalize probabilities, unifying them with weaker structures like possibility measures and comparative probability relations. So far, the theory of plausibility measures has only been developed for classical sample spaces. In this paper, we generalize the theory to test spaces, so that they can be applied to general operational theories, and to quantum theory in particular. Our main results are two theorems on when a plausibility measure agrees with a probability measure, i.e. when its comparative relations coincide with those of a probability measure. For strictly finite test spaces we obtain a precise analogue of the classical result that the Archimedean condition is necessary and sufficient for agreement between a plausibility and a probability measure. In the locally finite case, we prove a slightly weaker result that the Archimedean condition implies almost agreement.

abstract: Concurrent remote entanglement of distant, non-interacting quantum entities is a crucial function for quantum information processing. In contrast with the existing protocols which employ addition of signals to generate entanglement between two remote qubits, the protocol we present is based on multiplication of signals. This protocol can be straightforwardly implemented by a novel Josephson junction mixing circuit. Our scheme would be able to generate provable entanglement even in presence of practical imperfections: finite quantum efficiency of detectors and undesired photon loss in current state-of-the-art devices.

abstract: Linear optics underpins tests of fundamental quantum mechanics and computer science, as well as quantum technologies. Here we experimentally demonstrate the longstanding goal of a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons and their measurement with a 12 single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with average fidelity 0.999 $\pm$ 0.001. Our system is capable of switching between these and any other linear optical protocol in seconds. These results point the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a simple method to measure the biphoton joint spectrum by mapping the spectral information onto the temporal domain using a dispersive medium. Various top-hat spectral filters are used to limit the spectral (and hence, temporal) extent of the broadband downconversion photons measured. The sharp edges of the spectral filters are utilized as spectral markers for dispersion characterization of the dispersive medium. This method allows dispersion characterization and joint spectral measurement to be completed simultaneously. The joint spectrum (which extends beyond 100 nm, centered about 1.5 micron) of the type-II downconverted photon pairs generated from a poled optical fiber is obtained with this method.

abstract: Electric field noise in proximity to metallic surfaces is a poorly understood phenomenon that appears in different areas of physics. Trapped ion quantum information processors are particular susceptible to this noise, leading to motional decoherence which ultimately limits the fidelity of quantum operations. On the other hand they present an ideal tool to study this effect, opening new possibilities in surface science. In this work we analyze and measure the polarization of the noise field in a micro-fabricated ion trap for various noise sources. We find that technical noise sources and noise emanating directly from the surface give rise to different degrees of polarization which allows us to differentiate between the two noise sources. Based on this, we demonstrate a method to infer the magnitude of surface noise in the presence of technical noise.

abstract: Experimental observations of quantum walks in one dimension have provided many exciting applications in quantum computing, while recent theoretical investigation of single phase defect in these system points towards interesting phenomena associated with bounds states. Here we obtain analytical solutions of quantum walk with a general quantum coin in one dimension with multiple defects, with new prediction on the condition for zero reflectance for scattering state, and the existence of an analogy to the Ramsauer effect for multiple defects. We also show the transition from the zero reflectance state to the bound state can provide a method for preparing the quantum walk in a bound state. Applications to systems similar to thin film optics are suggested.

abstract: We provide and analyze examples that counter the widely made claim that tunneling is needed for a quantum speedup in optimization problems. The examples belong to the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems. In one case, featuring a plateau in the cost function in Hamming weight space, we find that the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible, while superior to simulated annealing, result in a slowdown compared to a diabatic cascade of avoided level-crossings. This, in turn, inspires a classical spin vector dynamics algorithm that is at least as efficient for the plateau problem as the diabatic quantum algorithm. In a second case whose cost function is convex in Hamming weight space, the diabatic cascade results in a speedup relative to both tunneling and classical spin vector dynamics.

abstract: We study the spontaneous emission of an excited atom close to an optical nanofiber and the resulting scattering forces. For a suitably chosen orientation of the atomic dipole, the spontaneous emission pattern becomes asymmetric and a resonant Casimir--Polder force parallel to the fiber axis arises. For a simple model case, we show that the such a lateral force is due to the interaction of the circularly oscillating atomic dipole moment with its image inside the material. With the Casimir--Polder energy being constant in the lateral direction, the predicted lateral force does not derive from a potential in the usual way. Our results have implications for optical force measurements on a substrate as well as for laser cooling of atoms in nanophotonic traps.

Gravitational waves can induce transformations on the state of phonons that can be observed through quantum state discrimination techniques. We show that this method is highly robust to thermal noise and depletion. We derive a bound on the strain sensitivity that shows that the detection of waves in the kHz regime is not significantly affected by temperature in a wide range of parameters that are well within current experimental reach.

abstract: When we extract information from a system by performing a quantum measurement, the state of the system is disturbed due to the backaction of the measurement. Numerous studies have been performed to quantitatively formulate tradeoff relations between information and disturbance. We formulate a tradeoff relation between information and disturbance from an estimation-theoretic point of view, and derive an inequality between them. The information is defined as the classical Fisher information obtained by the measurement, and the disturbance is defined as the average loss of the quantum Fisher information. We show that pure and reversible measurements achieve the equality of the inequality. We also identify the necessary condition for various divergences between two quantum states to satisfy a similar relation. The obtained relation holds not only for the quantum relative entropy but also for the maximum quantum relative entropy.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.01327
abstract: We show that the resonances of the Stark effect in hydrogen reported in Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 022509 (2013) are considerably less accurate than the number of digits appear to suggest. In particular, the imaginary part of the lowest resonance is several orders of magnitude greater than it should be. We compare the results of that paper with those provided by the Riccati-Pad\'{e} method, perturbation theory and an asymptotic expansion for the resonance width. The inaccuracy of those results can be traced back to the lack of precision in the calculation of the matrix elements of the secular equation. We carry out a more accurate calculation with the same method and show that the agreement with earlier results of other authors is greatly improved.

We demonstrate that this differential equation is a non-linear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). This NLSE exhibits both similarities and differences vis-a-vis the Nobre-Rego Monteiro-Tsallis one.

abstract: We present a derivation of Born's rule and unitary transforms in Quantum Mechanics, from a simple set of axioms built upon a physical phenomenology of quantization. Combined to Gleason's theorem, this approach naturally leads to the usual quantum formalism, within a new conceptual framework that is discussed heuristically in details. The structure of Quantum Mechanics, from its probabilistic nature to its mathematical expression, appears as a result of the interplay between the quantized number of "modalities" accessible to a quantum system, and the continuum of "contexts" that are required to define these modalities.

abstract: The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems, such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum transport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a classical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a noisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here, recent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition, to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the quantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series of examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new perspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is interacting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal correlations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their local detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.

abstract: Engineering complex non-Abelian anyon models with simple physical systems is crucial for topological quantum computation. Unfortunately, the simplest systems are typically restricted to Majorana zero modes (Ising anyons). Here we go beyond this barrier, showing that the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermion model of non-Abelian anyons can be realized on a qubit lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions. Our system additionally contains the Abelian $D(\mathbb{Z}_4)$ anyons as low-energetic excitations. We show that braiding of these parafermions with each other and with the $D(\mathbb{Z}_4)$ anyons allows the entire $d=4$ Clifford group to be generated. The error correction problem for our model is also studied in detail, guaranteeing fault-tolerance of the topological operations. Crucially, since the non-Abelian anyons are engineered through defect lines rather than as excitations, non-Abelian error correction is not required. Instead the error correction problem is performed on the underlying Abelian model, allowing high noise thresholds to be realized.

abstract: Novel quantum technology becomes mature when it can successfully be implemented in compact, integrated and easy-to-use devices. In response to this challenge, the quantum information community has recently achieved impressive results by reproducing linear bulk setups in a waveguide-based platform [1-10]. Even so, the generation of tailored quantum states in integrated sources suffers from severe limitations. While waveguide systems overcome the brightness and stability issues of bulk crystals, the confinement restricts the possibilities of source engineering. In particular, the generation of light in spatially separated modes, as needed for the preparation of specific bi-partite systems like N00N states [11], is prohibited in waveguides [12,13]. Recently, two experiments have gained control over this fundamental limitation by combining different waveguide sources followed by linear optical elements [14,15]. Yet, this approach requires the use of extra resources like active phase stabilisation, filtering or post-selection. Here, we harness the path degree of freedom in waveguide sources without additional overhead. As an example we implement an ultra-bright tunable two-channel integrated device which generates post-processing free, indistinguishable two-photon N00N states. We take advantage of the integration of parametric down-conversion in a single directional coupler and show that a clever engineering of the non-linear structure gets rid of the need for phase stabilisation, narrow-band filtering and spatial post-selection. This type of effective integration goes beyond reproducing a bulk setup on a chip and combines the action of many optical elements in one. Based on this concept, our device greatly simplifies the generation of intricate multi-channel quantum states and reduces the required complexity of linear networks for quantum information applications.

abstract: The discovery of post-quantum nonlocality, i.e. the existence of nonlocal correlations stronger than any quantum correlations but nevertheless consistent with the no-signaling principle, has deepened our understanding of the foundations quantum theory. In this work, we investigate whether the phenomenon of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, a different form of quantum nonlocality, can also be generalized beyond quantum theory. While post-quantum steering does not exist in the bipartite case, we prove its existence in the case of three observers. Importantly, we show that post-quantum steering is a genuinely new phenomenon, fundamentally different from post-quantum nonlocality. Our results provide new insight into the nonlocal correlations of multipartite quantum systems.

abstract: In this article we present an effective Hamiltonian approach for Discrete Time Quantum Random Walk. A form of the Hamiltonian for one dimensional quantum walk has been prescribed, utilizing the fact that Hamiltonians are the generators of time translations. Then an attempt has been made to generalize the techniques to higher dimensions. We find that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a Weyl Hamiltonian and a Dirac comb potential. The time evolution operator obtained from this prescribed Hamiltonian is in complete agreement with that of the standard approach. But in higher dimension we find that the time evolution operator is additive, instead of being multiplicative \cite{Chandrasekhar:2013SREP08229}. We showed that in case of two-step walk, effectively the time evolution operator can have multiplicative form. In case of a square lattice, quantum walk has been studied computationally for different coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative approaches have been compared. Using the Graphene Hamiltonian the walk has been studied on a Graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive approach over the multiplicative one.

abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a nonclassicality test of single-mode field in phase space, which has an analogy with the nonlocality test proposed by Banaszek and Wodkiewicz [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 2009 (1999)]. Our approach to deriving the classical bound draws on the fact that the Wigner function of a coherent state is a product of two independent distributions as if the orthogonal quadratures (position and momentum) in phase space behave as local realistic variables. Our method detects every pure nonclassical Gaussian state, which can also be extended to mixed states. Furthermore, it sets a bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, thereby providing a criterion to detect a genuine quantum non-Gaussian state. Remarkably, our phase-space approach with invariance under Gaussian unitary operations leads to an optimized test for a given non-Gaussian state. We experimentally show how this enhanced method can manifest quantum non-Gaussianity of a state by simply choosing phase-space points appropriately, which is essentially equivalent to implementing a squeezing operation on a given state.

abstract: We study a translation invariant spin model in a three-dimensional regular lattice, called the cubic code model, in the presence of arbitrary extensive perturbations. Below a critical perturbation strength, we show that most states with finite energy are localized; the overwhelming majority of such states have energy concentrated around a finite number of defects, and remain so for a time that is near-exponential in the distance between the defects. This phenomenon is due to an emergent superselection rule and does not require any disorder. An extensive number of local integrals of motion for these finite energy sectors are identified as well. Our analysis extends more generally to systems with immobile topological excitations.

abstract: We perform an "archeological" study of one of the original experiments used as evidence for the static, time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since the experiment in question [L. Marton, J. A. Simpson, and J. A. Suddeth, Rev. Sci. Instr. 25, 1099 (1954)] involved a time varying magnetic field we show that there are problems with the explanation of this experiment as a confirmation of the static Aharonov-Bohm effect -- specifically the previous analysis ignored the electric field which arises in conjunction with a time-varying magnetic flux. We further argue that the results of this experiment do in fact conform exactly to the recent prediction [D. Singleton and E. Vagenas, Phys. Lett. B723, 241 (2013); J. MacDougall and D. Singleton, J. Math. Phys. 55, 042101 (2014)] of a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts for the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect. To resolve this issue a new time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm experiment is called for.

abstract: Entanglement between two qubits (two level atoms) mediated by surface plasmons in three-dimensional plasmonic waveguides is studied using a quantum master equation formalism. Two types of waveguides, a nanowire and a V-shaped channel cut in a flat metal plane, are considered. The Green functions for the waveguides, which rigorously describes the dissipative qubit environment, are calculated numerically using a direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. Finite-length effects are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing entanglement, and resonant-length plasmonic waveguides can provide higher entanglement between qubits than infinite-length waveguides. It is also shown that coupling slots can improve entanglement via stronger qubit-waveguide coupling, for both the infinite- and finite-waveguide cases.

abstract: We analyze how the performance of a quantum-repeater network depends on the protocol employed to distribute entanglement, and we find that the choice of repeater-to-repeater link protocol has a profound impact on communication rate as a function of hardware parameters. We develop numerical simulations of quantum networks using different protocols, where the repeater hardware is modeled in terms of key performance parameters, such as photon generation rate and collection efficiency. These parameters are motivated by recent experimental demonstrations in quantum dots, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. We find that a quantum-dot repeater with the newest protocol ("MidpointSource") delivers the highest communication rate when there is low probability of establishing entanglement per transmission, and in some cases the rate is orders of magnitude higher than other schemes. Our simulation tools can be used to evaluate communication protocols as part of designing a large-scale quantum network.

abstract: We propose and analyze an optically loaded quantum memory exploiting capacitive coupling between self-assembled quantum dot molecules and electrically gated quantum dot molecules. The self-assembled dots are used for spin-photon entanglement, which is transferred to the gated dots for long-term storage or processing via a teleportation process heralded by single-photon detection. We illustrate a device architecture enabling this interaction and we outline its operation and fabrication. We provide self-consistent Poisson-Schroedinger simulations to establish the design viability and refine the design, and to estimate the physical coupling parameters and their sensitivities to dot placement. The device we propose generates heralded copies of an entangled state between a photonic qubit and a solid-state qubit with a rapid reset time upon failure. The resulting fast rate of entanglement generation is of high utility for heralded quantum networking scenarios involving lossy optical channels.

abstract: There has been considerable progress in the design and construction of quantum annealing devices. However, a conclusive detection of quantum speedup over traditional silicon-based machines remains elusive, despite multiple careful studies. In this work we outline strategies to design hard tunable benchmark instances based on insights from the study of spin glasses - the archetypal random benchmark problem for novel algorithms and optimization devices. We propose to complement head-to-head scaling studies that compare quantum annealing machines to state-of-the-art classical codes with an approach that compares the performance of different algorithms and/or computing architectures on different classes of computationally hard tunable spin-glass instances. The advantage of such an approach lies in having to only compare the performance hit felt by a given algorithm and/or architecture when the instance complexity is increased. Furthermore, we propose a methodology that might not directly translate into the detection of quantum speedup, but might elucidate whether quantum annealing has a "`quantum advantage" over corresponding classical algorithms like simulated annealing. Our results on a 496 qubit D-Wave Two quantum annealing device are compared to recently-used state-of-the-art thermal simulated annealing codes.

abstract: Quantum linear response theory considers only the response of a closed quantum system to a perturbation up to first order in the perturbation. This theory breaks down when the system subjects to environments and the response up to second order in perturbation is not negligible. In this paper, we develop a quantum nonlinear response theory for open systems. We first formulate this theory in terms of general susceptibility, then apply it to deriving the Hall conductance for the open system at finite temperature. Taking the two-band model as an example, we derive the Hall conductance for the two-band model. We calculate the Hall conductance for a two-dimensional ferromagnetic electron gas and a two-dimensional lattice model via different expressions for $d_{\alpha}(\vec p), \ \alpha=x,y,z$. The results show that the transition points of topological phase almost remain unchanged in the presence of environments.

abstract: We present an NMR experiment to detect the evolution of a spin system during the transient to a quasi-equilibrium state. In this way, new evidence is presented in favor of irreversible decoherence as the mechanism which leads an initial out-of-equilibrium state to quasi-equilibrium. The results are obtained using a modified Jeener-Broekaert experiment where a spin reversion pulse sequence and a decode of coherence are included. The sequence also allows visualizing the evolution of the full spectra of the different coherences during the formation of the quasi-equilibrium. We use different reversion strategies on three nematic liquid crystal samples. We conclude that the eigen-selection observed as an evidence of irreversible decoherence is an indication that the spin system in liquid-crystal NMR experiments, conform actual quantum open systems, where the quasi-equilibrium is a rigorous description of their dynamics in a time-scale far earlier than thermal equilibrium.

Protective measurement is described, both in the original and generalized form. The degree to which the system and the apparatus remain entangled in a protective measurement, is assessed. A possible experimental test of protective measurements is discussed.

abstract: Whether a quantum bath can be approximated as classical noise is a fundamental issue in central spin decoherence and also of practical importance in designing noise-resilient quantum control. Spin qubits based on bismuth donors in silicon have tunable interactions with nuclear spin baths and are first-order insensitive to magnetic noise at so-called clock-transitions (CTs). This system is therefore ideal for studying the quantum/classical nature of nuclear spin baths since the qubit-bath interaction strength determines the back-action on the baths and hence the adequacy of a classical noise model. We develop a Gaussian noise model with noise correlations determined by quantum calculations and compare the classical noise approximation to the full quantum bath theory. We experimentally test our model through dynamical decoupling sequence of up to 128 pulses, finding good agreement with simulations and measuring electron spin coherence times approaching one second - notably using natural silicon. Our theoretical and experimental study demonstrates that the noise from a nuclear spin bath is analogous to classical Gaussian noise if the back-action of the qubit on the bath is small compared to the internal bath dynamics, as is the case close to CTs. However, far from the CTs, the back-action of the central spin on the bath is such that the quantum model is required to accurately model spin decoherence.

abstract: By jointly using quantum Zeno dynamics and the approach of "transitionless quantum driving (TQD)" proposed by Berry to construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage (STAP), we propose an efficient scheme to fast generate multiatom Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in separate cavities connected by opitical fibers only by one-step manipulation. We first detail the generation of the three-atom GHZ states via TQD, then, we compare the proposed TQD scheme with the traditional ones with adiabatic passage. At last, the influence of various decoherence factors, such as spontaneous emission, cavity decay and fiber photon leakage, is discussed by numerical simulations. All the results show that the present TQD scheme is fast and insensitive to atomic spontaneous emission and fiber photon leakage. Furthermore, the scheme can be directly generalized to realize N-atom GHZ states generation by the same principle in theory.

abstract: We demonstrate that the Casimir-Polder force for a molecule near the surface of a real dielectric substrate out of thermal equilibrium displays distinctive behaviors as compared to that at thermal equilibrium. In particular, when the molecule-substrate separation is much less than the molecular transition wave-length, the CP force in the high temperature limit can be dramatically manipulated by varying the relative magnitude of the temperatures of the substrate and the environment so that the attractive-to-repulsive transition can occur beyond certain a threshold temperature of either the substrate or the environment depending on which one is higher for molecules both in the ground and excited states. More remarkably, when the separation is comparable to the wave-length, such transitions which are impossible at thermal equilibrium may happen for longitudinally polarizable molecules with a small permittivity, while for isotropically polarizable ones the transitions can even occur at room temperature for some dielectric substrates such as sapphire and graphite which is much lower than the temperature for the transition to take place in the thermal equilibrium case, thus making the experimental demonstration of such force transitions easier.

abstract: We consider networks featuring preparation, transformation, and measurement devices, in which devices exchange communication via mediating physical systems. We investigate the problem of testing the dimension of the mediating systems in the device-independent scenario, that is, based on observable data alone. A general framework for tackling this problem is presented, considering both classical and quantum systems. These methods can then also be used to certify the non-classicality of the mediating systems, given an upper bound on their dimension. Several case studies are reported, which illustrate the relevance of the framework. These examples also show that, for fixed dimension, quantum systems largely outperform classical ones. Moreover, the use of a transformation device considerably improves noise tolerance when compared to simple prepare-and-measure networks. These results suggest that the classical simulation of quantum systems becomes costly in terms of dimension, even for simple networks.

abstract: Monogamy is a nonclassical property that limits the amount of quantum correlation which can be shared among different parties in a multiparty quantum system. We show that the monogamy scores for the different quantum correlation measures are bounded above by the functions of genuine multipartite entanglement for a large majority of multiqubit pure states. We analytically show that the bound is universal for three-qubit states and identify the conditions for its validity in higher number of qubits. Moreover, we derive a set of necessary conditions to characterize the extremely small set of states that may violate the multiparty entanglement bound on monogamy score, and numerically observe that the bound is satisfied by almost all Haar uniformly generated multiqubit pure states. The results show that the distribution of bipartite quantum correlations in a multipartite system is restricted by its genuine multipartite entanglement content.

abstract: We propose a methodology to design optimal pulses for achieving quantum optimal control on molecular systems. Our approach constrains pulse shapes to linear combinations of a fixed number of experimentally relevant pulse functions. Quantum optimal control is obtained by maximizing a multi-target fitness function with genetic algorithms. As a first application of the methodology we generated an optimal pulse that successfully maximized the yield on a selected dissociation channel of a diatomic molecule. Our pulse is obtained as a linear combination of linearly chirped pulse functions. Data recorded along the evolution of the genetic algorithm contained important information regarding the interplay between radiative and diabatic processes. We performed a principal component analysis on these data to retrieve the most relevant processes along the optimal path. Our proposed methodology could be useful for performing quantum optimal control on more complex systems by employing a wider variety of pulse shape functions.

abstract: If X and Y are independent, Y and Z are independent, and so are X and Z, one might be tempted to conclude that X, Y, and Z are independent. But it has long been known in classical probability theory that, intuitive as it may seem, this is not true in general. In quantum mechanics one can ask whether analogous statistics can emerge for configurations of particles in certain types of entangled states. The explicit construction of such states, along with the specification of suitable sets of observables that have the purported statistical properties, is not entirely straightforward. We show that an example of such a configuration arises in the case of an N-particle GHZ state, and we are able to identify a family of observables with the property that the associated measurement outcomes are independent for any choice of 2, 3, ..., N-1 of the particles, even though the measurement outcomes for all N particles are not independent. Although such states are highly entangled, the entanglement turns out to be 'fragile', i.e. the associated density matrix has the property that if one traces out the freedom associated with even a single particle, the resulting reduced density matrix is separable.

abstract: Detection of entanglement in bipartite states is a fundamental task in quantum information. The first method to verify entanglement in mixed states was the partial-transpose criterion. Subsequently, numerous quantifiers for bipartite entanglement were introduced, among them concurrence and negativity. Surprisingly, these quantities are often treated as distinct or independent of each other. The aim of this contribution is to highlight the close relations between these concepts, to show the connections between seemingly independent results, and to present various estimates for the mixed-state concurrence within the same framework.

abstract: Secure positioning, a prover located at a specified position convinces a set of verifiers at distant reference stations that he/she is indeed at the specific position, is considered to be impossible if the prover and verifiers have no pre-shared data while dishonest provers have an arbitrary amount of pre-shared entanglement [Nature 479, 307-308 (2011)]. We argue here that current impossibility results for secure positioning are the upshot of not utilizing full powers of relativistic quantum information theory and show that secure positioning and hence position-based quantum cryptography is possible if causal structure of Minkowski space time and quantum non-locality is used properly.

abstract: We present and investigate an analogue model for a controllable photon geberation via the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in a cavity containing a degenerate optical amplifier (OPA) which is pumed by an amplitude-modulated field. The time modulation of the pump field in the model OPA system is equivalent to a periodic modulation of the cavity length, which is responsible for the generation of the Casimir radiation. By taking into account the rapidly oscillating terms of the modulation frequency, the effects of the corresponding counter-rotating terms (CRTs) on the analogue Casimir radiation emerge clearly. We find that the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical properties exhibit oscillatory behaviors, which are controllable through the modulation frequency as an external control parameter.We also recognize a new phenomenon, the so-called "Anti-DCE," in which pair photons can be coherently annihilated due to the time-modulated pumping. We show that the Casimir radiation exhibits quadrature squeezing, photon bunching and super-Poissonian statistics which are controllable by modulation frequency. We also calculate the power spectrum of the intracavity light field. We find that the appearance of the side bands in the spectrum is due to the presence of the CRTs.

abstract: The influence of outside quantum noises on the amplification of weak measurements is investigated. Three typical quantum noises are discussed. The maximum values of the pointer's shifts decrease sharply with the strength of the depolarizing channel and phase damping. In order to obtain significant amplified signals, the preselection quantum systems must be kept away from the two quantum noises. Interestingly, the amplification effect is immune to the amplitude damping noise.

abstract: Topological entanglement entropy, which is defined as the conditional mutual information of a state for an annular region in a topologically ordered system, is widely used to detect characteristic topological correlations in topologically ordered phases. We investigate an information-theoretical meaning of the topological entanglement entropy by analyzing a multi-partite correlation measure called irreducible correlation. We prove that the topological entanglement entropy is equivalent to the irreducible correlation if the state has zero-correlation length. We further show that for zero-correlation length states the irreducible correlation is equal to the maximum communication rate of a particular class of secret sharing protocols. Therefore, we provide an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy.

abstract: We introduce a family of operations in quantum mechanics that one can regard as "universal quantum measurements" (UQMs). These measurements are applicable to all finite-dimensional quantum systems and entail the specification of only a minimal amount of structure. The first class of UQM that we consider involves the specification of the initial state of the system---no further structure is brought into play. We call operations of this type "tomographic measurements", since given the statistics of the outcomes one can deduce the original state of the system. Next, we construct a disentangling operation, the outcome of which, when the procedure is applied to a general mixed state of an entangled composite system, is a disentangled product of pure constituent states. This operation exists whenever the dimension of the Hilbert space is not a prime, and can be used to model the decay of a composite system. As another example, we show how one can make a measurement of the direction along which the spin of a particle of spin s is oriented (s = 1/2, 1, ...). The required additional structure in this case involves the embedding of CP(1) as a rational curve of degree 2s in CP(2s).

abstract: Quantum nonlocality and contextuality are two phenomena stemming from nonclassical correlations. Whereas the former requires entanglement that is consumed in the measurement process the latter can occur for any state if one chooses a proper set of measurements. Despite this stark differences experimental tests of both phenomena were similar so far. For each run of the experiment one had to use a different copy of a physical system prepared according to the same procedure, or the system had to be brought to its initial state. Here we show that this is not necessary and that the state-independent contextuality can be manifested in a scenario in which each measurement round is done on an output state from the previous round.

abstract: A state is called Maximally Multipartite Entangled State (MMES) if it is maximally entangled according to any balanced bipartition. Such states are also important in setting up quantum networks. In this work, we introduce a method for creating such states or very good approximations of them, by gluing Bell states in a step by step manner. Three different strategies based on linear, star and branch geometries are investigated. Beside creating GHZ, W and asymmetric W states, we obtain other entangled states up to seven-qubit states. In each case we calculate the measure of multiparty entanglement first introduced in [1, 2] in the form of an average of purity over all bi-partitions.

abstract: In this work we propose a practical entanglement classification scheme for pure states of $2\times L\times M\times N\times H$, under the stochastic local operation and classical communication (SLOCC), which generalizes the method explored in the entanglement classification of $2\times L\times M\times N$ to the five-partite system. The entangled states of $2\times L\times M\times N\times H$ system are first classified into different coarse-grained standard forms using matrix decompositions, and then fine-grained identification of two inequivalent entangled states with the same standard form are completed by using the matrix realignment technique. As an practical example, entanglement classes of the five-qubit system of $2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ are presented.

abstract: A randomly walking quantum particle searches in Grover's $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ iterations for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices by repeatedly querying an oracle that flips the amplitude at the marked vertex, scattering by a "coin" flip, and hopping. Physically, however, potential energy barriers can hinder the hop and cause the search to fail, even when the amplitude of not hopping decreases with $N$. We correct for these errors by interpreting the quantum walk search as an amplitude amplification algorithm and modifying the phases applied by the coin flip and oracle such that the amplification recovers the $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ runtime.

abstract: Nuclear spin registers in the vicinity of electron spins in solid state systems offer a powerful resource to address the challenge of scalability in quantum architectures. We investigate here the properties of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins surrounding donor atoms in silicon, and consider the use of such spins, combined with the donor nuclear spin, as a quantum register coupled to the donor electron spin. We find the coherence of the nearby $^{29}$Si nuclear spins is effectively protected by the presence of the donor electron spin, leading to coherence times in the second timescale - over two orders of magnitude greater than the coherence times in bulk silicon. We theoretically investigate the use of such a register for quantum error correction, including methods to protect nuclear spins from the ionisation/neutralisation of the donor, which is necessary for the re-initialisation of the ancillae qubits. This provides a route for multi-round quantum error correction using donors in silicon.

Signatures of the ESQPT are directly visible in the complex spectrum of an effective Hamiltonian, whereas they get smeared out in the time-dependence of system observables. In the latter case, we show how delayed feedback control can be used to restore the visibility of the ESQPT signals.

abstract: The static and dynamic properties of many-body quantum systems are often well described by collective excitations, known as quasiparticles. Engineered quantum systems offer the opportunity to study such emergent phenomena in a precisely controlled and otherwise inaccessible way. We present a spectroscopic technique to study artificial quantum matter and use it for characterizing quasiparticles in a many-body system of trapped atomic ions. Our approach is to excite combinations of the system's fundamental quasiparticle eigenmodes, given by delocalised spin waves. By observing the dynamical response to superpositions of such eigenmodes, we extract the system dispersion relation, magnetic order, and even detect signatures of quasiparticle interactions. Our technique is not limited to trapped ions, and it is suitable for verifying quantum simulators by tuning them into regimes where the collective excitations have a simple form.

abstract: We study the problem of remote one-qubit mixed state creation using a pure initial state of two-qubit sender and spin-1/2 chain as a connecting line. We express the parameters of creatable states in terms of transition amplitudes. We show that the creation of complete receiver's state-space can be achieved only in the chain engineered for the one-qubit perfect state transfer (PST) (for instance, in the fully engineered Ekert chain), the chain can be arbitrarily long in this case. As for the homogeneous chain, the creatable receiver's state region decreases quickly with the chain length. Both homogeneous chains and chains engineered for PST can be used for the purpose of selective state creation, when only the restricted part of the whole receiver's state space is of interest. Among the parameters of the receiver's state, the eigenvalue is the most hard creatable one and therefore deserves the special study. Regarding the homogeneous spin chain, an arbitrary eigenvalue can be created only if the chain is of no more then 34 nodes. Alternating chain allows us to increase this length up to 68 nodes.

The Hamiltonian of the system considered contains some explicit time-dependence in addition to one resulting from being minimally coupled to a time-dependent magnetic field. The eigenvalue equations for the two spinor components of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant are found to decouple into a pair of supersymmetric invariants in a similar fashion as the known decoupling for the time-independent Dirac Hamiltonians.

abstract: We investigate the specific form that the collapsed quantum state of a signal photon can take when its entangled idler is measured in an entangled ghost imaging configuration using a type II collinear phase matched spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) interaction. Calculation of the correlated counting rate distributions in the ghost image plane and diffraction plane show that agreement between collapse and non-collapse models is obtained if the signal is assumed to collapse into a specific mixed state. However, if the signal is assumed to collapse into a pure state, significant differences arise between the predictions of the two collapse models.

abstract: Whilst physicists have long been aware of the existence of a fundamental uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, an explicit understanding of this principle has remained an enigma, our grasp limited to specific "uncertainty relations". In this work we overcome these limitations by clarifying the concept of uncertainty, based on minimalistic axioms. Applying this notion to quantum-mechanical measurements, we arrive at a general, overarching framework for characterizing all quantum-mechanical uncertainty relations, which we unify into our proposed Uncertainty Principle. Along the way, we find that the variance is an uncertainty measure only in a restricted sense.

abstract: We introduce the notion of time reversal in open quantum systems as represented by linear quantum operations, and a related generalization of classical entropy production in the environment. This functional is the ratio of the probability to observe a transition between two states under the forward and the time reversed dynamics, and leads, as in the classical case, to fluctuation relations as tautological identities. As in classical dynamics in contact with a heat bath, time reversal is not unique, and we discuss several possibilities. For any bistochastic map its dual map preserves the trace and describes a legitimate dynamics reversed in time, in that case the entropy production in the environment vanishes. For a generic stochastic map we construct a simple quantum operation which can be interpreted as a time reversal. For instance, the decaying channel, which sends the excited state into the ground state with a certain probability, can be reversed into the channel transforming the ground state into the excited state with the same probability.

abstract: Recent tests performed on the D-Wave Two quantum annealer have revealed no clear evidence of speedup over conventional silicon-based technologies. Here, we present results from classical parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with isoenergetic cluster moves of the archetypal benchmark problem-an Ising spin glass-on the native chip topology. Using realistic uncorrelated noise models for the D-Wave Two quantum annealer, we study the best-case resilience, i.e., the probability that the ground-state configuration is not affected by random fields and random-bond fluctuations found on the chip. We thus compute classical upper-bound success probabilities for different types of disorder used in the benchmarks and predict that an increase in the number of qubits will require either error correction schemes or a drastic reduction of the intrinsic noise found in these devices. We outline strategies to develop robust, as well as hard benchmarks for quantum annealing devices, as well as any other computing paradigm affected by noise.

abstract: This paper is concerned with a translation invariant network of identical quantum stochastic systems subjected to external quantum noise. Each node of the network is directly coupled to a finite number of its neighbours. This network is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator and is governed by a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The dynamic variables of the network satisfy the canonical commutation relations. Similar large-scale networks can be found, for example, in quantum metamaterials and optical lattices. Using spatial Fourier transform techniques, we obtain a sufficient condition for stability of the network in the case of finite interaction range, and consider a mean square performance index for the stable network in the thermodynamic limit. The Peres-Horodecki-Simon separability criterion is employed in order to obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for quantum entanglement of bipartite systems of nodes of the network in the Gaussian invariant state. The results on stability and entanglement are extended to the infinite chain of the linear quantum systems by letting the number of nodes go to infinity. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the results.

It is shown, that wave function collapse is the specific transformation which is fundamentally differ from Shr\"odinger's evolution. Specifically, a formal cause of the collapse is a local time derivative (infinite large) of the potential energy. Such transformation can not be described using mathematical apparatus of conventional quantum mechanics.

abstract: Quantum statistics originate from the physics of state preparation. It is therefore wrong to think of quantum states as fundamental. In fact, quantum states are merely summaries of dynamical processes that randomize the properties of the system by drawing on the inexhaustible reservoir of quantum fluctuations provided by the physical tools used to control the quantum system. The mathematical form of the "state vector" is actually an expression of the laws of causality which describe the relations between physical properties in terms of the action of transformations. These laws of causality directly associate the macroscopic effects of a physical property in an interaction with the environment with dynamical changes to the system caused by the microscopic properties of that environment.

Control is implemented by shaping the laser which excites $S_2$. Excitation and IC are considered simultaneously, using the recently introduced resonance-based control approach. Highly successful control is achieved by optimizing both the amplitude and phase profiles of the laser spectrum. The dependence of control on the properties of resonances in $S_2$ is demonstrated.

abstract: The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, with which legitimate users are able to estimate information leakage by monitoring the disturbance of the transmitted quantum signals. Normally, the disturbance is reflected as bit flip errors in the sifted key; thus, privacy amplification, which removes any leaked information from the key, generally depends on the bit error rate. Recently, a round-robin differential-phase-shift QKD protocol for which privacy amplification does not rely on the bit error rate [Nature 509, 475 (2014)] was proposed. The amount of leaked information can be bounded by the sender during the state-preparation stage and hence, is independent of the behaviour of the unreliable quantum channel. Considering the essence of this protocol, we present a tight bound on the key rate and employ a decoy-state method. The effects of background noise and misalignment are taken into account under practical conditions. Our simulation results show that the protocol can tolerate channel error rates of close to 50% within a typical experiment setting. That is, there is no restriction on the error rate in practice.

We employed a master-slave configuration for the laser, where an ultra low expansion glass (ULE) Fabry-Perot cavity is used as a stable reference as well as a spectral filter. We characterized the laser spectrum using the ions with a modified Ramsey sequence which eliminated the affect of the magnetic field noise. We demonstrated high fidelity single qubit gates with individual addressing, based on inhomogeneous micromotion, on a two-ion chain as well as the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen two-qubit entangling gate.

The equilibrium probability density obtained in the mixed coordinate-momentum space is a reasonable extension of the Gibbs canonical distribution.

abstract: An efficient implementation of many multiparty protocols for quantum networks requires that all the nodes in the network share a common reference frame. Establishing such a reference frame from scratch is especially challenging in an asynchronous network where network links might have arbitrary delays and the nodes do not share synchronised clocks. In this work, we study the problem of establishing a common reference frame in an asynchronous network of $n$ nodes of which at most $t$ are affected by arbitrary unknown error, and the identities of the faulty nodes are not known. We present a protocol that allows all the correctly functioning nodes to agree on a common reference frame as long as the network graph is complete and not more than $t<n/4$ nodes are faulty. As the protocol is asynchronous, it can be used with some assumptions to synchronise clocks over a network. Also, the protocol has the appealing property that it allows any existing two-node asynchronous protocol for reference frame agreement to be lifted to a robust protocol for an asynchronous quantum network.

abstract: We demonstrate a new method for the direct measurement of atomic dipole transition matrix elements based on techniques developed for quantum information purposes. The scheme consists of measuring dispersive and absorptive off-resonant light-ion interactions and is applicable to many atomic species. We determine the dipole matrix element pertaining to the Ca II H line, i.e. the 4$^2$S$_{1/2} \leftrightarrow $ 4$^2$P$_{1/2}$ transition of $^{40}$Ca$^+$, for which we find the value 2.8928(43) ea$_0$. Moreover, the method allows us to deduce the lifetime of the 4$^2$P$_{1/2}$ state to be 6.904(26) ns, which is in agreement with predictions from recent theoretical calculations and resolves a longstanding discrepancy between calculated values and experimental results.

abstract: Quantum contextuality is one of the fundamental notions in quantum mechanics. Proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem and noncontextuality inequalities are two means for revealing the contextuality phenomenon in quantum mechanics. It has been found that some proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem, such as those based on rays, can be converted to a state-independent noncontextuality inequality, but it remains open whether it is true in general, i.e., whether any proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem can always be converted to a noncontextuality inequality. In this paper, we address this issue. We prove that all kinds of proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem, based on rays or any other observables, can always be converted to state-independent noncontextuality inequalities. Besides, our constructive proof also provides a general approach for deriving a state-independent noncontextuality inequality from a proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem.

abstract: Recently, a protocol for quantum state discrimination (QSD) in a multi-party scenario has been introduced [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 100501 (2013)]. In this protocol, Alice generates a quantum system in one of two pre-defined non-orthogonal qubit states, and the goal is to send the generated state information to different parties without any classical communication between them. The interesting feature is that, by resorting to sequential generalized measurements onto this system, there is a non-vanishing probability that all observers identify the state prepared by Alice. Here, we present the experimental implementation of this protocol based on polarization single-photon states. Our scheme works over a linear optical network, and since QSD lies in the core of many protocols, it represents a step towards experimental multi-party quantum information processing.

abstract: Chimera states are complex spatiotemporal patterns in networks of identical oscillators, characterized by the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized dynamics. Here we propose to extend the phenomenon of chimera states to the quantum regime, and uncover intriguing quantum signatures of these states. We calculate the quantum fluctuations about semiclassical trajectories and demonstrate that chimera states in the quantum regime can be characterized by bosonic squeezing, weighted quantum correlations, and measures of mutual information. Our findings reveal the relation of chimera states to quantum information theory, and give promising directions for experimental realization of chimera states in quantum systems.

abstract: Recent experiments have realized an all-optical photon transistor using a cold atomic gas. This approach relies on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in conjunction with the strong interaction among atoms excited to high-lying Rydberg states. The transistor is gated via a so-called Rydberg spinwave, in which a single Rydberg excitation is coherently shared by the whole ensemble. In its absence the incoming photon passes through the atomic ensemble by virtue of EIT while in its presence the photon is scattered rendering the atomic gas opaque. An important current challenge is to preserve the coherence of the Rydberg spinwave during the operation of the transistor, which would enable for example its coherent optical read-out and its further processing in quantum circuits. With a combined field theoretical and quantum jump approach and by employing a simple model description we investigate systematically and comprehensively how the coherence of the Rydberg spinwave is affected by photon scattering. With large-scale numerical calculations we show how coherence becomes increasingly protected with growing interatomic interaction strength. For the strongly interacting limit we derive analytical expressions for the spinwave fidelity as a function of the optical depth and bandwidth of the incoming photon.

abstract: We theoretically study the optical tomography of maximally entangled states generated at the output modes of a beam splitter. We consider even and odd coherent states in one of the input modes and vacuum state in the other input mode of the beam splitter. We have shown that the signatures of entanglement can be observed directly in the optical tomogram of the state, without reconstructing the density matrix of the system. Two distinct types of optical tomograms are observed in any one of the output modes of the beam splitter based on the quadrature measurement in the other output mode if the output modes are entangled. The different features shown by the optical tomograms are verified by investigating the photon number statistics of the corresponding state.

abstract: Optical trapping is an indispensable tool in physics and the life sciences. However, there is a clear trade off between the size of a particle to be trapped, its spatial confinement, and the intensities required. This is due to the decrease in optical response of smaller particles and the diffraction limit that governs the spatial variation of optical fields. It is thus highly desirable to find techniques that surpass these bounds. Recently, a number of experiments using nanophotonic cavities have observed a qualitatively different trapping mechanism described as "self-induced back-action trapping" (SIBA). In these systems, the particle motion couples to the resonance frequency of the cavity, which results in a strong interplay between the intra-cavity field intensity and the forces exerted. Here, we provide a theoretical description that for the first time captures the remarkable range of consequences. In particular, we show that SIBA can be exploited to yield dynamic reshaping of trap potentials, strongly sub-wavelength trap features, and significant reduction of intensities seen by the particle, which should have important implications for future trapping technologies

abstract: Quantum cryptography uses techniques and ideas from physics and computer science. The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum cryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol is secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these assumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may break the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent on which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an implementation of the protocol. This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection between the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their experimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key distribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties. We provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics using the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key distribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline several mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or simplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in quantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in implementations. Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes quantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes. Protocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which kinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions are justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an eavesdropper. Two contributions of the author are discussed: the security proofs of two two-way quantum-key-distribution protocols and an intuitive proof of the data-processing inequality.

abstract: One-shot decoupling is a powerful primitive in quantum information theory and was hypothesized to play a role in the black hole information paradox. We study black hole dynamics modeled by a trilinear Hamiltonian whose semiclassical limit gives rise to the Hawking radiation. An explicit numerical calculation of the discretized path integral of the S-matrix shows that decoupling is exact in the continuous limit, implying that quantum information is perfectly transferred from the black hole to radiation. A striking consequence of decoupling is the emergence of an output radiation entropy profile that follows Page's prediction.

abstract: The version of Bohmian mechanics in relativistic space-time that works best, the hypersurface Bohm--Dirac model, assumes a preferred foliation of space-time into spacelike hypersurfaces (called the time foliation) as given. We consider here a degenerate case in which, contrary to the usual definition of a foliation, several leaves of the time foliation have a region in common. That is, if we think of the time foliation as a 1-parameter family of hypersurfaces, with the hypersurfaces moving towards the future as we increase the parameter, a degenerate time foliation is one for which a part of the hypersurface does not move as we increase the parameter. We show that the hypersurface Bohm--Dirac model still works in this situation; that is, we show that a Bohm-type law of motion can still be defined, and that the appropriate $|\psi|^2$ distribution is still equivariant with respect to this law.

abstract: Aiming at a ternary quantum logic circuit, four symmetric ternary quantum homomorphic encryption schemes, based on ternary quantum one-time protocol, were presented. First, for a one-qutrit rotation gate, a homomorphic quantum encryption scheme was constructed. Second, in view of the synthesis of a 3x3 general unitary transformation, another one-qutrit quantum homomorphic encryption scheme was proposed. Third, according to the one-qutrit scheme, the two-qutrit quantum homomorphic encryption scheme about GCX(m') gate was constructed and was further generalized to the n-qutrit unitary matrix case. Finally, the security of these schemes was analyzed from two perspectives. It could be concluded that the attacker can correctly guess the encryption key with a maximum probability ${p_k} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 {{3^{3n}}}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {{3^{3n}}}}$, thus it can better protect the privacy of users' data. Moreover these schemes can be well integrated into future quantum remote server architecture, and the computational security of the user's private quantum information can be well solved in a distributed computing environment.

abstract: A single superconducting artificial atom provides a unique basis for coupling electromagnetic fields and photons hardly achieved with a natural atom. Bringing a pair of harmonic oscillators into resonance with transitions of the three-level atom converts atomic spontaneous processes into correlated emission dynamics. We demonstrate two-mode correlated emission lasing on harmonic oscillators coupled via the fully controllable three-level artificial atom. Correlation of two different color emissions reveals itself as equally narrowed linewiths and quench of their mutual phase-diffusion. The mutual linewidth is more than four orders of magnitude narrower than the Schawlow-Townes limit. The interference between the different color lasing fields demonstrates the two-mode fields are strongly correlated.

Our approach exploit the Noether symmetries of the system by proposing integrals of motion as the variables to obtain a solution to the -genvalue equation, namely the Wigner function. We also obtain, by means of a quantum canonical transformation the wave function associated to the Schr\"odinger equation of the system. We show that unitary evolution of the system is guaranteed by means of the quantum canonical transformation and via the properties of the constructed Wigner function, even in the so called equal frequency limit of the model, in agreement with recent results.

abstract: Quantum simulators, which exploit quantum effects to reveal unknown or difficult-to-compute properties of a model of interest, play a significant role in quantum information science. Quantum simulation of the dynamics of many-body system has been widely studied for various quantum computing systems, including cold atoms, trapped ions and photons. However, simulation of quantum channels, which describes one of the most general quantum processes in realistic systems, has not yet been fully explored, even for single-qubit channels. Here we report the first experimental digital quantum simulator of arbitrary single-qubit channels. We built this simulator with a set of single-qubit gates together with a single two-qubit entangling gate. We show that any single-qubit channel can be efficiently and accurately programmed and compiled by our simulator. Our scheme generalizes Hamiltonian-based simulators to channel-based digital quantum simulators, which could have important applications in quantum computation and quantum simulation.

This proposal paves the way to study multipartite nonlocality and entanglement in ultracold atomic systems.

abstract: Methods and techniques to measure and image beyond the state-of-the-art have always been influential in propelling basic science and technology. Because current technologies are venturing into nanoscopic and molecular-scale fabrication, atomic-scale measurement techniques are inevitable. One such emerging sensing method uses the spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond. The uniqueness of this NV sensor is its atomic size and ability to perform precision sensing under ambient conditions conveniently using light and microwaves (MW). These advantages have unique applications in nanoscale sensing and imaging of magnetic fields from nuclear spins in single biomolecules. During the last few years, several encouraging results have emerged towards the realization of an NV spin-based molecular structure microscope. Here, we present a projection-reconstruction method that retrieves the three-dimensional structure of a single molecule from the nuclear spin noise signatures. We validate this method using numerical simulations and reconstruct the structure of a molecular phantom \b{eta}-cyclodextrin, revealing the characteristic toroidal shape.

abstract: We study the work statistics of a periodically-driven integrable closed quantum system, addressing in particular the role played by the presence of a quantum critical point. Taking the example of a one-dimensional transverse Ising model in the presence of a spatially homogeneous but periodically time-varying transverse field of frequency $\omega_0$, we arrive at the characteristic cumulant generating function $G(u)$, which is then used to calculate the work distribution function $P(W)$. By applying the Floquet theory we show that, in the infinite time limit, $P(W)$ converges, starting from the initial ground state, towards an asymptotic steady state value whose small-$W$ behaviour depends only on the properties of the small-wave-vector modes and on a few important ingredients: the time-averaged value of the transverse field, $h_0$, the initial transverse field, $h_{\rm i}$, and the equilibrium quantum critical point $h_c$, which we find to generate a sequence of non-equilibrium critical points $h_{*l}=h_c+l\omega_0/2$, with $l$ integer. When $h_{\rm i}\neq h_c$, we find a "universal" edge singularity in $P(W)$ at a threshold value of $W_{\rm th}=2|h_{\rm i}-h_c|$ which is entirely determined by $h_{\rm i}$. The form of that singularity --- Dirac delta derivative or square root --- depends on $h_0$ being or not at a non-equilibrium critical point $h_{*l}$. On the contrary, when $h_{\rm i}=h_c$, $G(u)$ decays as a power-law for large $u$, leading to different types of edge singularity at $W_{\rm th}=0$. Generalizing our calculations to the case in which we initialize the system in a finite temperature density matrix, the irreversible entropy generated by the periodic driving is also shown to reach a steady state value in the infinite time limit.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.02984
abstract: Quantum phase estimation algorithm has been successfully adapted as a sub frame of many other algorithms applied to a wide variety of applications in different fields. However, the requirement of a good approximate eigenvector given as an input to the algorithm hinders the application of the algorithm to the problems where we do not have any prior knowledge about the eigenvector. In this paper, we show that the principal eigenvalue of an irreducible non-negative operator can be determined by using an equal superposition initial state in the phase estimation algorithm. This removes the necessity of the existence of an initial good approximate eigenvector. Moreover, we show that the success probability of the algorithm is related to the closeness of the operator to a stochastic matrix. Therefore, we draw an estimate for the success probability by using the variance of the column sums of the operator. This provides a priori information which can be used to know the success probability of the algorithm beforehand for the non-negative matrices and apply the algorithm only in cases when the estimated probability reasonably high. Finally, we discuss the possible applications and show the results for random symmetric matrices and 3-local Hamiltonians with non-negative off-diagonal elements.

abstract: We study the entanglement between two coupled detectors, whose internal degrees of freedom are modeled by harmonic oscillators, interacting with a common quantum field, paying special attention to two less studied yet important features: finite separation and direct coupling. Distance dependence is essential in quantum teleportation and relativistic quantum information considerations. The presence of a quantum field as the environment accords an indirect interaction between the two oscillators at finite separation of a non-Markovian nature which competes with the direct coupling between them. The interplay between these two factors results in a rich variety of interesting entanglement behaviors at late times. We show that the entanglement behavior reported in prior work assuming no separation between the detectors can at best be a transient effect at very short times, and claims that such behaviors represent late time entanglement are misplaced. Entanglement between the detectors with direct coupling enters in the consideration of macroscopic quantum phenomena and other frontline issues. We find that with direct coupling entanglement between the two detectors can sustain over a finite distance, in contrast to the no-direct coupling case reported before, where entanglement can not survive at separation more than a few inverse high frequency cutoff scales. This work provides a solid platform necessary for further systematic investigations into the entanglement behavior of continuous variable quantum systems.

abstract: Triggered sources of entangled photons play crucial roles in almost any existing protocol of quantum information science. The possibility to generate these non-classical states of light with high speed and using electrical pulses could revolutionize the field. Entangled-light-emitting-diodes (ELEDs) based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are at present the only devices that can address this task 5. However, ELEDs are plagued by a source of randomness that hampers their practical exploitation in the foreseen applications: the very low probability (~10-2) of finding QDs with sufficiently small fine-structure-splitting for entangled-photon-generation. Here, we overcome this hurdle by introducing the first strain-tunable ELEDs (S-ELEDs) that exploit piezoelectric-induced strains to tune QDs for entangled-photon-generation. We demonstrate that up to 30% of the QDs in S-ELEDs emit polarization-entangled photon pairs with entanglement-fidelities as high as f+ = 0.83(5). Driven at the highest operation speed of 400 MHz ever reported so far, S-ELEDs emerge as unique devices for high-data rate entangled-photon applications.

abstract: We reconsider the concept of multi-prover commitments, as introduced in the late eighties in the seminal work by Ben-Or et al. As was recently shown by Cr\'{e}peau et al., the security of known two-prover commitment schemes not only relies on the explicit assumption that the provers cannot communicate, but also depends on their information processing capabilities. For instance, there exist schemes that are secure against classical provers but insecure if the provers have quantum information processing capabilities, and there are schemes that resist such quantum attacks but become insecure when considering general so-called non-signaling provers, which are restricted solely by the requirement that no communication takes place. This poses the natural question whether there exists a two-prover commitment scheme that is secure under the sole assumption that no communication takes place; no such scheme is known. In this work, we give strong evidence for a negative answer: we show that any single-round two-prover commitment scheme can be broken by a non-signaling attack. Our negative result is as bad as it can get: for any candidate scheme that is (almost) perfectly hiding, there exists a strategy that allows the dishonest provers to open a commitment to an arbitrary bit (almost) as successfully as the honest provers can open an honestly prepared commitment, i.e., with probability (almost) 1 in case of a perfectly sound scheme. In the case of multi-round schemes, our impossibility result is restricted to perfectly hiding schemes. On the positive side, we show that the impossibility result can be circumvented by considering three provers instead: there exists a three-prover commitment scheme that is secure against arbitrary non-signaling attacks.

abstract: The expansion of a harmonic potential that holds a quantum particle may be realized without any final particle excitation but much faster than adiabatically via "shortcuts to adiabaticity" (STA). While ideally the process time can be reduced to zero, practical limitations and constraints impose minimal finite times for the externally controlled time-dependent frequency protocols. We examine the role of different time-averaged energies (total, kinetic, potential, non-adiabatic) and of the instantaneous power in characterizing or selecting different protocols.Specifically, we prove a virial theorem for STA processes, set minimal energies for specific times or viceversa, and discuss their realizability by means of Dirac impulses or otherwise.

abstract: We present a description of the measurement process based on the parametric representation with environmental coherent states. This representation is specifically tailored for studying quantum systems whose environment needs being considered through the quantum-to-classical cross-over. Focusing upon projective measures, and exploiting the connection between large-$N$ quantum theories and the classical limit of related ones, we manage to push our description beyond the pre-measurement step. This allows us to show that the outcome production follows from a global-symmetry breaking, entailing the observed system's state reduction, and that the statistical nature of the process is brought about, together with the Born's rule, by the macroscopic character of the measuring apparatus.

The present paper addresses the flip side of superradiance, i.e. subradiance. Single photon subradiant states are potentially stable against collective spontaneous emission and can have ultrafast readout. In particular it is shown how many atom collective effects provide a new way to control spontaneous emission by preparing and switching between subradiant and superradiant states.

abstract: We present methods which allow orders of magnitude increase in the number of modes in linear optics experiments by moving from spatial encoding to temporal encoding and using dispersion. This enables significant practical advantages for linear quantum optics and Boson Sampling experiments. Passing consecutively heralded photons through time-independent dispersion and measuring the output time of the photons is equivalent to a Boson Sampling experiment for which no efficient classical algorithm is reported, to our knowledge. With time-dependent dispersion, it is possible to implement arbitrary single-particle unitaries. Given the relatively simple requirements of these schemes, they provide a path to realizing much larger linear quantum optics experiments including post-classical Boson Sampling machines.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.03106
abstract: This document is meant as a pedagogical introduction to the modern language used to talk about quantum theories, especially in the field of quantum information. It assumes that the reader has taken a first traditional course on quantum mechanics, and is familiar with the concept of Hilbert space and elementary linear algebra. As in the popular textbook on quantum information by Nielsen and Chuang, we introduce the generalised concept of states (density matrices), observables (POVMs) and transformations (channels), but we also go further and characterise these structures from an algebraic standpoint, which provides many useful technical tools, and clarity as to their generality. This approach also makes it manifest that quantum theory is a direct generalisation of probability theory, and provides a unifying formalism for both fields. Although this algebraic approach dates back, in parts, to John von Neumann, we are not aware of any presentation which focuses on finite-dimensional systems. This simplifcation allows us to have a self-contained presentation which avoids many of the technicalities inherent to the most general $C^*$-algebraic approach, while being perfectly appropriate for the quantum information literature.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: In this paper we investigate some aspects of the dynamics of a quantum system constituted by a two-level atom (atom 1) in interaction with a single mode cavity field. The field is considered to be weakly coupled to a third subsystem: a second two-level atom (atom 2), in a mixed state, which will play the role of an external environment. We analyze the influence of such a small environment on the dynamics of quantities such as the linear entropy (state purity) and the atomic dipole squeezing of atom 1, as well as the entanglement between atom 1 and the field. In order to study a general situation, we obtain the full analytical solution of the two atom Tavis-Cummings model in which the constituent atoms may be coupled with different strengths to the field and also have different frequency detunings. We show that nonclassical features associated to the main system may be significantly degraded by the action of the small environment, if atom 2 is resonantly coupled to the field. We also demonstrate that the nonclassical behaviour of the system may be restored if we detune the field from the transition frequency of atom 2, the environment.

abstract: We address quantum communication channels based on phase modulation of coherent states and analyze in details the effects of static and dynamical (stochastic) phase diffusion. We evaluate mutual information for an ideal phase receiver and for a covariant phase-space-based receiver, and compare their performances by varying the number of symbols in the alphabet and/or the overall energy of the channel. Our results show that phase communication channels are generally robust against phase noise, especially for large alphabets in the low energy regime. In the presence of dynamical (non-Markovian) noise the mutual information is preserved by the time correlation of the environment, and when the noise spectra is detuned with respect to the information carrier, revivals of mutual information appears.

We numerically study the effect of the coupling between the elastic and inelastic channels, width of the individual barrier, separation between the consecutive barriers on the saturation of tunneling time. Nature of HF effect has further been investigated for more realistic barriers with random inelasticity and also for emissive inelastic channels.

abstract: The quantum mechanical behavior of a particle in a double well defies our intuition based on classical reasoning. Not surprisingly, an asymmetry in the double well will restore results more consistent with the classical picture. What is surprising, however, is how a very small asymmetry can lead to essentially classical behavior. In this paper we use the simplest version of a double well potential to demonstrate these statements. We also show how this system accurately maps onto a two-state system, which we refer to as a `toy model'.

abstract: We propose a scheme for preparing an ensemble of atoms in a maximally entangled W state by exploiting the Rydberg blockade effect. The success of our protocol is indicated by the detection of an ion, which thus serves as a herald for successful entangled state preparation. The fidelity of the preparation scheme is independent of the number of atoms in the ensemble. Therefore, a small cloud of atoms in a dipole trap randomly loaded from a background gas can be reliably prepared in a maximally entangled state despite of atom number fluctuations.

abstract: We explore the possibility of using "weak measurements" without "weak value" for quantum state estimation. Since for weak measurements the disturbance caused during each measurement is small, we can rescue the state, unlike for the case of projective measurements. We use this property of weak measurements and design schemes for quantum state estimation for qubits and for Gaussian states. We show, via numerical simulations, that under certain circumstances, our method can outperform the estimation by projective measurements both for qubits and for Gaussian states. It turns out that ensemble size plays an important role and the scheme based on recycling works better for small ensembles.

abstract: In this paper we propose a new protocol to achieve coherent population transfer between two states in a three-level atom by using two ac fields. It is based on the physics of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), but it is implemented with the constraint of a reduced control, namely one of the fields cannot be switched off. A combination of frequency chirps is used with resonant fields, allowing to achieve approximate destructive interference, despite of the fact that an exact dark state does not exist. This new chirped STIRAP protocol is tailored for applications to artificial atoms, where architectures with several elementary units can be strongly coupled but where the possibility of switching on and off such couplings is often very limited. Demonstration of this protocol would be a benchmark for the implementation of a class of multilevel advanced control procedures for quantum computation and microwave quantum photonics in artificial atoms.

The coefficients of the expansion are then retrieved using a least squares algorithm. The experimentally obtained operator measure is validated on classical and nonclassical states and exploited to obtain the overall quantum efficiency of the detector.

abstract: Quantum parameter estimation, the ability to precisely obtain a classical value in a quantum system, is very important to many key quantum technologies. Many of these technologies rely on an optical probe, either coherent or squeezed states to make a precise measurement of a parameter ultimately limited by quantum mechanics. We use this technique to theoretically model, simulate and validate by experiment the measurement and precise estimation of the position of a cavity mirror. In non-resonant systems, the achieved estimation enhancement from quantum smoothing over optimal filtering has not exceeded a factor two, even when squeezed state probes were used. Using a coherent state probe, we show that using quantum smoothing on a mechanically resonant structure driven by a resonant forcing function can result significantly greater improvement in parameter estimation than with non-resonant systems. In this work, we show that it is possible to achieve a smoothing improvement by a factor in excess of three times over optimal filtering. By using intra-cavity light as the probe we obtain finer precision than has been achieved with the equivalent quantum resources in free-space.

The many-particle system can be expressed in terms of the generators a deformed $SU(2)$ algebra, and the mean-field dynamics takes place on a deformed version of the Bloch sphere, a teardrop shaped surface with a cusp singularity. We analyse the mean-field and many-particle correspondence, which shows typical features of quantum-classical correspondence. We demonstrate that semiclassical methods can be employed to recover full many-particle features from the mean-field description in cold atom systems with atom-molecule conversion, and derive an analytic expression for the many-particle density of states in the limit of large particle numbers.

abstract: We show that the dipole force of an ensemble of quantum emitters embedded in a dielectric nanosphere can be exploited to achieve a strong single-photon quantum optomechanical coupling, in the resolved sideband regime and at room temperature, with experimentally feasible parameters. The key ingredient is that the polarizability from an ensemble of embedded quantum emitters can be larger than the bulk polarizability of the sphere, thereby enabling the use of repulsive optical potentials and consequently the levitation at near-fields. This allows to boost the single-photon coupling by combining larger polarizability to mass ratio, larger field gradients, and smaller cavity volumes. A case study is done with a nanodiamond containing a high-density of silicon-vacancy color centers that is optically levitated in the evanescent field of a high-finesse microsphere cavity.

We show that the collective non-local dissipation induced by the thermal bath plays a fundamental role in energy transport. It gives rise to a dramatic enhancement of the energy-transport efficiency, which may largely overcome $100\%$. This effect, which improves the understanding of transport phenomena in experimentally relevant complexes, suggests a particularly promising mechanism for quantum energy management.

abstract: In this work we present a theoretical model supported with a physical reasoning leading to a relation which performs an excellent estimation for the tunneling time in attosecond and strong field experiments, where we address the important case of the He-atom \cite{Eckle:2008s,Eckle:2008}. Our tunneling time estimation is found by utilizing the time-energy uncertainty relation and represents a quantum clock. The tunneling time is also featured as the time of passage (at the exit of the tunnel) similarly to the Einstein's {\it photon box Gedanken experiment}. Our work tackles an important study case for the theory of time in quantum mechanics and is very promising for the search for a (general) time operator in quantum mechanics. The work can be seen as a new fundamental step in dealing with the tunneling time in strong field and ultra-fast science, and is appealing for more elaborate treatments using quantum wave packet dynamics and especially for complex atoms and molecules.

abstract: We demonstrate that quantum fluctuations can cause, under certain conditions, the instability of pure states. The degree and type of such instability are controlled by the environment-induced anti-Hermitian parts of Hamiltonians. This is drastically different from the Hermitian case where both the purity's value and pure states are preserved during time evolution. The instability of pure states is not preassigned in the evolution equation but arises as the emergent phenomenon in its solutions. In order to illustrate the different types of instability that may occur, we consider some exactly solvable two-state models which can be used in a theory of open quantum-optical and spin systems.

abstract: We evaluate the advantages of performing cross phase modulation (XPM) on a very-far-off-resonance atomic system. We consider a ladder system with a weak (few-photon level) control coherent field imparting a conditional nonlinear phase shift on a probe beam. We find that by coupling to an optical resonator the optimal XPM is enhanced proportional to the finesse of the resonator by a factor of $F/4\pi$. We present a semi-classical description of the system and show that the phenomenon is optimal in the self-defined condition of off-resonance-effective-cooperativity equal to one.

In contrast, we here study a quantum repeater architecture that uses simple parametric down-conversion sources, as well as frequency-multiplexed multimode quantum memories and photon-number resolving detectors. We show that this approach can significantly extend quantum communication distances compared to direct transmission. This shows that important trade-offs are possible between the different components of quantum repeater architectures.

abstract: Spin-chain models have been widely studied in terms of quantum information processes, for instance for the faithful transmission of quantum states. Here, we investigate the limitations of mapping this process to an equivalent one through a bosonic chain. In particular, we keep in mind experimental implementations, which the progress in integrated waveguide circuits could make possible in the very near future. We consider the feasibility of exploiting the higher dimensionality of the Hilbert space of the chain elements for the transmission of a larger amount of information, and the effects of unwanted excitations during the process. Finally, we exploit the information-flux method to provide bounds to the transfer fidelity.

abstract: We construct measures for the non-Markovianity of quantum evolution with a physically meaningful interpretation. We first provide a general setting in the framework of channel capacities and propose two families of meaningful quantitative measures, based on the largest revival of a channel capacity, avoiding some drawbacks of other non-Markovianity measures. We relate the proposed measures to the task of information screening. This shows that the non-Markovianity of a quantum process may be used as a resource. Under these considerations, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, a qubit in a quantum environment with classically mixed dynamics and the Jaynes-Cummings model.

abstract: The role of noise in the transport properties of quantum excitations is a topic of great importance in many fields, from organic semiconductors for technological applications to light-harvesting complexes in photosynthesis. In this paper we study a semi-classical model where a tight-binding Hamiltonian is fully coupled to an underlying spatially extended nonlinear chain of atoms. We show that the transport properties of a quantum excitation are subtly modulated by (i) the specific type (local vs non-local) of exciton-phonon coupling and by (ii) nonlinear effects of the underlying lattice. We report a non-monotonic dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient on temperature, in agreement with earlier predictions, as a direct consequence of the lattice-induced fluctuations in the hopping rates due to long-wavelength vibrational modes. A standard measure of transport efficiency confirms that both nonlinearity in the underlying lattice and off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling promote transport efficiency at high temperatures, preventing the Zeno-like quench observed in other models lacking an explicit noise-providing dynamical system.

abstract: Time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEGF) are shown to provide a flexible, effective tool for the description of quantum mechanical single particle scattering on a spatially localized, time-dependent potential. Focusing on numerical methods, arbitrary space and time dependence of the potential can be treated, provided it is zero before an initial time instant. In this case, appropriate version of the Dyson and Keldysh equations lead to a transparent description with clear physical interpretation. The interaction of a short laser pulse and an electron propagating initially in free space is discussed as an example.

abstract: We discuss the entropic criterion for separability of compound quantum systems for general non-additive entropic forms based on arbitrary concave functions $f$. For any separable state, the generalized entropy of the whole system is shown to be not smaller than that of the subsystems, for any choice of $f$, providing thus a necessary criterion for separability. Nevertheless, the criterion is not sufficient and examples of entangled states with the same property are provided. This entails, in particular, that the conjecture about the positivity of the conditional Tsallis entropy for all $q$, a more stringent requirement than the positivity of the conditional von Neumann entropy, is actually a necessary but not sufficient condition for separability in general. The direct relation between the entropic criterion and the largest eigenvalues of the full and reduced density operators of the system is also discussed.

abstract: We examine the violation of the majorization relations between the eigenvalues of the full and reduced density operators of entangled states of composite systems and its detection using generalized entropic forms based on arbitrary concave functions. It is shown that the violation of these relations may not always be detected by the conditional von Neumann and Tsallis entropies (for any $q>0$). Families of smooth entropic forms which are always able to detect such violations are, however, provided. These features are then examined for particular sets of mixed states in a two-qudit system, which for $d\geq 3$ may exhibit different types of violation of the majorization relations. Comparison with the Peres criterion for separability is also shown.

Particular results obtained with the Tsallis entropy and with an introduced exponential entropic form are also discussed.

The tomographic probability representation for the qudit states is applied. The connection between the correlation function in two qubit system and the single qudit is presented in an integral form with a intertwining kernel calculated explicitly in tomographic probability terms.

Our repeater relies on an error correction protocol for loss on CV states based on CV teleportation and entanglement distillation via noiseless linear amplification. The error correction protocol is concatenated to preserve the same effective transmission coefficient for the quantum channel over increasing distance. The probability of successful operation of the repeater scales polynomially with distance. However, the protocol is limited by a trade-off between fidelity and probability of success.

abstract: Quantum measurement is a physical process. A system and an apparatus interact for a certain time period (measurement time). During this interaction, information of an observable is transferred from the system to the apparatus. In this study, we study the amount of energy fluctuation of the apparatus that is required for this physical process to occur. To do so, the interface between the quantum and classical worlds ("Heisenberg cut") must be carefully chosen so that the quantum side is large enough to autonomously switch on the interaction. At this setting we prove that a trade-off relation (energy-time uncertainty relation) holds between the energy fluctuation of the apparatus and the measurement time. We use this trade-off relation to discuss the spacetime uncertainty relation questioning the operational meaning of the microscopic structure of spacetime. In addition, we derive another trade-off inequality between the measurement time and the strength of interaction between the system and the apparatus. The larger the information carried by an observable to be measured, the stronger restriction the trade-off relations give.

abstract: Boson Sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialised quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, Scattershot Boson Sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric downconversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. Here we report the first Scattershot Boson Sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.

abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is widely regarded as the quintessential quantum interference phenomenon in optics. In this work we examine how nonlinearity can smear statistical photon bunching in the HOM interferometer. We model both the nonlinearity and a balanced beam splitter with a single two-level system and calculate a finite probability of anti-bunching arising in this geometry. We thus argue that the presence of such nonlinearity would reduce the visibility in the standard HOM setup, offering some explanation for the diminution of the HOM visibility observed in many experiments. We use the same model to show that the nonlinearity affects a resonant two-photon propagation through a two-level impurity in a waveguide due to a "weak photon blockade" caused by the impossibility of double-occupancy and argue that this effect might be stronger for multi-photon propagation.

abstract: We experimentally study the effects of the anisotropic Rydberg-interaction on $D$-state Rydberg polaritons slowly propagating through a cold atomic sample. In addition to the few-photon nonlinearity known from similar experiments with Rydberg $S$-states, we observe the interaction-induced dephasing of Rydberg polaritons at very low photon input rates into the medium. We develop a model combining the propagation of the two-photon wavefunction through our system with nonperturbative calculations of the anisotropic Rydberg-interaction to show that the observed effect can be attributed to pairwise interaction of individual Rydberg polaritons.

abstract: Although the theoretical treatment to describe the light field in Quantum Optics was generic, during large time it was predominantly related to optical modes trapped inside cavities. Important results were then obtained in this scenario. However, in view of the practical difficulties due to the deleterious effects of decoherence upon states of trapped fields, many physicists in this area began to focus more emphasis in the treatment using traveling fields. This brief report concerns with engineering non-classical states of light field to show some details and applications in the later scenario. Here the interaction "atom-trapped field", is translated to the interaction "beam splitter-traveling field".

abstract: The recently developed formalism of Markovian master equations for quantum open systems with external periodic driving is applied to the theory of dynamical decoupling by periodic control. This new approach provides a more detailed quantitative picture of this phenomenon applicable both to traditional NMR spectroscopy and to recent attempts of decoherence reduction in quantum devices. For popular choices of bath spectral densities and a two-level system, exact formulas for the relaxation rates are available. In the context of NMR imaging, the obtained formulas allow the extraction of a new parameter describing bath relaxation time from the experimental data.

abstract: A long-lived qubit is usually well-isolated from all other systems and the environments, and so is not easy to couple with measurement apparatus. It is sometimes difficult to implement reliable projective measurements on such a qubit. One potential solution is spin amplification with many ancillary qubits. Here, we propose a spin amplification technique, where the ancillary qubits state change depending on the state of the target qubit. The technique works even in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening. We show that fast and accurate amplification is possible even if the coupling and frequency of the ancillary qubits is inhomogeneous. Since our scheme is robust against realistic imperfections, this could provide a new mechanism for reading out a single spin that could not have been measured using the previous approaches.

abstract: Random number plays a key role in information science, especially in cryptography. Based on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, quantum random number generators can produce genuine randomness. In particular, random numbers can be produced from laser phase fluctuations with a very high speed, typically in the Gbps regime. In this work, by developing a physical model, we investigate the origin of the randomness in quantum random number generators based on laser phase fluctuations. We show how the randomness essentially stems from spontaneous emissions. The laser phase fluctuation can be quantitatively evaluated from basic principles and also qualitatively explained by the Brownian motion model. After taking account of practical device precision, we show that the randomness generation speed is limited by the finite resolution of detection devices. Our result also provides the optimal experiment design in order to achieve the maximum generation speed.

abstract: We study the effects of Lorentz transformations on three-particle non-local system states (GHZ and W) of spin 1/2 particles, using the Pauli spin operator and a three-particle generalization of Bell's inequality, introduced by Svetlichny. In our setup, the moving and laboratory frames used the (same) set of measurement directions that maximally violate Svetlichny's inequality in the laboratory frame. We also investigate the behavior of Mermin's and Collins' inequalities. We find that, regardless of the particles' type of entanglement, violation of Svetlichny's inequality in the moving frame is decreased by increasing the boost velocity and the energy of particles in the laboratory frame. In the relativistic regime Svetlichny's inequality is a good criterion to investigate the non-locality of the GHZ state. We also find that Mermin's and Collins' inequalities lead to reasonable predictions, in agreement with the behavior of the spin state, about non-locality of the W state in the relativistic regime. Then, comparing our results with those in which Czachor's relativistic spin is used instead of the Pauli operator, we find that the results obtained by considering the Pauli spin operator are in better agreement with the behavior of spin state of the system in the relativistic information theory.

abstract: In this paper we apply the time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method to explore single- and double-slit diffraction of matter waves. By using a simplified model of two electrons prepared in the ground state of an atom (molecule) and then suddenly released we are able to calculate the diffraction patterns in one spatial dimension in close correspondence with the numerically exact results. Through the Coulomb repulsion the one electron serves as an environment for the other thus introducing decoherence in the quantum state which is easily quantified. It is demonstrated that the set of single particle wave functions yield by TDQMC can be used to directly construct density matrix for that particle without tracing out the other particles from the density matrix of the whole system. In this way it is possible to build explicitly time-dependent density matrices for different components of a complex quantum system straight within the TDQMC algorithm which may widen our understanding of quantum dynamics in many-body systems.

abstract: We study quantum correlations in a bipartite heteronuclear $(N-1)\times1$ system in an external magnetic field. The system consists of a spin ring with an arbitrary number $N-1$ of spins on the ring and one spin in its center. The spins on the ring are connected by secular dipole-dipole interactions and interact with the central spin through the Heisenberg $zz$-interaction. We show that the quantum discord, describing quantum correlations between the ring and the central spin, can be obtained analytically for this model in the high temperature approximation. The model allows us to find contributions of different parts of the spin-spin interactions to quantum correlations. We also investigate the evolution of quantum and classical correlations at different numbers of spins.

abstract: We consider discrete and integer-valued cellular automata (CA). A particular class of which comprises "Hamiltonian CA" with equations of motion that bear similarities to Hamilton's equations, while they present discrete updating rules. The dynamics is linear, quite similar to unitary evolution described by the Schroedinger equation. This has been essential in our construction of an invertible map between such CA and continuous quantum mechanical models, which incorporate a fundamental discreteness scale. Based on Shannon's sampling theory, it leads, for example, to a one-to-one relation between quantum mechanical and CA conservation laws. The important issue of linearity of the theory is examined here by incorporating higher-order nonlinearities into the underlying action. These produce inconsistent nonlocal (in time) effects when trying to describe continuously such nonlinear CA. Therefore, in the present framework, only linear CA and local quantum mechanical dynamics are compatible.

We propose how to mimic these bio-inspired features in a quantum-mechanical formalism, which allows for an experimental implementation achievable with current quantum platforms. This result paves the way for the realization of artificial life and embodied evolution with quantum technologies.

abstract: We examine the behavior of quantum correlations of spin pairs in a finite anisotropic $XY$ spin chain immersed in a transverse magnetic field, through the analysis of the quantum discord and the conventional and quadratic one way-information deficits. We first provide a brief review of these measures, showing that the last ones can be obtained as particular cases of a generalized information deficit based on general entropic forms. All these measures coincide with an entanglement entropy in the case of pure states, but can be non-zero in separable mixed states, vanishing just for classically correlated states. It is then shown that their behavior in the exact ground state of the chain exhibits similar features, deviating significantly from that of the pair entanglement below the critical field. In contrast with entanglement, they reach full range in this region, becoming independent of the pair separation and coupling range in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field. It is also shown, however, that significant differences between the quantum discord and the information deficits arise in the local minimizing measurement that defines them. Both analytical and numerical results are provided.

abstract: By performing local projective measurements on a two-qubit entangled state one can certify in a device-independent way up to one bit of randomness. We show here that general measurements, defined by positive-operator-valued measures, can certify up to two bits of randomness, which is the optimal amount of randomness that can be certified from an entangled bit. General measurements thus provide an advantage over projective ones for device-independent randomness certification.

abstract: We investigate the exact dynamics of a system of two independent harmonic oscillators coupled through their angular momentum. The exact analytic solution of the equations of motion for the field operators is derived, and the conditions for dynamical stability are obtained. As application, we examine the emergence of squeezing and mode entanglement for an arbitrary separable coherent initial state. It is shown that close to instability, the system develops considerable entanglement, which is accompanied with simultaneous squeezing in the coordinate of one oscillator and the momentum of the other oscillator. In contrast, for weak coupling away from instability, the generated entanglement is small, with weak alternating squeezing in the coordinate and momentum of each oscillator. Approximate expressions describing these regimes are also provided.

abstract: We show that two photons coupled to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency can interact via an effective Coulomb potential. This interaction gives rise to a continuum of two-body bound states. Within the continuum, metastable bound states are distinguished in analogy with quasi-bound states tunneling through a potential barrier. We find multiple branches of metastable bound states whose energy spectrum is governed by the Coulomb potential, thus obtaining a photonic analogue of the hydrogen atom. Under certain conditions, the wavefunction resembles that of a diatomic molecule in which the two polaritons are separated by a finite "bond length." These states propagate with a negative group velocity in the medium, allowing for a simple preparation and detection scheme, before they slowly decay to pairs of bound Rydberg atoms.

abstract: Any optical quantum information processing machine would be comprised of fully-characterized constituent devices for both single state manipulations and tasks involving the interaction between multiple quantum optical states. Ideally for the latter, would be an apparatus capable of deterministic optical phase shifts that operate on input quantum states with the action mediated solely by auxiliary signal fields. Here we present the complete experimental characterization of a system designed for optically controlled phase shifts acting on single-photon level probe coherent states. Our setup is based on a warm vapor of rubidium atoms under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency with its dispersion properties modified through the use of an optically triggered N-type Kerr non-linearity. We fully characterize the performance of our device by sending in a set of input probe states and measuring the corresponding output via balanced homodyne tomography and subsequently performing the technique of coherent state quantum process tomography. This method provides us with the precise knowledge of how our optical phase shift will modify any arbitrary input quantum state engineered in the mode of the reconstruction.

abstract: The so-called classical limit of quantum mechanics is generally studied in terms of the decoherence of the state operator that characterizes a system. This is not the only possible approach to decoherence. In previous works we have presented the possibility of studying the classical limit in terms of the decoherence of relevant observables of the system. On the basis of this approach, in this paper we introduce the classical limit from a logical perspective, by studying the way in which the logical structure of quantum properties corresponding to relevant observables acquires Boolean characteristics.

abstract: Control over the quantum state of interacting particles to a high degree of fidelity is an important ability to have in the quest for understanding fundamental properties of non-classical states. However, the quickly increasing density of the spectrum, together with the appearance of crossings in time-dependent processes, makes any effort to control the system hard and resource intensive. Here we show that in trapped systems regimes can exist, in which isolated energy bands appear that allow to easily generalize known single-particle techniques. We demonstrate this for the well known spatial adiabatic passage effect, which can control the centre-of-mass state of atoms with high fidelity.

abstract: A global solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians is derived by integrating the non-linear differential equation associated with the time-dependent wave operator. A fast iterative solution method is proposed in which, however, numerous integrals over time have to be evaluated. This internal work is done using a numerical integrator based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The case of a transition between two potential wells of a model molecule driven by intense laser pulses is used as an illustrative example. This application reveals some interesting features of the integration technique. Each iteration provides a global approximate solution on grid points regularly distributed over the full time propagation interval. Inside the convergence radius, the complete integration is competitive with standard algorithms, especially when high accuracy is required.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a two-axis counter-twisting Hamiltonian from an initial spin coherent state in a spin-$1/2$ ensemble. A characteristic feature of the two-axis counter-twisting Hamiltonian is the existence of four neutrally stable and two saddle unstable fixed points. The presence of the last one is responsible for a high level of squeezing. The squeezing is accompanied by the appearance of several quantum states of interest in quantum metrology with Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, and we show fidelity functions for some of them. We present exact results for the quantum Fisher information and the squeezing parameter. Although, the overall time evolution of both changes strongly with the number of particles, we find that they have regular dynamics for short times. We explain scaling with the system size by using a Gaussian approach.

abstract: Quantum metrology has the potential to revolutionise precision measurements by going beyond the bounds of classical physics. However, in the optical applications which require a large photon flux, such as gravitational wave detection, the fragility of quantum states reduces the precision gains to small constant-factor improvements. Here we instead focus on the low photon number regime, which is relevant to measurements of delicate systems, and show that in this regime significant improvements can be gained over classical measurements. In particular, the scheme we propose achieves a precision with a $\sqrt{7}$ factor improvement over the classical limit, and a $\sqrt{3}$ improvement when compared to the quantum states commonly considered for enhanced phase estimation. Crucially, the procedure we propose employs probe states that have already been produced in experiments, and is robust to moderate losses.

abstract: Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, and is the key resource for quantum information processing. Bipartite entangled states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several experiments, and post-selected entangled states involving pairs of photons, or single photons and single atoms, have also been produced. Here, we deterministically generate a "hybrid" entangled state of two different species of trapped-ion qubit, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make the first test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven two-qubit quantum logic gate, whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, to produce a maximally-entangled state of one Ca40 qubit and one Ca43 qubit, held in the same ion trap, with 99.8(5)% fidelity. We make a test of Bell's inequality for this novel entangled state, and find that it is violated by 15 sigma. Mixed-species quantum logic is an essential technique for the construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations, or are used as photonic interfaces to other processing units.

abstract: Based on the theory of quantum mechanics, intrinsic randomness in measurement distinguishes quantum effects from classical ones. From the perspective of states, this quantum feature can be summarized as coherence or superposition in a specific (classical) computational basis. Recently, by regarding coherence as a physical resource, Baumgratz et al.~present a comprehensive framework for coherence measures. Here, we propose a quantum coherence measure essentially using the intrinsic randomness of measurement. The proposed coherence measure provides an answer to the open question in completing the resource theory of coherence. Meanwhile, we show that the coherence distillation process can be treated as quantum extraction, which can replace the extraction process in quantum random number generators. From this viewpoint, the proposed coherence measure also clarifies the operational aspect of quantum coherence. Finally, our results indicate a strong similarity between two types of quantumness --- coherence and entanglement.

abstract: With the increase of complexity and coherence of superconducting systems made using the principles of circuit quantum electrodynamics, more accurate methods are needed for the characterization, analysis and optimization of these quantum processors. Here we introduce a new method of modelling that can be applied to superconducting structures involving multiple Josephson junctions, high-Q superconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique, an extension of our previous work on single-port structures [1], permits the derivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every feature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation of T1 times for qubits. We begin with a black box model of the linear and passive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance function Zsim(w), which can be obtained using a finite-element electormagnetics simulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of Josephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50 Ohm connectors to high-frequency lines. We fit Zsim(w) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s), a function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space techniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same impedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this finite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms to classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in numerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained by using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms [2, 3]. Due to the presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization methods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the Kirchhoff voltage and current laws.

abstract: We analyze the properties of a Raman quantum light-atom interface in long atomic ensemble and its applications as a quantum memory or two-mode squeezed state generator. We consider the weak-coupling regime and include both Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering and the effects of Doppler broadening in buffer gas assuming frequent velocity-averaging collisions. We find the Green functions describing multimode transformation from input to output fields of photons and atomic excitations. Proper mode basis is found via singular value decomposition for short interaction times. It reveals that triples of modes are coupled by a transformation equivalent to a combination of two beamsplitters and a two-mode squeezing operation. We analyze the possible transformations on an example of warm rubidium-87 vapor. The model we present bridges the gap between the Stokes only and anti-Stokes only interactions providing simple, universal description in a temporally and longitudinally multimode situation. Our results also provide an easy way to find an evolution of the states in a Schr\"odinger picture thus facilitating understanding and design.

abstract: There is a tension in quantum theory between the existence of a widely accepted way to axiomatize the theory and the lack of similarly accepted intuitive principles from which the theory can be derived. This tension is present at the very definition of what measurements are admissible. The usual assumption is that all measurements which do not produce negative probabilities are valid measurements, irrespective of how many outcomes the measurement has. Here we show that this assumption is accessible to falsification by particular high-precision Bell-type experiments, which can exclude that all measurements are produced from measurements with a limited number of outcomes and classical measurements. Our analysis reveals that the results of previous experiments provide evidence that nature cannot be explained with the simplest of these modifications in which quantum measurements are limited to two or three outcomes. This supports standard quantum theory versus some natural and almost indistinguishable alternatives. Future experiments can also aim to exclude other alternatives such as quantum measurements with higher number of outcomes and more general non-signaling theories with a limited number of outcomes, possibly imposing universal constraints on the structure of measurements in any physical theory.

abstract: We derive a general fluctuation theorem for quantum maps. The theorem applies to a broad class of quantum dynamics, such as unitary evolution, decoherence, thermalization, and other types of evolution for quantum open systems. The theorem reproduces well-known fluctuation theorems in a single and simplified framework and extends the Hatano-Sasa theorem to quantum nonequilibrium processes. Moreover, it helps to elucidate the physical nature of the environment inducing a given dynamics in an open quantum system.

abstract: Electromagnetic modes are instrumental in building quantum machines. In this experiment, we introduce a method to manipulate these modes by effectively controlling their phase space. Preventing access to a single energy level, corresponding to a number of photons N, confined the dynamics of the field to levels 0 to N-1. Under a resonant drive, the level occupation was found to oscillate in time, similarly to an N-level system. Performing a direct Wigner tomography of the field revealed its nonclassical features, including a Schr\"{o}dinger cat-like state at half period in the evolution. This fine control of the field in its phase space may enable applications in quantum information and metrology.

abstract: We give an overview of joint unsharp measurements of non-commuting observables using positive operator valued measures (POVMs). We exemplify the role played by joint measurability of POVMs in entropic uncertainty relation for Alice's pair of non-commuting observables in the presence of Bob's entangled quantum memory. We show that Bob should record the outcomes of incompatible (non-jointly measurable) POVMs in his quantum memory so as to beat the entropic uncertainty bound. In other words, in addition to the presence of entangled Alice-Bob state, implementing incompatible POVMs at Bob's end is necessary to beat the uncertainty bound and hence, predict the outcomes of non-commuting observables with improved precision. We also explore the implications of joint measurability to {\em validate} a moment matrix constructed from average pairwise correlations of three dichotomic non-commuting qubit observables. We prove that a classically acceptable moment matrix -- which ascertains the existence of a legitimate joint probability distribution for the outcomes of all the three dichotomic observables -- could be realized if and only if compatible POVMs are employed.

abstract: Blind quantum computation (BQC) allows an unconditionally secure delegated quantum computation for a client (Alice) who only possesses cheap quantum devices. So far, extensive efforts have been paid to make Alice's devices as classical as possible. Along this direction, quantum channels between Alice and the quantum server (Bob) should be considered as a part of Alice's devices, and the noise during a long distance quantum communication should be also taken into account. Here we propose to use decoherence-free subspace (DFS) to overcome the collective noise in a photonic quantum communication channel for BQC, which we call DFS-BQC. We propose three variations of DFS-BQC, each of which has its own advantage depending on situations. One of them, coherent-light-assisted protocol, allows Alice to send undecohered rotated photons without decreasing the total transmission rate compared to the case of single photon transmission. In all cases, we can combine the ideas based on DFS and BQC without degrading unconditional security. The proposed DFS-based schemes are generic and hence can be applied for other BQC protocols, where Alice sends quantum states to Bob.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.04257
abstract: Conventional superconducting qubits have used Josephson junctions as an essential part to provide anharmonicity for well-separated energy-level spacings. However, because a superconducting ring without Josephson junctions has intrinsically well-separated energy-level spacings, Josephson junctions are not necessary as long as one can achieve single-qubit operations. We show that the orbital angular momentum of light can be adopted as a qubit-control means and can eliminate the need for Josephson junctions. The feasibility study reveals that the proposed qubit has many advantages over the previous ones. The lifetime of the qubit is extended due to the lack of the junction resistance. Very fast (sub-nanosecond) qubit manipulation in both single- and two-qubit gate is achieved. Without Josephson junctions, the fabrication process is simple and the deviations in the characteristics of each qubit can be improved.

abstract: We study a simple open quantum system with a PT-symmetric defect potential as a prototype to illustrate general features of PT-symmetric open quantum systems; however, the potential could be mimicked by a number of recent PT experiments. One key feature is the resonance in continuum (RIC), which appears in both the discrete spectrum and scattering spectrum. The RIC forms a standing wave extending throughout the spatial extent of the system, representing a resonance between the open environment and the central PT-symmetric potential. We illustrate that as one deforms the system parameters, the RIC may exit the continuum by splitting into a bound state and a virtual bound state at the band edge, a process that should be experimentally observable. We also study the exceptional points (EPs) at which two eigenvalues coalesce; we categorize these as either EP2As, at which two real-valued solutions coalesce before becoming complex-valued, or EP2Bs, for which the two solutions are complex on either side of the EP. The EP2As are associated with PT-symmetry breaking; we argue that these are more stable against parameter perturbation than the EP2Bs. We also study complex-valued solutions of the discrete spectrum for which the wave function is nevertheless spatially localized, something not allowed in traditional open quantum systems; we illustrate that these may form quasi-bound states in continuum (QBICs) under some circumstances. We also study the scattering properties of the system, including states that support invisible propagation and some general features of perfect transmission states. We finally construct scattering states that satisfy PT-symmetric boundary conditions; while these states do not conserve the traditional probability current, we introduce the PT-current that is preserved. The perfect transmission states appear as a special case of the PT-symmetric scattering states.

abstract: Bell test is one of the most important tools in quantum information science. On the one hand, it enables fundamental test for the physics laws of nature, and on the other hand, it can be also applied in varieties of device independent tasks such as quantum key distribution and random number generation. In practice, loopholes existing in experimental demonstrations of Bell tests may affect the validity of the conclusions. In this work, we focus on the randomness (freewill) loophole and investigate the randomness requirement in a well-known Bell test, the Clauser-Horne test, under various conditions. With partially random inputs, we explicitly bound the Bell value for all local hidden variable models by optimizing the classical strategy. Our result thus puts input randomness requirement on the Clauser-Horne test under varieties of practical scenarios. The employed analysis technique can be generalized to other Bell's inequalities.

abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the entanglement between two dipole coupled two-level atoms. The model, in which only one atom is trapped in an lossless cavity and interacts with single-mode thermal field, and the other one can be spatially moved freely outside the cavity has been carried out. We have considered the effect of the atomic coherence on the entanglement behavior. We have shown that a thermal field might cause high entanglement between the atoms both for coherent and incoherent initial atomic states only for small values of the cavity mean photon number. In the considered model the atoms would get entangled even when both atoms are initially in the excited state. We have also derived that the degree of entanglement is weakly dependent on the strength of dipole-dipole interaction for coherent initial states.

abstract: The aim of this note is to attract once again attention of the quantum community to statistical analysis of data which was reported as violating Bell's inequality. This analysis suffers of a number of problems. And the main problem is that rough data is practically unavailable. However, experiments which are not followed by the open access to the rough data have to be considered as with no result. The absence of rough data generates a variety of problems in statistical interpretation of the results of Bell's type experiment. One may hope that this note would stimulate experimenters to create the open access data-base for, e.g., Bell tests. Unfortunately, recently announced experimental loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality using entangled electron spins separated by 1.3 km was not supported by open-access data. Therefore in accordance with our approach "it has no result." The promising data after publication is, of course, a step towards fair analysis quantum experiments. May be this is a consequence of appearance of this preprint, v1. But there are a few questions which would be interesting to clarify before publication (and which we shall discuss in this note).

abstract: We consider a macroscopic spin qubit based on spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates, where, in addition to the spin-orbit coupling, spin dynamics strongly depends on the interaction between particles. The evolution of the spin for freely expanding, trapped, and externally driven condensates is investigated. For condensates oscillating at the frequency corresponding to the Zeeman splitting in the synthetic magnetic field, the spin Rabi frequency does not depend on the interaction between the atoms since it produces only internal forces and does not change the total momentum. However, interactions and spin-orbit coupling bring the system into a mixed spin state, where the total spin is inside rather than on the Bloch sphere. This greatly extends the available spin space making it three-dimensional, but imposes limitations on the reliable spin manipulation of such a macroscopic qubit. The spin dynamics can be modified by introducing suitable spin-dependent initial phases, determined by the spin-orbit coupling, in the spinor wave function.

abstract: In support of the quantum field theory interpretation of quantum mechanics, stochastic processes with virtual particles whose mean field equations describe quantum dynamics are presented. Two type of virtual particles $A$ and $B$ with an asymmetric interaction such that $A$ rejects (hates) $B$ and $B$ attracts (loves) $A$ have a combined distribution that satisfies Schr\"odinger equation. It is also shown how four virtual particles drifting, creating and destroying themselves have a combined distribution that satisfies Dirac equation. Finally, a non-markovian process that generates Klein-Gordon equation is given. However, markovian property is recovered if we postulate reversed causality.

abstract: We analyze implementations of bipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication (LOCC) assisted by shared entanglement. We employ concepts and techniques developed in quantum Shannon theory to study an asymptotic scenario in which the two distant parties perform the same bipartite unitary on infinitely many pairs of input states generated by a completely random i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) quantum information source. We analyze the minimum costs of resources of entanglement and classical communication per copy. For protocols consisting of two-round LOCC, we prove that an achievable rate tuple of costs of entanglement and classical communication is given by the "Markovianizing cost" of a tripartite state associated with the unitary, which is conjectured to be optimal as well. We also propose a finite-step algorithm for computing the Markovianizing cost.

In addition, previous work on the singular harmonic oscillator model, introduced by Avakian et al. is reproduced to verify the method and results. A novel features is the determination of the spectra of asymmetric hybrid linear and quadratic potentials. As in previous work, the singular perturbations are modeled by delta functions.

abstract: We propose a scheme to generate W states based on transitionless-based shortcuts technique in cavity quantum electronic dynamics (QED) system. In light of quantum Zeno dynamics, we first effectively design a system whose effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the counter-diabatic driving Hamiltonian constructed by transitionless quantum driving, then, realize the W states' generation within this framework. For the sake of clearness, we describe two stale schemes for W states' generation via traditional methods: the adiabatic dark-state evolution and the quantum Zeno dynamics. The comparison among these three schemes shows the shortcut scheme is closely related to the other two but better than them. That is, numerical investigation demonstrates that the shortcut scheme is faster than the adiabatic one, and more robust against operational imperfection than the Zeno one. What is more, the present scheme is also robust against decoherence caused by spontaneous emission and photon loss

abstract: Shared entanglement and communication of a quantum system are the two quantum resources for information processing. Many information tasks can be performed using either quantum resource. However, this equivalence is not always present since entanglement is known to sometimes be the better performing resource. Here we show the opposite phenomenon: that there exists tasks for which sending a quantum system is a more powerful resource than sharing entanglement. We introduce a family of communication complexity problems parametrized by dimension of Hilbert space and study the performance of each quantum resource. We ?nd that for low dimensions, the two resources perform equally well whereas for dimension seven and above, the equivalency is suddenly broken and sending a quantum system becomes more powerful than sharing entanglement.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.04431
abstract: Pearle (1970) gave an example of a local hidden variables model which exactly reproduced the singlet correlations of quantum theory, through the device of data-rejection: particles can fail to be detected in a way which depends on the hidden variables carried by the particles and on the measurement settings. If the experimenter computes correlations between measurement outcomes of particle pairs for which both particles are detected, he is actually looking at a subsample of particle pairs, determined by interaction involving both measurement settings and the hidden variables carried in the particles. We correct a mistake in Pearle's formulas (a normalization error) and more importantly show that the model is more simple than first appears. We illustrate with visualisations of the model and with a small simulation experiment, with code in the statistical programming language R included in the paper. Open problems are discussed.

Our scheme requires neither direct coupling between qubits nor the detection of single photons. Moreover the quantum dots do not need to have the same frequencies and coupling constants.

abstract: We present a novel quantum phenomenon named electromagnetically induced entanglement in the conventional Lambda-type three-level atomic system driven by a strong pump field and a relatively weak probe field. Nearly perfect entanglement between the pump and probe fields can be achieved with a low coherence decay rate between the two lower levels, high pump-field intensity, and large optical depth of the atomic ensemble. The physical origin is quantum coherence between the lower doublet produced by the pump and probe fields, similar to the well-known electromagnetically induced transparency. This method would greatly facilitate the generation of nondegenerate narrow-band continuous-variable entanglement between bright light beams by using only coherent laser fields, and may find potential and broad applications in realistic quantum information processing.

abstract: It is proposed a optical procedure in context of continuous variables to verify the entanglement between two light modes without destroying both modes and their entanglement. The method relies on beam-splitter and quantum non-demolition interactions of the signal modes with two ancillary probe modes. The probe modes are measured by homodyne detection systems, and the detector signals are used to feedforward modulation of signal modes, concluding the procedure. It is shown that the classical information obtained from homodyne measurements is sufficient to verify the entanglement of the signal modes. The processing impact on the entanglement is analyzed.

abstract: We describe a novel analogue algorithm that allows the simultaneous factorization of an exponential number of large integers with a polynomial number of experimental runs. It is the interference-induced periodicity of "factoring" interferograms measured at the output of an analogue computer that allows the selection of the factors of each integer [1,2,3,4]. At the present stage the algorithm manifests an exponential scaling which may be overcome by an extension of this method to correlated qubits emerging from n-order quantum correlations measurements. We describe the conditions for a generic physical system to compute such an analogue algorithm. A particular example given by an "optical computer" based on optical interference will be addressed in the second paper of this series [5].

Results for the dependencies of the von Neumann and linear entanglement entropic measures on the cavity radius are discussed in details. Some highly accurate numerical results for the von Neumann and linear entropy are reported for the first time. It is found that the transition to the strong confinement regime is manifested by the entropies as an appearance of the inflection points on their variations.

A method to measure the characteristic function directly using an auxiliary qubit is also briefly discussed.

abstract: The fact that the quantum relative entropy is non-increasing with respect to quantum physical evolutions lies at the core of many optimality theorems in quantum information theory and has applications in other areas of physics. In this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex interpolation, basic linear algebra, and the recently introduced Renyi generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities.

abstract: We study the entropy increase of quantum systems evolving under primitive, doubly stochastic Markovian noise and thus converging to the maximally mixed state. This entropy increase can be quantified by a logarithmic-Sobolev constant of the Liouvillian generating the noise. We prove a universal lower bound on this constant that stays invariant under taking tensor-powers. Our methods involve a new comparison method to relate logarithmic-Sobolev constants of different Liouvillians and a technique to compute logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities of Liouvillians with eigenvectors forming a projective representation of a finite abelian group. Our bounds improve upon similar results established before and as an application we prove an upper bound on continuous-time quantum capacities. In the last part of this work we study entropy production estimates of discrete-time doubly-stochastic quantum channels by extending the framework of discrete-time logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities to the quantum case.

abstract: Quantum state space is endowed with a metric structure and Riemannian monotone metric is an important geometric entity defined on such a metric space. Riemannian monotone metrics are very useful for information-theoretic and statistical considerations on the quantum state space. In this article, considering the quantum state space being spanned by 2x2 density matrices, we determine a particular Riemannian metric for a state \r{ho} and show that if \r{ho} gets entangled with another quantum state, the negativity of the generated entangled state is, upto a constant factor, equals to square root of that particular Riemannian metric . Our result clearly relates a geometric quantity to a measure of entanglement. Moreover, the result establishes the possibility of understanding quantum correlations through geometric approach.

abstract: We propose a digital quantum simulator of non-Abelian pure-gauge models with a superconducting circuit setup. Within the framework of quantum link models, we build a minimal instance of a pure $SU(2)$ gauge theory, using triangular plaquettes involving geometric frustration. This realization is the least demanding, in terms of quantum simulation resources, of a non-Abelian gauge dynamics. We present two superconducting architectures that can host the quantum simulation, estimating the requirements needed to run possible experiments. The proposal establishes a path to the experimental simulation of non-Abelian physics with solid-state quantum platforms.

abstract: Evolution of a particle in an inverse square potential is studied. We derive an equation of motion for $\left<r^2\right>$ and solve it exactly. It gives us a possibility to identify the conditions under which a falling of a quantum particle into an attractive centre is possible. We get the time of falling of a particle from an initial state into the centre. An example of a quasi-stationary state which evolves with $\left<r^2\right>$ being constant in time is given. We demonstrate the existence of quantum limit of falling, namely, a particle does not fall into the attractive centre, when coupling constant is smaller then some critical value. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of neutral atoms falling in the electric field of a charged wire. Moreover, we propose modifications of the experiment, which allow to observe quantum limit of falling.

abstract: There are at least three models of discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) on graphs currently under active development. In this work we focus on the equivalence of two of them, known as Szegedy's and staggered QWs. We give a formal definition of the staggered model and discuss generalized versions for searching marked vertices. Using this formal definition, we prove that any instance of Szegedy's model is equivalent to an instance of the staggered model. On the other hand, we show that there are instances of the staggered model that cannot be cast into Szegedy's framework. Our analysis also works when there are marked vertices. We show that Szegedy's spatial search algorithms can be converted into search algorithms in staggered QWs. We take advantage of the similarity of those models to define the quantum hitting time in the staggered model and to describe a method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator of staggered QWs.

abstract: We provide an explicit construction of entangled states in a noncommutative space with nonclassical states, particularly with the squeezed states. Noncommutative systems are found to be more entangled than the usual quantum mechanical systems. The noncommutative parameter provides an additional degree of freedom in the construction by which one can raise the entanglement of the noncommutative systems to fairly higher values beyond the usual systems. Despite of having classical-like behaviour, coherent states in noncommutative space produce little amount of entanglement and therefore they possess slight nonclassicality as well, which are not true for the coherent states of ordinary harmonic oscillator.

abstract: We propose a novel type of Hamiltonians for quantum field theories. They are mathematically well-defined (and in particular, ultraviolet finite) without any ultraviolet cut-off such as smearing out the particles over a nonzero radius; rather, the particles are assigned radius zero. We describe explicit examples of such Hamiltonians. Their definition, which is best expressed in the particle-position representation of the wave function, involves a novel type of boundary condition on the wave function, which we call an interior-boundary condition. The relevant configuration space is one of a variable number of particles, and the relevant boundary consists of the configurations with two or more particles at the same location. The interior-boundary condition relates the value (or derivative) of the wave function at a boundary point to the value of the wave function at an interior point (here, in a sector of configuration space corresponding to a lesser number of particles).

abstract: Based on the Lyapunov control, we present a scheme to realize state transfer with high fidelity by only modulating the boundary spins in a quantum spin-1/2 chain. Recall that the conventional transmission protocols aim at nonstationary state (or information) transfer from the first spin to the end spin at a fixed time. The present scheme possesses the following advantages. First, the scheme does not require precise manipulations of the control time. Second, it is robust against uncertainties in the initial states and fluctuations in the control fields. Third, the controls are exerted only on the boundary sites of the chain. It works for variable spin-1/2 chains with different periodic structures and has good scalability. The feasibility to replace the control fields by square pules is explored, which simplifies the realization in experiments.

abstract: A simple calculation method for photon statistics of frequency-filtered fields is proposed. This method, based on eigenvalue decompositions of superoperators, allows us to study effects on the photon statistics of spectral filtering by various types of filters, such as Gaussian and rectangular filters as well as Lorentzian filters, which is not possible by conventional approaches. As an example, this method is applied to a simulation of quantum dot single-photon emitters, where we found the efficient choice of the filter types to have pure single photons depends on the excitation conditions i.e. incoherent or coherent (and resonant) excitations.

abstract: We design fast protocols to separate or recombine two ions in a segmented Paul trap. By inverse engineering the time evolution of the trapping potential composed of a harmonic and a quartic term, it is possible to perform these processes in a few microseconds without final excitation. These times are much shorter than the ones reported so far experimentally. The design is based on dynamical invariants and dynamical normal modes. Anharmonicities beyond the harmonic approximation at potential minima are taken into account perturbatively. The stability versus an unknown potential bias is also studied.

abstract: The superposition principle is one of the landmarks of quantum mechanics. The importance of quantum superpositions provokes questions about the limitations that quantum mechanics itself imposes on the possibility of their generation. In this work we systematically study the problem of creation of superpositions of unknown quantum states. First, we prove a no-go theorem that forbids the existence of a universal probabilistic quantum protocol producing a superposition of two unknown quantum states. Secondly, we provide an explicit probabilistic protocol generating a superposition of two unknown states, each having a fixed overlap with the known referential pure state. The protocol is proven to be unique and optimal. Moreover, it can be implemented on arbitrary Hilbert spaces. In the context of quantum optics it can be used to efficiently generate highly nonclassical or nongaussian states.

abstract: Current quantum computing architectures lack the size and fidelity required for universal fault-tolerant operation, limiting the practical implementation of key quantum algorithms to all but the smallest problem sizes. In this work we propose an alternative method for general-purpose quantum computation that is ideally suited for such "prethreshold" superconducting hardware. Computations are performed in the n-dimensional single-excitation subspace (SES) of a system of n tunably coupled superconducting qubits. The approach is not scalable, but allows many operations in the unitary group SU(n) to be implemented by a single application of the Hamiltonian, bypassing the need to decompose a desired unitary into elementary gates. This feature makes large, nontrivial quantum computations possible within the available coherence time. We show how to use a programmable SES chip to perform fast amplitude amplification and phase estimation, two versatile quantum subalgorithms. We also show that an SES processor is well suited for Hamiltonian simulation, specifically simulation of the Schrodinger equation with a real but otherwise arbitrary nxn Hamiltonian matrix. We discuss the utility and practicality of such a universal quantum simulator, and propose its application to the study of realistic atomic and molecular collisions.

He further claimed that Heisenberg's EDR can be proven to hold true in general, when the meter observable is modified as one of its functions. Here, some comments are given to suggest that the above claims are not supported.

comments:

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.05029
abstract: The problem of measurement is often considered as an inconsistency inside the quantum formalism. Many attempts to solve (or to dissolve) it have been made since the inception of quantum mechanics. The form of these attempts depends on the philosophical position that their authors endorse. I will review some of them and analyze their relevance. The phenomenon of decoherence is often presented as a solution lying inside the pure quantum formalism and not demanding any particular philosophical assumption. Nevertheless, a widely debated question is to decide between two different interpretations. The first one is to consider that the decoherence process has the effect to actually project a superposed state into one of its classically interpretable component, hence doing the same job as the reduction postulate. For the second one, decoherence is only a way to show why no macroscopic superposed state can be observed, so explaining the classical appearance of the macroscopic world, while the quantum entanglement between the system, the apparatus and the environment never disappears. In this case, explaining why only one single definite outcome is observed remains to do. In this paper, I examine the arguments that have been given for and against both interpretations and defend a new position, the "Convivial Solipsism" , according to which the outcome that is observed is relative to the observer, different but in close parallel to the Everett's interpretation and sharing also some similarities with Rovelli's relational interpretation and quantum bayesianism. I also show how "Convivial Solipsism" can help getting a new standpoint about the EPR paradox providing a way out of the standard dilemma that is having to choose between abandoning either realism or locality.

Spanning more than seventy years, we chart the major developments in the field from the declaration, by Landau and Peierls in 1931, that measurement of nonlocal variables was impossible in the relativistic regime to the demonstration, by Vaidman in 2003, that all such variables \emph{can} be measured instantaneously without violation of causality through an appropriate act of "measurement", albeit not of a standard projective (Von Neumann) type.

abstract: In this article, we revisit the century-old question of the minimal set of observables needed to identify a quantum state: here, we replace the natural coincidences in their spectra by effective ones, induced by an imperfect measurement. We show that if the detection error is smaller than the mean level spacing, then two observables with Poisson spectra will suffice, no matter how large the system is. The primary target of our findings is the integrable (i.e. exactly solvable) quantum systems whose spectra do obey the Poisson statistics. We also consider the implications of our findings for classical pattern recognition techniques.

abstract: In this paper, we show how the Robertson uncertainty relation gives certain intrinsic quantum limits of measurements in the most general and rigorous mathematical treatment. A general lower bound for the product of the root-mean-square measurement errors arising in joint measurements of noncommuting observables is established. We give a rigorous condition for holding of the standard quantum limit (SQL) for repeated measurements, and prove that if a measuring instrument has no larger root-mean-square preparational error than the root-mean-square measurement errors then it obeys the SQL. As shown previously, we can even construct many linear models of position measurement which circumvent this condition for the SQL.

abstract: We develop a dynamic description of an effective Dirac theory in metamaterials, in which the wavefunction is modeled by the corresponding electric and magnetic field in the metamaterial. This electro-magnetic field can be probed in the experimental setup, which means that the wavefunction of the effective theory is directly accessible by measurement. Our model is based on a plane wave expansion, which ravels the identification of Dirac spinors with single-frequency excitations of the electro-magnetic field in the metamaterial. The characteristic Zitterbewegung is shown to emerge in simulations of the effective theory and we verify this signature with an analytic solution.

abstract: A model of reality is called separable if the state of a composite system is equal to the union of the states of its parts, located in different regions of space. Spekkens has argued that it is trivial to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics using a separable ontological model, provided one allows for arbitrary violations of `dynamical locality'. However, since dynamical locality is strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of whether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and dynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an ontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the original formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that measurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can alternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's theorem does apply. We find that the resulting model violates local causality, but satisfies both separability and dynamical locality, making it a candidate for the `most local' ontological model of quantum mechanics.

abstract: A new form to construct complex superpotentials that produce real energy spectra in supersymmetric quantum mechanics is presented. This is based on the relation between the nonlinear Ermakov equation and a second order differential equation of the Schroedinger type. The superpotentials so constructed are characterized by the Ermakov parameters in such a way that they are always complex-valued and lead to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, whose eigenfunctions form a bi-orthogonal system. As applications we present new complex supersymmetric partners of the free particle that are PT-symmetric and can be either periodic or regular (of the Poeschl-Teller form). A new family of complex oscillators with real frequencies that have the energies of the harmonic oscillator plus an additional real eigenvalue is introduced.

abstract: A cavity QED implementation of the non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces is proposed with nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled commonly to the whispering-gallery mode of a microsphere cavity, where a universal set of quantum gates can be realized on the qubits. In our implementation, with the assistant of the appropriate driving fields, the quantum evolution is insensitive to the cavity field state, which is only virtually excited. The implemented non-adiabatic holonomies, utilizing optical transitions in the {\Lambda} type of three-level configuration of the nitrogen-vacancy centers, can be used to construct a universal set of quantum gates on the encoded logical qubits. Therefore, our scheme opens up the possibility of realizing universal holonomic quantum computation with cavity assisted interaction on solid-state spins characterized by long coherence times.

abstract: We study the quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems, especially the infinite dimensional bosonic systems in Fock space. We show that given the energy constraints, the relative entropy of coherence serves as a well-defined quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems. Via using the relative entropy of coherence, we also generalize the problem to multi-mode Fock space and special examples are considered. It is shown that with a finite average particle number, increasing the number of modes of light can enhance the relative entropy of coherence. With the mean energy constraint, our results can also be extended to other infinite-dimensional systems.

abstract: Quantum optics is a field of research based on the quantum theory of light. Here, we show that the classical theory of light can be equally effective in explaining a cornerstone of quantum optics: the quantization of the free radiation field. The quantization lies at the heart of quantum optics and has never been obtained classically. Instead, we find it by taking into account the degeneracy of the spherical harmonics that appear in multipole terms of the ordinary Maxwell theory of the free electromagnetic field. In this context, the number of energy quanta is determined by a finite countable set of spherical harmonics of higher order than the fundamental (monopole). This one plays, instead, the role of the electromagnetic vacuum that, contrary to the common view, has its place in the classical theory of light.

abstract: Optimal control theory is a powerful tool for solving control problems in quantum mechanics, ranging from the control of chemical reactions to the implementation of gates in a quantum computer. Gradient-based optimization methods are able to find high fidelity controls, but require considerable numerical effort and often yield highly complex solutions. We propose here to employ a two-stage optimization scheme to significantly speed up convergence and achieve simpler controls. The control is initially parametrized using only a few free parameters, such that optimization in this pruned search space can be performed with a simplex method. The result, considered now simply as an arbitrary function on a time grid, is the starting point for further optimization with a gradient-based method that can quickly converge to high fidelities. We illustrate the success of this hybrid technique by optimizing a holonomic phasegate for two superconducting transmon qubits coupled with a shared transmission line resonator, showing that a combination of Nelder-Mead simplex and Krotov's method yields considerably better results than either one of the two methods alone.

abstract: The impact of disorder in the vibrational bath of an ensemble of open quantum systems is explored, arising either from variation in the overall coupling strength or from uncertainty in the shape of the environment spectral function. Such disorder leads to an additional source of decoherence of subsystem ensembles, due to variation in the reorganization energy. Additionally, vibrational disorder induces a shift in the oscillation frequency of the coherence between ground and excited states. This shift is temperature dependent, and in the high temperature limit $\delta \omega \propto T$. This latter finding could be of particular relevance to biological systems exhibiting long lived coherences in highly disordered environments, where temperature-dependent quantum beats have been observed.

abstract: We argue first that translational invariant Matrix Product can be interpreted as a stationary sea of particles. Next, rather than starting from some local Hamiltonian with random potentials, we consider fluctuations of the local tensors of a continuous one-parameter family of Matrix Product States. This leads to a mapping from 1+1+0 to 0+1+1, being time-space-$\lambda$. We argue that both pictures are equivalent. Finally, the holography principle and an operational argumentation is used to map the problem onto 1+0+1. Localization in 1-dimension, can be understood from a simple study spectral and mixing properties of finite dimensional quantum channels.

We list, in detail, the operations necessary to enable fast-transform-based matrix-vector operations in the joint space to reconstruct a 16.8 million-dimensional image in less than 10 minutes. Within a subspace of that image exists a 3.2 million-dimensional bi-photon probability distribution. In addition, we demonstrate how the marginal distributions can aid in the accuracy of joint space distribution reconstructions.

For closed systems, it is the unitary group. For open quantum systems, the semigroup of Kraus maps contains, as a maximal subgroup, the general linear group. The same group emerges as the exponentiation of the $C^{*}$--algebra associated with the quantum system, when thought of as a Lie algebra. Thus, open quantum systems seem to identify the general linear group as associated with quantum mechanics and moreover suggest to extend the Klein programme also to groupoids. The usual unitary group emerges as a maximal compact subgroup of the general linear group.

abstract: We present a scheme to generate entangled photons using the NV centers in diamond. We show how the long-lived nuclear spin in diamond can mediate entanglement between multiple photons thereby increasing the length of entangled photon string. With the proposed scheme one could generate both n-photon GHZ and cluster states. We present an experimental scheme realizing the same and estimating the rate of entanglement generation both in the presence and absence of a cavity.

abstract: The concept of non-Markovianity (NM) in quantum dynamics is still an open debate. Understanding how to generate and measure NM in specific models may aid in this quest. In quantum optics, an engineered electromagnetic environment coupled to a single atom can induce NM. The most common scenario of structured electromagnetic environment is an optical cavity, composed by a pair of mirrors. Here, we show how to generate and measure NM on a two-level system coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide with no mirrors required. The origin of the non-Markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field, prepared as a single-photon packet. We analyze how NM depends on two experimentally controllable parameters, namely, the linewidth of the packet and its central frequency. We relate the presence of NM to a $\pi$-phase shift between incoming and emitted fields. We also show how the two output channels of the waveguide provide distinct signatures of NM, both experimentally accessible.

abstract: We show that single-slit two-photon ghost diffraction can be explained very simply by using a wave-packet evolution of a generalised EPR state. Diffraction of a wave travelling in the x-direction can be described in terms of the spreading in time of the transverse (z-direction) wave-packet, within the Fresnel approximation. The slit is assumed to truncate the transverse part of the wavefunction of the photon to within the width of the slit. The analysis reproduces all features of the two-photon single-slit ghost diffraction.

abstract: An on-demand single photon source is a key element in a series of prospective quantum technologies and applications. We demonstrate the operation of a tuneable on-demand microwave photon source based on a fully controllable superconducting artificial atom strongly coupled to an open-end transmission line (a 1D half-space). The atom emits a photon upon excitation by a short microwave $\pi$-pulse applied through a control line weakly coupled to the atom. The emission and control lines are well decoupled from each other, preventing the direct leakage of radiation from the $\pi$-pulses used for excitation. The estimated efficiency of the source is higher than 75\% and remains to be about 50\% or higher over a wide frequency range from 6.7 to 9.1 GHz continuously tuned by an external magnetic field.

We compare this technique with quantum teleportation and remote state preparation and show that SuperDense teleportation requires less classical information and fewer experimental resources. We discuss the information content of this constrained set of states and demonstrate that this set has an exponentially larger state space volume than the lower dimensional general states with the same number of state parameters.

abstract: The spatial modes of light have grasped great research interests because of its great potentials in optical communications, optical manipulation and trapping, optical metrology and quantum information processing. Here we report on generating of photon pairs in Hermite-Gaussian (HG) mode in a type-I optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operated far below threshold. The bandwidths of the photon pairs are 11.4 MHz and 20.8MHz for two different HG modes respectively, which is capable to be stored in cold Rubidium atomic ensembles. From correlation measurements, non-classical properties of HG modes in different directions are verified by tuning the cavity. Our study provides an effective way to generate photon pairs with narrow bandwidth in high order spatial modes for high dimensional quantum communication.

abstract: A large number of inequalities have been proposed for the detection of bipartite continuous variable entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Many of these are based on either measured or inferred variances and are relatively easily measured via homodyne detection of optical outputs. In this work we examine a number of bipartite inequalities in the process of cascaded downconversion and sum-frequency generation inside an optical cavity. This has previously been predicted to be a potential source of continuous-variable tripartite entanglement, therefore we know that there are no separable bipartitions. In this work we investigate the performance of the chosen inequalities in the stable, below threshold regime. We show that detection of the existing entanglement is sensitive to the actual inequalities chosen, with some criteria missing it completely. Our results are explained by the fact that violation of the chosen inequalities is sufficient but not necessary to demonstrate the non-classical relationships between the modes, and highlights the outstanding problem of developing a reliable continuous-variable entanglement measure.

We report the experimental quantum simulation of critical dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model by a set of Landau-Zener crossings in pseudo-momentum space, that can be probed with high accuracy using a single trapped ion. Our results support the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the quantum regime and advance the quantum simulation of critical systems far-away from equilibrium.

abstract: We study quantum teleportation via Bell-diagonal mixed states of two qubits in the context of the intrinsic properties of the quantum discord. We show that when the quantum-correlated state of the two qubits is used for quantum teleportation the character of the teleportation efficiency changes substantially depending on the Bell-diagonal-state parameters, which can be seen when the worst-case-scenario or best-case-scenario fidelity is studied. Depending on the parameter range, one of two types of single qubit states is hardest/easiest to teleport. The transition between these two parameter ranges coincides exactly with the transition between the range of classical correlation decay and quantum correlation decay characteristic for the evolution of the quantum discord. The correspondence provides a physical interpretation for the prominent feature of the decay of the quantum discord.

abstract: We investigate non-Markovianity measure using two-time correlation functions for open quantum systems. We define non-Markovianity measure as the difference between the exact two-time correlation function and the one obtained in the Markov limit. Such non-Markovianity measure can easily be measured in experiments. We found that the non-Markovianity dynamics in different time scale crucially depends on the system-environment coupling strength and other physical parameters such as the initial temperature of the environment and the initial state of the system. In particular, we obtain the short-time and long-time behaviors of non-Markovianity for different spectral densities. We also find that the thermal fluctuation always reduce the non-Markovian memory effect. Also, the non-Markovianity measure shows non-trivial initial state dependence in different time scales.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new interferometry paradigm: a self-interfering clock. We split a clock into two spatially separated wave packets, and observe an interference pattern with a stable phase showing that the splitting was coherent, i.e., the clock was in two places simultaneously. We then make the clock wave packets "tick" at different rates to simulate a proper time lag. The entanglement between the clock's time and its path yields "which path" information, which affects the visibility of the clock's self-interference. By contrast, in standard interferometry, time cannot yield "which path" information. As a clock we use an atom prepared in a superposition of two spin states. This first proof-of-principle experiment may have far-reaching implications for the study of time and general relativity and their impact on fundamental quantum effects such as decoherence and wave packet collapse.

We show that under the allowed incoherent operations, monotonicity of a valid coherence measure is affected due to non-Markovian features of the system-environment evolution. We also define a measure to quantify non-Markovianity of the underlying dynamics based on the non-monotonic behavior of the coherence measure. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity marker in the behavior of dephasing and dissipative dynamics for one and two qubit cases. We also show that our proposed measure captures the back-flow of information from the environment to the system and compatible with well known distinguishability criteria of non-Markovianity.

abstract: A complex quantum system can be constructed by coupling simple quantum elements to one another. For example, trapped-ion or superconducting quantum bits may be coupled by Coulomb interactions, mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. Alternatively quantum objects can be coupled by the exchange of real photons, particularly when driven within resonators that amplify interactions with a single electro-magnetic mode. However, in such an open system, the capacity of a coupling channel to convey quantum information or generate entanglement may be compromised. Here, we realize phase-coherent interactions between two spatially separated, near-ground-state mechanical oscillators within a driven optical cavity. We observe also the noise imparted by the optical coupling, which results in correlated mechanical fluctuations of the two oscillators. Achieving the quantum backaction dominated regime opens the door to numerous applications of cavity optomechanics with a complex mechanical system. Our results thereby illustrate the potential, and also the challenge, of coupling quantum objects with light.

abstract: Real life quantum computers are inevitably affected by intrinsic noise resulting in dissipative non-unitary dynamics realized by these devices. We consider an open system quantum annealing algorithm optimized for a realistic analog quantum device which takes advantage of noise-induced thermalization and relies on incoherent quantum tunneling at finite temperature. We analyze the performance of this algorithm considering a p-spin model which allows for a mean field quasicalssical solution and at the same time demonstrates the 1st order phase transition and exponential degeneracy of states. We demonstrate that finite temperature effects introduced by the noise are particularly important for the dynamics in presence of the exponential degeneracy of metastable states. We determine the optimal regime of the open system quantum annealing algorithm for this model and find that it can outperform simulated annealing in a range of parameters.

abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that a polarized nuclear spin modifies the dynamic behavior of a neighboring electronic spin. Specifically, an out-of-phase component appears in the electronic spin-echo signal. This component is proportional to the nuclear spin degree of polarization and strongly depends on the nuclear polarization direction. When the electronic spin is surrounded by a polarized nuclear spin bath, the spin-echo quadrature manifests a characteristic frequency related only to the nuclear spins abundance and their collective polarization. We use this analysis to propose a novel measurement method for the local nuclear spin bath of a single electronic spin. We quantify the realistic experimental regimes at which the scheme is efficient. Our proposal has potential applications for quantum sensing schemes, and opens a route for a systematic study of polarized mesoscopical-systems.

abstract: We address how a quantum phase estimation using a $|\phi 0\rangle+|0\phi\rangle$-type entangled state can be controllable by Mandel Q-factor of a single-mode state $|\phi\rangle$. From a simple form of the quantum Fisher information, we show that quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound can be enhanced with super-Poissonianity of the single-mode component. For an optical phase estimation, these bounds can also be achieved in a certain range of unknown phases by performing a parity measurement at the output. On the other hand, over an entire range $[0,2\pi]$ of unknown phase shifts, we show that the phase-shift range for beating shot-noise limit can be enlarged with sub-Poissonianity of the single-mode component.

We investigate the conversions between the ground states in quantum critical systems via LOCC and propose an novel method to reveal the different convertibility via majorization relation when a quantum phase transition occurs. The ground-state local convertibility in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model is studied. It is shown that the LOCC convertibility changes nearly at the phase transition point. The relation between the order of quantum phase transitions and the LOCC convertibility is discussed. Our results are compared with the corresponding results using the Renyi entropy and the LOCC convertibility with assisted entanglement.

abstract: We investigate finite-size scaling of genuine multisite entanglement in the ground state of quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. We obtain the ground states of odd- and even-legged Heisenberg ladder Hamiltonians and compute genuine multisite entanglement, the generalized geometric measure (GGM), which shows that for even rungs, GGM increases for odd-legged ladder while it decreases for even ones. Interestingly, the ground state obtained by short-range dimer coverings, under the resonating valence bond (RVB) ansatz, encapsulates the qualitative features of GGM for both the ladders. We find that while the GGMs for higher legged odd- and even-ladders converge to a single value in the asymptotic limit of a large number of rungs, the finite-size scaling exponents of the same tend to diverge. The scaling exponent of GGM obtained by employing density matrix recursion method is therefore a reliable quantity in distinguishing the odd-even dichotomy in Heisenberg ladders, even when the corresponding multisite entanglements merge.

For this purpose we extend the Bochner theorem by including derivatives of the characteristic function. The resulting necessary and sufficient nonclassicality criteria unify previously known moment-based criteria with those based on the characteristic function. For applications of the generalized nonclassicality probes, we provide direct sampling formulas for balanced homodyne detection. A squeezed vacuum state is experimentally realized and characterized with our method. This complete framework -- theoretical unification, sampling approach, and experimental implementation -- presents an efficient toolbox to characterize quantum states of light for applications in quantum technology.

abstract: Optical beams with topological singularities have a Schmidt decomposition. Hence, they display features typically associated with bipartite quantum systems; in particular, these classical beams can exhibit entanglement. This classical entanglement can be quantified by a Bell inequality formulated in terms of Wigner functions. We experimentally demonstrate the violation of this inequality for Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams and confirm that the violation increases with increasing orbital angular momentum. Our measurements yield negativity of the Wigner function at the origin for $\LG_{10}$ beams, whereas for $\LG_{20}$ we always get a positive value.

abstract: Quantum information technology strongly relies on coupling of optical photons with narrowband quantum systems, such as quantum dots, color centers, and atomic systems. This coupling requires matching the optical wavelength and bandwidth to the desired system, which presents a considerable problem for most available sources of quantum light. Here we demonstrate coupling of alkali dipole transitions with a tunable source of photon pairs. Our source is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator. For this, we have developed novel wavelength tuning mechanisms, which allow for a coarse tuning to either cesium or rubidium wavelength with subsequent continuous fine-tuning to the desired transition. As a demonstration of the functionality of the source, we performed a heralded single photon measurement of the atomic decay. We present a major advance in controlling the spontaneous down-conversion process, which makes our bright source of single photons now compatible with a plethora of narrow-band resonant systems.

A Floquet-Liouville supermatrix approach is used to calculate the time-evolution of the density matrix under the experimental conditions of a spin read-out operation. With an overall detection efficiency of 2.5%, the read-out is a single-shot measurement with a fidelity of 76.2%.

abstract: To make precise the sense in which nature fails to respect classical physics, one requires a formal notion of classicality. Ideally, such a notion should be defined operationally, so that it can be subjected to a direct experimental test, and it should be applicable in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, so that it can cover the breadth of phenomena that are thought to defy classical understanding. Bell's notion of local causality fulfills the first criterion but not the second. The notion of noncontextuality fulfills the second criterion, but it is a long-standing question whether it can be made to fulfill the first. Previous attempts to experimentally test noncontextuality have all presumed certain idealizations that do not hold in real experiments, namely, noiseless measurements and exact operational equivalences. We here show how to devise tests that are free of these idealizations. We also perform a photonic implementation of one such test that rules out noncontextual models with high confidence.

abstract: It is known that there are three maximally entangled states $\ket{\Phi_1} = (\ket{0000} + \ket{1111}) / \sqrt{2}$, $\ket{\Phi_2} = (\sqrt{2} \ket{1111} + \ket{1000} + \ket{0100} + \ket{0010} + \ket{0001}) / \sqrt{6}$, and $\ket{\Phi_3} = (\ket{1111} + \ket{1100} + \ket{0010} + \ket{0001}) / 2$ in four-qubit system. It is also known that there are three independent measures ${\cal F}^{(4)}_j \hspace{.2cm} (j=1,2,3)$ for true four-way quantum entanglement in the same system. In this paper we compute ${\cal F}^{(4)}_j$ and their corresponding linear monotones ${\cal G}^{(4)}_j$ for three rank-two mixed states $\rho_j = p \ket{\Phi_j}\bra{\Phi_j} + (1 - p) \ket{\mbox{W}_4} \bra{\mbox{W}_4}$, where $\ket{\mbox{W}_4} = (\ket{0111} + \ket{1011} + \ket{1101} + \ket{1110}) / 2$. We discuss the possible applications of our results briefly.

abstract: It is known that the coupling lemma provides a useful tool in the study of probability theory and its related areas. It describes the relation between the variational distance of two probability distributions and the probability that outcomes from the two random experiments associated with each distribution are not identical. In this paper, the failure probability interpretation problem that has been presented by Yuen and Hirota is discussed from the viewpoint of the application of the coupling lemma. First, we introduce the coupling lemma, and investigate properties of it. Next, it is shown that the claims for this problem in the literatures are justified by using the coupling lemma. Consequently, we see that the failure probability interpretation is not adequate in the security analysis of quantum key distribution.

abstract: The aim of the paper is to propose a bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) algorithm for the max-bisection and the min-bisection problems. The max-bisection and the min-bisection problems are fundamental NP-hard problems. Given a graph with even number of vertices, the aim of the max-bisection problem is to divide the vertices into two subsets of the same size to maximize the number of edges between the two subsets, while the aim of the min-bisection problem is to minimize the number of edges between the two subsets. The proposed algorithm runs in $O(m^2)$ for a graph with $m$ edges and in the worst case runs in $O(n^4)$ for a dense graph with $n$ vertices. The proposed algorithm targets a general graph by representing both problems as Boolean constraint satisfaction problems where the set of satisfied constraints are simultaneously maximized/minimized using a novel iterative partial negation and partial measurement technique. The algorithm is shown to achieve an arbitrary high probability of success of $1-\epsilon$ for small $\epsilon>0$ using a polynomial space resources.

abstract: The quantum Cramer-Rao bound places a limit on the mean square error of a parameter estimation procedure, and its numerical value is determined by the quantum Fisher information. For single parameters, this leads to the well- known Heisenberg limit that surpasses the classical shot-noise limit. When estimating multiple parameters, the situation is more complicated and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound is generally not attainable. In such cases, the use of entanglement typically still offers an enhancement in precision. Here, we demonstrate that entanglement is detrimental when estimating some nuisance parameters. In general, we find that the estimation of coupled parameters does not benefit from either classical or quantum correlations. We illustrate this effect in a practical application for optical gyroscopes.

abstract: Quantum mechanics is reformulated using Hartle's definition of the state of an individual physical system and a variant of von Neumann's propositional calculus. An elementary set of quantum postulates lead inductively to the familiar formulas of quantum theory, including the canonical commutation relation and Schr\"odinger's equation. The expected value of the frequency of events for an ideal ensemble is equal to the expected value of a state operator for an individual system, producing a binomial probability distribution for the determination of indefinite experimental propositions.

abstract: We study several parasitic effects on the implementation of a Josephson radiation comb generator (JRCG) based on a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by an external magnetic field. This system can be used as a radiation generator similarly to what is done in optics and metrology, and allows one to generate up to several hundreds of harmonics of the driving frequency. First we take into account how assuming a finite loop geometrical inductance and junction capacitance in each SQUID may alter the operation of this device. Then, we estimate the effect of imperfections in the fabrication of an array of SQUIDs, which is an unavoidable source of errors in practical situations. We show that the role of the junction capacitance is in general negligible, whereas the geometrical inductance has a beneficial effect on the performance of the device. The errors on the areas and junction resistance asymmetries may deteriorate the performance, but their effect can be limited up to a large extent with a suitable choice of fabrication parameters.

abstract: In a previous publication, we showed how group actions can be used to generate Bell inequalities. The group action yields a set of measurement probabilities whose sum is the basic element in the inequality. The sum has an upper bound if the probabilities are a result of a local, realistic theory, but this bound can be violated if the probabilities come from quantum mechanics. In our first paper, we considered the case of only two parties making the measurements and single-generator groups. Here we show that the method can be extended to three parties, and it can also be extended to non-Abelian groups. We discuss the resulting inequalities in terms of nonlocal games.

abstract: In this short essay we reject the interpretation of quantum theory called quantum Bayesianism (Qbism) which has been promoted recently by David Mermin in his essay published in Nature. According to Qbism quantum states are personal judgements of human agents. Physicists are not verifying their personal beliefs about their observations but search for the mathematical abstract description allowing to explain and to predict in a quantitative way the regularities observed (and those to be discovered) in physical phenomena which exist independently of the presence of any agent. We reject also the claim that Qbism explains properly the quantum nonlocality. The distant long range correlations can be correctly explained using a contextual statistical interpretation of quantum theory. We conclude that the Greeks were right to remove a perceiving subject out of Science.

abstract: In their recent comment, published in Nature, Jeffrey T.Leek and Roger D.Peng discuss how P-values are widely abused in null hypothesis significance testing . We agree completely with them and in this short comment we discuss the importance of sample homogeneity tests. No matter with how much scrutiny data are gathered if homogeneity tests are not performed the significance tests suffer from sample homogeneity loophole and the results may not be trusted. For example sample homogeneity loophole was not closed in the experiment testing local realism in which a significant violation of Eberhard inequality was found. We are not surprised that Bell type inequalities are violated since if the contextual character of quantum observables is properly taken into account these inequalities cannot be proven. However in order to trust the significance of the violation sample homogeneity loophole must be closed. Therefore we repeat after Jeffrey T.Leek and Roger D.Peng that sample homogeneity loophole is probably just the tip of the iceberg.

abstract: It is shown that, for the block matrices belonging to $M(nd,\mathbb{C})$ with commuting and normal block entries of dimension $d$, the separability of such a block matrices is equivalent to its semi-positive definity. The separability decomposition of lenght equal to the dimension of the block matrix (which is smaller then Carath\'eodory theorem implies) is given. The separability decomposition depends only on eigenvalues of block entries in the first part and on eigenvectors of the block entries in the second part of the tensor product. It is shown that semi-positive definity of considered block matrices is equivalent to semi-positive definity $d$ smaller matrices of dimension $n$.

abstract: Although quantum key distribution (QKD) comes from the development of quantum theory, the implementation of a practical QKD system does involve a lot of classical process, such as key reconciliation and privacy amplification, which is called post-processing. Post-processing has been a crucial element to high speed QKD systems, even the bottleneck of it because of its relatively high time consumption. Low density parity check (LDPC) is now becoming a promising approach of overcoming the bottleneck due to its good performance in processing throughput. In this article we propose and simulate an easily implemented but efficiently rate-adaptive LDPC coding approach of reconciliation, different from the previously proposed puncturing- and shortening-based approach. We also give a measure for choosing the optimal LDPC parameter for our rate-adaptive approach according to error rates.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.06437
abstract: The main contribution of this paper is to derive an explicit expression for the fundamental precision bound, the Holevo bound, for estimating any two-parameter family of mixed qubit states. The obtained formula depends solely on a given weight matrix and three previously known bounds; the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) Cramer-Rao (CR) bound, the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) CR bound, and the bound for D-invariant models. This result immediately provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the following important cases; the Holevo bound coincides with the RLD CR bound and it does with the SLD CR bound. An important consequence of the result of this paper is that a general model other than these two special cases exhibits an unexpected property: The structure of the Holevo bound changes smoothly when the weight matrix varies. Several examples are provided to illustrate these findings.

Above the threshold, quantum fluctuations induce transitions between the period-two states over the quasienergy barrier. We find the effective quantum activation energies for such transitions and their scaling with the difference of the driving amplitude from its critical value. We also find the scaling of the fluctuation correlation time with the quantum noise parameters in the critical region near the threshold.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.06468
abstract: We construct a random MERA state with a bond dimension that varies with the level of the MERA. This causes the state to exhibit a very different entanglement structure from that usually seen in MERA, with neighboring intervals of length $l$ exhibiting a mutual information proportional to $\epsilon l$ for some constant $\epsilon$, up to a length scale exponentially large in $\epsilon$. We express the entropy of a random MERA in terms of sums over cuts through the MERA network, with the entropy in this case controlled by the cut minimizing bond dimensions cut through. One motivation for this construction is to investigate the tightness of the Brandao-Horodecki\cite{bh} entropy bound relating entanglement to correlation decay. Using the random MERA, we show that at least part of the proof is tight: there do exist states with the required property of having linear mutual information between neighboring intervals at all length scales. We conjecture that this state has exponential correlation decay and that it demonstrates that the Brandao-Horodecki bound is tight (at least up to constant factors), and we provide some numerical evidence for this as well as a sketch of how a proof of correlation decay might proceed.

abstract: We study an optomechanical system in which the mechanical motion of a single trapped ion is coupled to a cavity field for the realization of a strongly quantum correlated two-mode system. We show that for large pump intensities the steady state photon number exhibits bistable behaviour. We further analyze the occurrence of normal mode splitting (NMS) due to mixing of the fluctuations of the cavity field and the fluctuations of the ion motion which indicates a coherent energy exchange. We also find that in the parameter regime where NMS exists, the steady state of the system shows continuous variable entanglement. Such a two-mode optomechanical system can be used for the realization of continuous variable quantum information interfaces and networks.

abstract: We provide a detailed estimate for the logical resource requirements of the quantum linear system algorithm (QLSA) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] including the recently described generalization [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 250504 (2013)]. Our resource estimates are based on the standard quantum-circuit model of quantum computation; they comprise circuit width, circuit depth, the number of qubits and ancilla qubits employed, and the overall number of elementary quantum gate operations as well as more specific gate counts for each elementary fault-tolerant gate from the standard set {X, Y, Z, H, S, T, CNOT}. To perform these estimates, we used an approach that combines manual analysis with automated estimates generated via the Quipper quantum programming language and compiler. Our estimates pertain to the example problem size N=332,020,680 beyond which, according to a crude big-O complexity comparison, QLSA is expected to run faster than the best known classical linear-system solving algorithm. For this problem size, a desired calculation accuracy 0.01 requires an approximate circuit width 340 and circuit depth of order $10^{25}$ if oracle costs are excluded, and a circuit width and depth of order $10^8$ and $10^{29}$, respectively, if oracle costs are included, indicating that the commonly ignored oracle resources are considerable. In addition to providing detailed logical resource estimates, it is also the purpose of this paper to demonstrate explicitly how these impressively large numbers arise with an actual circuit implementation of a quantum algorithm. While our estimates may prove to be conservative as more efficient advanced quantum-computation techniques are developed, they nevertheless provide a valid baseline for research targeting a reduction of the resource requirements, implying that a reduction by many orders of magnitude is necessary for the algorithm to become practical.

abstract: We report on the storage of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light via the phenomenon of Coherent Population Oscillation (CPO) in cold cesium atoms. The experiment is performed using a delayed four wave mixing configuration where the transverse optical information of a probe field carrying OAM associated with its azimuthal phase dependence is stored in the CPO of Zeeman sublevels of the hyperfine transition $F=3\rightarrow F^{\prime}=2$ of cesium $D_{2}$ line. We also demonstrate experimentally the simultaneous storage and retrieval of different OAM states propagating along different directions in space, leading to algebric operations with OAM and therefore opening the possibility of multiplexing OAM states.

abstract: Typical quantum gate tomography protocols struggle with a self-consistency problem: the gate operation cannot be reconstructed without knowledge of the initial state and final measurement, but such knowledge cannot be obtained without well-characterized gates. A recently proposed technique, known as randomized benchmarking tomography (RBT), sidesteps this self-consistency problem by designing experiments to be insensitive to preparation and measurement imperfections. We implement this proposal in a superconducting qubit system, using a number of experimental improvements including implementing each of the elements of the Clifford group in single `atomic' pulses and custom control hardware to enable large overhead protocols. We show a robust reconstruction of several single-qubit quantum gates, including a unitary outside the Clifford group. We demonstrate that RBT yields physical gate reconstructions that are consistent with fidelities obtained by randomized benchmarking.

abstract: Contemporary understanding of correlations in quantum many-body systems and in quantum phase transitions is based to a large extent on the recent intensive studies of entanglement in many-body systems. In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum nonlocality in these systems, mostly because the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve high-order correlations among many particles, which are hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Standard, "theorist- and experimentalist-friendly" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality for this scenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently, however, we have succeeded in constructing multipartite Bell inequalities that involve two- and one-body correlations only, and showed how they revealed the nonlocality in many-body systems relevant for nuclear and atomic physics [Science 344, 1256 (2014)]. With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On the one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell inequalities, pertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved parties. On the other hand, we present a couple of new results concerning such Bell inequalities. First, we characterize their tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum violations of these inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with the number of parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell inequalities which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke states---ground states of physically relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we shortly discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic systems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of designed nanostructures.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a single photon pulse travels through a linear atomic chain coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) single mode photonic waveguide. We derive a time-dependent dynamical theory for this collective many-body system which allows us to study the real time evolution of the photon transport and the atomic excitations. Our analytical result is consistent with previous numerical calculations when there is only one atom. For an atomic chain, the collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide mode can significantly change the dynamics of the system. The reflectivity of a photon can be tuned by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain. The reflectivity of a single photon pulse with finite bandwidth can even approach $100\%$. The spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly different from the single atom case. Many interesting physical phenomena can occur in this system such as the photonic bandgap effects, quantum entanglement generation, Fano-like interference, and superradiant effects. For engineering, this system may serve as a single photon frequency filter, single photon modulation and may find important applications in quantum information.

Finally, some novel effects, such as increasing the quantum correlations with temperature and constructive role of anisotropy parameter which may paly to the quantum correlations were observed.

abstract: Is a violation of Kochen-Specker (KS) non-contextuality inequality a tight bound to rule out the non-contextual hidden variable theory? A test designed by Liang, Spekkens and Wiseman (LSW) provides a more stringent bound and a violation of a generalized non-contextuality inequality such as LSW inequality rules out more generalized non-contextual models including the traditional KS non-contextual models. It is proven that three unsharp binary qubit measurements are enough to violate LSW inequality in a state-dependent manner. We show such measurements can be implemented through joint positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy spin-1/2 observables and report an experimental realization of the joint POVMs on photonic qubits. We demonstrate an experimental violation of LSW inequality with single photons and provide the experimental evidence of a more stringent bound to rule out the non-contextual models without unwarranted idealizations such as noiseless measurements.unsharp binary qubit measurements.

abstract: Current quantum orthodoxy claims that the statistical collapse of the wave-function arises from the interaction of the measuring instrument with its environment through the phenomenon known as environment induced decoherence. Here it is shown that there exists a measurement scheme that is exactly decohering without the aid of an environment. The scheme relies on the assumption that the meter is decomposable into probe and pointer, with the probe taken to be inaccessible for observation. Under the assumption that the probe and the pointer initial states are momentum limited, it is shown that coherences die out within a finite interval of time and the pointer states are exactly orthogonal. These lead to the fundamental realization that dispersion of correlation does not require an external infinite number of degrees of freedom. An internal one degree of freedom is already sufficient to delocalize the correlations and leave its subparts in a classical mixed state, so that decoherence may occur even for isolated measuring instruments.

The solution emerges from a geometric formulation of the problem. This formulation also reveals a deeper connection between cloning and state discrimination. The convergence of cloning to state discrimination as the number of clones goes to infinity exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking phase transition.

abstract: It is shown that the structure of thermodynamics is "form invariant", when it is derived using maximum entropy principle for various choices of entropy and even beyond equilibrium. By the form invariance of thermodynamics, it is meant that the form of the free energy (internal energy minus the temperature times entropy) remains unaltered when all the entities entering this relation are suitably defined. The useful ingredients for this are the equilibrium entropy associated with thermal density matrix and the relative entropy between an arbitrary density matrix and the thermal density matrix. To delineate the form invariance, we consider the quantum R\'enyi entropic versions (indexed by a parameter $\alpha$), i.e., R\'enyi entropy with appropriate internal energy and equilibrium state defined for all $\alpha$. These results reduce to the well-known Gibbs-von Neumann results when $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. Moreover, we show that the \textit{universality} of the Carnot statement of the second law is the consequence of the form invariance of the free energy. Further, the Clausius inequality, which is the precursor to the Carnot cycle, is also shown to hold based on the known data processing inequalities for the traditional and the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies. Thus, we find the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium state and its deviation from equilibrium together determine the thermodynamic laws.

abstract: A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac equation), and thus provide us with discrete toy models of familiar particles (e.g. the electron). In this paper, we study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to all those PDEs corresponding to the Hamiltonian form of the massive curved Dirac equation in (1 + 1) dimensions. Therefore a certain QW, which we make explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of the electron as a test particle in curved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice. Mathematically we have introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW, but which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.

abstract: Non-local correlations are usually understood through the outcomes of alternative measurements (on two or more parts of a system) that cannot altogether actually be carried out in an experiment. Indeed, a joint input/output -- e.g., measurement-setting/outcome -- behavior is non-local if and only if the outputs for all possible inputs cannot coexist consistently. It has been argued that this counterfactual view is how Bell's inequalities and their violations are to be seen. We propose an alternative perspective which refrains from setting into relation the results of mutually exclusive measurements, but that is based solely on data actually available. Our approach uses algorithmic complexity instead of probability, implies non-locality to have similar consequences as in the probabilistic view, and is conceptually simpler yet at the same time more general than the latter.

abstract: The Dirac equation is invariant under rotations with a constant frequency and invariable cylindrical radius. 3D transformation for rotating frames is found with help of this invariance. Exact localized solutions of the Dirac equation in the field of a traveling circularly polarized electromagnetic wave and constant magnetic field exist and possess unusual properties. Temporal changes of spin pertaining to the solutions are studied.

abstract: We introduce the differential and the total decay widths of a resonant (Gamow) state decaying into a continuum of stable states. When the resonance has several decay modes, we introduce the corresponding partial decay widths and branching fractions. In the approximation that the resonance is sharp, the expressions for the differential, partial and total decay widths of a resonant state bear a close resemblance with the Golden Rule. In such approximation, the branching fractions of a resonant state are the same as the standard branching fractions obtained by way of the Golden Rule. We also introduce dimensionless decay constants along with their associated differential decay constants, and we express experimentally measurable quantities such as the branching fractions and the energy distributions of decay events in terms of those dimensionless decay constants.

abstract: We investigate the weak measurement experiment demonstrated by Ritchie et al. [N. W. M. Ritchie, J. G. Story, and R. G. Hulet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 1107 (1991)] from the viewpoint of the statistical hypothesis testing for the weak-value amplification proposed by Susa and Tanaka [Y. Susa and S. Tanaka, Phys. Rev. A 92, 012112 (2015)]. We conclude that the weak-value amplification is a better method to determine whether the crystal used in the experiment is birefringent than the measurement without postselection, when the angles of two polarizers are almost orthogonal. This result gives a physical description and intuition of the hypothesis testing and supports the experimental usefulness of the weak-value amplification.

abstract: For a quantum measurement process described by a quantum instrument $\mathcal{I}$ and a system observable corresponding to a positive-operator valued measure (POVM) $E ,$ $\mathcal{I}$ is said to conserve the information of $E$ if the joint successive measurement of $\mathcal{I}$ followed by $E$ is equivalent to a single measurement of $E .$ We show that for any quantum instrument $\mathcal{I}$ we can construct a POVM conserved by $\mathcal{I}$. Intuitively the construction gives the infinite joint successive measurement of $\mathcal{I}.$ We also show that the constructed POVM is the least informative observable among POVMs conserved by $\mathcal{I}$, i.e. the constructed POVM can be realized by a classical post-processing of any POVM conserved by $\mathcal{I} .$ As typical examples of quantum instruments, we explicitly evaluate POVMs of infinite successive measurements for photon counting and quantum counter instruments.

Here, we present a nested-structured framework that makes it possible to achieve partially noise-tolerant QCF, due to that there is a trade-off between the security and the justice correctness. It is showed that noise-tolerant single-shot QCF protocols can be produced by filling the presented framework up with existed or even future protocols. We also proved a lower bound of 0.25, with which a cheating Alice or Bob could bias the outcome.

abstract: Exploiting the correspondence between Wigner distribution function and a frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) measurement, we experimentally demonstrate existence of the chessboard-like interference patterns with a time-bandwidth product smaller than that of a transform-limited pulse in the phase space representation of compass states. Using superpositions of four electric pulses as realization of compass states, we have shown via direct measurements that displacements leading to orthogonal states can be smaller than limits set by uncertainty relations. In the experiment we observe an exactly chronocyclic correspondence to the sub-Planck structure in the interference pattern appearing for superposition of two Sch\"{o}dinger-cat-like states in a position-momentum phase space.

We develop a time-resolved approach to study quantum dynamics of the Landau-Zener transition. By using this method, we observe the key features of the correspondence between Landau-Zener transition and Kibble-Zurek mechanism, e.g., the boundary between the adiabatic and impulse regions, the freeze-out phenomenon in the impulse region. Remarkably, the scaling behavior of the population in the excited state, an analogical phenomenon originally predicted in Kibble-Zurek mechanism, is also observed in the Landau-Zener transition.

abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) entails the encoding of quantum information into a QEC code space, measuring error syndromes to properly locate and identify errors, and, if necessary, applying a proper recovery operation. Here we compare three syndrome measurement protocols for the [[7,1,3]] QEC code: Shor states, Steane states, and one ancilla qubit by simulating the implementation of 50 logical gates with the syndrome measurements interspersed between the gates at different intervals. We then compare the fidelities for the different syndrome measurement types. Our simulations show that the optimal syndrome measurement strategy is generally not to apply syndrome measurements after every gate but depends on the details of the error environment. Our simulations also allow a quantum computer programmer to weigh computational accuracy versus resource consumption (time and number of qubits) for a particular error environment. In addition, we show that applying syndrome measurements that are unnecessary from the standpoint of quantum fault tolerance may be helpful in achieving better accuracy or in lowering resource consumption. Finally, our simulations demonstrate that the single-qubit non-fault tolerant syndrome measurement strategy achieves comparable fidelity to those that are fault tolerant.

abstract: Quantum mechanics exhibits a wide range of non-classical features, of which entanglement in multipartite systems takes a central place. Other notions of non-classicality are also important, especially for non-composite systems. Yet the relationship between entanglement and other types of non-classicality remains to be clarified. In this work we show that, in fact, several general forms of single-system non-classicality are faithfully convertible into entanglement. Specifically, we prove that there is a physical operation which transforms all given non-classical states into entangled states, while the corresponding classical states become separable. Our results apply to two broad scenarios, one which is discrete and one which is continuous. In the discrete setting, the classical states can be any finite linearly independent set. For the continuous setting, the pertinent classical states are `symmetric coherent states,' connected with symmetric representations of the group SU(K). These results generalize and link convertibility properties from the resource theory of coherence, spin coherent states, and optical coherent states, while also revealing important connections between local and non-local quantum correlations.

abstract: We consider a quantum relay which is used by two parties to perform several continuous-variable protocols: Entanglement swapping, distillation, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. The theory of these protocols is extended to a non-Markovian model of decoherence characterized by correlated Gaussian noise. Even if bipartite entanglement is completely lost at the relay, we show that the various protocols can progressively be reactivated by the separable noise-correlations of the environment. In fact, above a critical amount, these correlations are able to restore the distribution of quadripartite entanglement, which can be localized into an exploitable bipartite form by the action of the relay. Our findings are confirmed by a proof-of-principle experiment and show the potential advantages of non-Markovian effects in a quantum network architecture.

abstract: Digital signatures are widely used in electronic communications to secure important tasks such as financial transactions, software updates, and legal contracts. The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However, it is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature schemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical -- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case, proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability. Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.

abstract: We introduce a simple protocol for verifiable measurement-only blind quantum computing. Alice, a client, can perform only single-qubit measurements, whereas Bob, a server, can generate and store entangled many-qubit states. Bob generates copies of a graph state, which is a universal resource state for measurement-based quantum computing, and sends Alice each qubit of them one by one. Alice adaptively measures each qubit according to her program. If Bob is honest, he generates the correct graph state, and therefore Alice can obtain the correct computation result. Regarding the security, whatever Bob does, Bob cannot learn any information about Alice's computation because of the no-signaling principle. Furthermore, evil Bob does not necessarily send the copies of the correct graph state, but Alice can check the correctness of Bob's state by directly verifying stabilizers of some copies.

Exploring the properties of the superconductor diamond system is essential for the efficient use of this device. When we perform spectroscopy of this system, significant power broadening is observed. However, previous models to describe this system are known to be applicable only when the power broadening is negligible. Here, we construct a new approach to analyze this system with strong driving, and succeed to reproduce the spectrum with the power broadening. Our results provide an efficient way to analyze this hybrid system.

abstract: We consider single-particle quantum transport on parametrized complex networks. Based on general arguments regarding the spectrum of the corresponding Hamiltonian, we derive bounds for a measure of the global transport efficiency defined by the time-averaged return probability. For tree-like networks, we show analytically that a transition from efficient to inefficient transport occurs depending on the (average) functionality of the nodes of the network. In the infinite system size limit, this transition can be characterized by an exponent which is universal for all tree-like networks. Our findings are corroborated by analytic results for specific deterministic networks, dendrimers and Viscek fractals, and by Monte Carlo simulations of iteratively built scale-free trees.

abstract: Parity measurement is a key step in many entanglement generation and quantum error correction schemes. We propose a protocol for non-destructive parity measurement of two remote qubits, i.e., macroscopically separated qubits with no direct interaction. The qubits are instead dispersively coupled to separate resonators that radiate to shared photodetectors. The scheme is deterministic in the sense that there is no fundamental bound on the success probability. Compared to previous proposals, our protocol addresses the scenario where number resolving photodetectors are available but the qubit-resonator coupling is time-independent and only dispersive.

abstract: We show that the entropy of a message can be tested in a device-independent way. Specifically, we consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with classical or quantum communication, and develop two different methods for placing lower bounds on the communication entropy, given observable data. The first method is based on the framework of causal inference networks. The second technique, based on convex optimization, shows that quantum communication provides an advantage over classical, in the sense of requiring a lower entropy to reproduce given data. These ideas may serve as a basis for novel applications in device-independent quantum information processing.

abstract: We present rigorous bounds on the thermalization time of the family of quantum mechanical spin systems known as stabilizer Hamiltonians. The thermalizing dynamics are modeled by a Davies master equation that arises from a weak local coupling of the system to a large thermal bath. Two temperature regimes are considered. First we clarify how in the low temperature regime, the thermalization time is governed by a generalization of the energy barrier between orthogonal ground states. When no energy barrier is present the Hamiltonian thermalizes in a time that is at most quadratic in the system size. Secondly, we show that above a universal critical temperature, every stabilizer Hamiltonian relaxes to its unique thermal state in a time which scales at most linearly in the size of the system. We provide an explicit lower bound on the critical temperature. Finally, we discuss the implications of these result for the problem of self-correcting quantum memories with stabilizer Hamiltonians.

abstract: We report a systematic treatment of the holographic generation of electron Bessel beams, with a view to applications in electron microscopy. We describe in detail the theory underlying hologram patterning, as well as the actual electro-optical configuration used experimentally. We show that by optimizing our nanofabrication recipe, electron Bessel beams can be generated with efficiencies reaching $37 \pm 3\%$. We also demonstrate by tuning various hologram parameters that electron Bessel beams can be produced with many visible rings, making them ideal for interferometric applications, or in more highly localized forms with fewer rings, more suitable for imaging. We describe the settings required to tune beam localization in this way, and explore beam and hologram configurations that allow the convergences and topological charges of electron Bessel beams to be controlled. We also characterize the phase structure of the Bessel beams generated with our technique, using a simulation procedure that accounts for imperfections in the hologram manufacturing process. Finally, we discuss a specific potential application of electron Bessel beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy.

By exploiting the physical resource of entanglement, quantum teleportation serves as a key primitive in a variety of quantum information tasks and represents an important building block for quantum technologies, with a pivotal role in the continuing progress of quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum networks. Here we review the basic theoretical ideas behind quantum teleportation and its variant protocols. We focus on the main experiments, together with the technical advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of the various technologies, from photonic qubits and optical modes to atomic ensembles, trapped atoms, and solid-state systems. Analysing the current state-of-the-art, we finish by discussing open issues, challenges and potential future implementations.

abstract: We introduce state-independent, non-perturbative Hamiltonian quantum speed limits for population leakage and fidelity loss, for a gapped open system interacting with a reservoir. These results hold in the presence of initial correlations between the system and the reservoir, under the sole assumption that their interaction and its commutator with the reservoir Hamiltonian are norm-bounded. The reservoir need not be thermal and can be time-dependent. We study the significance of energy mismatch between the system and the local degrees of freedom of the reservoir which directly interact with the system. We demonstrate that, in general, by increasing the system gap we may reduce this energy mismatch, and consequently drive the system and the reservoir into resonance, which can accelerate fidelity loss, irrespective of the thermal properties or state of the reservoir. This implies that quantum error suppression strategies based on increasing the gap are not uniformly beneficial. Our speed limits also yield an elementary lower bound on the relaxation time of spin systems.

abstract: A class of autonomous quantum heat baths satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) criteria is proposed. We show that such systems are expected to cause thermal relaxation of much smaller quantum systems coupled to one of the baths local observables. The process of thermalization is examined through residual fluctuations of local observables of the bath around their thermal values predicted by ETH. It is shown that such fluctuations perturb the small quantum system causing its decoherence to the thermal state. As an example, we investigate theoretically and numerically thermalization of a qubit coupled to a realistic ETH quantum heat bath.

In existing QKD protocols, an eavesdropper's intervention will inevitably disturb the quantum signals; thus, Alice and Bob must monitor the signal disturbance to place a bound on the potential information leakage. However, T. Sasaki et al. proposed a quite different protocol, named round-robin differential phase shift (RRDPS), in which the amount of eavesdropped information is bounded without monitoring the signal disturbance. Here, we present the first active implementation of the RRDPS protocol. In our experiment, Alice prepares packets of pulses, with each packet being a train with 65 pulses, and the global phase of each packet is randomized. Bob uses a 1-GHz, 1-64-bit actively controlled variable-delay interferometer to realize random switching of the different delays. Benefiting from the large pulse number of each packet, the high stability and low insertion loss of the interferometer, the system can distribute secret key over a distance of 90 km. Our results confirm the feasibility of performing practical QKD with this novel protocol.

abstract: Encoding quantum information in continuous variables (CV)---as the quadrature of electromagnetic fields---is a powerful approach to quantum information science and technology. CV entanglement---light beams in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states---is a key resource for quantum information protocols; and enables hybridisation between CV and single photon discrete variable (DV) qubit systems. However, CV systems are currently limited by their implementation in free-space optical networks: increased complexity, low loss, high-precision alignment and stability, as well as hybridisation, demand an alternative approach. Here we show an integrated photonic implementation of the key capabilities for CV quantum technologies---generation and characterisation of EPR beams in a photonic chip. Combined with integrated squeezing and non-Gaussian operation, these results open the way to universal quantum information processing with light.

abstract: We investigate the Rabi oscillation of an atom placed inside a quantum cavity where each mirror is formed by a chain of atoms trapped near a one-dimensional waveguide. This proposal was studied previously with the use of Markov approximation, where the delay due to the finite travel time of light between the two cavity mirrors is neglected. We show that Rabi oscillation analogous to that obtained with high-finesse classical cavities is achieved only when this travel time is much larger than the time scale that characterizes the collective response of the atomic chain. Therefore, the delay must be taken into account and the dynamics of the problem is inherently non-Markovian. Parameters of interest such as the Rabi frequency and the cavity loss rate due to photon leakage through the mirrors are obtained.

abstract: Since the invention of Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol, many quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and some protocols are operated even in field environments. One of the striking features of QKD is that QKD protocols are provably secure unlike cryptography based on computational complexity assumptions. It has been believed that, to guarantee the security of QKD, Alice and Bob have to monitor the statistics of the measurement outcomes which are used to determine the amount of the privacy amplification to generate a key. Recently a new type of QKD protocol, called round robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) protocol, was proposed, and remarkably this protocol can generate a key without monitoring any statistics of the measurement outcomes. Here we report an experimental realization of the RRDPS protocol. We used a setup in which Bob randomly chooses one from four interferometers with different pulse delays so that he could implement phase difference measurements for all possible combinations with five-pulse time-bin states. Using the setup, we successfully distributed keys over 30 km of fiber, making this the first QKD experiment that does not rely on signal disturbance monitoring.

abstract: Although quantum walks exhibit distinctive properties that distinguish them from random walks, classical behavior can be recovered in the asymptotic limit by destroying the coherence of the pure state associated to the quantum system. Here I show that this is not the only way: I introduce a quantum walk driven by an inhomogeneous, time-dependent coin operator, which mimics the statistical properties of a random walk at all time scales. The quantum particle undergoes unitary evolution and, in fact, the high correlation evidenced by the components of the wave function can be used to revert the outcome of an accidental measurement of its chirality.

abstract: The connectivity and tunability of superconducting quantum devices provide a rich platform to build quantum simulators and study novel many-body physics. Here we study quantum phase transition in a detuned multi-connected Jaynes-Cummings lattice, which can be constructed with superconducting circuits. This model is composed of alternatively connected qubits and cavity modes. Using a numerical method, we show that by varying the detuning between the qubits and the cavities, a phase transition from the superfluid phase to the Mott insulator phase occurs at commensurate fillings in a one-dimensional array. We study the phase transition in lattices with symmetric and asymmetric couplings, respectively.

abstract: We apply random matrix and free probability techniques to the study of linear maps of interest in quantum information theory. Random quantum channels have already been widely investigated with spectacular success. Here, we are interested in more general maps, asking only for $k$-positivity instead of the complete positivity required of quantum channels. Unlike the theory of completely positive maps, the theory of $k$-positive maps is far from being completely understood, and our techniques give many new parametrized families of such maps. We also establish a conceptual link with free probability theory, and show that our constructions can be obtained to some extent without random techniques in the setup of free products of von Neumann algebras. Finally, we study the properties of our examples and show that for some parameters, they are indecomposable. In particular, they can be used to detect the presence of entanglement missed by the partial transposition test, that is, PPT entanglement. As an application, we considerably refine our understanding of PPT states in the case where one of the spaces is large whereas the other one remains small.

abstract: In quantum key distribution (QKD), the bit error rate is used to estimate the information leakage and hence determines the amount of privacy amplification --- making the final key private by shortening the key. In general, there exists a threshold of the error rate for each scheme, above which no secure key can be generated. This threshold puts a restriction on the environment noises. For example, a widely used QKD protocol --- BB84 --- cannot tolerate error rates beyond 25%. A new protocol, round-robin differential phase shifted (RRDPS) QKD, essentially removes this restriction and can in principle tolerate more environment disturbance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a passive RRDPS QKD scheme. In particular, our 500 MHz passive RRDPS QKD system is able to generate a secure key over 50 km with a bit error rate as high as 29%. This scheme should find its applications in noisy environment conditions.

The energy levels and electron probability density are plotted as a function of the compactification radius. The occurrence of several physical effects is discussed and interpreted.

abstract: In conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, security is guaranteed by estimating the amount of leaked information through monitoring signal disturbance, which, in practice, is generally caused by environmental noise and device imperfections rather than eavesdropping. Such estimation therefore tends to overrate the amount of leaked information in practice, leads to a fundamental threshold of the bit error rate. The threshold becomes a bottleneck of the development of practical QKD systems. In classical communication, according to Shannon's communication theory, information can transform through a noisy channel even if the background noise is very strong compare to the signal and hence the threshold of the bit error rate tends to 50%. One might wonder whether a QKD scheme can also tolerate error rate as high as 50%. The question is answered affirmatively with the recent work of round-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol, which breaks through the fundamental threshold of the bit error rate and indicates another potential direction in the field of quantum cryptography. The key challenge to realize the RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a variable-delay interferometer. The delay needs to be chosen from a set of predetermined values randomly. Such measurement can be realized by switching between many interferometers with different delays at a high speed in accordance with the system repetition rate. The more delay values can be chosen from, the higher error rate can be tolerated. By designing an optical system with multiple switches and employing an active phase stabilization technology, we successfully construct a variable-delay interferometer with 128 actively selectable delays. With this measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the RRDPS QKD protocol and obtain a final key rate of 15.54 bps via a total loss of 18 dB and 8.9% error rate.

abstract: Hybrid architectures integrating mesoscopic electronic conductors with resonant microwave cavities have a great potential for investigating unexplored regimes of electron-photon coupling. In this context, producing nonclassical squeezed light is a key step towards quantum communication with scalable solid-state devices. Here we show that parametric driving of the electronic conductor induces a squeezed steady state in the cavity. We find that squeezing properties of the cavity are essentially determined by the electronic noise correlators of the quantum conductor. In the case of a tunnel junction, we predict that squeezing is optimized by applying a time-periodic series of quantized $\delta-$peaks in the bias voltage. For an asymmetric quantum dot, we show that a sharp Leviton pulse is able to achieve perfect cavity squeezing.

abstract: Coherent control over photoelectron wavepackets, via the use of polarization-shaped laser pulses, can be understood as a time and polarization-multiplexed process. In this work, we investigate this multiplexing via computation of the observable photoelectron angular interferograms resulting from multi-photon atomic ionization with polarization-shaped laser pulses. We consider the polarization sensitivity of both the instantaneous and cumulative continuum wavefunction; the nature of the coherent control over the resultant photoelectron interferogram is thus explored in detail. Based on this understanding, the use of coherent control with polarization-shaped pulses as a methodology for a highly multiplexed coherent quantum metrology is also investigated, and defined in terms of the information content of the observable.

abstract: The numerical study of anyonic systems is known to be highly challenging due to their non-bosonic, non-fermionic particle exchange statistics, and with the exception of certain models for which analytical solutions exist, very little is known about their collective behaviour as a result. Meanwhile, the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) algorithm is an exceptionally powerful numerical technique for calculating the ground state of a low-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian, and has been applied to the study of bosonic, fermionic, and group-symmetric systems. The recent development of a tensor network formulation for anyonic systems opened up the possibility of studying these systems using algorithms such as DMRG, though this has proved challenging both in terms of programming complexity and computational cost. This paper presents the implementation of DMRG for finite anyonic systems, including a detailed scheme for the implementation of anyonic tensors with optimal scaling of computational cost. The anyonic DMRG algorithm is demonstrated by calculating the ground state energy of the Golden Chain, which has become the benchmark system for the numerical study of anyons, and is shown to produce results comparable to those of the anyonic TEBD algorithm and superior to the variationally optimised anyonic MERA, at far lesser computational cost.

abstract: The control of light transmission through a Fabry-Perot cavity containing atoms is theoretically investigated, when the cavity mode beam and an intersecting control beam are both close to specific atomic resonances. A four-level atomic system is considered and its interaction with the cavity mode is studied by solving for the time dependent cavity field and atomic state populations. The conditions for optical bistability of the atom-cavity system are obtained in steady state limit. For an ensemble of atoms in the cavity mode, the response of the intra-cavity light intensity to the intersecting resonant beam is understood for stationary atoms (closed system) and non-static atoms (open system). The open system is modelled by adjusting the atomic state populations to represent the exchange of atoms in the cavity mode, with the thermal environment. The solutions to the model are used to qualitatively explain the observed steady state and transient behaviour of the light in the cavity mode, in Sharma et. al. [1]. The control behaviour with three- and two-level atomic systems is also studied, and the rich physics arising out of these systems, for closed and open atomic systems is discussed.

abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo, we study the non-equilibrium transport of magnetization in large open strongly correlated quantum spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems driven by purely dissipative processes that conserve the uniform or staggered magnetization. We prepare both a low-temperature Heisenberg ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet in two parts of the system that are initially isolated from each other. We then bring the two subsystems in contact and study their real-time dissipative dynamics for different geometries. The flow of the uniform or staggered magnetization from one part of the system to the other is described by a diffusion equation that can be derived analytically.

abstract: This thesis contributes to ongoing research related to the categorical compositional model for natural language of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark in three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract framework based on Frobenius algebras (joint work with Sadrzadeh). The theory improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results. The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models that find intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work with Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in particular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum mechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different meanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and linguistics.

abstract: We explore the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional trapped ultracold ensemble of bosonic atoms triggered by the sudden creation of a single ion. The numerical simulations are performed by means of the ab initio multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons which takes into account all correlations. The dynamics is analyzed via a cluster expansion approach, adapted to bosonic systems of fixed particle number, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the occurring many-body processes. After a transient during which the atomic ensemble separates into fractions which are unbound and bound with respect to the ion, we observe an oscillation in the atomic density which we attribute to the additional length and energy scale induced by the attractive long-range atom-ion interaction. This oscillation is shown to be the main source of spatial coherence and population transfer between the bound and the unbound atomic fraction. Moreover, the dynamics exhibits collapse and revival behavior caused by the dynamical build-up of two-particle correlations demonstrating that a beyond mean-field description is indispensable.

abstract: We review recent developments concerning non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and many-body physics with light, in superconducting circuits and Josephson analogues. We start with quantum impurity models summarizing the effect of dissipation and of driving the system. We mention theoretical and experimental efforts to characterize these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how Josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect with microwave photons. The Kondo effect is characterized by a renormalized light-frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot devices coupled to an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing to engineer the Jaynes-Cummings lattice and Rabi lattice models. This opens the door to novel many-body physics with light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition observed with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent theoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic gauge fields and spin-orbit couplings have been successfully implemented with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet perturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice systems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose-Hubbard models in ladder and two-dimensional geometries. The Bose-Hubbard model is related to the Jaynes-Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit between light and matter. In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show that Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.

abstract: We demonstrate the suitability of tensor network techniques for describing the thermal evolution of lattice gauge theories. As a benchmark case, we have studied the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate in the Schwinger model, using matrix product operators to approximate the thermal equilibrium states for finite system sizes with non-zero lattice spacings. We show how these techniques allow for reliable extrapolations in bond dimension, step width, system size and lattice spacing, and for a systematic estimation and control of all error sources involved in the calculation. The reached values of the lattice spacing are small enough to capture the most challenging region of high temperatures and the final results are consistent with the analytical prediction by Sachs and Wipf over a broad temperature range.

In particular, we analyze how the angular distribution and polarization of the scattered photons are affected by the parameters of the initial beam such as the opening angle and the projection of orbital angular momentum. We present analytical and numerical results for the angular distribution and the polarization of Compton scattered photons for initially twisted light and compare them with the standard case of plane-wave light.

abstract: Superfluidity and superconductivity have been studied widely since the last century in many different contexts ranging from nuclear matter to atomic quantum gases. The rigidity of these systems with respect to external perturbations results in frictionless motion for superfluids and resistance-free electric current in superconductors. This peculiar behaviour is lost when external perturbations overcome a critical threshold, i.e. above a critical magnetic field or a critical current for superconductors. In superfluids, such as liquid helium or ultracold gases, the corresponding quantities are critical rotation rate and critical velocity, respectively. Enhancing the critical values is of great fundamental and practical value. Here we demonstrate that superfluidity can be achieved for flow above the critical velocity through quantum interference induced resonances. This has far reaching consequences for the fundamental understanding of superfluidity and superconductivity and opens up new application possibilities in quantum metrology, e.g. in rotation sensing.

The robustness of this number extends well beyond the topological insulator phase towards attractive and repulsive interactions that are comparable to the kinetic energy scale of the model. We identify and characterize the relevant phases of the model.

Starting from weakly bound Feshbach molecules, we demonstrate hyperfine resolved two-photon transfer into the singlet ${\rm X}^1\Sigma^+ |v{=}0,J{=}0\rangle$ ground state, coherently bridging a binding energy difference of 0.65 eV via stimulated rapid adiabatic passage. The spin-polarized, nearly quantum degenerate molecular gas displays a lifetime longer than 2.5 s, highlighting NaK's stability against two-body chemical reactions. A homogeneous electric field is applied to induce a dipole moment of up to 0.8 Debye. With these advances, the exploration of many-body physics with strongly dipolar Fermi gases of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules is in experimental reach.

abstract: We discuss the treatment of the systematic frequency shifts due to microwave lensing and distributed cavity phase in "First accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2" 2014 Metrologia 51 174-182. We explain that the microwave lensing frequency shift is generally non-zero and finite in the limit of no applied microwave field. This systematic error was incorrectly treated and we find that it contributes a significant frequency offset. Accounting for this shift implies that the measured microwave amplitude dependence (e.g due to microwave leakage) is comparable to the total reported inaccuracy. We also discuss the importance of vertically aligning the fountain perpendicular to the axis of the cavity feeds, when the cavity has only two independent feeds. Finally, we note that background gas collisions have a different behavior for cold clock atoms than for clock atoms at room-temperature, and therefore room temperature measurements do not directly apply to laser-cooled clocks.

abstract: Recently, the quaternionic quantum walk was formulated by the first author as a generalization of discrete-time quantum walks. We treat the right eigenvalue problem of quaternionic matrices to analysis the spectra of its transition matrix. The way to obtain all the right eigenvalues of a quaternionic matrix is given. From the unitary condition on the transition matrix of the quaternionic quantum walk, we deduce some properties about it. Our main results, Theorem 5.3, determine all the right eigenvalues of a quaternionic quantum walk by use of those of the corresponding weighted matrix. In addition, we give some examples of quaternionic quantum walks and their right eigenvalues.

abstract: We discuss the theoretical treatment of the microwave lensing frequency shift of the NIST-F1 and F2 atomic fountain clocks by Ashby et al. [Phy. Rev. A. 91, 033624 (2015)]. The shifts calculated by NIST are much smaller than the previously evaluated microwave lensing frequency shifts of other clocks contributing to International Atomic Time. We identify several fundamental problems in the NIST treatment and demonstrate that each significantly affects their results. We also show a smooth transition of microwave lensing frequency shifts to the photon recoil shift for large wave packets.

abstract: This is the first one of a series of papers about zeta regularization of the divergences appearing in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of several local and global observables in quantum field theory. More precisely we consider a quantized, neutral scalar field on a domain in any spatial dimension, with arbitrary boundary conditions and, possibly, in presence of an external classical potential. We analyze, in particular, the VEV of the stress-energy tensor, the corresponding boundary forces and the total energy, thus taking into account both local and global aspects of the Casimir effect. In comparison with the wide existing literature on these subjects, we try to develop a more systematic approach, allowing to treat specific configurations by mere application of a general machinery. The present Part I is mainly devoted to setting up this general framework; at the end of the paper, this is exemplified in a very simple case. In Parts II, III and IV we will consider more engaging applications, indicated in the Introduction of the present work.

Adiabatic release from the optical lattice in the object plane of a high-numerical-aperture imaging system allows a measurement of the population distribution among the lowest three bands in both radial directions with atom numbers as low as $7\times 10^2$. We measure exponential ground band heating rates as low as 0.014(1) s$^{-1}$ corresponding to a radial ground state $1/e$ lifetime of 71(5) s, fundamentally limited by scattering of lattice photons. For all lattice depths above 2 recoil, we find radial ground state lifetimes $\ge 1.6 \times 10^6$ recoil times.

abstract: We study the problem of computing energy density in one-dimensional quantum systems. We show that the ground-state energy per site or per bond can be computed in time (i) independent of the system size and subexponential in the desired precision if the ground state satisfies area laws for the Renyi entanglement entropy (this is the first rigorous formulation of the folklore that area laws imply efficient matrix-product-state algorithms); (ii) independent of the system size and polynomial in the desired precision if the system is gapped. As a by-product, we prove that in the presence of area laws (or even an energy gap) the ground state can be approximated by a positive semidefinite matrix product operator of bond dimension independent of the system size and subpolynomial in the desired precision of local properties.

abstract: The scientific approach to understand the nature of consciousness revolves around the study of human brain. Neurobiological studies that compare the nervous system of different species have accorded highest place to the humans on account of various factors that include a highly developed cortical area comprising of approximately 100 billion neurons, that are intrinsically connected to form a highly complex network. Quantum theories of consciousness are based on mathematical abstraction and Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory is one of the most promising ones. Inspired by Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory, Behrman et. al. (Behrman, 2006) have simulated a quantum Hopfield neural network with the structure of a microtubule. They have used an extremely simplified model of the tubulin dimers with each dimer represented simply as a qubit, a single quantum two-state system. The extension of this model to n-dimensional quantum states, or n-qudits presented in this work holds considerable promise for even higher mathematical abstraction in modelling consciousness systems.

abstract: The time evolution of an extended quantum system can be theoretically described in terms of the Schwinger-Keldysh functional integral formalism, whose action conveniently encodes the information about the dynamics. We show here that the action of quantum systems evolving in thermal equilibrium is invariant under a symmetry transformation which distinguishes them from generic open systems. A unitary or dissipative dynamics having this symmetry naturally leads to the emergence of a Gibbs thermal stationary state. Moreover, the fluctuation-dissipation relations characterizing the linear response of an equilibrium system to external perturbations can be derived as the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with this symmetry. Accordingly, the latter provides an efficient check for the onset of thermodynamic equilibrium and it makes testing the validity of fluctuation-dissipation relations unnecessary. In the classical limit, this symmetry renders the one which is known to characterize equilibrium in the stochastic dynamics of classical systems coupled to thermal baths, described by Langevin equations.

abstract: We study a generalization of Kitaev's abelian toric code model defined on CW complexes. In this model qudits are attached to n dimensional cells and the interaction is given by generalized star and plaquette operators. These are defined in terms of coboundary and boundary maps in the locally finite cellular cochain complex and the cellular chain complex. We find that the set of energy-minimizing ground states and the types of charges carried by certain localized excitations depends only on the proper homotopy type of the CW complex. As an application we show that the homological product of a CSS code with the infinite toric code has excitations with abelian anyonic statistics.

We also describe multiple approaches for numerical simulations of the microwave properties of these structures, along with comparisons with the measured transmission spectra. The ability to predict the mode spectrum based on the chip layout provides a path towards future designs integrating metamaterial resonators with superconducting qubits.

abstract: Iridium ions near $4f$-$5s$ level crossings are the leading candidates for a new type of atomic clocks with a high projected accuracy and a very high sensitivity to the temporal variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. To identify spectra of these ions in experiment accurate calculations of the spectra and electromagnetic transition probabilities should be performed. Properties of the $4f$-core-excited states in Ir$^{16+}$, Ir$^{17+}$, and Ir$^{18+}$ ions are evaluated using relativistic many-body perturbation theory and Hartree-Fock-Relativistic method (COWAN code). We evaluate excitation energies, wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and transition rates. Our large-scale calculations includes the following set of configurations: $4f^{14-k}5s^{m}5p^{n}$ with $(k+m+n)$ equal to 3, 2, and 1 for the Ir$^{16+}$, Ir$^{17+}$, and Ir$^{18+}$ ions, respectively. The $5s-5p$ transitions are illustrated by the synthetic spectra in the 180 - 200 \AA range. Large contributions of magnetic-dipole transitions to lifetimes of low-lying states in the region below 2.5 Ry are demonstrated.

abstract: We show that for any graph $G$, by considering "activation" through the strong product with another graph $H$, the relation $\alpha(G) \leq \vartheta(G)$ between the independence number and the Lov\'{a}sz number of $G$ can be made arbitrarily tight: Precisely, the inequality \[ \alpha(G \times H) \leq \vartheta(G \times H) = \vartheta(G)\,\vartheta(H) \] becomes asymptotically an equality for a suitable sequence of ancillary graphs $H$. This motivates us to look for other products of graph parameters of $G$ and $H$ on the right hand side of the above relation. For instance, a result of Rosenfeld and Hales states that \[ \alpha(G \times H) \leq \alpha^*(G)\,\alpha(H), \] with the fractional packing number $\alpha^*(G)$, and for every $G$ there exists $H$ that makes the above an equality; conversely, for every graph $H$ there is a $G$ that attains equality. These findings constitute some sort of duality of graph parameters, mediated through the independence number, under which $\alpha$ and $\alpha^*$ are dual to each other, and the Lov\'{a}sz number $\vartheta$ is self-dual. We also show results towards the duality of Schrijver's and Szegedy's variants $\vartheta^-$ and $\vartheta^+$ of the Lov\'{a}sz number, and explore analogous notions for the chromatic number under strong and disjunctive graph products.

The major technical tool is a transformation of the eigenvalue problem into that of a hypersingular Fredholm-type integral equation which is subsequently solved with the aid of both analytic and numerical methods. As a byproduct of discussion we give a direct analytic proof that trigonometric functions $\cos(n\pi x/2)$ and $\sin(n\pi x)$, for integer $n$ are {\it not} the eigenfunctions of $|\Delta |_D^{1/2}$.

abstract: We consider certain self-adjoint observables for the KMS state associated to the Hamiltonian $H= \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x$ over the quantum spin lattice $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes ...$. For a fixed observable of the form $L \otimes L \otimes L \otimes ...$, where $L:\mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}^2 $, and for zero temperature one can get a naturally defined stationary probability $\mu$ on the Bernoulli space $\{1,2\}^\mathbb{N}$. This probability is not Markov. Anyway, for such probability $\mu$ we can show that a Large Deviation Principle is true for a certain class of functions. The result is derived by showing the explicit form of the free energy which is differentiable. We show that the natural probability $\mu$ at temperature zero is invariant for the shift but it is not mixing. We also prove that $\mu$ is not a Gibbs state for a continuous normalized potential.

abstract: With the recent achievement of extremely high-quality epitaxial interfaces between InAs nanowires and superconducting Al shells with strong superconductor-semiconductor tunnel coupling, a new regime of proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductors can be explored where the induced gap is similar to the bulk Al gap (large gap) with negligible subgap conductance (hard gap). We propose several experimentally relevant consequences of this large-gap strong-coupling regime for tunneling experiments, and we comment on the prospects of this regime for topological superconductivity. In particular, we find that the advantages of having a strong spin-orbit coupling and a large spin g-factor in the semiconductor nanowire may both be compromised in this strongly coupled limit, and somewhat weaker interface tunneling may be necessary for achieving optimal proximity superconductivity in the semiconductor nanowire. We derive a theory for the strong-coupling hard-gap regime obtaining excellent agreement with experiment and pointing out future directions necessary for further progress toward Majorana nanowires in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures.

abstract: Reciprocity is a universal principle that has a profound impact on many areas of physics. A fundamental phenomenon in condensed-matter physics, optical physics and acoustics, arising from reciprocity, is the constructive interference of quantum or classical waves which propagate along time-reversed paths in disordered media, leading to, for example, weak localization and metal-insulator transition. Previous studies have shown that such coherent effects are suppressed when reciprocity is broken. Here we show that by breaking reciprocity in a controlled manner, we can tune, rather than simply suppress, these phenomena. In particular, we manipulate coherent backscattering of light, also known as weak localization. By utilizing a non-reciprocal magneto-optical effect, we control the interference between time-reversed paths inside a multimode fiber with strong mode mixing, and realize a continuous transition from the well-known peak to a dip in the backscattered intensity. Our results may open new possibilities for coherent control of classical and quantum waves in complex systems

So far, all-optical addressing of qubits was demonstrated only for color centers in diamond and quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate generation of coherent dark state of a single rare earth ion in a solid, namely a cerium ion in yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG). The dark state was formed under the condition of coherent population trapping. Furthermore, high-resolution spectroscopic studies of native and implanted single Ce ions have been performed. They revealed narrow and spectrally stable optical transitions between the spin sublevels of the ground and excited optical states, indicating the feasibility of interfacing single photons with a single electron spin of a cerium ion.

abstract: It is shown that the Unruh effect, i.e. the increase in temperature indicated by a uniformly accelerated thermometer in an inertial vacuum state of a quantum field, cannot be interpreted as the result of an exchange of heat with a surrounding gas. Since the vacuum is spatially homogeneous in any accelerated system its temperature must be zero everywhere as a consequence of Tolman's law. In fact, the increase of temperature of accelerated thermometers is due to systematic quantum effects induced by the local coupling between the thermometer and the vacuum. This coupling inevitably creates excitations ofthe vacuum which transfer energy to the thermometer, gained by the acceleration, and thereby affect its readings. The temperature of the vacuum, however, remains to be zero for arbitrary accelerations.

We also present the prospects and visions for combining this filter with the single photon emission of a single quantum dot (QD), which matches with the atomic transition.

abstract: The search for non-Newtonian forces has been pursued following many different paths. Recently it was suggested that hypothetical chameleon interactions, which might explain the mechanisms behind dark energy, could be detected in a high-precision force measurement. In such an experiment, interactions between parallel plates kept at constant separation could be measured as a function of the pressure of an ambient gas, thereby identifying chameleon interactions by their unique inverse dependence on the local mass density. During the past years we have been developing a new kind of setup complying with the high requirements of the proposed experiment. In this article we present the first and most important part of this setup -- the force sensor. We discuss its design, fabrication, and characterization. From the results of the latter we derive limits on chameleon interaction parameters that could be set by the forthcoming experiment. Finally, we describe the opportunity to use the same setup to measure Casimir forces at large surface separations with unprecedented accuracy, thereby potentially giving unambiguous answers to long standing open questions.

abstract: The scattering of a Dirac particle has been studied for a quaternionic potential step. In the potential region an additional diffusion solution is obtained. The quaternionic solution which generalizes the complex one presents an amplification of the reflection and transmission rates. A detailed analysis of the quaternionic spinorial velocities sheed new light on the additional solution. For pure quaternionic potentials, the interesting and surprising result of total transmission is found. This suggests that the presence of pure quaternionic potentials cannot be seen by analyzing the reflection or transmission rates. It has be observed by measuring the mean value of some operator.

abstract: We consider a two-dimensional weakly interacting ultracold Bose gas whose constituents are two-level atoms. We study the effects of a synthetic density-dependent gauge field that arises from laser-matter coupling in the adiabatic limit with a laser configuration such that the single-particle zero-order vector potential corresponds to a constant synthetic magnetic field. We find a new exotic type of current non-linearity in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which affects the dynamics of the order parameter of the condensate. We investigate the rotational properties of this system, focusing in particular on the physical conditions that make the nucleation of a quantized vortex in the system energetically favourable with respect to the non rotating solution. We point out that two different physical interpretations can be given to this new non linearity: firstly it can be seen as a local modification of the mean field coupling constant, whose value depends on the angular momentum of the condensate. Secondly, it can be interpreted as a density modulated angular velocity given to the cloud. Looking at the problem from both of these viewpoints, we analyze the physical conditions that make a single vortex state energetically favourable. In the Thomas-Fermi limit, we show that the effect of the new nonlinearity is to induce a rotation to the condensate, where the transition from non-rotating to rotating states depends on the density of the cloud.

Given a fixed density matrix $\beta:\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ and a fixed unitary operator $U : \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, the transformation $\Phi: M^n \to M^n$ $$ Q \to \Phi (Q) =\, \text{Tr}_2 (\,U \, ( Q \otimes \beta )\, U^*\,)$$ describes the interaction of $Q$ with the external source $\beta$. The result of this is $\Phi(Q)$. If $Q$ is a density operator then $\Phi(Q)$ is also a density operator. The main interest is to know what happen when we repeat several times the action of $\Phi$ in an initial fixed density operator $Q_0$. This procedure is known as random repeated quantum iterations and is of course related to the existence of one or more fixed points for $\Phi$. In \cite{NP}, among other things, the authors show that for a fixed $\beta$ there exists a set of full probability for the Haar measure such that the unitary operator $U$ satisfies the property that for the associated $\Phi$ there is a unique fixed point $ Q_\Phi$. Moreover, there exists convergence of the iterates $\Phi^n (Q_0) \to Q_\Phi$, when $n \to \infty$, for any given $Q_0$ We show here that there is an open and dense set of unitary operators $U: \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n $ such that the associated $\Phi$ has a unique fixed point. We will also consider a detailed analysis of the case when $n=2$. We will be able to show explicit results. We consider the $C^0$ topology on the coefficients of $U$. In this case we will exhibit the explicit expression on the coefficients of $U$ which assures the existence of a unique fixed point for $\Phi$. Moreover, we present the explicit expression of the fixed point $Q_\Phi$

abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of efficient and robust energy transfer in organic systems provides us with new insights for the optimal design of artificial systems. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of excitation energy transfer (EET) through a complex quantum network by a toy model consisting of three sites coupled to environments. We study how the coherent evolution and the noise-induced decoherence work together to reach efficient EET and illustrate the role of the phase factor attached to the coupling constant in the EET. By comparing the differences between the Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, we discuss the effect of environment and the spatial structure of system on the dynamics and the efficiency of EET. A intuitive picture is given to show how the exciton is transferred through the system. Employing the simple model, we show the robustness of EET efficiency under the influence of the environment and elucidate the important role of quantum coherence in EET. We go further to study the quantum feature of the EET dynamics by {\it quantumness} and show the importance of quantum coherence from a new respect. We calculate the energy current in the EET and its quantumness, results for different system parameters are presented and discussed.

abstract: Achieving controllable coupling of dopants in silicon is crucial for operating donor-based qubit devices, but it is difficult because of the small size of donor-bound electron wavefunctions. Here we report the characterization of a quantum dot coupled to a localized electronic state, and we present evidence of controllable coupling between the quantum dot and the localized state. A set of measurements of transport through this device enable the determination of the most likely location of the localized state, consistent with an electronically active impurity in the quantum well near the edge of the quantum dot. The experiments we report are consistent with a gate-voltage controllable tunnel coupling, which is an important building block for hybrid donor and gate-defined quantum dot devices.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of two quantum dots (QDs) or artificial atoms electromagnetically coupled through the localized plasmon of a single gold nanorod. We derive an intuitive and efficient time-local master equation, in which the effect of the gold nanorod is taken into consideration self-consistently using a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion technique of the photon Green function. We then present a study of the quantum dynamics and photoluminescence spectra of the two plasmon coupled QDs. We first explore the non-Markovian regime, which is found to be important on the time scale of the lifetime of the plasmon mode which is about 40$\,$fs. For the free evolution case of excited QDs in homogeneous dielectric background, we show how spatially separated QDs can be effectively coupled through the plasmon and we demonstrate that frequencies away from the plasmon resonance are more effective for coherently coupling the QDs. Despite the strong inherent dissipation of gold, we show that qubit entanglements as large as 0.7 can be achieved from an initially separate state, which has been limited to less than 0.5 in previous work for weakly coupled reservoirs. We also study the superradiance and subradiance decay dynamics of the QD pair. Finally, we investigate the dynamics of QDs that are incoherently pumped, and study the polarization dependent behaviour of the emitted photoluminescence spectrum where a double-resonance structure is observed due to the strong photon exchange interactions. Our formalism can easily be extended to include multiple QDs interacting through the QNMs of metallic resonator structures.

abstract: Random spin-exchange collisions in warm alkali vapor cause rapid decoherence and act to equilibriate the spin state of the atoms. In contrast, here we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically a coherent coupling of one alkali specie to another specie, mediated by these random collisions. We show that, the minor specie (potassium) inherits the magnetic properties of the dominant specie (rubidium), including its lifetime (T1), coherence time (T2), gyromagnetic ratio, and SERF magnetic-field threshold. We further show that this coupling can be completely controlled by varying the strength of the magnetic field. Finally, we explain these phenomena analytically by modes-mixing of the two species via spin-exchange collisions.

abstract: The stress-energy tensor of the quantum vacuum is studied for the particular case of quantum electrodynamics (QED), that is a fictituous universe where only the electromagnetic and the electron-positron fields exist. The integrals involved are ultraviolet divergent but it is suggested that a natural cut-off may exist. It is shown that, in spite of the fact that the stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field alone is traceless (i.e the pressure P equals 1/3 the energy density u), the total QED tensor is proportional to the metric tensor to a good approximation (i. e. P = -u). It is proposed that there is a cosmological constant in Einstein equation that exactly balances the stress-energy of the vacuum. It is shown that vacuum fluctuations give rise to a modified spacetime metric able to explain dark energy. Particular excitations of the vacuum are studied that might explain dark matter.

abstract: In this thesis we propose new, versatile schemes to control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. In the first part of the thesis, we envisage a new class of plasmonic cloaks made of magneto-optical (MO) materials. We demonstrate that the application of a uniform magnetic field B in these cloaks may not only switch on and off the cloaking mechanism, but also mitigate the electromagnetic (EM) absorption. We also prove that the scattered field profile can be effectively controlled by changing B. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of light-matter interactions mediated by fluctuations of the vacuum EM field. Firstly, we demonstrate that the Purcell effect can be effectively suppressed for an excited atom near a cloaking device. Furthermore, the decay rate of a quantum emitter near a graphene-coated wall under the influence of an external magnetic field is studied. We show that the MO properties of graphene strongly affect the atomic lifetime and that B allows for an unprecedented control of the decay channels of the system. In addition, we discuss the dispersive interaction between an atom and suspended graphene in a magnetic field. For large atom-graphene separations and low temperatures we show that the interaction energy is a quantized function of B. Besides, we show that at room temperature, thermal effects must be taken into account even in the extreme near-field regime. Finally, the third part of the thesis deals with the study of near-field heat transfer. We analyze the energy transfered from a semi-infinite medium to a composite sphere made of metallic inclusions embedded in a dielectric host medium. We show that the heat transfer can be strongly enhanced at the percolation phase transition. We show that our results apply for different effective medium models and are robust against changes in the inclusions' shape and materials.

abstract: We analyze spectral properties of a leaky wire model with a potential bias. It describes a two-dimensional quantum particle exposed to a potential consisting of two parts. One is an attractive $\delta$-interaction supported by a non-straight, piecewise smooth curve $\mathcal{L}$ dividing the plane into two regions of which one, the `interior', is convex. The other interaction component is a constant positive potential $V_0$ in one of the regions. We show that in the critical case, $V_0=\alpha^2$, the discrete spectrum is non-void if and only if the bias is supported in the interior. We also analyze the non-critical situations, in particular, we show that in the subcritical case, $V_0<\alpha^2$, the system may have any finite number of bound states provided the angle between the asymptotes of $\mathcal{L}$ is small enough.

abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) at critical times appear as non-analyticities during nonequilibrium quantum real-time evolution. Although there is evidence for a close relationship between DQPTs and equilibrium phase transitions, a major challenge is still to connect to fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality. In this work, renormalization group transformations in complex parameter space are formulated for quantum quenches in Ising models showing that the DQPTs are critical points associated with unstable fixed points of equilibrium Ising models. Therefore, these DQPTs obey scaling and universality. On the basis of numerical simulations, signatures of these DQPTs in the dynamical buildup of spin correlations are found with an associated power-law scaling determined solely by the fixed point's universality class. An outlook is given on how to explore this dynamical scaling experimentally in systems of trapped ions.

abstract: The evolution of two-component cold atoms on a ring with spin-orbit coupling has been studied analytically for the case with N noninteracting particles. Then, the effect of interaction is evaluated numerically via a two-body system. Two cases are considered: (i) Starting from a ground state the evolution is induced by a sudden change of the laser field, and (ii) Starting from a superposition state. Oscillating persistent spin-currents have been found. A set of formulae have been derived to describe the period and amplitude of the oscillation. Based on these formulae the oscillation can be well controlled via adjusting the parameters of the laser beams. In particular, it is predicted that movable stripes might emerge on the ring.

abstract: Solving intractable mathematical problems in simulators composed of atoms, ions, photons or electrons has recently emerged as a subject of intense interest. Here we extend this concept to phonons that are localised in spectrally pure resonances in an electromechanical system which enables their interactions to be exquisitely fashioned via electrical means. We harness this platform to emulate the Ising Hamiltonian whose spin 1/2 particles are replicated by the phase bistable vibrations from a parametric resonance where multiple resonances play the role of a spin bath. The coupling between the mechanical pseudo spins is created by generating thermomechanical two-mode squeezed states which impart correlations between resonances that can imitate a ferromagnetic, random or an anti-ferromagnetic state on demand. These results suggest an electromechanical simulator for the Ising Hamiltonian could be built with a large number of spins with multiple degrees of coupling, a task that would overwhelm a conventional computer.

abstract: We introduce exactly solvable models of interacting (Majorana) fermions in $d \ge 3$ spatial dimensions that realize a new kind of topological quantum order, building on a model presented in ref. [1]. These models have extensive topological ground-state degeneracy and a hierarchy of point-like, topological excitations that are only free to move within sub-manifolds of the lattice. In particular, one of our models has fundamental excitations that are completely stationary. To demonstrate these results, we introduce a powerful polynomial representation of commuting Majorana Hamiltonians. Remarkably, the physical properties of the topologically-ordered state are encoded in an algebraic variety, defined by the common zeros of a set of polynomials over a finite field. This provides a "geometric" framework for the emergence of topological order.

abstract: A 1-dimensional model for coherent quantum energy transfer through a complex of compressible boxes is investigated by numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Energy is communicated from one box to the next by the resonant fluctuating Fermi pressure of the electrons in each box pushing on the walls and doing work on adjacent boxes. Parameters are chosen similar to the chain molecules of typical light harvesting complexes. For some parameter choices the system is found to have an instability leading to self-induced coherent energy transfer transparency.

abstract: A partitioned process theory, as defined by Coecke, Fritz, and Spekkens, is a symmetric monoidal category together with an all-object-including symmetric monoidal subcategory. We think of the morphisms of this category as processes, and the morphisms of the subcategory as those processes that are freely executable. Via a construction we refer to as parallel-combinable processes with discarding, we obtain from this data a partially ordered monoid on the set of processes, with $f \succeq g$ if one can use the free processes to construct $g$ from $f$. The structure of this partial order can then be probed using additive monotones: order-preserving monoid homomorphisms with values in the real numbers under addition. Our first task in this short note is to characterise these additive monotones in terms of the corresponding partitioned process theory. Given enough monotones, we might hope to be able to reconstruct the order on the monoid. If so, we say that we have a complete family of monotones. In general, however, when we require our monotones to be additive monotones, such families do not exist or are hard to compute. We show the existence of complete families additive monotones for various partitioned process theories based on the category of finite sets, in order to shed light on the way such families can be constructed.

abstract: We study the effects of anisotropic hopping amplitudes on quantum phases of ultracold fermions in optical lattices described by the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model. In particular, using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) we investigate the dimensional crossover between the isotropic square and the isotropic cubic lattice. We analyze the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state and observe a significant change in the critical temperature: Depending on the interaction strength, the anisotropy can lead to both a suppression or increase. We also investigate the localization properties of the system, such as the compressibility and double occupancy. Using the local density approximation in combination with DMFT we conclude that density profiles can be used to detect the mentioned anisotropy-driven transitions.

abstract: Many modern cosmological scenarios feature large volumes of spacetime in a de Sitter vacuum phase. Such models are said to be faced with a "Boltzmann Brain problem" - the overwhelming majority of observers with fixed local conditions are random fluctuations in the de Sitter vacuum, rather than arising via thermodynamically sensible evolution from a low-entropy past. We argue that this worry can be straightforwardly avoided in the Many-Worlds (Everett) approach to quantum mechanics, as long as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional. In that case, de Sitter settles into a truly stationary quantum vacuum state. While there would be a nonzero probability for observing Boltzmann-Brain-like fluctuations in such a state, "observation" refers to a specific kind of dynamical process that does not occur in the vacuum (which is, after all, time-independent). Observers are necessarily out-of-equilibrium physical systems, which are absent in the vacuum. Hence, the fact that projection operators corresponding to states with observers in them do not annihilate the vacuum does not imply that such observers actually come into existence. The Boltzmann Brain problem is therefore much less generic than has been supposed.

abstract: We propose a method for acting on the spin state of a spin-1/2 localized particle, or `qubit', by means of a magnetic signal effectively generated by the nearby transit of a magnetic soliton, there conveyed through a transmission line. We first introduce the specific magnetic soliton of which we will make use, and briefly review the properties that make it apt to represent a signal. We then show that a Heisenberg spin chain can serve as transmission line, and propose a method for injecting a soliton into the chain by acting just on one of its ends. We finally demonstrate that the resulting magnetic pulse can indeed cause, just passing by the spin-1/2 localized particle embodying the qubit, a permanent change in its spin state, thus realizing the possibility of getting through to a single, localized qubit, and manipulate its state. A thorough analysis of how the overall dynamical system operates depending on the setting of its parameters demonstrates that fine tuning is not necessary as it exists an extended region in the parameters space that corresponds to an effective functioning. Moreover, we show that possible noise on the transmission line does not invalidate the scheme.

abstract: Many experiments investigated the violation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) since its discovery in 1925. The VIP (VIolation of the Pauli Principle) experiment tested the PEP by measuring the probability for an external electron to be captured and undergo a 2p to 1s transition during its cascading process, where the 1s state is already occupied by two electrons. This transition is forbidden by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The VIP experiment resulted in a preliminary upper limit for the probability of the violation of the PEP of 4.7 x 10^{-29}. Currently a setup for the follow-up experiment VIP 2 is under preparation. The goal of this experiment is to improve the upper limit for the violation of the PEP by two orders of magnitude, by different improvements like enhanced energy resolution of the X-ray detectors and by implementing an active shielding. Here we report currently ongoing performance tests of the new parts of the setup.

abstract: In a recent work, using a coupled microresonator system with tailored gain and loss parameters B. Peng et al. [Science 346, 328 (2014)] have experimentally reported on an apparently counterintuitive effect in laser theory, namely the possibility to enhance lasing by increasing loss in the system. The observed phenomenon was related to the existence of an exceptional point in the system and was presented somehow as an unexpected and novel effect, especially by some reporters and scientific blogs. In this communication it is pointed out that the phenomenon of loss-induced lasing does not come as a surprise in known laser theory and that it is not necessarily related to the physics of exceptional points. Loss-induced lasing is basically the lasing mechanism that occurs in loss-coupled distributed feedback lasers. This mechanism dates back to the 1970's, has a simple physical explanation and does not rely on the physics of exceptional points.

abstract: We show how dipolar interactions between dysprosium atoms in an optical lattice can be used to obtain fractional quantum Hall states. In our approach, dysprosium atoms are trapped one atom per site in a deep optical lattice with negligible tunneling. Microwave and spatially dependent optical dressing fields are used to define an effective spin-1/2 or spin-1 degree of freedom in each atom. Thinking of spin-1/2 particles as hardcore bosons, dipole-dipole interactions give rise to boson hopping, topological flat bands with Chern number 1, and the \nu = 1/2 Laughlin state. Thinking of spin-1 particles as two-component hardcore bosons, dipole-dipole interactions again give rise to boson hopping, topological flat bands with Chern number 2, and the bilayer Halperin (2,2,1) state. By adjusting the optical fields, we find a phase diagram, in which the (2,2,1) state competes with superfluidity. Generalizations to solid-state magnetic dipoles are discussed.

abstract: We prove a near optimal round-communication tradeoff for the two-party quantum communication complexity of disjointness. For protocols with $r$ rounds, we prove a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(n/r + r)$ on the communication required for computing disjointness of input size $n$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The previous best lower bound was $\Omega(n/r^2 + r)$ due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [JRS03]. Along the way, we develop several tools for quantum information complexity, one of which is a lower bound for quantum information complexity in terms of the generalized discrepancy method. As a corollary, we get that the quantum communication complexity of any boolean function $f$ is at most $2^{O(QIC(f))}$, where $QIC(f)$ is the prior-free quantum information complexity of $f$ (with error $1/3$).

From measured interference patterns we extract phase correlation functions and analyze if, and under which conditions, the higher-order correlation functions factorize into lower ones. This allows us to characterize the essential features of the model solely from our experimental measurements, detecting the relevant quasiparticles, their interactions and the topologically distinct vacua. Our method provides comprehensive insights into a non-trivial quantum field theory and establishes a general method to analyze quantum many-body systems through experiments.

Whether various topological phases can survive in the presence of long-range interactions, however, is largely unknown. Here we show that a paradigmatic example of a symmetry-protected topological phase, the Haldane phase of an antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain, surprisingly remains intact in the presence of arbitrarily slowly decaying power-law interactions. The influence of long-range interactions on the topological order is largely quantitative, and we expect similar results for more general systems. Our conclusions are based on large-scale matrix-product-state simulations and two complementary effective-field-theory calculations. The striking agreement between the numerical and analytical results rules out finite-size effects. The topological phase considered here should be experimentally observable in a recently developed trapped-ion quantum simulator.

abstract: We study the effect of resonances near the threshold of low energy ($\varepsilon$) reactive scattering processes, and find an anomalous behavior of the $s$-wave cross sections. For reaction and inelastic processes, the cross section exhibits the energy dependence $\sigma\sim\varepsilon^{-3/2}$ instead of the standard Wigner's law threshold behavior $\sigma\sim\varepsilon^{-1/2}$. Wigner's law is still valid as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, but in a narrow range of energies. We illustrate these effects with two reactive systems, a low-reactive system (H$_2$ + Cl) and a more reactive one (H$_2$ + F). We provide analytical expressions, and explain this anomalous behavior using the properties of the Jost functions. We also discuss the implication of the reaction rate coefficients behaving as $K\sim 1/T$ at low temperatures, instead of the expected constant rate of the Wigner regime in ultracold physics and chemistry.

abstract: Phases of matter are sharply defined in the thermodynamic limit. One major challenge of accurately simulating quantum phase diagrams of interacting quantum systems is due to the fact that numerical simulations usually deal with the energy density, a local property of quantum wavefunctions, while identifying different quantum phases generally rely on long-range physics. In this paper we construct generic fully symmetric quantum wavefunctions under certain assumptions using a type of tensor networks: projected entangled pair states, and provide practical simulation algorithms based on them. We find that quantum phases can be organized into crude classes distinguished by short-range physics, which is related to the fractionalization of both on-site symmetries and space-group symmetries. Consequently, our simulation algorithms, which are useful to study long-range physics as well, are expected to be able to sharply determine crude classes in interacting quantum systems efficiently. Examples of these crude classes are demonstrated in half-integer quantum spin systems on the kagome lattice. Limitations and generalizations of our results are discussed.

abstract: We report results for reaction and vibrational quenching of the collision D with para-H$_2$($v,j=0$) and ortho-H$_2$($v,j=1$) at cold and ultracold temperatures. We investigate the effect of nuclear spin symmetry for barrier dominated processes ($0\le v\le 4$) and for one barrierless case ($v=5$). We find resonant structures for energies in the range corresponding to 0.01--10 K, which depend on the nuclear spin of H$_2$, arising from contributions of specific partial waves. We discuss the implications on the results in this benchmark system for ultracold chemistry.

abstract: Quantum walks, whose dynamics is prescribed by alternating unitary coin and shift operators, possess topological phases akin to those of Floquet topological insulators, driven by a time-periodic field. While there is ample theoretical work on topological phases of quantum walks where the coin operators are spin rotations, in experiments a different coin, the Hadamard operator is often used instead. This was the case in a recent photonic quantum walk experiment, where protected edge states were observed between two bulks whose topological invariants, as calculated by the standard theory, were the same. This hints at a hidden topological invariant in the Hadamard quantum walk. We establish a relation between the Hadamard and the spin rotation operator, which allows us to apply the recently developed theory of topological phases of quantum walks to the one-dimensional Hadamard quantum walk. The topological invariants we derive account for the edge state observed in the experiment, we thus reveal the hidden topological invariant of the one-dimensional Hadamard quantum walk.

abstract: The creation of ultracold molecules is currently limited to diatomic species. In this letter we present a theoretical description of the photoassociation of ultracold atoms and molecules to create ultracold excited triatomic molecules, thus being a novel example of light-assisted ultracold chemical reaction. The calculation of the photoassociation rate of ultracold Cs atoms with ultracold Cs$_2$ molecules in their rovibrational ground state is reported, based on the solution of the quantum dynamics involving the atom-molecule long-range interactions, and assuming a model potential for the short-range physics. The rate for the formation of excited Cs$_3$ molecules is predicted to be comparable with currently observed atom-atom photoassociation rates. We formulate an experimental proposal to observe this process relying on the available techniques of optical lattices and standard photoassociation spectroscopy.

abstract: A contemporary physicist would be hard put to agree entirely with the author of a 1959 textbook on quantum mechanics, who wrote: "A second simple, one-dimensional system, somewhat divorced from reality but illustrative of the principles of the theory, is a particle in a box with finite walls." Interest in this prototypic system has not diminished over the years, and is not likely to do so in the near future, because it has now been wedded to reality and seen as a paradigm for quantum wells and other nanosystems. The treatment of this topic in standard textbooks has changed little over the last few decades, and such changes as have come to our notice leave, in our opinion, much to be desired. The purpose of this article is to enable, even encourage, other teachers to give the finite square well the attention that it deserves; to this end, the authors provide a tutorial review that is more instructive and comprehensive than the accounts presented in numerous textbooks and dispensed in still more numerous online resources, but does not make any additional demands on the mathematical abilities of the student. Given the elemental nature of the topic, the authors claim no originality; with nothing more than the winnowing fork in their hands, they can only clear the threshing floor, gather the wheat into the barn, and let others decide whether or no the chaff should be burnt with unquenchable fire.

abstract: A possible solution of the well known paradox of chiral molecules is based on the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking. At low pressure the molecules are delocalized between the two minima of a given molecular potential while at higher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a phase transition is provided by measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at different pressures. In particular, at pressure greater than a critical value no inversion line is observed. These data are well accounted for by a model previously developed and recently extended to mixtures. In the present paper, we discuss the variation of the critical pressure in binary mixtures as a function of the fractions of the constituents.

abstract: We consider interacting one-dimensional, spinless Fermi gases, whose low-energy properties are described by Luttinger liquid theory. We perform a systematic, in-depth analysis of the relation between the macroscopic, phenomenological parameters of Luttinger liquid effective field theory, and the microscopic interactions of the Fermi gas. In particular, we begin by explaining how to model effective interactions in one dimension, which we then apply to the main forward scattering channel -- the interbranch collisions -- common to these systems. We renormalise the corresponding interbranch phenomenological constants in favour of scattering phase shifts. Interestingly, our renormalisation procedure shows (i) how Luttinger's model arises in a completely natural way -- and not as a convenient approximation -- from Tomonaga's model, and (ii) the reasons behind the interbranch coupling constant remaining unrenormalised in Luttinger's model. We then consider the so-called intrabranch processes, whose phenomenological coupling constant is known to be fixed by charge conservation, but whose microscopic origin is not well understood. We show that, contrary to general belief and common sense, the intrabranch interactions appearing in Luttinger liquid theory do not correspond to an intrabranch scattering channel, nor an energy shift due to intrabranch interactions, in the microscopic theory. Instead, they are due to interbranch processes. We finally apply our results to a particular example of an exactly solvable model, namely the fermionic dual to the Lieb-Liniger model in the Tonks-Girardeau and super-Tonks-Girardeau regimes.

abstract: The quantum ratchet current is studied in the parameter space of the dissipative kicked rotor model coupled to a zero temperature quantum environment. We show that vacuum fluctuations blur the generic isoperiodic stable structures found in the classical case. Such structures tend to survive when a measure of statistical dependence between the quantum and classical currents are displayed in the parameter space. In addition, we show that quantum fluctuations can be used to overcome transport barriers in the phase space. Related quantum ratchet current activation regions are spotted in the parameter space. Results are discussed {based on quantum, semiclassical and classical calculations. While the semiclassical dynamics involves vacuum fluctuations, the classical map is driven by thermal noise.

abstract: It is common knowledge that the microcanonical, canonical, and grand-canonical ensembles are equivalent in thermodynamically large systems. Here, we study finite-size effects in the latter two ensembles. We show that contrary to naive expectations, finite-size errors are exponentially small in grand canonical ensemble calculations of translationally invariant systems in unordered phases at finite temperature. Open boundary conditions and canonical ensemble calculations suffer from finite-size errors that are only polynomially small in the system size. We further show that finite-size effects are generally smallest in numerical linked cluster expansions. Our conclusions are supported by analytical and numerical analyses of classical and quantum systems.

abstract: We performed quantum manipulations of the multi-level spin system S=5/2 of a Mn$^{2+}$ ion, by means of a two-tone pulse drive. The detuning between the excitation and readout radio frequency pulses allows one to select the number of photons involved in a Rabi oscillation as well as increase the frequency of this nutation. Thus detuning can lead to a resonant multi-photon process. Our analytical model for a two-photon process as well as a numerical generalization fit well the experimental findings, with implications in the use of multi-level spin systems as tunable solid state qubits.

abstract: Using measures of entanglement such as negativity and tangles we provide a detailed analysis of entanglement structures in pure states of non-interacting qubits. The motivation for this exercise primarily comes from holographic considerations, where entanglement is inextricably linked with the emergence of geometry. We use the qubit systems as toy models to probe the internal structure, and introduce some useful measures involving entanglement negativity to quantify general features of entanglement. In particular, our analysis focuses on various constraints on the pattern of entanglement which are known to be satisfied by holographic sates, such as the saturation of Araki-Lieb inequality (in certain circumstances), and the monogamy of mutual information. We argue that even systems as simple as few non-interacting qubits can be useful laboratories to explore how the emergence of the bulk geometry may be related to quantum information principles.

A simple theoretical model predicts the presence of electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) in this pure three-level system when the control field is resonant. Experimentally, we use $^{87}$Rb in a large magnetic field of 0.62~T to reach the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime and realise a non-degenerate three-level system. Experimental observations verify the predictions over a wide range of detunings.

abstract: We investigate the self-correcting properties of a network of Majorana wires, in the form of a trijunction, in contact with a parity-preserving thermal environment. As opposed to the case where Majorana bound states (MBSs) are immobile, braiding MBSs within a trijunction introduces dangerous error processes that we identify. Such errors prevent the lifetime of the memory from increasing with the size of the system. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings put a restriction on the degree of self-correction of this specific quantum computing architecture.

abstract: Three of the big puzzles of theoretical physics are the following: (i) There is apparently no time evolution in the dynamics of quantum general relativity, because the allowed quantum states must obey the Hamiltonian constraint. (ii) During a quantum measurement, the state of the quantum system randomly collapses from being in a linear superposition of the eigenstates of the measured observable, to just one of the eigenstates, in apparent violation of the predictions of the deterministic, linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. (iii) The observed value of the cosmological constant is exceedingly small, compared to its natural value, creating a serious fine-tuning problem. In this essay we propose a novel idea to show how the three problems help solve each other.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.03811
abstract: We propose a model for addressing the superfluidity of two different Fermi species confined in a bilayer geometry of square optical lattices. The fermions are assumed to be molecules with interlayer s-wave interactions, whose dipole moments are oriented perpendicularly to the layers. Using functional integral techniques we investigate the BCS-like state induced in the bilayer at finite temperatures. In particular, we determine the critical temperature as a function of the coupling strength between molecules in different layers and of the interlayer spacing. By means of Ginzburg-Landau theory we calculate the superfluid density. We also study the dimerized BEC phase through the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where the effective mass leads to identify the crossover from BCS to BEC regimes. The possibility of tuning the effective mass as a direct consequence of the lattice confinement, allows us to suggest a range of values of the interlayer spacing, which would enable observing this superfluidity within current experimental conditions.

In addition to the density-dependent interactions, this model also contains nonlinear coupling terms between the two components of the polariton. Using a mean-field calculation, we obtain the phase diagram which shows how these terms affect the transition between the Mott insulator and the superfluid phase. In addition, we employ both a perturbation approach and an exact diagonalization method to gain more insights into the phase diagram.

abstract: The entanglement of coherently split electron-hole pairs in an electronic conductor is typically not considered accessible due to particle number conservation and fermionic super-selection rules. We demonstrate here that current cross-correlation measurements at the outputs of an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can nevertheless provide a robust witness of electron-hole entanglement. Specifically, we consider neutral excitations generated by modulating the transmission of an unbiased quantum point contact periodically in time. For an optimized modulation profile, an entangled state with one positively-charged leviton (a hole) and one negatively-charged leviton (an electron) gets delocalized over the two paths of the interferometer and is detected at the output arms. We evaluate the influence of finite electronic temperatures and dephasing corresponding to recent experiments.

abstract: We demonstrate a compact, spectrally-selective, and tunable delay line for single photons emitted by quantum dots. This is achieved by fine-tuning the wavelength of the optical transitions of such "artificial atoms" into a spectral window in which a cloud of natural atoms behaves as slow-light medium. By employing the ground-state fine-structure-split exciton confined in an InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot as a source of single photons at different frequencies and the hyperfine-structure-split $D_1$ transition of Cs-vapors as a tunable delay-medium, we achieve a differential delay of up 2.4 ns on a 7.5 cm long path for photons that are only 60 \mu eV (14.5 GHz) apart. To quantitatively explain the experimental data we develop a theoretical model that accounts for both the inhomogeneously broadening of the quantum-dot emission lines and the Doppler-broadening of the atomic lines. The concept we proposed here may be used to implement time-reordering operations aimed at erasing the "which-path" information that deteriorates entangled-photon emission from excitons with finite fine-structure-splitting.

abstract: We point out that neutrino oscillations imply an ambiguity in the definition of the vacuum and the coupling to gravity, with experimentally observable consequences due to the Unruh effect. In an accelerating frame, the detector should see a bath of mass Eigenstates neutrinos. In inertial processes, neutrinos are produced and absorbed as charge Eigenstates. The two cannot be reconciled by a spacetime coordinate transformation. This makes manifestations of the Unruh effect in neutrino physics a promising probe of both neutrinos and fundamental quantum field theory. In this respect, we suggest $p\rightarrow n +\ell^+ + {\nu_\ell}$ ($\ell^+ = e^+, \mu^+, \tau^+$) transitions in strong electromagnetic fields as a promising avenue of investigation. In this essay we discuss this process both in the inertial and comoving frame, we briefly describe the experimental realization and its challenges, and close by speculating on possible results of such an experiment in different scenarios of fundamental neutrino physics

abstract: A route toward lineshape engineering of Fano resonances in photonic structures is theoretically proposed, which uses dynamic modulation of the refractive index of a microcavity. The method is exemplified by considering coupled-resonator optical waveguide systems. An exact Floquet analysis, based on coupled-mode theory, is presented. Two distinct kinds of resonances can be dynamically created, depending on whether the static structure sustains a localized mode or not. In the former case a single Fano resonance arises, which can be tuned in both frequency and line width by varying the refractive index modulation amplitude and frequency. In the latter case two resonances, in the form of narrow asymmetric dips in the transmittance, are found, which can overlap resulting in an electromagnetically-induced transparency effect.

abstract: The bandstructures of [110] and [001] Bi2Te3 nanowires are solved with the atomistic 20 band tight binding functionality of NEMO5. The theoretical results reveal: The popular assumption that all topological insulator wire surfaces are equivalent is inappropriate. The Fermi velocity of chemically distinct wire surfaces differs significantly which creates an effective in-surface confinement potential. As a result, topological insulator surface states prefer specific surfaces. Therefore, experiments have to be designed carefully not to probe surfaces unfavorable to the surface states (low density of states) and thereby be insensitive to the TI-effects.

abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) provide a framework for the construction of models where a single tensor gives rise to both Hamiltonian and ground state wavefunction on the same footing. A key problem is to characterize the behavior which emerges in the system in terms of the properties of the tensor, and thus of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we consider PEPS models with $\mathbb Z_2$ on-site symmetry and study the occurence of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show how long-range order is connected to a degeneracy in the spectrum of the PEPS transfer operator, and how the latter gives rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking under perturbations. We provide a succinct characterization of the symmetry broken states in terms of the PEPS tensor, and find that using the symmetry broken states we can derive a local entanglement Hamiltonian, thereby restoring locality of the entanglement Hamiltonian for all gapped phases.

abstract: Weak measurement is an important technique for detecting the tiny spin-dependent splitting in photonic spin Hall effect. The weak measurement is only valid when the probe wavefunction remains almost undisturbed during the procedure of measurements. However, it does not always satisfy such condition in some practical situations, such as in the strong-coupling regime or the preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal. In this paper, we develop a modified weak measurement for detecting photonic spin Hall effect when the probe wavefunction is distorted. We find that the measuring procedure with preselected and postselected ensembles is still effective. This scheme is important for us to detect the photonic spin Hall effect in the case where neither weak nor strong measurements can detect the spin-dependent splitting. The modified theory is valid not only in weak-coupling regime but also in the strong-coupling regime, and especially in the intermediate regime. The theoretical models of conventional weak measurements and modified weak measurements are established and compared. We show that the experimental results coincide well with the predictions of the modified theory.

abstract: Photonic quantum technologies promise to repeat the success of integrated nanophotonic circuits in non-classical applications. Using linear optical elements, quantum optical computations can be performed with integrated optical circuits and thus allow for overcoming existing limitations in terms of scalability. Besides passive optical devices for realizing photonic quantum gates, active elements such as single photon sources and single photon detectors are essential ingredients for future optical quantum circuits. Material systems which allow for the monolithic integration of all components are particularly attractive, including III-V semiconductors, silicon and also diamond. Here we demonstrate nanophotonic integrated circuits made from high quality polycrystalline diamond thin films in combination with on-chip single photon detectors. Using superconducting nanowires coupled evanescently to travelling waves we achieve high detection efficiencies up to 66 % combined with low dark count rates and timing resolution of 190 ps. Our devices are fully scalable and hold promise for functional diamond photonic quantum devices.

abstract: In this contribution to the study of one dimensional point potentials, we prove that if we take the limit $q\to 0$ on a potential of the type $v_0\delta({y})+{2}v_1\delta'({y})+w_0\delta({y}-q)+ {2} w_1\delta'({y}-q)$, we obtain a new point potential of the type ${u_0} \delta({y})+{2 u_1} \delta'({y})$, when $ u_0$ and $ u_1$ are related to $v_0$, $v_1$, $w_0$ and $w_1$ by a law having the structure of a group. This is the Borel subgroup of $SL_2({\mathbb R})$. We also obtain the non-abelian addition law from the scattering data. The spectra of the Hamiltonian in the exceptional cases emerging in the study are also described in full detail. It is shown that for the $v_1=\pm 1$, $w_1=\pm 1$ values of the $\delta^\prime$ couplings the singular Kurasov matrices become equivalent to Dirichlet at one side of the point interaction and Robin boundary conditions at the other side.

abstract: Afterpulsing is one of the main technological flaws present in photon counting detectors based on solid-state semiconductor avalanche photodiodes operated in Geiger mode. Level of afterpulsing depends mainly on type of the semiconductor, doping concentrations and temperature and presents an additional source of noise, along with dark counts. Unlike dark counts which appear randomly in time, aterpulses and are time-correlated with the previous detections. For measurements that rely on timing information afterpulsing can create fake signals and diminish the sensitivity. In this work we test a novel broadband sensitive APD that was designed for sub-Geiger avalanche gain operation. We find that this APD, which has a reach-through geometry typical of single-photon detection photodiodes, can also operate in Geiger mode with usable detection sensitivity and acceptable dark counts level while exhibiting uniquely low afterpulsing. The afterpulsing of tested samples was systematically less than 0.05 percent at 10V excess voltage.

abstract: Tensor networks algorithms provide a suitable route to tackle real-time dependent problems in lattice gauge theories, enabling the investigation of out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We analyze a U(1) lattice gauge theory in (1+1) dimensions in the presence of dynamical matter for different mass and electric field couplings, a theory akin to quantum-electrodynamics in one-dimension, which displays string-breaking: the confining string between charges can spontaneously break during quench exper- iments, giving rise to charge-anticharge pairs according to the Schwinger mechanism. We study the real-time spreading of excitations in the system by means of electric field and particle fluctuations: We determine a dynamical state diagram for string breaking, and we quantitatively evaluate the time-scales for mass production. We show also that the time evolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von Neumann entropies, which demonstrates that the Schwinger mech- anism is tightly linked to entanglement spreading. To present the variety of possible applications of this simulation platform, we show how one could follow the real-time scattering processes between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering processes. Finally, we access the quality of quantum simulations of these dynamics quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuit systems. Our results demonstrate how entan- glement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic phenomena in the real-time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking and collisions.

abstract: Using matrix product states, we explore numerically the phenomenology of string breaking in a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory, namely 1+1 dimensional SU(2). The technique allows us to study the static potential between external heavy charges, as traditionally explored by Monte Carlo simulations, but also to simulate the real-time dynamics of both static and dynamical fermions, as the latter are fully included in the formalism. We propose a number of observables that are sensitive to the presence or breaking of the flux string, and use them to detect and characterize the phenomenon in each of these setups.

abstract: Long-lived single-frequency oscillations in the local non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system is an exceptional phenomenon. In fact, till now, it has never been observed, nor predicted, for the physically relevant case where a system is prepared to be quenched from one quantum phase to another. Here we show how the quench dynamics of the entanglement spectrum may reveal the emergence of such oscillations in a correlated quantum system with Kondo impurities. The oscillations we find are characterized by a single frequency. This frequency is universal, being independent of the amount of energy released by the local quench, and scales with the inverse system size. Importantly, the universal frequency manifests itself also in local observables, such as the spin-spin correlation function of the impurities.

abstract: In a previous article, [arXiv:1501.02506, JPhysA {\bf48} (2015) 225207], we demonstrated that whenever $[X,Y] = u X + vY + cI$ the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula reduces to the tractable closed-form expression \[ Z(X,Y)=\ln( e^X e^Y ) = X+Y+ f(u,v) \; [X,Y], \] where $f(u,v)=f(v,u)$ is explicitly given by \[ f(u,v) = {(u-v)e^{u+v}-(ue^u-ve^v)\over u v (e^u - e^v)} = {(u-v)-(ue^{-v}-ve^{-u})\over u v (e^{-v} - e^{-u})}. \] This is much more general than the results usually presented for either the Heisenberg commutator $[P,Q]=-i\hbar I$, or the creation-destruction commutator $[a,a^\dagger]=I$. In the current article we shall further generalize and extend this result, primarily by relaxing the input assumptions. We shall work with the structure constants $f_{ab}{}^c$ of the Lie algebra, (defined by $[T_a,T_b] = f_{ab}{}^c \; T_c$), and identify suitable constraints one can place on the structure constants to make the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula tractable. We shall also develop related results using the commutator sub-algebra $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ of the relevant Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Under suitable conditions, and taking $L_A B = [A,B]$ as usual, we shall demonstrate that \[ \ln( e^X e^Y ) = X + Y + {I \over e^{-L_X} - e^{+L_Y} } \left( {I-e^{-L_X}\over L_X} + {I-e^{+L_Y}\over L_Y} \right) [X,Y]. \]

abstract: Quantum walks are promising for information processing tasks because on regular graphs they spread quadratically faster than random walks. Static disorder, however, can turn the tables: unlike random walks, quantum walks can suffer Anderson localization, whereby the spread of the walker stays within a finite region even in the infinite time limit. It is therefore important to understand when we can expect a quantum walk to be Anderson localized and when we can expect it to spread to infinity even in the presence of disorder. In this work we analyze the response of a generic one-dimensional quantum walk -- the split-step walk -- to different forms of static disorder. We find that introducing static, symmetry-preserving disorder in the parameters of the walk leads to Anderson localization. In the completely disordered limit, however, a delocalization sets in, and the walk spreads subdiffusively. Using an efficient numerical algorithm, we calculate the bulk topological invariants of the disordered walk, and interpret the disorder-induced Anderson localization and delocalization transitions using these invariants.

We discuss whether they can be applied to some important cases including monotone, Boson, Fermion and Boolean $C^*$-algebras in a unified version. The monotone and the Boolean cases are treated in full generality, the Bose/Fermi cases being already widely investigated. In fact, on one hand we show that the set of stationary stochastic processes are isomorphic to a segment in both the situations, on the other hand the Boolean processes enjoy the very strong property of unique mixing with respect to the fixed point subalgebra and the monotone ones do not

abstract: We discuss thermalization of isolated quantum systems by using the Husimi-Wehrl entropy evaluated in the semiclassical treatment. The Husimi-Wehrl entropy is the Wehrl entropy obtained by using the Husimi function for the phase space distribution. The time evolution of the Husimi function is given by smearing the Wigner function, whose time evolution is obtained in the semiclassical approximation. We show the efficiency and usefullness of this semiclassical treatment in describing entropy production of a couple of quantum mechanical systems, whose classical counter systems are known to be chaotic. We propose two methods to evaluate the time evolution of the Husimi-Wehrl entropy, the test-particle method and the two-step Monte-Carlo method. We demonstrate the characteristics of the two methods by numerical calculations, and show that the simultaneous application of the two methods ensures the reliability of the results of the Husimi-Wehrl entropy at a given time.

abstract: We experimentally study the dynamics of a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas that is subject to a continuous outcoupling of atoms. Although standard evaporative cooling is rendered ineffective by the absence of thermalizing collisions in this system, we observe substantial cooling. This cooling proceeds through homogeneous particle dissipation and many-body dephasing, enabling the preparation of otherwise unexpectedly low temperatures. Our observations establish a scaling relation between temperature and particle number, and provide insights into equilibration in the quantum world.

abstract: We analyze spontaneous parametric down-conversion in various experimentally feasible 1D quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays, with emphasis on the relationship between the lattice's topological invariants and the biphoton correlations. Nontrivial topology results in a nontrivial "winding" of the array's Bloch waves, which introduces additional selection rules for the generation of biphotons. These selection rules are in addition to, and independent of existing control using the pump beam's spatial profile and phase matching conditions. In finite lattices, nontrivial topology produces single photon edge modes, resulting in "hybrid" biphoton edge modes, with one photon localized at the edge and the other propagating into the bulk. When the single photon band gap is sufficiently large, these hybrid biphoton modes reside in a band gap of the bulk biphoton Bloch wave spectrum. Numerical simulations support our analytical results.

abstract: Topological quantum computation has been extensively studied due to its robustness against decoherence. A conventional way to realize it is by adiabatic operations---it requires relatively long time to accomplish so that the speed of quantum computation slows down. In this work, we present a method to realize topological quantum computation by periodic driving. Compared to the adiabatic evolution, the total operation time can be regulated arbitrarily by the amplitude and frequency of the periodic driving. For the sinusoidal driving, we give an expression for the total operation time in the high-frequency limit. For the square wave driving, we derive an exact analytical expression for the evolution operator without any approximations, and show that the amplitude and frequency of driving field depend on its period and total operation time. This could provide a new direction in regulations of the operation time in topological quantum computation.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.04923
abstract: Fixing the number of particles $N$, the quantum canonical ensemble imposes a constraint on the occupation numbers of single-particle states. The constraint particularly hampers the systematic calculation of the partition function and any relevant thermodynamic expectation value for arbitrary $N$ since, unlike the case of the grand-canonical ensemble, traces in the $N$-particle Hilbert space fail to factorize into simple traces over single-particle states. In this paper we introduce a projection operator that enables a constraint-free computation of the partition function and its derived quantities, at the price of an angular or contour integration. Being applicable to both bosonic and fermionic non-interacting systems in arbitrary dimensions, the projection operator approach provides closed-form expressions for the partition function $Z_N$ and the Helmholtz free energy $F_{\! N}$ as well as for two- and four-point correlation functions. While appearing only as a secondary quantity in the present context, the chemical potential potential emerges as a by-product from the relation $\mu_N = F_{\! N+1} - F_{\! N}$, as illustrated for a two-dimensional fermion gas with $N$ ranging between 2 and 500.

abstract: The first step in the coherent control of a photoinduced binary reaction is bond making or photoassociation. We have recently demonstrated coherent control of bond making in multi-photon femtosecond photoassociation of hot magnesium atoms, using linearly chirped pulses [Levin et al., arXiv:1411.1542]. The detected yield of photoassociated magnesium dimers was enhanced by positively chirped pulses which is explained theoretically by a combination of purification and chirp-dependent Raman transitions. The yield could be further enhanced by pulse optimization resulting in pulses with an effective linear chirp and a sub-pulse structure, where the latter allows for exploiting vibrational coherences. Here, we systematically explore the efficiency of phase-shaped pulses for the coherent control of bond making, employing a parametrization of the spectral phases in the form of cosine functions. We find up to an order of magnitude enhancement of the yield compared to the unshaped transform-limited pulse. The highly performing pulses all display an overall temporally increasing instantaneous frequency and are composed of several overlapping sub-pulses. The time delay between the first two sub-pulses almost perfectly fits the vibrational frequency of the generated intermediate wavepacket.These findings are in agreement with chirp-dependent Raman transitions and exploitation of vibrational dynamics as underlying control mechanisms.

abstract: We recently performed cognitive experiments on conjunctions and negations of two concepts with the aim of investigating the combination problem of concepts. Our experiments confirmed the deviations (conceptual vagueness, underextension, overextension, etc.) from the rules of classical (fuzzy) logic and probability theory observed by several scholars in concept theory, while our data were successfully modeled in a quantum-theoretic framework developed by ourselves. In this paper, we isolate a new, very stable and systematic pattern of violation of classicality that occurs in concept combinations. In addition, the strength and regularity of this non-classical effect leads us to believe that it occurs at a more fundamental level than the deviations observed up to now. It is our opinion that we have identified a deep non-classical mechanism determining not only how concepts are combined but, rather, how they are formed. We show that this effect can be faithfully modeled in a two-sector Fock space structure, and that it can be exactly explained by assuming that human thought is the supersposition of two processes, a 'logical reasoning', guided by 'logic', and a 'conceptual reasoning' guided by 'emergence', and that the latter generally prevails over the former. All these findings provide a new fundamental support to our quantum-theoretic approach to human cognition.

This can be realized by the engineering of parametric interaction between control and target polariton modes, which can be varied in time. As an explicit setup we use a system of dipolaritons, which allows for enhancement of parametric interaction by auxiliary classical fields and scalable multigate system realization. The calculated fidelity is shown to exceed 99% for realistic system parameters.

But when the electric and magnetic formulas are averaged ('electric-magnetic democracy'), these terms cancel, restoring the separation into right-handed and left-handed currents for orbital and spin separately.

abstract: We introduce a family of strongly-correlated spin wave functions on arbitrary spin-1/2 and spin-1 lattices in one and two dimensions. These states are lattice analogues of Moore-Read states of particles at filling fraction 1/q, which are non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall states in 2D. One parameter enables us to perform an interpolation between the continuum limit, where the states become continuum Moore-Read states of bosons (odd q) and fermions (even q), and the lattice limit. We show numerical evidence that the topological entanglement entropy stays the same along the interpolation for some of the states we introduce in 2D, which suggests that the topological properties of the lattice states are the same as in the continuum, while the 1D states are critical states. We then derive exact parent Hamiltonians for these states on lattices of arbitrary size. By deforming these parent Hamiltonians, we construct local Hamiltonians that stabilize some of the states we introduce in 1D and in 2D.

abstract: In this second paper on quantum fluctuations near the classical instanton configurations, see {\em Phys. Rev. D \bf 92}, 025046 (2015) and arXiv:1501.03993, we focus on another well studied quantum-mechanical problem, the one-dimensional Sine-Gordon potential (the Mathieu potential). Using only the tools from quantum field theory, the Feynman diagrams in the instanton background, we calculate the tunneling amplitude (the instanton density) to the three-loop order. The result confirms (to seven significant figures) the one recently recalculated by G. V. Dunne and M. \"{U}nsal, {\it Phys. Rev. \bf D 89}, 105009 (2014) from the resurgence perspective. As in the double well potential case, we found that the largest contribution is given by the diagrams originating from the Jacobian. We again observe that in the three-loop case individual Feynman diagrams contain irrational contributions, while their sum does not.

abstract: We study numerically the wavefunction evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a Bunimovich stadium billiard being governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We show that for a moderate nonlinearity, above a certain threshold, there is emergence of dynamical thermalization which leads to the Bose-Einstein probability distribution over the linear eigenmodes of the stadium. This distribution is drastically different from the energy equipartition over oscillator degrees of freedom which would lead to the ultra-violet catastrophe. We argue that this interesting phenomenon can be studied in cold atom experiments.

abstract: Long-range order in quantum many-body systems is usually associated with equilibrium situations. Here, we experimentally investigate the quasicondensation of strongly-interacting bosons at finite momenta in a far-from-equilibrium case. We prepare an inhomogeneous initial state consisting of one-dimensional Mott insulators in the center of otherwise empty one-dimensional chains in an optical lattice with a lattice constant $d$. After suddenly quenching the trapping potential to zero, we observe the onset of coherence in spontaneously forming quasicondensates in the lattice. Remarkably, the emerging phase order differs from the ground-state order and is characterized by peaks at finite momenta $\pm (\pi/2) (\hbar / d)$ in the momentum distribution function.

abstract: We observe Wannier-Stark localization in curved photonic lattices, realized using arrays of evanescently coupled optical waveguides. By correctly tuning the strength of inter-site coupling in the lattice, we observe that Wannier-Stark states become increasingly localized, and eventually fully localized to one site, as the curvature of the lattice is increased. We then demonstrate that tunneling can be successfully restored in the lattice by applying a sinusoidal modulation to the lattice position, an effect that is a direct analogue of photon-assisted tunneling. This precise tuning of the tunneling matrix elements, through laser-fabricated on-site modulations, opens a novel route for the creation of gauge fields in photonic lattices.

This system is ideal for performing high-precision molecular spectroscopy with applications in astrochemistry and fundamental physics. Here we show that this same system can be coupled with a broadband laser to discover new molecular transitions. We use three-ion chains of Ca$^{+}$ and CaH$^{+}$ to observe vibrational transitions via resonance enhanced multiphoton dissociation detected by Ca$^{+}$ fluorescence. Based on theoretical calculations, we assign the observed peaks to the transition from the ground vibrational state, $\nu=0$, to $\nu=9$ and $\nu=10$. Our method allows us to track single molecular events, and it can be extended to work with any molecule by using normal mode frequency shifts to detect the dissociation. This survey spectroscopy serves as a bridge to the precision spectroscopy required for molecular ion control.

abstract: It shown that the five Regge transformations act as a spectrometric splitter on any 6-j symbol. Four unknown partitions are brought out: S4(0), S4(1), S(2) and S4(5). They are stable subsets, with well defined parameters depending only on triangles and quadrangles. These findings are easily generalized to super 6-jS symbols, properly labelled by their own parity alpha, beta, gamma. Super Regge symmetry is reduced only for beta where S4(2), S4(5) vanish. In addition, all tools for computing exact values of any 6-jS are provided.

abstract: The prospect of coherent dynamics and excitonic delocalization across several light-harvesting structures in photosynthetic membranes is of considerable interest, but challenging to explore experimentally. Here we demonstrate theoretically that the excitonic delocalization across extended domains involving several light-harvesting complexes can lead to unambiguous signatures in the optical response, specifically, linear absorption spectra. We characterize, under experimentally established conditions of molecular assembly and protein-induced inhomogeneities, the optical absorption in these arrays from polarized and unpolarized excitation, and demonstrate that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the coherent coupling among iso-energetic light-harvesting structures. The knowledge of these couplings would then provide further insight into the dynamical properties of transfer, such as facilitating the accurate determination of F\"orster rates.

abstract: In this article we have developed a formalism to obtain the Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation for a particle in a frame undergoing an uniform acceleration in an otherwise flat Minkowski space-time geometry. We have presented an exact solution of the equation and obtained the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues. It has been observed that the Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation can be reduced to an one dimensional hydrogen atom problem. Whereas, the quantized energy levels are exactly identical with that of an one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Hence considering transitions, we have predicted the existence of a new kind of quanta, which will either be emitted or absorbed if the particles get excited or de-excited respectively.

abstract: The results of a study of Dirac's Hamiltonian for a point electron in the zero-gravity Kerr--Newman spacetime are reported; here, "zero-gravity" means G to 0, where G is Newton's constant of universal gravitation, and the limit is effected in the Boyer--Lindquist coordinate chart of the maximal analytically extended, topologically nontrivial, Kerr--Newman spacetime. In a nutshell, the results are: the essential self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian; the reflection symmetry about zero of its spectrum; the location of the essential spectrum, exhibiting a gap about zero; and (under two smallness assumptions on some parameters) the existence of a point spectrum in this gap, corresponding to bound states of Dirac's point electron in the electromagnetic field of the zero-G Kerr--Newman ring singularity. The symmetry result of the spectrum extends to Dirac's Hamiltonian for a point electron in a generalization of the zero-G Kerr--Newman spacetime with different ratio of electric-monopole to magnetic-dipole moment. The results are discussed in the context of the general-relativistic Hydrogen problem. Also, some interesting projects for further inquiry are listed in the last section.

abstract: The understanding of molecular structure and function is at the very heart of the chemical and molecular sciences. Experiments that allow for the creation of structurally pure samples and the investigation of their molecular dynamics and chemical function have developed tremendously over the last few decades, although "there's plenty of room at the bottom" for better control as well as further applications. Here, we describe the use of inhomogeneous electric fields for the manipulation of neutral molecules in the gas-phase, \ie, for the separation of complex molecules according to size, structural isomer, and quantum state. For these complex molecules, all quantum states are strong-field seeking, requiring dynamic fields for their confinement. Current applications of these controlled samples are summarised and interesting future applications discussed.

abstract: We study the transmission probability in an AB-stacked bilayer graphene of Dirac fermions scattered by a double barrier structure in the presence of a magnetic field. We take into account the full four bands of the energy spectrum and use the boundary conditions to determine the transmission probability. Our numerical results show that for energies higher than the interlayer coupling, four ways for transmission probabilities are possible while for energies less than the height of the barrier, Dirac fermions exhibits transmission resonances and only one transmission channel is available. We show that, for AB-stacked bilayer graphene, there is no Klein tunneling at normal incident. We find that the transmission displays sharp peaks inside the transmission gap around the Dirac point within the barrier regions while they are absent around the Dirac point in the well region. The effect of the magnetic field, interlayer electrostatic potential and various barrier geometry parameters on the transmission probabilities are also discussed.

abstract: Although the general theory macroscopic quantum entanglement of is still in its infancy, consideration of the matter in the framework of action-at-a distance electrodynamics predicts for the random dissipative processes observability of the advanced nonlocal correlations. These correlations were really revealed in our previous experiments with some large-scale heliogeophysical processes as the source ones and the lab detectors as the probe ones. Recently a new experiment has been performing on the base of Baikal Deep Water Neutrino Observatory. The thick water layer is an excellent shield against any local impacts on the detectors. The first annual series 2012/2013 has demonstrated that detector signals respond to the heliogeophysical processes and causal connection of the signals directed downwards: from the Earth surface to the Baikal floor. But this nonlocal connection proved to be in reverse time. In addition advanced nonlocal correlation of the detector signal with the regional source-process: the random component of hydrological activity in the upper layer was revealed and the possibility of its forecast on nonlocal correlations was demonstrated. But the strongest macroscopic nonlocal correlations are observed at extremely low frequencies, that is at periods of several months. Therefore the above results should be verified in a longer experiment. We verify them by data of the second annual series 2013/2014 of the Baikal experiment. All the results have been confirmed, although some quantitative parameters of correlations and time reversal causal links turned out different due to nonstationarity of the source-processes. A new result is displaying of the advanced response of nonlocal correlation detector to the earthquake. This opens up the prospect of the earthquake forecast on the new physical principle, although further confirmation in the next events is certainly needed.

abstract: Magnetized neutron stars constitute a special class of compact objects harbouring gravitational fields that deviate strongly from the Newtonian weak field limit. Moreover strong electromagnetic fields anchored into the star give rise to non-linear corrections to Maxwell equations described by quantum electrodynamics (QED). Electromagnetic fields close to or above the critical value of $\BQ=4.4\times10^9$~T are probably present in some pulsars and for most of the magnetars. To account properly for emission emanating from the neutron star surface like for instance thermal radiation and its polarization properties, it is important to include general relativistic (GR) effects simultaneously with non-linear electrodynamics. This can be achieved through a 3+1 formalism known in general relativity and that incorporates QED perturbations to Maxwell equations. Starting from the lowest order corrections to the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field, as given for instance by Born-Infeld or Euler-Heisenberg theory, we derive the non-linear Maxwell equations in general relativity including quantum vacuum effects. We also derive a prescription for the force-free limit and show that these equations can be solved with classical finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. It is therefore straightforward to include general relativity and quantum electrodynamics in the description of neutron star magnetospheres by using standard classical numerical techniques borrowed from Maxwell and Newton theory. As an application, we show that spin-down luminosity corrections associated to QED effects are negligible with respect to GR corrections.

abstract: The black hole firewall conjecture is based on Page curve hypothesis, which claims that entanglement between black hole and Hawking radiation is almost maximum. The hypothesis is inspired by Lubkin-Lloyd-Pagels-Page theorem for degenerate systems with zero Hamiltonian. Adopting canonical typicality for nondegenerate systems with nonvanishing Hamiltonians, the entanglement becomes nonmaximal,and energetic singularities (firewalls) do not emerge for general systems. For static thermal pure states of black hole and Hawking radiation, entanglement entropy equals thermal entropy of the smaller system.

abstract: As relative systematic frequency uncertainties in trapped-ion spectroscopy are approaching the low $10^{-18}$ range, motional frequency shifts account for a considerable fraction of the uncertainty budget. Micromotion, a driven motion fundamentally connected to the principle of the Paul trap, is a particular concern in these systems. In this article, we experimentally investigate at this level three common methods for minimizing and determining the micromotion amplitude. We develop a generalized model for a quantitative application of the photon-correlation technique, which is applicable in the commonly encountered regime where the transition linewidth is comparable to the rf drive frequency. We show that a fractional frequency uncertainty due to the 2nd-order Doppler shift below $1\times 10^{-20}$ can be achieved. The quantitative evaluation is verified in an interleaved measurement with the conceptually simpler resolved sideband method. If not performed deep within the Lamb-Dicke regime, a temperature-dependent offset at the level of $10^{-19}$ is observed in resolved sideband measurements due to sampling of intrinsic micromotion. By direct comparison with photon-correlation measurements, we show that the simple to implement parametric heating method is sensitive to micromotion at the level of $1\times 10^{-20}$ as well.

Using adiabatic elimination and numerical simulations with matrix product states, we show how strong interactions significantly slow down the relaxation dynamics (with the emergence of a new time scale) and can alter the properties of the steady state. We also show that steady state properties are completely different depending on the order in which the limits of infinite time and infinite interaction are taken.

abstract: The Shale-Stinespring Theorem (1965) together with Ruijsenaar's criterion (1977) provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the implementability of the evolution of external field quantum electrodynamics between constant-time hyperplanes on standard Fock space. The assertion states that an implementation is possible if and only if the spacial components of the external electromagnetic four-vector potential $A_\mu$ are zero. We generalize this result to smooth, space-like Cauchy surfaces and, for general $A_\mu$, show how the second-quantized Dirac evolution can always be implemented as a map between varying Fock spaces. Furthermore, we give equivalence classes of polarizations, including an explicit representative, that give rise to those admissible Fock spaces. We prove that the polarization classes only depend on the tangential components of $A_\mu$ w.r.t. the particular Cauchy surface, and show that they behave naturally under Lorentz and gauge transformations.

abstract: Manipulating energy levels while controlling the electron localization is an essential step for many applications of confined systems. In this paper we demonstrate how to achieve electron localization and induce energy level oscillation in one-dimensional quantum systems by externally controlling the deformation of the system. From a practical point of view, the one-dimensional potentials can be realized using layered structures. In the analysis, we considered three different examples. The first one is a graded quantum well between confining infinite walls where the deformation is modeled by varying slightly the graded well. The second systems is a symmetric multiple quantum well between infinite walls under the effect of biasing voltage. The third system is a layered 2D hybrid perovskites where pressure is used to induce deformation. The calculations are conducted both numerically and analytically using the perturbation theory. It is shown that the obtained oscillations are associated with level avoided crossings and that the deformation results in changing the spatial localization of the electrons.

abstract: Ultracold gases promise access to many-body quantum phenomena at convenient length and time scales. However, it is unclear whether the entropy of these gases is low enough to realize many phenomena relevant to condensed matter physics, such as quantum magnetism. Here we report reliable single-shot temperature measurements of a degenerate $^{87}$Rb gas by imaging the momentum distribution of thermalized magnons, which are spin excitations of the atomic gas. We record average temperatures as low as $0.022(1)_\text{stat}(2)_\text{sys}$ times the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature, indicating an entropy per particle, $S/N\approx0.001\, k_B$ at equilibrium, that is well below the critical entropy for antiferromagnetic ordering of a Bose-Hubbard system. The magnons themselves can reduce the temperature of the system by absorbing energy during thermalization and by enhancing evaporative cooling, allowing low-entropy gases to be produced within deep traps.

abstract: Thermodynamics describes large-scale, slowly evolving systems. Two modern approaches generalize thermodynamics: fluctuation theorems, which concern finite-time nonequilibrium processes, and one-shot statistical mechanics, which concerns small scales and finite numbers of trials. Combining these approaches, we calculate a one-shot analog of the average dissipated work defined in fluctuation contexts: the cost of performing a protocol in finite time instead of quasistatically. The average dissipated work has been shown to be proportional to a relative entropy between phase-space densities, one between quantum states, and one between probability distributions over possible values of work. We derive one-shot analogs of all three equations, demonstrating that the order-infinity R\'enyi divergence is proportional to the maximum dissipated work in each case. These one-shot analogs of fluctuation-theorem results contribute to the unification of these two toolkits for small-scale, nonequilibrium statistical physics.

abstract: The infinite Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (iDMRG) algorithm is a highly successful numerical algorithm for the study of low-dimensional quantum systems, and is also frequently used to initialise the more popular finite DMRG algorithm. Implementations of both finite and infinite DMRG frequently incorporate support for the protection and exploitation of symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In common with other variational tensor network algorithms, convergence of iDMRG to the ground state is not guaranteed, with the risk that the algorithm may become stuck in a local minimum. In this paper I demonstrate the existence of a particularly harmful class of physically irrelevant local minima affecting both iDMRG and to a lesser extent also infinite Time-Evolving Block Decimation (iTEBD), for which the ground state is compatible with the protected symmetries of the Hamiltonian but cannot be reached using the conventional iDMRG or iTEBD algorithms. I describe a modified iDMRG algorithm which evades these local minima, and which also admits a natural interpretation on topologically ordered systems with a boundary.

abstract: We study the localization problem of one-dimensional interacting spinless fermions in an incommensurate optical lattice, which changes from an extended phase to a nonergoic many-body localized phase by increasing the strength of the incommensurate potential. We identify that there exists an intermediate regime before the system enters the many-body localized phase, in which both the localized and extended many-body states coexist, thus the system is divided into three different phases, which can be characterized by normalized participation ratios of the many-body eigenstates and distributions of natural orbitals of the corresponding one-particle density matrix. This is very different from its noninterating limit, in which all eigenstaes undergo a delocaliztion-localization transtion when the strength of the incommensurate potential exceeds a critical value.

abstract: The possibility of realizing bosonic fractional quantum Hall effect in ultra-cold atomic systems suggests a new route to producing and manipulating anyons, by introducing auxiliary bosons of a different species that capture quasiholes and thus inherit their non-trivial braiding properties. States with localized quasiholes at any desired locations can be obtained by annihilating the auxiliary bosons at those locations. We explore how this method can be used to generate non-Abelian quasiholes of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state for bosons at filling factor $\nu=1$. We show that a Hamiltonian with an appropriate three-body interaction can produce two-quasihole states in two distinct fusion channels of the topological "qubit." Characteristics of these states that are related to the non-Abelian nature can be probed and verified by a measurement of the effective relative angular momentum of the auxiliary bosons, which is directly related to their pair distribution function. Moore-Read states of more than two quasiholes can also be produced in a similar fashion. We investigate some issues related to the experimental feasibility of this approach, in particular, how large the systems should be for a realization of this physics and to what extent this physics carries over to systems with the more standard two-body contact interaction.

abstract: We report the design and implementation of a complete electronics platform for conducting a quantum optics experiment that will be operated on board a 1U CubeSat (a 10 x 10 x 10 cm satellite). The quantum optics experiment is designed to produce polarization-entangled photon pairs using non-linear optical crystals and requires opto-electronic components such as a pump laser, single photon detectors and liquid crystal based polarization rotators in addition to passive optical elements. The platform provides mechanical support for the optical assembly. It also communicates autonomously with the host satellite to provide experiment data for transmission to a ground station. A limited number of commands can be transmitted from ground to the platform enabling it to switch experimental modes. This platform requires less than 1.5W for all operations, and is space qualified. The implementation of this electronics platform is a major step on the road to operating quantum communication experiments using nanosatellites.

abstract: Lieb-Liniger model describes bosons with contact interactions in one-dimensional space. In the limit of weak repulsive particle interactions, there are two types of low lying excitation spectrum. The first is reproduced by the Bogoliubov dispersion relation, the other is believed to correspond to dark soliton excitations. While there are various evidences that the type II spectrum is related to dark solitons, it has not been shown that measurements of positions of particles reveal dark soliton density profiles. Here, we employ the Bethe ansatz approach and show that dark solitons emerge in the measurement process if the system is prepared in an eigenstate corresponding to the type II spectrum. We analyze single and double dark solitons as well as weak and strong interaction regime.

abstract: Spin-orbit coupled bosons can exhibit rich equilibrium phases at low temperature and in the presence of particle-particle interactions. In the case with a 1D synthetic spin-orbit interaction, it has been observed that the ground state of a Bose gas can be a normal phase, stripe phase, or magnetized phase in different experimentally controllable parameter regimes. The magnetized states are doubly degenerate and consist of a many-particle two-state system. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics by switching on an external perturbation to induce resonant couplings between the magnetized phases, and predict the novel quantum spin dynamics which cannot be obtained in the single-particle systems. In particular, due to particle-particle interactions, the transition of the Bose condensate from one magnetized phase to the other is forbidden when the strength of external perturbation is less than a critical value, and a full transition can occur only when the perturbation exceeds such critical strength. This phenomenon manifests itself a quantum dynamical phase transition, with the critical point behavior being exactly solvable. From the numerical simulations and exact analytic studies we show that the predicted many-body effects can be well observed with the current experiments.

abstract: We report the theoretical analysis for tuning the quantum efficiency of solid state random lasers. Vollhardt-Woelfle theory of photonic transport in disordered non-conserving and open random media, is coupled to lasing dynamics and solved positionally dependent. The interplay of non-linearity and homogeneous non-radiative frequency conversion by means of a Stokes-shift leads to a reduction of the quantum efficiency of the random laser. At the threshold a strong decrease of the spot-size in the stationary state is found due to the increase of non-radiative losses. The coherently emitted photon number per unit of modal surface is also strongly reduced. This result allows for the conclusion that Stokes-shifts are not sufficient to explain confined and extended mode regimes.

For different choices of the Hamiltonian parameters we get different currents dynamics. We generalize the Heisenberg equation of motion to write the second derivative of an operator.

abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems provide an important window onto the influence of particle statistics on collective behaviour, with the prototypical system being the two-leg ladder. Particle statistics in two dimensions are particularly rich, admitting not only bosonic and fermionic but also anyonic excitations, and while the behaviours of fermions and hard-core bosons on the ladder are well understood, the same cannot be said about anyons. Numerical analysis of the hard-core $\mathbb{Z}_3$ anyon model on the two-rung ladder reveals a rich phase diagram clearly distinct from both the fermionic and bosonic cases, including a novel Cooper triplet superfluid phase. Qualitative predictions are extrapolated for the phase diagrams of all integer Abelian anyon models $\{\mathbb{Z}_q~|~q\in\mathbb{Z}^+\}$.

abstract: We report the generation of high-purity twin photon pairs through cavity-enhanced non-degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in a high-Q silicon microdisk resonator. Twin photon pairs are created within the same cavity mode and are consequently expected to be identical in all degrees of freedom. The device is able to produce twin photons at telecommunication wavelengths with a pair generation rate as large as $(3.96\pm0.03)\times10^5 ~{\rm pairs/s}$, within a narrow bandwidth of 0.72 GHz. A coincidence-to-accidental ratio of $660\pm62$ was measured, the highest value reported to date for twin photon pairs, at a pair generation rate of $(2.47\pm0.04)\times10^4 ~{\rm pairs/s}$. Through careful engineering of the dispersion matching window, we have reduced the ratio of photons resulting from degenerate FWM to non-degenerate FWM to less than 0.15.

abstract: The Compton wavelength gives the minimum radius within which the mass of a particle may be localized due to quantum effects, while the Schwarzschild radius gives the maximum radius within which the mass of a black hole may be localized due to classial gravity. In a mass-radius diagram, the two lines intersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects become significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is based on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie relations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$. It is unclear what physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $E \gg m_Pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\lambda \ll l_P$ or time periods $T \ll t_P$ in the standard theory. We therefore propose a correction to the standard de Broglie relations, which gives rise to a modified Schr{\" o}dinger equation and a modified expression for the Compton wavelength, which may be extended into the region $E \gg m_Pc^2$. For the proposed modification, we recover the expression for the Schwarzschild radius for $E \gg m_Pc^2$ and the usual Compton formula for $E \ll m_Pc^2$. The sign of the inequality obtained from the uncertainty principle reverses at $m \approx m_P$, so that the Compton wavelength and event horizon size may be interpreted as minimum and maximum radii, respectively. We interpret the additional terms in the modified de Broglie relations as representing the self-gravitation of the wave packet.

abstract: There is growing experimental interest in coupling cavity photons to the cyclotron resonance excitations of electron liquids in high-mobility semiconductor quantum wells or graphene sheets. These media offer unique platforms to carry out fundamental studies of exciton-polariton condensation and cavity quantum electrodynamics in a regime in which electron-electron (e-e) interactions are expected to play a pivotal role. Focusing on graphene, we present a theoretical study of the impact of e-e interactions on a quantum Hall polariton fluid (QHPF), i.e. a fluid of magneto-excitons resonantly coupled to cavity photons. We show that e-e interactions are responsible for an instability of graphene integer QHPFs towards a crystalline phase. We demonstrate that this phase can be detected by measuring the collective excitation spectra, which soften at a characteristic wave vector of the order of the inverse magnetic length.

abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of a translationally invariant quantum spin chain, based on the East kinetically constrained glass model, in search for evidence of many-body localisation in the absence of disorder. Numerical simulations indicate a change, controlled by a coupling parameter, from a regime of fast relaxation---corresponding to thermalisation---to a regime of very slow relaxation. This slowly relaxing regime is characterised by dynamical features usually associated with non-ergodicity and many-body localisation (MBL): memory of initial conditions, logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, and non-exponential decay of time-correlators. We show that slow relaxation is a consequence of sensitivity to spatial fluctuations in the initial state. While numerics indicate that certain relaxation timescales grow markedly with size, our finite size results are consistent both with an MBL transition, expected to only occur in disordered systems, or with a pronounced quasi-MBL crossover.

abstract: We demonstrate an area law bound on the ground state entanglement entropy of a wide class of gapless quantum states of matter using a strategy called local entanglement thermodynamics. The bound depends only on thermodynamic data, actually a single exponent, the hyper-scaling violation exponent $\theta$. All systems in $d$ spatial dimensions obeying our scaling assumptions and with $\theta < d-1$ obey the area law, while systems with $\theta = d-1$ can violate the area law at most logarithmically. We also discuss the case of frustration-free Hamiltonians and show that to violate the area law more than logarithmically these systems must have an unusually large number of low energy states. Finally, we make contact with the recently proposed $s$-source framework and argue that $\theta$ and $s$ are related by $s=2^\theta$.

abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a planar silicon photonic crystal cavity in which large position-squared optomechanical coupling is realized. The device consists of a double-slotted photonic crystal structure in which motion of a central beam mode couples to two high-Q optical modes localized around each slot. Electrostatic tuning of the structure is used to controllably hybridize the optical modes into supermodes which couple in a quadratic fashion to the motion of the beam. From independent measurements of the anti-crossing of the optical modes and of the optical spring effect, the position-squared vacuum coupling rate is measured to be as large as 245 Hz to the fundamental in-plane mechanical resonance of the structure at 8.7MHz, which in displacement units corresponds to a coupling coefficient of 1 THz/nm$^2$. This level of position-squared coupling is approximately five orders of magnitude larger than in conventional Fabry-Perot cavity systems.

abstract: Motivated by the ideas of analogue gravity, we have performed experiments in a flume where an analogue White Hole horizon is generated, in the form of a wave blocking region, by suitably tuned uniform fluid (water) flow and counter-propagating shallow water waves. We corroborate earlier experimental observations by finding a critical wave frequency for a particular discharge above which the waves are effectively blocked beyond the horizon. An obstacle, in the form of a bottom wave, is introduced to generate a sharp blocking zone. All previous researchers used this obstacle. A novel part of our experiment is where we do not introduce the obstacle and find that wave blocking still takes place, albeit in a more diffused zone. Lastly we replace the fixed bottom wave obstacle by a movable sand bed to study the sediment transport and the impact of the horizon or wave blocking phenomenon on the sediment profile. We find signatures of the wave blocking zone in the ripple pattern.

abstract: Two-point functions, the mean field squared and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are investigated for the electromagnetic field in the geometry of parallel plates on background of $(D+1)$% -dimensional dS spacetime. We assume that the field is prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and on the plates a boundary condition is imposed that is a generalization of the perfectly conducting boundary condition for an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. It is shown that for $D\geq 4$ the background gravitational field essentially changes the behavior of the VEVs at separations between the plates larger than the curvature radius of dS spacetime. At large separations, the Casimir forces are proportional to the inverse fourth power of the distance for all values of spatial dimension $D\geq 3$. For $D\geq 4$ this behavior is in sharp contrast with the case of plates in Minkowski bulk where the force decays as the inverse $(D+1)$th power of the distance.

abstract: Quantum dots in cavities have been shown to be very bright sources of indistinguishable single photons. Yet the quantum interference between two bright quantum dot sources, a critical step for photon based quantum computation, has never been investigated. Here we report on such a measurement, taking advantage of a deterministic fabrication of the devices. We show that cavity quantum electrodynamics can efficiently improve the quantum interference between remote quantum dot sources: poorly indistinguishable photons can still interfere with good contrast with high quality photons emitted by a source in the strong Purcell regime. Our measurements and calculations show that cavity quantum electrodynamics is a powerful tool for interconnecting several devices.

abstract: Henri Poincar\'e formulated the mathematics of the Lorentz transformations, known as the Poincar\'e group. He also formulated the Poincar\'e sphere for polarization optics. It is noted that his sphere contains the symmetry of the Lorentz group applicable to the momentum-energy four-vector of a particle in the Lorentz-covariant world. Since the particle mass is a Lorentz-invariant quantity, the Lorentz group does not allow its variations. However, the Poincar\'e sphere contains the symmetry corresponding to the mass variation, leading to the $O(3,2)$ symmetry. An illustrative calculation is given.

abstract: Recently much effort has been made towards the introduction of non-Hermitian random matrix models respecting $PT$-symmetry. Here we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between complex $PT$-symmetric matrices and split-complex and split-quaternionic versions of Hermitian matrices. We introduce two new random matrix ensembles of (a) Gaussian split-complex Hermitian, and (b) Gaussian split-quaternionic Hermitian matrices, of arbitrary sizes. They are related to the split signature versions of the complex and the quaternionic numbers, respectively. We conjecture that these ensembles represent universality classes for $PT$-symmetric matrices. For the case of $2\times2$ matrices we derive analytic expressions for the joint probability distributions of the eigenvalues, the one-level densities and the level spacings in the case of real eigenvalues.

abstract: We initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for conformal field theory states with smooth holographic dual geometries. For 2, 3, and 4 regions, we prove that the strong subadditivity and the monogamy of mutual information give the complete set of inequalities. This is in contrast to the situation for generic quantum systems, where a complete set of entropy inequalities is not known for 4 or more regions. We also find an infinite new family of inequalities applicable to 5 or more regions. The set of all holographic entropy inequalities bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces. We find that, for a fixed number of regions, there are only finitely many independent entropy inequalities. To establish new holographic entropy inequalities, we introduce a combinatorial proof technique that may also be of independent interest in Riemannian geometry and graph theory.

abstract: We investigate capacitively coupled two-qubit quantum gates based on quantum dots. For exchange-only coded qubits electron spin $S$ and its projection $S_z$ are exact quantum numbers. Capacitive coupling between qubits, as distinct from interqubit exchange, preserves these quantum numbers. We prove, both analytically and numerically, that conservation of the spins of individual qubits has dramatic effect on performance of two-qubit gates. By varying the level splittings of individual qubits, $J_a$ and $J_b$, and the interqubit coupling time $t$, we can find an infinite number of triples $(J_a, J_b, t)$ for which the two-qubit entanglement, in combination with appropriate single-qubit rotations, can produce an exact CNOT gate. This statement is true for practically arbitrary magnitude and form of capacitive interqubit coupling. Our findings promise a large decrease in the number of nonlocal (two-qubit) operations in quantum circuits.

We also discuss the connection between the SSD in the continuous space and its lattice version, where the geometric correction due to the real-space deformation plays an important role in relating the eigenstates of the lattice SSD with those of the continuous SSD.

abstract: We predict a dynamical bistability in the photon emission from a solid-state single-atom laser comprised of a microwave cavity coupled to a voltage-biased double quantum dot. The switching rates of the bistability can be extracted from the average electrical current and the shot noise in the quantum dots. Using large-deviation techniques we demonstrate that the full counting statistics of emitted photons is captured by the universal shape of a tilted ellipse whose form can be controlled by modulating the electronic transport in the quantum dots. Our prediction is robust against moderate electronic decoherence and dephasing due to phonons and may be tested using current technology.

We study the energy spectrum of graphene quantum dot (QD) defined by electrostatic gates. We give discussions of our results based on different physical settings, whether the cyclotron frequency is similar or larger/smaller compared to the oscillator frequency. This defines an effective magnetic field that produces the effective quantized Landau levels. We study analytically such field in gate-tunable graphene QD and show that our structure allow us to control the valley degeneracy. Finally, we compare our results with already published work and also discuss the possible applications of such QD.

This paper discusses Rupp's fraud, the relation between Albert Einstein and Rupp, and the Einstein-Rupp experiments, and argues that these experiments were an influence on Niels Bohr's development of complementarity and Werner Heisenberg's formulation of the uncertainty relations.

abstract: We propose to accurately determine the orbital magnetic moment of the electron by measuring, in a Magneto-Optical or Ion trap, the ratio of the Lande g-factors in two atomic states. From the measurement of (gJ1/gJ2), the quantity A, which depends on the corrections to the electron g-factors can be extracted, if the states are LS coupled. Given that highly accurate values of the correction to the spin g-factor are currently available, accurate values of the correction to the orbital g-factor may also be determined. At present, (-1.8 +/- 0.4) x 10-4 has been determined as a correction to the electron orbital g-factor, by using earlier measurements of the ratio gJ1/gJ2, made on the Indium 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states.

abstract: Ground states of interacting QFTs are non-gaussian states, i.e. their connected n-point correlation functions do not vanish for n>2, in contrast to the free QFT case. We show that when the ground state of an interacting QFT evolves under a free massive QFT for a long time (a scenario that can be realised by a Quantum Quench), the connected correlation functions decay and all local physical observables equilibrate to values that are given by a gaussian density matrix that keeps memory only of the two-point initial correlation function. The argument hinges upon the fundamental physical principle of cluster decomposition, which is valid for the ground state of a general QFT. An analogous result was already known to be valid in the case of d=1 spatial dimensions, where it is a special case of the so-called Generalised Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) hypothesis, and we now generalise it to higher dimensions. Moreover in the case of massless free evolution, despite the fact that the evolution may not lead to equilibration but unbounded increase of correlations with time instead, the GGE gives correctly the leading order asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions in the thermodynamic and large time limit. The demonstration is performed in the context of bosonic relativistic QFT, but the arguments apply more generally.

abstract: We present a brief overview of some key concepts in the theory of generalised complex manifolds. This new geometry interpolates, so to speak, between symplectic geometry and complex geometry. As such it provides an ideal framework to analyse thermodynamical fluctuation theory in the presence of gravitational fields. To illustrate the usefulness of generalised complex geometry, we examine a simplified version of the Unruh effect: the thermalising effect of gravitational fields on the Schroedinger wavefunction.
