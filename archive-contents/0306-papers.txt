abstract: Bipartite correlations in multi-qubit systems cannot be shared freely. The presence of entanglement or classical correlation on certain pairs of qubits may imply correlations on other pairs. We present a method of characterization of bi-partite correlations in multi-qubit systems using a concept of entangled graphs that has been introduced in our earlier work [M.Plesch and V.Buzek, Phys. Rev. A 67, 012322 (2003)]. In entangled graphs each qubit is represented by a vertex while the entanglement and classical correlations are represented by two types of edges. We prove by construction that any entangled graph with classical correlations can be represented by a mixed state of N qubits. However, not all entangled graphs with classical correlations can be represented by a pure state.

abstract: A direct classical analog of the quantum dynamics of intrinsic decoherence in Hamiltonian systems, characterized by the time dependence of the linear entropy of the reduced density operator, is introduced. The similarities and differences between the classical and quantum decoherence dynamics of an initial quantum state are exposed using both analytical and computational results. In particular, the classicality of early-time intrinsic decoherence dynamics is explored analytically using a second-order perturbative treatment, and an interesting connection between decoherence rates and the stability nature of classical trajectories is revealed in a simple approximate classical theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics. The results offer new insights into decoherence, dynamics of quantum entanglement, and quantum chaos.

abstract: We constructed a Hilbert space representation of a contextual Kolmogorov model. This representation is based on two fundamental observables -- in the standard quantum model these are position and momentum observables. This representation has all distinguishing features of the quantum model. Thus in spite all ``No-Go'' theorems (e.g., von Neumann, Kochen and Specker,..., Bell) we found the realist basis for quantum mechanics. Our representation is not standard model with hidden variables. In particular, this is not a reduction of quantum model to the classical one. Moreover, we see that such a reduction is even in principle impossible. This impossibility is not a consequence of a mathematical theorem but it follows from the physical structure of the model. By our model quantum states are very rough images of domains in the space of fundamental parameters - PRESPACE. Those domains represent complexes of physical conditions. By our model both classical and quantum physics describe REDUCTION of PRESPACE-INFORMATION. Quantum mechanics is not complete. In particular, there are prespace contexts which can be represented only by a so called hyperbolic quantum model. We predict violations of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and existence of dispersion free states.

abstract: As an ensemble scheme of solid-state NMR quantum computers the extension of Kane's many-qubits silicon scheme based on the array of 31 P donor atoms are spaced lengthwise of the strip gates is considered. The possible planar topology of such ensemble quantum computer is suggested. The estimation of the output NMR signal was performed and it was shown that for the number N>=10^5 of ensemble elements involving L~10^3 qubits each, the standard NMR methods are usable. As main mechanisms of decoherence for low temperature (<0.1K), the adiabatic processes of random modulation of qubit resonance frequency determined by secular part of nuclear spin hyperfine interaction with electron magnetic moment of basic atom and dipole-dipole interaction with nuclear moments of neighboring impurity atoms was considered, It was made estimations of allowed concentrations of magnetic impurities and of spin temperature whereby the required decoherence suppression is obtained. Semiclassical decoherence model of two qubit entangled states is also presented. As another variant of the solid-state ensemble quantum computer, the gateless architecture of cellular-automaton with antiferromagnetically ordered electron spins is also discussed here.

abstract: In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, path integrals are normally derived from the Schroedinger equation. This assumes the two formalisms are equivalent. Since time plays a very different role in the Schroedinger equation and in path integrals, this may not be the case. We here derive path integrals directly by imposing two requirements: correct behavior in the classical limit and the most complete practicable symmetry between time and space. With these requirements, the path integral formalism predicts quantum fluctuations over the time dimension analogous to the quantum fluctuations seen over the three space dimensions. For constant potentials there is no effect. But the coupling between rapidly varying electromagnetic fields and the quantum fluctuations in time should be detectable. We consider a variation on the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which a particle with a non-zero electric dipole moment is sent through a rapidly varying electric field, oriented parallel to the particle's trajectory. The Schroedinger equation predicts changes to the precession frequency of the wave function about the trajectory but no physical splitting of the beam. With the approach here, path integrals predict the changes to the precession frequency and in addition that the beam will be split in velocity and time.

The fundamental formulae occurring in a supersymmetric approach to these Hamiltonians are consequences of some formulae concerning the general theory of associated special functions. We use this connection in order to obtain a general theory of Schrodinger equations exactly solvable in terms of associated special functions, and to extend certain results known in the case of some particular potentials.

Hence, the machinery of quantum mechanics can be applied to the statistical analysis of planar configurations of points. Various correspondences between point configurations and quantum states, such as linear superposition as well as unitary and stochastic evolution of shapes, are illustrated. In particular, a complete characterisation of shape eigenstates for an arbitrary number of points is given in terms of cyclotomic equations.

abstract: Our account of the problem of the classical limit of quantum mechanics involves two elements. The first one is self-induced decoherence, conceived as a process that depends on the own dynamics of a closed quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian with continuous spectrum; the study of decoherence is addressed by means of a formalism used to give meaning to the van Hove states with diagonal singularities. The second element is macroscopicity: when the macroscopic limit is applied to the Wigner transformation of the diagonal state resulting from decoherence, the description of the quantum system becomes equivalent to the description of an ensemble of classical trajectories on phase space weighted by their corresponding probabilities.

abstract: Individual members of an ensemble of identical systems coupled to a common probe can become entangled with one another, even when they do not interact directly. We investigate how this type of multipartite entanglement is generated in the context of a system consisting of two two-level atoms resonantly coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field. The dynamical evolution is studied in terms of the entanglements in the different bipartite partitions of the system, as quantified by the I-tangle. We also propose a generalization of the so-called residual tangle that quantifies the inherent three-body correlations in our tripartite system. This enables us to completely characterize the phenomenon of entanglement sharing in the case of the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model, a system of both theoretical and experimental interest.

abstract: We discuss the communication complexity of establishing a shared reference frame, in particular examining the case of aligning spatial axes via the exchange of spin-1/2 particles. Unlike previous work we allow for multiple rounds of communication, and we give several simple examples demonstrating that nontrivial tradeoffs between the number of rounds and the type of communication required exist. We then give an explicit protocol for aligning spatial axes via the exchange of spin-1/2 particles which makes no use of either exchanged entangled states or of joint measurements. Rather it works by performing a simple type of distributed quantum computation. To facilitate comparison with previous work, we show that this protocol achieves a worst case fidelity for the much studied problem of "direction finding" that is asymptotically equivalent (up to polylog factors) to the optimal average case fidelity achievable via a single forward communication of entangled states.

abstract: Typical circuit implementations of Shor's algorithm involve controlled rotation gates of magnitude $\pi/2^{2L}$ where $L$ is the binary length of the integer N to be factored. Such gates cannot be implemented exactly using existing fault-tolerant techniques. Approximating a given controlled $\pi/2^{d}$ rotation gate to within $\delta=O(1/2^{d})$ currently requires both a number of qubits and number of fault-tolerant gates that grows polynomially with $d$. In this paper we show that this additional growth in space and time complexity would severely limit the applicability of Shor's algorithm to large integers. Consequently, we study in detail the effect of using only controlled rotation gates with $d$ less than or equal to some $d_{\rm max}$. It is found that integers up to length $L_{\rm max} = O(4^{d_{\rm max}})$ can be factored without significant performance penalty implying that the cumbersome techniques of fault-tolerant computation only need to be used to create controlled rotation gates of magnitude $\pi/64$ if integers thousands of bits long are desired factored. Explicit fault-tolerant constructions of such gates are also discussed.

abstract: In a recent article, Ford, Lewis and O'Connell (PRA 64, 032101 (2001)) discuss a thought experiment in which a Brownian particle is subjected to a double-slit measurement. Analyzing the decay of the emerging interference pattern, they derive a decoherence rate that is much faster than previous results and even persists in the limit of vanishing dissipation. This result is based on the definition of a certain attenuation factor, which they analyze for short times. In this note, we point out that this attenuation factor captures the physics of decoherence only for times larger than a certain time t_mix, which is the time it takes until the two emerging wave packets begin to overlap. Therefore, the strategy of Ford et al of extracting the decoherence time from the regime t < t_mix is in our opinion not meaningful. If one analyzes the attenuation factor for t > t_mix, one recovers familiar behaviour for the decoherence time; in particular, no decoherence is seen in the absence of dissipation. The latter conclusion is confirmed with a simple calculation of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix.

abstract: Properties of entangled photon pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion are investigated in interference experiments. Strong energy correlations are demonstrated in a direct way. If a signal photon is detected behind a narrow spectral filter, then interference appears in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer placed in the route of the idler photon, even if the path difference in the interferometer exceeds the coherence length of the light. Narrow time correlations of the detection instants are demonstrated for the same photon-pair source using the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. Both these two effects may be exhibited only by an entangled state.

authors: Dominik Janzing, Thomas Beth
comments: 23 pages, 2 figures

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306023
abstract: We describe separable joint states on bipartite quantum systems that cannot be prepared by any thermodynamically reversible classical one-way communication protocol. We argue that the joint state of two synchronized microscopic clocks is always of this type when it is considered from the point of view of an ``ignorant'' observer who is not synchronized with the other two parties. We show that the entropy generation of a classical one-way synchronization protocol is at least \Delta S = \hbar^2/(4\Delta E \Delta t)^2 if \Delta t is the time accuracy of the synchronism and \Delta E is the energy bandwidth of the clocks. This dissipation can only be avoided if the common time of the microscopic clocks is stored by an additional classical clock. Furthermore, we give a similar bound on the entropy cost for resetting synchronized clocks by a classical one-way protocol. The proof relies on observations of Zurek on the thermodynamic relevance of quantum discord. We leave it as an open question whether classical multi-step protocols may perform better. We discuss to what extent our results imply problems for classical concepts of reversible computation when the energy of timing signals is close to the Heisenberg limit.

The possible role and the meaning of these extra observables is briefly indicated in this work. We also analyze the similarities and differences between non selective measurements and two-slit experiments in classical and quantum mechanics.

Bipartite pure entangled states are totally ordered under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) in the asymptotic limit and uniquely quantified by the well-known entropy of entanglement. However, we show that mixed entangled states are partially ordered under LOCC even in the asymptotic limit. Therefore, non-uniqueness of entanglement measure is understood on the basis of an operational notion of asymptotic convertibility.

abstract: A recent paper by Peshkin [1] has drawn attention again to the problem of understanding the spin statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Allen and Mondragon [2] has pointed out correctly some of the flaws in Peshkin's arguments which are based on the single valuedness under rotation of the wave functions of systems of identical particles. We examine carefully the claim that is made in the title of [2] that there can be ``no spin-statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics''. We show that we can derive the spin statistics connection for non-relativistic quantum field theories which have equations of motion of the Hamiltonian type based on SU(2) invariance of the Lagrangian. The formalism and machinary of non-relativistic quantum field theory as opposed to usual quantum mechanics is necessary for constructing our proof.

title: Implementation of generalized quantum measurements: superadditive quantum coding, accessible information extraction, and classical capacity limit

abstract: Quantum information theory predicts that when the transmission resource is doubled in quantum channels, the amount of information transmitted can be increased more than twice by quantum channel coding technique, whereas the increase is at most twice in classical information theory. This remarkable feature, the superadditive quantum coding gain, can be implemented by appropriate choices of code words and corresponding quantum decoding which requires a collective quantum measurement. Recently, the first experimental demonstration was reported [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 167906 (2003)]. The purpose of this paper is to describe our experiment in detail. Particularly, a design strategy of quantum collective decoding in physical quantum circuits is emphasized. We also address the practical implication of the gain on communication performance by introducing the quantum-classical hybrid coding scheme. We show how the superadditive quantum coding gain, even in a small code length, can boost the communication performance of conventional coding technique.

abstract: We continue our investigations of cavity QED with time dependent parameters. In this paper we discuss the situation where the state of the atoms leaving the cavity is reduced but the outcome is not recorded. In this case our knowledge is limited to an ensemble description of the results only. By applying the Demkov-Kunike level-crossing model, we show that even in this case, the filtering action of the interaction allows us to prepare a preassigned Fock state with good accuracy. The possibilities and limitations of the method are discussed and some relations to earlier work are presented.

abstract: It is common to model random errors in a classical measurement by the normal (Gaussian) distribution, because of the central limit theorem. In the quantum theory, the analogous hypothesis is that the matrix elements of the error in an observable are distributed normally. We obtain the probability distribution this implies for the outcome of a measurement, exactly for the case of 2x2 matrices and in the steepest descent approximation in general. Due to the phenomenon of `level repulsion', the probability distributions obtained are quite different from the Gaussian.

abstract: The surface impedance approach to the description of the thermal Casimir effect in the case of real metals is elaborated starting from the free energy of oscillators. The Lifshitz formula expressed in terms of the dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency is shown to be inapplicable in the frequency region where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the metal. The standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field on such frequencies meets difficulties when used as a model for the zero-point oscillations or thermal photons in the thermal equilibrium inside metals. Instead, the surface impedance permits not to consider the electromagnetic oscillations inside the metal but taking the realistic material properties into account by means of the effective boundary condition. An independent derivation of the Lifshitz-type formulas for the Casimir free energy and force between two metal plates is presented within the impedance approach. It is shown that they are free of the contradictions with thermodynamics which are specific to the usual Lifshitz formula for dielectrics in combination with the Drude model. We demonstrate that in the impedance approach the zero-frequency contribution is uniquely fixed by the form of impedance function and does not need any of the ad hoc prescriptions intensively discussed in the recent literature. As an example, the computations of the Casimir free energy between two gold plates are performed at different separations and temperatures. It is argued that the surface impedance approach lays a reliable framework for the future measurements of the thermal Casimir force.

abstract: When a measurement is made on a quantum system in which classical information is encoded, the measurement reduces the observers average Shannon entropy for the encoding ensemble. This reduction, being the {\em mutual information}, is always non-negative. For efficient measurements the state is also purified; that is, on average, the observers von Neumann entropy for the state of the system is also reduced by a non-negative amount. Here we point out that by re-writing a bound derived by Hall [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 55}, 100 (1997)], which is dual to the Holevo bound, one finds that for efficient measurements, the mutual information is bounded by the reduction in the von Neumann entropy. We also show that this result, which provides a physical interpretation for Hall's bound, may be derived directly from the Schumacher-Westmoreland-Wootters theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 3452 (1996)]. We discuss these bounds, and their relationship to another bound, valid for efficient measurements on pure state ensembles, which involves the subentropy.

abstract: Some PT-symmetric non-hermitean Hamiltonians have only real eigenvalues. There is numerical evidence that the associated PT-invariant energy eigenstates satisfy an unconventional completeness relation. An ad hoc scalar product among the states is positive definite only if a recently introduced `charge operator' is included in its definition. A simple derivation of the conjectured completeness and orthonormality relations is given. It exploits the fact that PT-symmetry provides an additional link between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and those of its adjoint, which form a dual pair of bases. The `charge operator' emerges naturally upon expressing the properties of the dual bases in terms of one basis only.

abstract: Motivated by the Peres-Horodecki criterion and the realignment criterion we develop a more powerful method to identify entangled states for any bipartite system through a universal construction of the witness operator. The method also gives a new family of positive but non-completely positive maps of arbitrary high dimensions which provide a much better test than the witness operators themselves. Moreover, we find there are two types of positive maps that can detect 2xN and 4xN bound entangled states. Since entanglement witnesses are physical observables and may be measured locally our construction could be of great significance for future experiments.

abstract: Quantum entanglement, perhaps the most non-classical manifestation of quantum information theory, cannot be used to transmit information between remote parties. Yet, it can be used to reduce the amount of communication required to process a variety of distributed computational tasks. We speak of pseudo-telepathy when quantum entanglement serves to eliminate the classical need to communicate. In earlier examples of pseudo-telepathy, classical protocols could succeed with high probability unless the inputs were very large. Here we present a simple multi-party distributed problem for which the inputs and outputs consist of a single bit per player, and we present a perfect quantum protocol for it. We prove that no classical protocol can succeed with a probability that differs from 1/2 by more than a fraction that is exponentially small in the number of players. This could be used to circumvent the detection loophole in experimental tests of nonlocality.

The corresponding quantum system, for a variety of system parameters and over long time scales, is shown to display energy absorption that is significantly faster than that associated with the underlying classical anomalous diffusion. The results are of interest to both areas of quantum chaos and quantum control.

abstract: In spite of many attempts, no local realistic model seems to be able to reproduce EPR-Bell type correlations, unless non ideal detection is allowed. The low efficiency of detectors in all experiments with photons makes the use of the fair sampling assumption unavoidable. However, since this very assumption is false in all existing local realistic models based on inefficient detection, we thus question its validity. We show that it is no more reasonable to assume fair sampling than it is impossible to test, and we actually propose an experimental test which would provides clear cut results in case of unfair sampling.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the quantum fluctuations of the fundamental field in the output of a nondegenerate second harmonic generation process occuring inside a laser cavity. Due to the nondegenerate character of the nonlinear medium, a field orthogonal to the laser field is for some operating conditions indepedent of the fluctuations produced by the laser medium. We show that this fact may lead to perfect squeezing for a certain polarization mode of the fundamental field. The experimental feasibility of the system is also discussed.

abstract: The irreversible motion of an open quantum system can be represented through an ensemble of state vectors following a stochastic dynamics with piecewise deterministic paths. It is shown that this representation leads to a natural definition of the rate of quantum entropy production. The entropy production rate is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropy and of the numbers of quantum jumps corresponding to the various decay channels of the open system. The proof of the positivity and of the convexity of the entropy production rate is given. Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic dynamics of a driven qubit and of a $\Lambda$-configuration involving a dark state are performed in order to illustrate the general theory.

As an application, we derive a new entanglement criterion for arbitrary mixed states of $n$ parties. The new criterion is weaker than the partial transposition criterion but offers advantages for the study of multipartite systems. A straightforward generalization of these invariants allows for the construction of a complete set of observable polynomial invariants.

We investigate and characterize the minimal combinatorics of the sharing of EPR pairs required amongst agents in a network for the creation of multi-partite entanglement. We also characterize the minimal combinatorics of agents in the creation of pure maximal multi-partite entanglement amongst the set $N$ of $n$ agents in a network using apriori multi-partite entanglement states amongst subsets of $N$. We propose protocols for establishing multi-partite entanglement in the above cases.

E v.67, 056116 (2003); quant-ph/0212125] proposed that if the Lifshitz formula is combined with the Drude model, the transverse electric zero mode does not contribute to the result for real metals and there arises a linear temperature correction to the Casimir force at small temperatures. The authors claim that in spite of the fact that the Casimir entropy in their approach is negative, the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. In the present Comment we show that the authors' conclusion regarding the Nernst heat theorem is in error. We demonstrate also the resolution of this thermodynamic puzzle based on the use of the surface impedance instead of the Drude dielectric function. The results of numerical computations obtained by the authors are compared with those from use of the surface impedance approach which are thermodynamically consistent.

abstract: This paper introduces quantum ``multiple-Merlin''-Arthur proof systems in which Arthur receives multiple quantum proofs that are unentangled with each other. Although classical multi-proof systems are obviously equivalent to classical single-proof systems (i.e., usual Merlin-Arthur proof systems), it is unclear whether or not quantum multi-proof systems collapse to quantum single-proof systems (i.e., usual quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems). This paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition under which the number of quantum proofs is reducible to two. It is also proved that, in the case of perfect soundness, using multiple quantum proofs does not increase the power of quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems.

This gives a profound meaning to what was observed by Schroedinger in 1931 concerning Schroedinger bridges: "Merkwuerdige Analogien zur Quantenmechanik, die mir sehr des Hindenkens wert erscheinen".

abstract: In a number of previous studies, we have investigated the use of the volume element of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric -- identically, one-fourth of the statistical distinguishability (SD) metric -- as a natural measure over the (n^2-1)-dimensional convex set of n x n density matrices. This has led us for the cases n = 4 and 6 to estimates of the prior (Bures/SD) probabilities that qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit pairs are separable. Here, we extend this work from such bipartite systems to the tripartite "laboratory'' quantum systems possessing U x U x U symmetry recently constructed by Eggeling and Werner (Phys. Rev. A 63 [2001], 042324). We derive the associated SD metric tensors for the three-qubit and three-qutrit cases, and then obtain estimates of the various related Bures/SD probabilities using Monte Carlo methods.

abstract: Grover's quantum search algorithm provides a way to speed up combinatorial search, but is not directly applicable to searching a physical database. Nevertheless, Aaronson and Ambainis showed that a database of N items laid out in d spatial dimensions can be searched in time of order sqrt(N) for d>2, and in time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N) for d=2. We consider an alternative search algorithm based on a continuous time quantum walk on a graph. The case of the complete graph gives the continuous time search algorithm of Farhi and Gutmann, and other previously known results can be used to show that sqrt(N) speedup can also be achieved on the hypercube. We show that full sqrt(N) speedup can be achieved on a d-dimensional periodic lattice for d>4. In d=4, the quantum walk search algorithm takes time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N), and in d<4, the algorithm does not provide substantial speedup.

abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the effective dipolar interactions between nuclear spins of spin-carrying molecules of a gas in a closed nano-cavities are independent of the spacing between all spins. We derive exact time-dependent polarization for all spins in spin-1/2 ensemble with spatially independent effective dipolar interactions. If the initial polarization is on a single (first) spin,$P_1(0)= 1$ then the exact spin dynamics of the model is shown to exhibit a periodical short pulses of the polarization of the first spin, the effect being typical of the systems having a large number, $N$, of spins. If $N \gg 1$, then within the period $4\pi/g$ ($2\pi/g$) for odd (even) $N$-spin clusters, with $g$ standing for spin coupling, the polarization of spin 1 switches quickly from unity to the time independent value, 1/3, over the time interval about $(g\sqrt{N})^{-1}$, thus, almost all the time, the spin 1 spends in the time independent condition $P_1(t)= 1/3$. The period and the width of the pulses determine the volume and the form-factor of the ellipsoidal cavity. The formalism is adopted to the case of time varying nano-fluctuations of the volume of the cavitation nano-bubbles. If the volume $V(t)$ is varied by the Gaussian-in-time random noise then the envelope of the polarization peaks goes irreversibly to 1/3. The polarization dynamics of the single spin exhibits the Gaussian (or exponential) time dependence when the correlation time of the fluctuations of the nano-volume is larger (or smaller) than the $<(\delta g)^2 >^{-1/2} $, where the $<(\delta g)^2>$ is the variance of the $g(V(t))$ coupling. Finally, we report the exact calculations of the NMR line shape for the $N$-spin gaseous aggregate.

abstract: Several proposed schemes for the physical realization of a quantum computer consist of qubits arranged in a cellular array. In the quantum circuit model of quantum computation, an often complex series of two-qubit gate operations is required between arbitrarily distant pairs of lattice qubits. An alternative model of quantum computation based on quantum cellular automata (QCA) requires only homogeneous local interactions that can be implemented in parallel. This would be a huge simplification in an actual experiment. We find some minimal physical requirements for the construction of unitary QCA in a 1 dimensional Ising spin chain and demonstrate optimal pulse sequences for information transport and entanglement distribution. We also introduce the theory of non-unitary QCA and show by example that non-unitary rules can generate environment assisted entanglement.

abstract: We introduce a measure Q of the "quality" of a quantum which-way detector, which characterizes its intrinsic ability to extract which-way information in an asymmetric two-way interferometer. The "quality" Q allows one to separate the contribution to the distinguishability of the ways arising from the quantum properties of the detector from the contribution stemming from a-priori which-way knowledge available to the experimenter, which can be quantified by a predictability parameter P. We provide an inequality relating these two sources of which-way information to the value of the fringe visibility displayed by the interferometer. We show that this inequality is an expression of duality, allowing one to trace the loss of coherence to the two reservoirs of which-way information represented by Q and P. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with the use of a quantum logic gate: the Symmetric Quanton-Detecton System (SQDS). The SQDS can be regarded as two qubits trying to acquire which way information about each other. The SQDS will provide an illustrating example of the reciprocal effects induced by duality between system and which-way detector.

abstract: The concepts of `conditional entropy' and `information' retain their validity for quantum systems, but their properties differ somewhat from those of their classical counterparts; specifically, some equalities and inequalities of classical information theory are in general violated. In this paper the concepts are generalized to include arbitrary indirect measurements (POVMs). Though the generalization is straightforward, it is important to ascertain that the basic relationships between the generalized quantitites remain the same for the POVMs as for direct measurements.

abstract: Nambu's construction of multi-linear brackets for super-integrable systems can be thought of as degenerate Poisson brackets with a maximal set of Casimirs in their kernel. By introducing privileged coordinates in phase space these degenerate Poisson brackets are brought to the form of Heisenberg's equations. We propose a definition for constructing quantum operators for classical functions which enables us to turn the maximally degenerate Poisson brackets into operators. They pose a set of eigenvalue problems for a new state vector. The requirement of the single valuedness of this eigenfunction leads to quantization. The example of the harmonic oscillator is used to illustrate this general procedure for quantizing a class of maximally super-integrable systems.

abstract: The bounded one dimensional multibarrier potential shows signs of chaos, phase transition and a transmission probability of unity for certain values of its total length $L$ and the ratio $c$ of total interval to total width. Like the infinite Kronig-Penney system, which is arranged along the whole spatial region, the bounded multibarrier potential has a band-gap structure in its energy spectrum. But unlike the Kronig-Penney system, in which the gaps disappear for large energies, these gaps do not disappear for certain values of $L$ and $c$. The energy is discontinuous even in parts of the spectrum with no gaps at all. These results imply that the energy spectrum of the bounded multibarrier system is singular.

abstract: Time evolution of a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a heat bath is compared for three classes of initial states for the bath modes - grand canonical ensemble, number states and coherent states. It is shown that for a wide class of number states the behavior of the oscillator is similar to the case of the equilibrium bath. If the bath modes are initially in coherent states, then the variances of the oscillator coordinate and momentum, as well as its entanglement to the bath, asymptotically approach the same values as for the oscillator at zero temperature and the average coordinate and momentum show a Brownian-like behavior. We derive an exact master equation for the characteristic function of the oscillator valid for arbitrary factorized initial conditions. In the case of the equilibrium bath this equation reduces to an equation of the Hu-Paz-Zhang type, while for the coherent states bath it leads to an exact stochastic master equation with a multiplicative noise.

abstract: The concept of mode locking in laser is applied to a two-photon state with frequency entanglement. Cavity enhanced parametric down-conversion is found to produce exactly such a state. The mode-locked two-photon state exhibits a comb-like correlation function. An unbalanced Hong-Ou-Mandel type interferometer is used to measure the correlation function. A revival of the typical interference dip is observed. We will discuss schemes for engineering of quantum states in time domain.

abstract: Anyons obtained from a finite gauge theory have a computational power that depends on the symmetry group. The relationship between group structure and computational power is discussed in this paper. In particular, it is shown that anyons based on finite groups that are solvable but not nilpotent are capable of universal quantum computation. This extends previously published results to groups that are smaller, and therefore more practical. Additionally, a new universal gate-set is built out of an operation called a probabilistic projection, and a quasi-universal leakage correction scheme is discussed.

abstract: Cavity QED is a versatile tool to explore small scale quantum information processing. Within this setting, we describe a particular protocol for implementing a Toffoli gate with Rydberg atoms and a cavity field. Our scheme uses both resonant and non resonant interactions, and in particular a cavity assisted atomic collision. The experimental feasibility of the protocol is carefully analyzed with the help of numerical simulations and takes into account the decoherence process. Moreover, we show that our protocol is optimal within the constraints imposed by the experimental setting.

We also show that the protocols are secure against an external eavesdropper using the intercept/resend strategy.

The non-gauge invariant terms have to be removed in order to obtain a physically correct result. In this paper we will examine this problem and determine why a theory that is supposed to be gauge invariant produces non-gauge invariant results.

abstract: Vaidman described how a team of three players, each of them isolated in a remote booth, could use a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state to always win a game which would be impossible to always win without quantum resources. However, Vaidman's method requires all three players to share a common reference frame; it does not work if the adversary is allowed to disorientate one player. Here we show how to always win the game, even if the players do not share any reference frame. The introduced method uses a 12-qubit state which is invariant under any transformation $R_a \otimes R_b \otimes R_c$ (where $R_a = U_a \otimes U_a \otimes U_a \otimes U_a$, where $U_j$ is a unitary operation on a single qubit) and requires only single-qubit measurements. A number of further applications of this 12-qubit state are described.

abstract: We study and solve the problem of distilling secret key from quantum states representing correlation between two parties (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) via one-way public discussion: we prove a coding theorem to achieve the "wire-tapper" bound, the difference of the mutual information Alice-Bob and that of Alice-Eve, for so-called cqq-correlations, via one-way public communication. This result yields information--theoretic formulas for the distillable secret key, giving ``ultimate'' key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one-way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so-called "hashing inequality" which says that the coherent information (i.e., the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable EPR rate. This result is well--known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulas which we briefly review.

abstract: The field of linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) will soon need a repertoire of experimental milestones. We make progress in this direction by describing several experiments based on Grover's algorithm. These experiments range from a relatively simple implementation using only a single non-scalable CNOT gate to the most complex, requiring two concatenated scalable CNOT gates, and thus form a useful set of early milestones for LOQC. We also give a complete description of basic LOQC using polarization-encoded qubits, making use of many simplifications to the original scheme of Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn.

abstract: A model is proposed for the statistical analysis of arbitrary-strength quantum measurements, based on a picture of "sampling weak values" from different configurations of the system. The model is comprised of two elements: a "local weak value" and a "likelihood factor". The first describes the response of an idealized weak measurement situation where the back-reaction on the system is perfectly controlled. The second assigns a weight factor to possible configurations of the system. The distribution of the data in a measurement of arbitrary strength may the be viewed as the net result of interfering different samples weighted by the likelihood factor, each of which implements a weak measurement of a different local weak value. It is shown that the mean and variance of the data can be connected directly to the means and variances of the sampled weak values. The model is then applied to a situation similar to a phase transition, where the distribution of the data exhibits two qualitatively different shapes as the strength parameter is slightly varied away from a critical value: one below the critical point, where an unusual weak value is resolved, the other above the critical point, where the spectrum of the measured observable is resolved. In the picture of sampling, the transition corresponds to a qualitative change in the sampling profile brought about by the competition between the prior sampling distribution and the likelihood factor.

abstract: We report our theoretical and experimental investigations into errors in quantum state estimation, putting a special emphasis on their asymptotic behavior. Tomographic measurements and maximum likelihood estimation are used for estimating several kinds of identically prepared quantum states (bi-photon polarization states) produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Excess errors in the estimation procedures are eliminated by introducing a new estimation strategy utilizing Akaike's information criterion. We make a quantitative comparision between the errors of the experimentally estimated states and their asymptotic lower bounds, which are derived from the Cram\'{e}r-Rao inequality. Our results reveal influence of entanglement on the errors in the estimation. An alternative measurement strategy employing inseparable measurements is also discussed, and its performance is numerically explored.

abstract: State representations summarize our knowledge about a system. When unobservable quantities are introduced the state representation is typically no longer unique. However, this non-uniqueness does not affect subsequent inferences based on any observable data. We demonstrate that the inference-free subspace may be extracted whenever the quantity's unobservability is guaranteed by a global conservation law. This result can generalize even without such a guarantee. In particular, we examine the coherent-state representation of a laser where the absolute phase of the electromagnetic field is believed to be unobservable. We show that experimental coherent states may be separated from the inference-free subspaces induced by this unobservable phase. These physical states may then be approximated by coherent states in a relative-phase Hilbert space.

abstract: We present a quantum computing scheme with atomic Josephson junction arrays. The system consists of a small number of atoms with three internal states and trapped in a far-off resonant optical lattice. Raman lasers provide the "Josephson" tunneling, and the collision interaction between atoms represent the "capacitive" couplings between the modes. The qubit states are collective states of the atoms with opposite persistent currents. This system is closely analogous to the superconducting flux qubit. Single qubit quantum logic gates are performed by modulating the Raman couplings, while two-qubit gates result from a tunnel coupling between neighboring wells. Readout is achieved by tuning the Raman coupling adiabatically between the Josephson regime to the Rabi regime, followed by a detection of atoms in internal electronic states. Decoherence mechanisms are studied in detail promising a high ratio between the decoherence time and the gate operation time.

The observables to be measured (particle numbers and particle number variances) are relatively easily accessible experimentally. The method may be used to detect entanglement in light fields or in Bose-Einstein condensates. In contrast to the standard approach based on entanglement witnesses, the condition is expressed in terms of an inequality which is nonlinear in expectation values.

Solutions of the master equation are compared with exact solutions for a system consisting of three spins which is manipulated with a sequence of laser pulses while interacting with a spin-bath. Exact solutions appear to converge to the master equation result as the number of bath spins increases.

A generalized Casella-type effect is found in one these configurations. A physical scenario for the quantum phase in an interferometric experiment is proposed.

The entanglement is maximized for intermediate values of the noise intensity, while it is a monotonic function of the spontaneous rate. This resembles the phenomenon of stochastic resonance and sheds more light on the idea to exploit white noise in quantum information processing.

We prove that the former yields the {\it necessary} condition for spectrum to be real whereas the latter helps in fixing a definition for inner-product of the eigenstates. Here we separate out adjointness of an operator from its Hermitian-adjointness. It turns out that a Hamiltonian possessing real spectrum is first pseudo-real, further it could be Hermitian, PT-symmetric or pseudo-Hermitian.

abstract: A two-photon emission of a medium with periodically time-dependent refractive index is considered. The emission results from the zero-point fluctuations of the medium. Usually this emission is very weak. However, it can be strongly enhanced if the resonant condition $\omega_0$ = 2.94 $c/l_0$ is fulfilled (here $\omega_0$ and $l_0 $ are the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillations of the optical length of the medium, respectively). Besides, a medium with resonant oscillations of the optical length performs the phase conjugated reflection with high efficiency. A similar resonant enhancement of the two-quantum emission of other bosons is also predicted.

abstract: We study classical Hamiltonian systems in which the intrinsic proper time evolution parameter is related through a probability distribution to the physical time, which is assumed to be discrete. In this way, a physical clock with discrete states is introduced, which presently is still treated as decoupled from the system. This is motivated by the recent discussion of ``timeless'' reparametrization invariant models, where discrete physical time has been constructed based on quasi-local observables. Employing the path-integral formulation of classical mechanics developed by Gozzi et al., we show that these deterministic classical systems can be naturally described as unitary quantum mechanical models. We derive the emergent quantum Hamiltonian in terms of the underlying classical one. Such Hamiltonians typically need a regularization - here performed by discretization - in order to arrive at models with a stable groundstate in the continuum limit. This is demonstrated in several examples, recovering and generalizing a model advanced by 't Hooft.

abstract: We discuss quantum fidelity decay of classically regular dynamics, in particular for an important special case of a vanishing time averaged perturbation operator, i.e. vanishing expectation values of the perturbation in the eigenbasis of unperturbed dynamics. A complete semiclassical picture of this situation is derived in which we show that the quantum fidelity of individual coherent initial states exhibits three different regimes in time: (i) first it follows the corresponding classical fidelity up to time t1=hbar^(-1/2), (ii) then it freezes on a plateau of constant value, (iii) and after a time scale t_2=min[hbar^(1/2) delta^(-2),hbar^(-1/2) delta^(-1)] it exhibits fast ballistic decay as exp(-const. delta^4 t^2/hbar) where delta is a strength of perturbation. All the constants are computed in terms of classical dynamics for sufficiently small effective value hbar of the Planck constant. A similar picture is worked out also for general initial states, and specifically for random initial states, where t_1=1, and t_2=delta^(-1). This prolonged stability of quantum dynamics in the case of a vanishing time averaged perturbation could prove to be useful in designing quantum devices. Theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments on the quantized integrable top.

abstract: When photons are sent through a fiber as part of a quantum communication protocol, the error that is most difficult to correct is photon loss. Here, we propose and analyze a two-to-four qubit encoding scheme, which can recover the loss of one qubit in the transmission. This device acts as a repeater when it is placed in series to cover a distance larger than the attenuation length of the fiber, and it acts as an optical quantum memory when it is inserted in a fiber loop. We call this dual-purpose device a ``quantum transponder.''

abstract: We propose a new laser cooling method for atomic species whose level structure makes traditional laser cooling difficult. For instance, laser cooling of hydrogen requires vacuum-ultraviolet laser light, while multielectron atoms need laser light at many widely separated frequencies. These restrictions can be eased by laser cooling on two-photon transitions with ultrafast pulse trains. Laser cooling of hydrogen, antihydrogen, and carbon appears feasible, and extension of the technique to molecules may be possible.

title: Use of Quadrupolar Nuclei for Quantum Information processing by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance: Implementation of a Quantum Algorithm

abstract: Physical implementation of Quantum Information Processing (QIP) by liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), using weakly coupled spin-1/2 nuclei of a molecule, is well established. Nuclei with spin$>$1/2 oriented in liquid crystalline matrices is another possibility. Such systems have multiple qubits per nuclei and large quadrupolar couplings resulting in well separated lines in the spectrum. So far, creation of pseudopure states and logic gates have been demonstrated in such systems using transition selective radio-frequency pulses. In this paper we report two novel developments. First, we implement a quantum algorithm which needs coherent superposition of states. Second, we use evolution under quadrupolar coupling to implement multi qubit gates. We implement Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a spin-3/2 (2 qubit) system. The controlled-not operation needed to implement this algorithm has been implemented here by evolution under the quadrupolar Hamiltonian. This method has been implemented for the first time in quadrupolar systems. Since the quadrupolar coupling is several orders of magnitude greater than the coupling in weakly coupled spin-1/2 nuclei, the gate time decreases, increasing the clock speed of the quantum computer.

They generate the quantum (Moyal) and classic (Poisson) brackets on respective orbits corresponding to representations of the Heisenberg group.

abstract: We generalize the correlation functions of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality to arbitrarily high-dimensional systems. Based on this generalization, we construct the general CHSH inequality for bipartite quantum systems of arbitrarily high dimensionality, which takes the same simple form as CHSH inequality for two-dimension. This inequality is optimal in the same sense as the CHSH inequality for two dimensional systems, namely, the maximal amount by which the inequality is violated consists with the maximal resistance to noise. We also discuss the physical meaning and general definition of the correlation functions. Furthermore, by giving another specific set of the correlation functions with the same physical meaning, we realize the inequality presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88,}040404 (2002)].

abstract: Two models of computer, a quantum and a classical "chemical machine" designed to compute the relevant part of Shor's factoring algorithm are discussed. The comparison shows that the basic quantum features believed to be responsible for the exponential speed-up of quantum computations possess their classical counterparts for the hybrid digital-analog computer. It is argued that the measurement errors which cannot be fully corrected make the computation not efficient for both models.

abstract: The exact dynamics of $N$ two-level atoms coupled to a common electromagnetic bath and closely located inside a lossy cavity is reported. Stationary radiation trapping effects are found and very transparently interpreted in the context of our approach. We prove that initially injecting one excitation only in the $N$ atoms-cavity system, loss mechanisms asymptotically drive the matter sample toward a long-lived collective subradiant Dicke state. The role played by the closeness of the $N$ atoms with respect to such a cooperative behavior is brought to light and carefully discussed.

The connection between the quantum spiral bandwidth and the entropy of entanglement of the quantum state is discussed.

abstract: The mean arrival time of free particles is computed using the quantum probability current. This is uniquely determined in the non-relativistic limit of Dirac equation, although the Schroedinger probability current has an inherent non-uniqueness. Since the Dirac probability current involves a spin-dependent term, an arrival time distribution based on the probability current shows an observable spin-dependent effect, even for free particles. This arises essentially from relativistic quantum dynamics, but persists even in the non-relativistic regime.

abstract: We simulated the quantum dynamics for magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) in the oscillating cantilever-driven adiabatic reversals (OSCAR) technique. We estimated the frequency shift of the cantilever vibrations and demonstrated that this shift causes the formation of a Schrodinger cat state which has some similarities and differences from the conventional MRFM technique which uses cyclic adiabatic reversals of spins. The interaction of the cantilever with the environment is shown to quickly destroy the coherence between the two possible cantilever trajectories. We have shown that using partial adiabatic reversals, one can produce a significant increase in the OSCAR signal.

abstract: We show that weak measurements with post-selection, proposed in the context of the quantum theory of measurement, naturally appear in the everyday physics of fiber optics telecom networks through polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) and polarization-dependent losses (PDL). Specifically, the PMD leads to a time-resolved discrimination of polarization; the post-selection is done in the most natural way: one post-selects those photons that have not been lost because of the PDL. The quantum formalism is shown to simplify the calculation of optical networks in the telecom limit of weak PMD.

We show how three-mode entanglement can be used to realize symmetric and asymmetric telecloning machines, which achieve optimal fidelity for coherent states. An experimental implementation involving a single nonlinear crystal where the two interactions take place simultaneously is suggested. Preliminary experimental results showing the feasibility and the effectiveness of the interaction scheme with seeded crystal are also presented.

Applications for quantum information processing are discussed.

Strangeness oscillations play the role of the traditional interference pattern linked to wave-like behaviour, whereas the distinct propagation in free space of the K_S and K_L components mimics the two possible interferometric paths taken by particle-like objects.

abstract: Using the natural connection equivalent to the SU(2) Yang-Mills instanton on the quaternionic Hopf fibration of $S^7$ over the quaternionic projective space ${\bf HP}^1\simeq S^4$ with an $SU(2)\simeq S^3$ fiber the geometry of entanglement for two qubits is investigated. The relationship between base and fiber i.e. the twisting of the bundle corresponds to the entanglement of the qubits. The measure of entanglement can be related to the length of the shortest geodesic with respect to the Mannoury-Fubini-Study metric on ${\bf HP}^1$ between an arbitrary entangled state, and the separable state nearest to it. Using this result an interpretation of the standard Schmidt decomposition in geometric terms is given. Schmidt states are the nearest and furthest separable ones lying on, or the ones obtained by parallel transport along the geodesic passing through the entangled state. Some examples showing the correspondence between the anolonomy of the connection and entanglement via the geometric phase is shown. Connections with important notions like the Bures-metric, Uhlmann's connection, the hyperbolic structure for density matrices and anholonomic quantum computation are also pointed out.

abstract: We study the spatial correlations of quantum fluctuations that can be observed in multi-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion in the regime of high gain. A stochastic model has been solved numerically to obtain quantitative results beyond the stationary plane-wave pump approximation. The pulsed shape of the pump beam and other features of the system, such as spatial walk-off and diffraction are taken into account. Their effect on the spatial quantum correlations predicted by the plane-wave pump theory is investigated, both for near field and far field measurements, in a type I and in a type II phase-matching configuration.

We study the general situation where the only resources required are secure bipartite key distribution and authenticated classical communication. Accordingly, multipartite quantum key distribution can be proven unconditionally secure by reducing the problem to the biparitite case and invoking the proof of security of bipartite quantum key distribution.

abstract: In the King's Problem, a physicist is asked to prepare a d-state quantum system in any state of her choosing and give it to a king who measures one of (d+1) sets of mutually unbiased observables on it. The physicist is then allowed to make a control measurement on the system, following which the king reveals which set of observables he measured and challenges the physicist to predict correctly all the eigenvalues he found. This paper obtains an upper bound on the physicist's probability of success at this task if she is allowed to make measurements only on the system itself (the "conventional" solution) and not on the system as well as any ancillary systems it may have been coupled to in the preparation phase, as in the perfect solutions proposed recently. An optimal conventional solution, with a success probability of 0.7, is constructed in d = 4; this is to be contrasted with the success probability of 0.902 for the optimal conventional solution in d = 2. The gap between the best conventional solution and the perfect solution grows quite rapidly with increasing d.

It is obtained by using off resonant light to carry out Quantum Non Demolition Measurements of the spins. The relevant experimental conditions, which require very dense atomic samples, can be realized with presently available techniques. Long-lived atomic superposition states may become useful as an off-line resource for quantum computing with otherwise linear operations.

The parameters of the possible normal forms of a given state are roots of an algebraic equation, which is proved to be solvable by radicals. The structure of the sets of equivalent normal forms is related to the geometry of certain regular complex polytopes.

Otherwise we show how the scattering matrix of the network is decomposed into a product of three matrices that can be generated by Hamiltonians.

abstract: A Gaussian resolution method for the computation of equilibrium density matrices rho(T) for a general multidimensional quantum problem is presented. The variational principle applied to the ``imaginary time'' Schroedinger equation provides the equations of motion for Gaussians in a resolution of rho(T) described by their width matrix, center and scale factor, all treated as dynamical variables. The method is computationally very inexpensive, has favorable scaling with the system size and is surprisingly accurate in a wide temperature range, even for cases involving quantum tunneling. Incorporation of symmetry constraints, such as reflection or particle statistics, is also discussed.

Inability to control system parameters with high precision is another possible source of error. As a solution we propose quantum computing experiments using dissipation based on an environment-induced quantum Zeno effect. As an example we present a simple scheme for quantum gate implementations with cold trapped ions in the presence of cooling.

abstract: We computationally investigate the complete polytope of Bell inequalities for 2 particles with small numbers of possible measurements and outcomes. Our approach is limited by Pitowsky's connection of this problem to the computationally hard NP problem. Despite this, we find that there are very few relevant inequivalent inequalities for small numbers. For example, in the case with 3 possible 2-outcome measurements on each particle, there is just one new inequality. We describe mixed 2-qubit states which violate this inequality but not the CHSH. The new inequality also illustrates a sharing of bi-partite non-locality between three qubits: something not seen using the CHSH inequality. It also inspires us to discover a class of Bell inequalities with m possible n-outcome measurements on each particle.

abstract: Even and odd q-deformed charge coherent states are constructed, their (over)completeness proved and their generation explored. A $D$-algebra realization of the SU$_q$(1,1) generators is given in terms of them. They are shown to exhibit SU$_q$(1,1) squeezing and two-mode $q$-antibunching, but neither one-mode, nor two-mode $q$-squeezing.

abstract: Quantum theory predicts that two indistinguishable photons incident on a beam-splitter interferometer stick together as they exit the device (the pair emerges randomly from one port or the other). We use a special photon-number-resolving energy detector for a direct loophole-free observation of this quantum-interference phenomenon. Simultaneous measurements from two such detectors, one at each beam-splitter output port, confirm the absence of cross-coincidences.

abstract: In a previous study (quant-ph/0207181), we formulated a conjecture that arbitrarily coupled qubits (describable by 4 x 4 density matrices) are separable with an a priori probability of 8/(11 \pi^2) = 0.0736881. For this purpose, we employed the normalized volume element of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric as a probability distribution over the fifteen-dimensional convex set of 4 x 4 density matrices. Here, we provide further/independent (quasi-Monte Carlo numerical integration) evidence of a stronger nature (giving an estimate of 0.0736858 vs. 0.0737012 previously) for this conjecture. Additionally, employing a certain ansatz, we estimate the probabilities of separability based on certain other monotone metrics of interest. However, we find ourselves, at this point, unable to convincingly conjecture exact simple formulas for these new (smaller) probabilities.

abstract: We study the far field spatial distribution of the quantum fluctuations in the transverse profile of the output light beam generated by a type II Optical Parametric Oscillator below threshold, including the effects of transverse walk-off. We study how quadrature field correlations depend on the polarization. We find spatial EPR entanglement in quadrature-polarization components: For the far field points not affected by walk-off there is almost complete noise suppression in the proper quadratures difference of any orthogonal polarization components. We show the entanglement of the state of symmetric intense, or macroscopic, spatial light modes. We also investigate nonclassical polarization properties in terms of the Stokes operators. We find perfect correlations in all Stokes parameters measured in opposite far field points in the direction orthogonal to the walk-off, while locally the field is unpolarized and we find no polarization squeezing.

abstract: Focusing particularly on one-qubit and two-qubit systems, I explain how the quantum state of a system of n qubits can be expressed as a real function--a generalized Wigner function--on a discrete 2^n x 2^n phase space. The phase space is based on the finite field having 2^n elements, and its geometric structure leads naturally to the construction of a complete set of 2^n+1 mutually conjugate bases.

abstract: The first precise measurement of the Casimir force between dissimilar metals is reported. The attractive force, between a Cu layer evaporated on a microelectromechanical torsional oscillator, and an Au layer deposited on an Al$_2$O$_3$ sphere, was measured dynamically with a noise level of 6 fN/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$. Measurements were performed for separations in the 0.2-2 $\mu$m range. The results agree to better than 1% in the 0.2-0.5 $\mu$m range with a theoretical model that takes into account the finite conductivity and roughness of the two metals. The observed discrepancies, which are much larger than the experimental precision, can be attributed to a lack of a complete characterization of the optical properties of the specific samples used in the experiment.

abstract: We propose a new method for detecting entanglement of two qubits and discuss its relation with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. Without the need for full quantum tomography for the density matrix we can experimentally detect the entanglement by measuring less than 9 local observables for any given state. We show that this test is stronger than the CHSH-Bell inequality and also gives an estimation for the degree of entanglement. If prior knowledge is available we can further greatly reduce the number of required local observables. The test is convenient and feasible with present experimental technology.

abstract: The role of squeezing in quantum key distribution with continuous variables based on homodyne detection and post-selection is investigated for several specific eavesdropping strategies. It is shown that amplitude squeezing creates strong correlations between the signals of the legitimate receiver and a potential eavesdropper. Post-selection of the received pulses can therefore be used to reduce the eavesdropper's knowledge of the raw key, which increases the secret key rate by orders of magnitude over large distances even for modest amounts of squeezing.

The resource requirements for implementing a quantum walk as a program on a quantum computer are compared and found to be very similar for both discrete and continuous time walks. The role of the oracle, and how it changes if more prior information about the graph is available, is also discussed.

abstract: We discuss quantum key distribution protocols using quantum continuous variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol, even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual'' entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.

abstract: Environment--induced decoherence causes entropy increase. It can be quantified using, e.g., the purity $\varsigma={\rm Tr}\rho^2$. When the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is perturbed, its sensitivity to such perturbation can be measured by the Loschmidt echo $\bar M(t)$. It is given by the average squared overlap between the perturbed and unperturbed state. We describe the relation between the temporal behavior of $\varsigma(t)$ and $\bar M(t)$. In this way we show that the decay of the Loschmidt echo can be analyzed using tools developed in the study of decoherence. In particular, for systems with a classically chaotic Hamiltonian the decay of $\varsigma$ and $\bar M$ has a regime where it is dominated by the classical Lyapunov exponents

abstract: A programmable gate array is a circuit whose action is controlled by input data. In this letter we describe a special--purpose quantum circuit that can be programmed to evaluate the expectation value of any operator $O$ acting on a space of states of $N$ dimensions. The circuit has a program register whose state $|\Psi(O)>_P$ encodes the operator $O$ whose expectation value is to be evaluated. The method requires knowledge of the expansion of $O$ in a basis of the space of operators. We discuss some applications of this circuit and its relation to known instances of quantum state tomography.

abstract: The operator-Schmidt decomposition is useful in quantum information theory for quantifying the nonlocality of bipartite unitary operations. We construct a family of unitary operators on C^n tensor C^n whose operator-Schmidt decompositions are computed using the discrete Fourier transform. As a corollary, we produce unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 with operator-Schmidt number S for every S in {1,...,9}. This corollary was unexpected, since it contradicted reasonable conjectures of Nielsen et al [Phys. Rev. A 67 (2003) 052301] based on intuition from a striking result in the two-qubit case. By the results of Dur, Vidal, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 057901 quant-ph/0112124], who also considered the two-qubit case, our result implies that there are nine equivalence classes of unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 which are probabilistically interconvertible by (stochastic) local operations and classical communication. As another corollary, a prescription is produced for constructing maximally-entangled operators from biunimodular functions. Reversing tact, we state a generalized operator-Schmidt decomposition of the quantum Fourier transform considered as an operator C^M_1 tensor C^M_2 --> C^N_1 tensor C^N_2, with M_1 x M_2 = N_1 x N_2. This decomposition shows (by Nielsen's bound) that the communication cost of the QFT remains maximal when a net transfer of qudits is permitted. In an appendix, a canonical procedure is given for removing basis-dependence for results and proofs depending on the "magic basis" introduced in [S. Hill and W. Wootters, "Entanglement of a pair of quantum bits," Phys Rev. Lett 78 (1997) 5022-5025, quant-ph/9703041 (and quant-ph/9709029)].

abstract: The modal interpretation of quantum mechanics allows one to keep the standard classical definition of realism intact. That is, variables have a definite status for all time and a measurement only tells us which value it had. However, at present modal dynamics are only applicable to situations that are described in the orthodox theory by projective measures. In this paper we extend modal dynamics to include positive operator measures (POMs). That is, for example, rather than using a complete set of orthogonal projectors, we can use an overcomplete set of nonorthogonal projectors. We derive the conditions under which Bell's stochastic modal dynamics for projective measures reduce to deterministic dynamics, showing (incidentally) that Brown and Hiley's generalization of Bohmian mechanics [quant-ph/0005026, (2000)] cannot be thus derived. We then show how {\em deterministic} dynamics for positive operators can also be derived. As a simple case, we consider a Harmonic oscillator, and the overcomplete set of coherent state projectors (i.e. the Husimi POM). We show that the modal dynamics for this POM in the classical limit correspond to the classical dynamics, even for the nonclassical number state $\ket{n}$. This is in contrast to the Bohmian dynamics, which for energy eigenstates, the dynamics are always non-classical.

abstract: We present a detailed theory of spectacular semiclassical catastrophes happening during the time evolution of a kicked quantum rotor (Phys.Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 163601 (2001)). Both two- and three-dimensional rotational systems are analyzed. It is shown that the wave function of the rotor develops a {\em cusp} at a certain delay after a kick, which results in a sharply focused rotational wave packet. The {\em cusp} is followed by a fold-type catastrophe manifested in the {\em rainbow}-like moving angular singularities. In the three-dimensional case, the rainbows are accompanied by additional singular features similar to {\em glory} structures known in wave optics. These catastrophes in the time-dependent angular wave function are well described by the appropriate tools of the quasiclassical wave mechanics, i.e. by Airy and Bessel approximations and Pearcey's functions. A scenario of "accumulative squeezing" is also presented in which a specially designed train of short kicks produces an unlimited narrowing of the rotor angular distribution. This scenario is relevant for the molecular alignment by short laser pulses, and also for atom lithography schemes in which cold atoms are focused by an optical standing wave.

A gas of 87Rb atoms is subjected to a strong drive laser and a weak probe laser and a radio frequency field, where the magnetic coupling between the Zeeman levels leads to nonlinear generation of a comb of sidebands.

The squeezing ratio saturates after a certain grating length and the fundamental Bragg soliton produces the optimal squeezing ratio.

abstract: The solution of the classical Fermi problem of low-energy neutron scattering by nuclei, when the excitations of the nuclei in scattering processes are taken into account, is found by the method of zero-range potentials with inner structure. This model is a generalization of the Fermi zero-range potential obtained by adding a non-trivial inner Hamiltonian and inner space with indefinite metric. We propose a general principle of analyticity of the Caley-transform of the S-scattering matrix, written as a function of wave number. This permits us to evaluate all parameters of the model, including the indefinite metric tensor of the inner space, once the spectrum of the inner Hamiltonian, the scattering length and the effective radious are chosen.

abstract: Entanglement-based attacks, which are subtle and powerful, are usually believed to render quantum bit commitment insecure. We point out that the no-go argument leading to this view implicitly assumes the evidence-of-commitment to be a monolithic quantum system. We argue that more general evidence structures, allowing for a composite, hybrid (classical-quantum) evidence, conduce to improved security. In particular, we present and prove the security of the following protocol: Bob sends Alice an anonymous state. She inscribes her commitment $b$ by measuring part of it in the + (for $b = 0$) or $\times$ (for $b=1$) basis. She then communicates to him the (classical) measurement outcome $R_x$ and the part-measured anonymous state interpolated into other, randomly prepared qubits as her evidence-of-commitment.

These values are higher than those of all currently known two-level-state schemes without using a quantum storage.

Complete population transfer from an initially occupied state 1 to a designated state 2 occurs under two conditions. First, there is a constraint on the ratios of the transition matrix elements of the external interaction. Second, there is a constraint on the action integral over the interaction, or "area", corresponding to the phase shift induced by the external interaction. Both conditions may be expressed in terms of simple odd integers.

abstract: Recent developments in quantum computation have made it clear that there is a lot more to computation than the conventional Boolean algebra. Is quantum computation the most general framework for processing information? Having gathered the courage to go beyond the traditional definitions, we are now in a position to answer: Certainly not. The meaning of a message being ``a collection of building blocks'' can be explored in a variety of situations. A generalised framework is proposed based on group theory, and it is illustrated with well-known physical examples. A systematic information theoretical approach is yet to be developed in many of these situations. Some directions for future development are pointed out.

abstract: A distant mirror leads to a vacuum-induced level shift in a laser-excited atom. This effect has been measured with a single mirror 25 cm away from a single, trapped barium ion. This dispersive action is the counterpart to the mirror's dissipative effect, which has been shown earlier to effect a change in the ion's spontaneous decay [J. Eschner et al., Nature 413, 495-498 (2001)]. The experimental data are well described by 8-level optical Bloch equations which are amended to take into account the presence of the mirror according to the model in [U. Dorner and P. Zoller, Phys. Rev. A 66, 023816 (2002)]. Observed deviations from simple dispersive behavior are attributed to multi-level effects.

A two-state model and a dipole approximation are used. In the case of degenerate energy levels an analytical solution of the time-dependent Shroedinger equation for the probability amplitudes exists. The form of the solution allows one to choose the ratio of the field amplitude to its frequency that leads to temporal trapping of electrons in specific states. The analytic solution is valid when the separation of the energy levels is small compared to the energy of the interacting radiation.

title: How to reuse a one-time pad and other notes on authentication, encryption and protection of quantum information

abstract: Quantum information is a valuable resource which can be encrypted in order to protect it. We consider the size of the one-time pad that is needed to protect quantum information in a number of cases. The situation is dramatically different from the classical case: we prove that one can recycle the one-time pad without compromising security. The protocol for recycling relies on detecting whether eavesdropping has occurred, and further relies on the fact that information contained in the encrypted quantum state cannot be fully accessed. We prove the security of recycling rates when authentication of quantum states is accepted, and when it is rejected. We note that recycling schemes respect a general law of cryptography which we prove relating the size of private keys, sent qubits, and encrypted messages. We discuss applications for encryption of quantum information in light of the resources needed for teleportation. Potential uses include the protection of resources such as entanglement and the memory of quantum computers. We also introduce another application: encrypted secret sharing and find that one can even reuse the private key that is used to encrypt a classical message. In a number of cases, one finds that the amount of private key needed for authentication or protection is smaller than in the general case.

Two specific examples are given based on two different ways to generalize Pauli matrices to $d$ dimensional Hilbert space and the case for identical particle system is also considered. In addition, applying our measure to mixed state case will give a sufficient condition for entanglement.

abstract: Coherent population trapping is shown to occur in a driven symmetric double-well potential in the strong-field regime. The system parameters have been chosen to reproduce the $0^{-}\leftrightarrow 3^{+}$ transition of the inversion mode of the ammonia molecule. For a molecule initially prepared in its lower doublet we find that, under certain circumstances, the $3^{+}$ level remains unpopulated, and this occurs in spite of the fact that the laser field is resonant with the $0^{-}\leftrightarrow 3^{+}$ transition and intense enough so as to strongly mix the $0^{+}$ and $0^{-}$ ground states. This counterintuitive result constitutes a coherent population trapping phenomenon of nonperturbative origin which cannot be accounted for with the usual models. We propose an analytic nonperturbative model which accounts correctly for the observed phenomenon.

The predictions of the model are corroborated by an exact numerical calculation.

We illustrate in detail that unconventional nontrivial two-qubit geometric gates with built-in fault tolerant geometric features can be implemented in real physical systems.

abstract: In this letter we present a method for increasing the coherence time of praseodymium hyperfine ground state transitions in Pr^3+:Y_2SiO_5 by the application of a specific external magnetic field. The magnitude and angle of the external field is applied such that the Zeeman splitting of a hyperfine transition is at a critical point in three dimensions, making the first order Zeeman shift vanishingly small for the transition. This reduces the influence of the magnetic interactions between the praseodymium ions and the spins in the host lattice on the transition frequency. Using this method a phase memory time of 82ms was observed, a value two orders of magnitude greater than previously reported. It is shown that the residual dephasing is amenable quantum error correction.

abstract: We investigate the transient phenomenon or property of the propagation of an optical probe field in a medium consisting of many $\Lambda$-type three-level atoms coupled to this probe field and an classical driven field. We observe a hidden symmetry and obtain an exact solution for this light propagation problem by means of the spectral generating method. This solution enlightens us to propose a practical protocol implementing the quantum memory robust for quantum decoherence in a crystal. As an transient dynamic process this solution also manifests an exotic result that a wave-packet of light will split into three packets propagating at different group velocities. It is argued that "super-luminal group velocity" and "sub-luminal group velocity" can be observed simultaneously in the same system. This interesting phenomenon is expected to be demonstrated experimentally.

abstract: A widely accepted definition of ``quantum chaos'' is ``the behavior of a quantum system whose \emph{classical} \emph{limit is chaotic}''. The dynamics of quantum-chaotic systems is nevertheless very different from that of their classical counterparts. A fundamental reason for that is the linearity of Schr{\"o}dinger equation. In this paper, we study the quantum dynamics of an ultra-cold quantum degenerate gas in a tilted optical lattice and show that it displays features very close to \emph{classical} chaos. We show that its phase space is organized according to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem.

abstract: In a recent paper, Geyer, Klimchitskaya, and Mostepanenko [Phys. Rev. A 67, 062102 (2003); quant-ph/0306038] proposed the final solution of the problem of temperature correction to the Casimir force between real metals. The basic idea was that one cannot use the dielectric permittivity in the frequency region where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the metal. Instead, the surface impedance approach is proposed as a solution of all contradictions. The purpose of this comment is to show that (i) the main idea contradicts to the fluctuation dissipation theorem, (ii) the proposed method to calculate the force gives wrong value of the temperature correction since the contribution of low frequency fluctuations is calculated with the impedance which is not applicable at low frequencies. In the impedance approach the right result for the reflection coefficients in the n=0 term of the Lifshitz formula is given.

abstract: We investigate two schemes of the quantum teleportation with a $W$ state, which belongs to a different class from a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger class. In the first scheme, the $W$ state is shared by three parties one of whom, called a sender, performs a Bell measurement. It is shown that quantum information of an unknown state is split between two parties and recovered with a certain probability. In the second scheme, a sender takes two particles of the $W$ state and performs positive operator valued measurements in two ways. For two schemes, we calculate the success probability and the average fidelity. We show that the average fidelity of the second scheme cannot exceed that of the first one.

abstract: A new approach to play games quantum mechanically is proposed. We consider two players who perform measurements in an EPR-type setting. The payoff relations are defined as functions of *correlations*, i.e. without reference to classical or quantum mechanics. Classical bi-matrix games are reproduced if the input states are classical and perfectly anti-correlated, that is, for a classical correlation game. However, for a quantum correlation game, with an entangled singlet state as input, qualitatively different solutions are obtained. For example, the Prisoners' Dilemma acquires a Nash equilibrium if the players both apply a mixed strategy. It appears to be conceptually impossible to reproduce the properties of quantum correlation games within the framework of classical games.

abstract: We introduce a Gaussian version of the entanglement of formation adapted to bipartite Gaussian states by considering decompositions into pure Gaussian states only. We show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone under Gaussian operations and provide a simplified computation for states of arbitrary many modes. For the case of one mode per site the remaining variational problem can be solved analytically. If the considered state is in addition symmetric with respect to interchanging the two modes, we prove additivity of the considered entanglement measure. Moreover, in this case and considering only a single copy, our entanglement measure coincides with the true entanglement of formation.

We discuss the implications of our results from both the fundamental as well as quantum computational perspective.

abstract: We prove a Gleason-type theorem for the quantum probability rule using frame functions defined on positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), as opposed to the restricted class of orthogonal projection-valued measures used in the original theorem. The advantage of this method is that it works for two-dimensional quantum systems (qubits) and even for vector spaces over rational fields--settings where the standard theorem fails. Furthermore, unlike the method necessary for proving the original result, the present one is rather elementary. In the case of a qubit, we investigate similar results for frame functions defined upon various restricted classes of POVMs. For the so-called trine measurements, the standard quantum probability rule is again recovered.

abstract: It is generally believed that entanglement is essential for quantum computing. We present here a few simple examples in which quantum computing without entanglement is better than anything classically achievable, in terms of the reliability of the outcome after a xed number of oracle calls. Using a separable (that is, unentangled) n-qubit state, we show that the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and the Simon problem can be solved more reliably by a quantum computer than by the best possible classical algorithm, even probabilistic. We conclude that: (a) entanglement is not essential for quantum computing; and (b) some advantage of quantum algorithms over classical algorithms persists even when the quantum state contains an arbitrarily small amount of information|that is, even when the state is arbitrarily close to being totally mixed.

abstract: The Grover quantum search algorithm is generalized to deal with an arbitrary mixed initial state. The probability to measure a marked state as a function of time is calculated, and found to depend strongly on the specific initial state. The form of the function, though, remains as it is in the case of initial pure state. We study the role of the von Neumann entropy of the initial state, and show that the entropy cannot be a measure for the usefulness of the algorithm. We give few examples and show that for some extremely mixed initial states carrying high entropy, the generalized Grover algorithm is considerably faster than any classical algorithm.

abstract: We identify the characteristic times of the evolution of a quantum wave generated by a point source with a sharp onset in an absorbing medium. The "traversal'' or "B\"uttiker-Landauer'' time (which grows linearly with the distance to the source) for the Hermitian, non-absorbing case is substituted by three different characteristic quantities. One of them describes the arrival of a maximum of the density calculated with respect to position, but the maximum with respect to time for a given position becomes independent of the distance to the source and is given by the particle's ``survival time'' in the medium. This later effect, unlike the Hartman effect, occurs for injection frequencies under or above the cut-off, and for arbitrarily large distances. A possible physical realization is proposed by illuminating a two-level atom with a detuned laser.

abstract: The notion of ``radiating'' and ``non-radiating'' current sources in classical electrodynamics plays an important role in calculations of direct and inverse electromagnetic scattering problems. Such a decomposition of the current is central for the notion of localized non-radiating electromagnetic modes. A completely quantum electrodynamic view is explored in this work. Photon emission and absorption current sources are classified as being either radiating or non-radiating. This quantum classification corresponds, respectively and exactly, to the notion of ``real'' and ``virtual'' photon processes. Causal properties of both real and virtual electromagnetic fields are discussed.

abstract: We have developed a fully quantized model for EIT in which the decay rates are taken into account. In this model, the general form of the susceptibility and group velocity of the probe laser we obtained are operators. Their expectation value and fluctuation can be obtained on the Fock space. Furthermore the uncertainty of the group velocity under very weak intensity of the controlling laser and the uncertainty relation between the phase operator of coupling laser and the group velocity are approximately given. Considering the decay rates of various levels, we may analyze the probe laser near resonance in detail and calculate the fluctuation in both absorption and dispersion. We also discuss how the fully quantized model reduces to a semiclassical model when the mean photon numbers of the coupling laser is getting large.

The conception is based on the occurrence of double-exciton dark states due to the collective destructive quantum interference of the emissions from the two atomic ensembles. With an adiabatically coherence manipulation for the atom-field couplings by stimulated Ramann scattering, the dark states will extrapolate from an exciton state of an ensemble to that of another. This realizes the transport of quantum information among atomic ensembles.

abstract: The study of conditional $q$-entropies in composite quantum systems has recently been the focus of considerable interest, particularly in connection with the problem of separability. The $q$-entropies depend on the density matrix $\rho$ through the quantity $\omega_q = Tr\rho^q$, and admit as a particular instance the standard von Neumann entropy in the limit case $q\to 1$. A comprehensive numerical survey of the space of pure and mixed states of bipartite systems is here performed, in order to determine the volumes in state space occupied by those states exhibiting various special properties related to the signs of their conditional $q$-entropies and to their connections with other separability-related features, including the majorization condition. Different values of the entropic parameter $q$ are considered, as well as different values of the dimensions $N_1$ and $N_2$ of the Hilbert spaces associated with the constituting subsystems. Special emphasis is paid to the analysis of the monotonicity properties, both as a function of $q$ and as a function of $N_1$ and $N_2$, of the various entropic functionals considered.

The characteristic equation of the corresponding hamiltonian is not separable in three degrees of freedom for the hydrogen atom.

abstract: The shot-noise detection limit in current high-precision atomic magnetometry is a manifestation of quantum fluctuations that scale as the square root of N in an ensemble of N particles. However, there is a general expectation that the reduced projection noise provided by conditional spin-squeezing could be exploited to surpass the conventional shot-noise limit. We show that continuous measurement coupled with quantum Kalman filtering provides an optimal procedure for magnetic detection limits that scale with 1/N, the Heisenberg squeezing limit. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of optimal estimation procedures for high bandwidth precision magnetometry.

Using a specific example, we clarify some issues related to non--Markovian dynamics, non--Lindblad type dynamics, and positivity of the density matrix.

abstract: We derive a family of necessary separability criteria for finite-dimensional systems based on inequalities for variances of observables. We show that every pure bipartite entangled state violates some of these inequalities. Furthermore, a family of bound entangled states and true multipartite entangled states can be detected. The inequalities also allow to distinguish between different classes of true tripartite entanglement for qubits. We formulate an equivalent criterion in terms of covariance matrices. This allows us to apply criteria known from the regime of continuous variables to finite-dimensional systems.

abstract: In this paper we show that sufficient multi-partite quantum entanglement helps in fair and unbiased election of a leader in a distributed network of processors with only linear classical communication complexity. We show that a total of $O(\log n)$ distinct multi-partite maximally entanglement sets (ebits) are capable of supporting such a protocol in the presence of nodes that may lie and thus be biased. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. We also demonstrate the difficulty of performing unbiased and fair election of a leader with linear classical communication complexity in the absence of quantum entanglement even if all nodes have perfect random bit generators. We show that the presence of a sufficient number $O(n/\log n)$ of biased agents leads to a non-zero limiting probability of biased election of the leader, whereas, the presence of a smaller number $O(\log n)$ of biased agents matters little. We define two new related complexity classes motivated by the our leader election problem and discuss a few open questions.

abstract: In this paper we give several equivalent formulations of the additivity conjecture for constrained channels, which formally is substantially stronger than the unconstrained additivity. To this end a characteristic property of the optimal ensemble for such a channel is derived, generalizing the maximal distance property. It is shown that the additivity conjecture for constrained channels holds true for certain nontrivial classes of channels. Recently P. Shor showed that conjectured additivity properties for several quantum information quantities are in fact equivalent. After giving an algebraic formulation for the Shor's channel extension, its main asymptotic property is proved. It is then used to show that additivity for two constrained channels can be reduced to the same problem for unconstrained channels, and hence, "global" additivity for channels with arbitrary constraints is equivalent to additivity without constraints.

(Naive) deformation quantization, the multiresolution representations and the variational approach are the key points. We construct the solutions via the multiscale expansions in the generalized coherent states or high-localized nonlinear eigenmodes in the base of the compactly supported wavelets and the wavelet packets. We demonstrate the appearance of (stable) localized patterns (waveletons) and consider entanglement and decoherence as possible applications.

abstract: It has been proposed that photon-exchange effects in atom-photon interactions could lead to greatly enhanced optical nonlinearities. These might have widespread application (e.g. quantum information). Here we demonstrate experimentally that such exchange effects can indeed enhance the probability of real absorption of photon pairs. Using nonclassical pairs of photons with variable time separation, we observe a maximum suppression of pair transmission by at least 5% with respect to the result for uncorrelated photons.

abstract: We present two polarization-based protocols for quantum key distribution. The protocols encode key bits in noiseless subspaces or subsystems, and so can function over a quantum channel subjected to an arbitrary degree of collective noise, as occurs, for instance, due to rotation of polarizations in an optical fiber. These protocols can be implemented using only entangled photon-pair sources, single-photon rotations, and single-photon detectors. Thus, our proposals offer practical and realistic alternatives to existing schemes for quantum key distribution over optical fibers without resorting to interferometry or two-way quantum communication, thereby circumventing, respectively, the need for high precision timing and the threat of Trojan horse attacks.

abstract: We investigate consequences of allowing the Hilbert space of a quantum system to have a time-dependent metric. For a given possibly nonstationary quantum system, we show that the requirement of having a unitary Schreodinger time-evolution identifies the metric with a positive-definite (Ermakov-Lewis) dynamical invariant of the system. Therefore the geometric phases are determined by the metric. We construct a unitary map relating a given time-independent Hilbert space to the time-dependent Hilbert space defined by a positive-definite dynamical invariant. This map defines a transformation that changes the metric of the Hilbert space but leaves the Hamiltonian of the system invariant. We propose to identify this phenomenon with a quantum mechanical analogue of the principle of general covariance of General Relativity. We comment on the implications of this principle for geometrically equivalent quantum systems and investigate the underlying symmetry group.

abstract: Some relations between physics and finitary and infinitary mathematics are explored in the context of a many-minds interpretation of quantum theory. The analogy between mathematical ``existence'' and physical ``existence'' is considered from the point of view of philosophical idealism. Some of the ways in which infinitary mathematics arises in modern mathematical physics are discussed. Empirical science has led to the mathematics of quantum theory. This in turn can be taken to suggest a picture of reality involving possible minds and the physical laws which determine their probabilities. In this picture, finitary and infinitary mathematics play separate roles. It is argued that mind, language, and finitary mathematics have similar prerequisites, in that each depends on the possibility of possibilities. The infinite, on the other hand, can be described but never experienced, and yet it seems that sets of possibilities and the physical laws which define their probabilities can be described most simply in terms of infinitary mathematics.

In the Feshbach-Villars representation the annihilation operator for a linear potential is defined and its eigenstates are obtained. Although the energy levels in this case are not equally-spaced, depending on the eigenvalues of the annihilation operator, the states are nearly coherent and squeezed. The relativistic Poschl-Teller potential is introduced. It is shown that its energy levels are equally-spaced. The coherence of time evolution of the eigenstates of the annihilation operator for this potential is evaluated.

abstract: Dynamics of entanglement is investigated on the basis of exactly solvable models of multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR spin dynamics. It is shown that the time evolution of MQ coherences of systems of coupled nuclear spins in solids is directly connected with dynamics of the quantum entanglement. We studied analytically dynamics of entangled states for two- and three-spin systems coupled by the dipole-dipole interaction. In this case dynamics of the quantum entanglement is uniquely determined by the time evolution of MQ coherences of the second order. The real part of the density matrix describing MQ dynamics in solids is responsible for MQ coherences of the zeroth order while its imaginary part is responsible for the second order. Thus, one can conclude that dynamics of the entanglement is connected with transitions from the real part of the density matrix to the imaginary one and vice versa. A pure state which generalizes the GHZ and W states is found. Different measures of the entanglement of this state are analyzed for three-partite systems.

abstract: Spin squeezing via atom-field interactions is considered within the context of the Tavis-Cummings model. An ensemble of N two-level atoms interacts with a quantized cavity field. For all the atoms initially in their ground states, it is shown that spin squeezing of both the atoms and the field can be achieved provided the initial state of the cavity field has coherence between number states differing by 2. Most of the discussion is restricted to the case of a cavity field initially in a coherent state, but initial squeezed states for the field are also discussed. Optimal conditions for obtaining squeezing are obtained. An analytic solution is found that is valid in the limit that the number of atoms is much greater than unity and is also much larger than the average number of photons, inititally in the coherent state of the cavity field. In this limit, the degree of spin squeezing increases with increasing a, even though the field more closely resembles a classical field for which no spin squeezing could be achieved.

abstract: Nonlinear optical response and optical coherence of excitons in semiconductor dense quantum dots in GaAs single quantum wells has been studied by using photon echo techniques. At low temperatures, the optical coherence is estimated to be 2 ns from the decay curve in the photon echo signal. Rabi oscillations are also observed. Unlike the results for a single quantum dot in the literature to date, the oscillation shows nonlinear behavior affected strongly by the pre-excited carrier density. The results can be explained by the theory of the local field correction originating from exciton-exciton interaction between the inter dots.

abstract: We consider insulating phases of cold spin-1 bosonic particles with antiferromagnetic interactions, such as Na-23, in optical lattices. We show that spin-exchange interactions give rise to several distinct phases, which differ in their spin correlations. In two- and three- dimensional lattices insulating phases with odd number of particles per site are always nematic. For insulating states with even number of particles per site there is always a spin-singlet phase and there may also be a first-order transition into the nematic phase. The nematic phase breaks spin rotational symmetry, but preserves time reversal symmetry, and has gapless spin-wave excitations. The spin singlet phase does not break spin symmetry and has a gap to all excitations. In one-dimensional lattices insulating phases with odd number of particles per site always have a regime where translational symmetry is broken and the ground state is dimerized. We discuss signatures of various phases in Bragg scattering and time-of-flight measurements.

abstract: Using a simple model for nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling between two energy bands of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a periodic potential, we find that the tunneling rates for the two directions of tunneling are not the same. Tunneling from the ground state to the excited state is enhanced by the nonlinearity, whereas in the opposite direction it is suppressed. These findings are confirmed by numerical simulations of the condensate dynamics. Measuring the tunneling rates for a condensate of rubidium atoms in an optical lattice, we have found experimental evidence for this asymmetry.

abstract: We consider an array of Cooper Pair Boxes, each of which is coupled to a superconducting reservoir by a capacitive tunnel junction. We discuss two effects that probe not just the quantum nature of the islands, but also of the superconducting reservoir coupled to them. These are analogues to the well-known quantum optical effects `superradiance,' and `revival.' When revival is extended to multiple systems, we find that `entanglement revival' can also be observed. In order to study the above effects, we utilise a highly simplified model for these systems in which all the single-electron energy eigenvalues are set to be the same (the strong coupling limit), as are the charging energies of the Cooper Pair Boxes, allowing the whole system to be represented by two large coupled quantum spins. Although this simplification is drastic, the model retains the main features necessary to capture the phenomena of interest. Given the progress in superconducting box experiments over recent years, it is possible that experiments to investigate both of these interesting quantum coherent phenomena could be performed in the forseeable future.

Static electric fields are used to implement a universal set of quantum gates, via the spin-orbit and exchange couplings. Initialization and measurement can be performed either by spin injection from/to ferromagnets, or by using spin filters and mesoscopic spin polarizing beam-splitters. The vulnerability of this proposal to various sources of error is estimated by numerical simulations. We also assess the suitability of various materials currently used in nanotechnology for an actual implementation of our model.

This result opens new possibilities for the design of a quantum dot spin quantum computer where g-factor and T_{1} can be engineered by manipulating the spin-orbit coupling through external gates.

abstract: Using an asymptotic phase representation of the particle density operator $\hat{\rho}(z)$ in the one-dimensional harmonic trap, the part $\delta \hat{\rho}_F(z)$ which describes the Friedel oscillations is extracted. The expectation value $<\delta \hat{\rho}_F(z)>$ with respect to the interacting ground state requires the calculation of the mean square average of a properly defined phase operator. This calculation is performed analytically for the Tomonaga-Luttinger model with harmonic confinement. It is found that the envelope of the Friedel oscillations at zero temperature decays with the boundary exponent $\nu = (K+1)/2$ away from the classical boundaries. This value differs from that known for open boundary conditions or strong pinning impurities. The soft boundary in the present case thus modifies the decay of Friedel oscillations. The case of two components is also discussed.

abstract: Using the pseudospin representation and the SU(2) phase operators we introduce a complex parameter to characterize both infinite and finite superconducting systems. While in the bulk limit the parameter becomes identical to the conventional order parameter, in the nanoscopic limit its modulus reduces to the number parity effect parameter and its phase takes discrete values. We evaluate the Josephson coupling energy and show that in bulk superconductor it reproduces the conventional expression and in the nanoscopic limit it leads to quantized Josephson effect. Finally, we study the phase flow or dual Josephson effect in a superconductor with fixed number of electrons.

abstract: A periodically kicked ring of a Bose-Einstein condensate is considered as a nonlinear generalization of the quantum kicked rotor. For weak interactions between atoms, periodic motion (anti-resonance) becomes quasiperiodic (quantum beating) but remains stable. There exists a critical strength of interactions beyond which quasiperiodic motion becomes chaotic, resulting in an instability of the condensate manifested by exponential growth in the number of noncondensed atoms. Similar behavior is observed for dynamically localized states (essentially quasiperiodic motions), where stability remains for weak interactions but is destroyed by strong interactions.

We find clear evidence for a line of continuous quantum phase transitions for subohmic bath exponents 0<s<1; the line terminates in the well-known Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at s=1. Contact is made with results from perturbative renormalization group, and various other applications are outlined.

abstract: We show that it is possible to cool a nanomechanical resonator mode to its ground state. The proposed technique is based on resonant laser excitation of a phonon sideband of an embedded quantum dot. The strength of the sideband coupling is determined directly by the difference between the electron-phonon couplings of the initial and final states of the quantum dot optical transition. Possible applications of the technique we describe include generation of non-classical states of mechanical motion.

abstract: In this paper we derive the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality for the full electron counting statistics in a mesoscopic multiterminal conductor and we discuss its properties. We first consider the idealized situation in which a flux of entangled electrons is generated by an entangler. Given a certain average number of incoming entangled electrons, the CH inequality can be evaluated for different numbers of transmitted particles. Strong violations occur when the number of transmitted charges on the two terminals is the same ($Q_1=Q_2$), whereas no violation is found for $Q_1\ne Q_2$. We then consider two actual setups that can be realized experimentally. The first one consists of a three terminal normal beam splitter and the second one of a hybrid superconducting structure. Interestingly, we find that the CH inequality is violated for the three terminal normal device. The maximum violation scales as 1/M and $1/M^2$ for the entangler and normal beam splitter, respectively, 2$M$ being the average number of injected electrons. As expected, we find full violation of the CH inequality in the case of the superconducting system.

abstract: We formulate the quantum mechanics of the solutions of a Klein-Gordon-type field equation: (\partial_t^2+D)\psi(t)=0, where D is a positive-definite operator acting in a Hilbert space \tilde H. We determine all the positive-definite inner products on the space H of the solutions of such an equation and establish their physical equivalence. We use a simple realization of the unique Hilbert space structure on H to construct the observables of the theory explicitly. In general, there are infinitely many choices for the Hamiltonian each leading to a different notion of time-evolution in H. Among these is a particular choice that generates t-translations in H and identifies t with time whenever D is t-independent. For a t-dependent D, we show that t-translations never correspond to unitary evolutions in H, and t cannot be identified with time. We apply these ideas to develop a formulation of quantum cosmology based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker model coupled to a real scalar field. We solve the Hilbert space problem, construct the observables, introduce a new set of the wave functions of the universe, reformulate the quantum theory in terms of the latter, reduce the problem of time to the determination of a Hamiltonian operator acting in L^2(\R)\oplus L^2(\R), show that the factor-ordering problem is irrelevant for the kinematics of the quantum theory, and propose a formulation of the dynamics. Our method allows for a genuine probabilistic interpretation and a unitary Schreodinger time-evolution.

abstract: I review basic principles of the quantum mechanical measurement process in view of their implications for a quantum theory of general relativity. It turns out that a clock as an external classical device associated with the observer plays an essential role. This leads me to postulate a ``principle of the integrity of the observer''. It essentially requires the observer to be part of a classical domain connected throughout the measurement process. Mathematically this naturally leads to a formulation of quantum mechanics as a kind of topological quantum field theory. Significantly, quantities with a direct interpretation in terms of a measurement process are associated only with amplitudes for connected boundaries of compact regions of space-time. I discuss some implications of my proposal such as in-out duality for states, delocalization of the ``collapse of the wave function'' and locality of the description. Differences to existing approaches to quantum gravity are also highlighted.

abstract: The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity is related to the fact that the canonical description is based on the prior choice of a spacelike foliation, hence making a reference to a spacetime metric. However, the metric is expected to be a dynamical, fluctuating quantity in quantum gravity. We show how this problem can be solved in the histories formulation of general relativity. We implement the 3+1 decomposition using metric-dependent foliations which remain spacelike with respect to all possible Lorentzian metrics. This allows us to find an explicit relation of covariant and canonical quantities which preserves the spacetime character of the canonical description. In this new construction, we also have a coexistence of the spacetime diffeomorphisms group, and the Dirac algebra of constraints.

abstract: We show in detail how the histories description of general relativity carries representations of both the spacetime diffeomorphisms group and the Dirac algebra of constraints. We show that the introduction of metric-dependent equivariant foliations leads to the crucial result that the canonical constraints are invariant under the action of spacetime diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, there exists a representation of the group of generalised spacetime mappings that are functionals of the four-metric: this is a spacetime analogue of the group originally defined by Bergmann and Komar in the context of the canonical formulation of general relativity. Finally, we discuss the possible directions for the quantization of gravity in histories theory.

abstract: In two recent papers by the author, a new approach was suggested for quantising space-time, or space. This involved developing a procedure for quantising a system whose configuration space--or history-theory analogue--is the set of objects, $\Ob\Q$, in a (small) category $\Q$. The quantum states in this approach are cross-sections of a bundle $A\leadsto\K[A]$ of Hilbert spaces over $\Ob\Q$. The Hilbert spaces $\K[A]$, $A\in\Ob\Q$, depend strongly on the object $A$, and have to be chosen so as to get an irreducible, faithful, representation of the basic `category quantisation monoid'. In the present paper, we develop a different approach in which the state vectors are complex-valued functions on the set of {\em arrows} in $\Q$. This throws a new light on the Hilbert bundle scheme: in particular, we recover the results of that approach in the, physically important, example when $\Q$ is a small category of finite sets.

abstract: We investigate the effect of quantum metric fluctuations on qubits that are gravitationally coupled to a background spacetime. In our first example, we study the propagation of a qubit in flat spacetime whose metric is subject to flat quantum fluctuations with a Gaussian spectrum. We find that these fluctuations cause two changes in the state of the qubit: they lead to a phase drift, as well as the expected exponential suppression (decoherence) of the off-diagonal terms in the density matrix. Secondly, we calculate the decoherence of a qubit in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. The no-hair theorems suggest a quantum state for the metric in which the black hole's mass fluctuates with a thermal spectrum at the Hawking temperature. Again, we find that the orbiting qubit undergoes decoherence and a phase drift that both depend on the temperature of the black hole. Thirdly, we study the interaction of coherent and squeezed gravitational waves with a qubit in uniform motion. Finally, we investigate the decoherence of an accelerating qubit in Minkowski spacetime due to the Unruh effect. In this case decoherence is not due to fluctuations in the metric, but instead is caused by coupling (which we model with a standard Hamiltonian) between the qubit and the thermal cloud of Unruh particles bathing it. When the accelerating qubit is entangled with a stationary partner, the decoherence should induce a corresponding loss in teleportation fidelity.

abstract: It is proposed that the Schrodinger equation for a free point particle has non-linear corrections which depend on the mass of the particle. It is assumed that the corrections become extremely small when the mass is much smaller or much larger than a critical value (the critical value being related to but smaller than Planck mass). The corrections become significant when the mass is close to this critical value and could play a role in explaining wave-function collapse. It appears that such corrections are not ruled out by present day experimental tests of the Schrodinger equation. Corrections to the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are calculated.

The energy spectrum of a spatially homogeneous SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs is calculated within thermofield dynamics. Level statistics of the spectra is studied by plotting nearest-level spacing distribution histograms. It is found that finite temperature effects lead to a strengthening of chaotic effects, i.e. spectrum which has Poissonian distribution at zero temperature has Gaussian distribution at finite-temperature.

abstract: The fine structure constant, alpha, is shown to be proportional to the ratio of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force of the electron, and provides a new representation, which is global across all unit systems. Consequently, a variation in alpha was shown to manifest due to a differential change in the fraction of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force, while a variation in hcross.c was shown to manifest due to the common mode change. The representation is discussed with respect to the running of the fine structure constant at high energies (small distances), and a putative temporal drift. It is shown that the running of the fine structure constant is due to equal components of electric screening (polarization of vacuum) and magnetic anti-screening (magnetization of vacuum), which cause the perceived quanta of electric charge to increase at small distances, while the magnetic flux quanta decreases. This introduces the concept of the bare magnetic flux quanta as well as the bare electric charge. With regards to temporal drift, it is confirmed that it is impossible to determine which fundamental constant is varying if alpha varies.

abstract: We consider the partition function for a matrix model with a global unitary invariant energy function. We show that the averages over the partition function of global unitary invariant trace polynomials of the matrix variables are the same when calculated with any choice of a global unitary fixing, while averages of such polynomials without a trace define matrix-valued correlation functions, that depend on the choice of unitary fixing. The unitary fixing is formulated within the standard Faddeev-Popov framework, in which the squared Vandermonde determinant emerges as a factor of the complete Faddeev-Popov determinant. We give the ghost representation for the FP determinant, and the corresponding BRST invariance of the unitary-fixed partition function. The formalism is relevant for deriving Ward identities obeyed by matrix-valued correlation functions.

abstract: I propose to formalize quantum theories as topological quantum field theories in a generalized sense, associating state spaces with boundaries of arbitrary (and possibly finite) regions of space-time. I further propose to obtain such ``general boundary'' quantum theories through a generalized path integral quantization. I show how both, non-relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory can be given a ``general boundary'' formulation. Surprisingly, even in the non-relativistic case, features normally associated with quantum field theory emerge from consistency conditions. This includes states with arbitrary particle number and pair creation. I also note how three dimensional quantum gravity is an example for a realization of both proposals and suggest to apply them to four dimensional quantum gravity.

abstract: We propose a systematic method to construct quasi-solvable quantum many-body systems having permutation symmetry. By the introduction of elementary symmetric polynomials and suitable choice of a solvable sector, the algebraic structure of sl(M+1) naturally emerges. The procedure to solve the canonical-form condition for the two-body problem is presented in detail. It is shown that the resulting two-body quasi-solvable model can be uniquely generalized to the M-body system for arbitrary M under the consideration of the GL(2,K) symmetry. An intimate relation between quantum solvability and supersymmetry is found. With the aid of the GL(2,K) symmetry, we classify the obtained quasi-solvable quantum many-body systems. It turns out that there are essentially five inequivalent models of Inozemtsev type. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of including M-body (M>=3) interaction terms without destroying the quasi-solvability.

The result is illustrated on finding the spectral properties in cases when $\Gamma$ is a ring or a star. Furthermore, we use this method to indicate that scattering on an infinite curve $\Gamma$ which is locally close to a loop shape or has multiple bends may exhibit resonances due to quantum tunneling or repeated reflections.

abstract: An algebraic description of basic discrete symmetries (space inversion P, time reversal T, charge conjugation C and their combinations PT, CP, CT, CPT) is studied. Discrete subgroups {1,P,T,PT} of orthogonal groups of multidimensional spaces over the fields of real and complex numbers are considered in terms of fundamental automorphisms of Clifford algebras. The fundamental automorphisms form a finite group of order 4. The charge conjugation is represented by a pseudoautomorphism of the Clifford algebra. Such a description allows one to extend the automorphism group. It is shown that an extended automorphism group (CPT-group) forms a finite group of order 8. The group structure and isomorphisms between the extended automorphism groups and finite groups are studied in detail. It is proved that there exist 64 different realizations of CPT-group. An extension of universal coverings (Clifford-Lipschitz groups) of the orthogonal groups is given in terms of CPT-structures which include well-known Shirokov-Dabrowski PT-structures as a particular case.

abstract: In the context of a two-parameter $(\alpha, \beta)$ deformation of the canonical commutation relation leading to nonzero minimal uncertainties in both position and momentum, the harmonic oscillator spectrum and eigenvectors are determined by using techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics combined with shape invariance under parameter scaling. The resulting supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians correspond to different masses and frequencies. The exponential spectrum is proved to reduce to a previously found quadratic spectrum whenever one of the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ vanishes, in which case shape invariance under parameter translation occurs. In the special case where $\alpha = \beta \ne 0$, the oscillator Hamiltonian is shown to coincide with that of the q-deformed oscillator with $q > 1$ and its eigenvectors are therefore $n$-$q$-boson states. In the general case where $0 \ne \alpha \ne \beta \ne 0$, the eigenvectors are constructed as linear combinations of $n$-$q$-boson states by resorting to a Bargmann representation of the latter and to $q$-differential calculus. They are finally expressed in terms of a $q$-exponential and little $q$-Jacobi polynomials.

abstract: We study the entropy of pure shift-invariant states on a quantum spin chain. Unlike the classical case, the local restrictions to intervals of length $N$ are typically mixed and have therefore a non-zero entropy $S_N$ which is, moreover, monotonically increasing in $N$. We are interested in the asymptotics of the total entropy. We investigate in detail a class of states derived from quasi-free states on a CAR algebra. These are characterised by a measurable subset of the unit interval. As the entropy density is known to vanishes, $S_N$ is sublinear in $N$. For states corresponding to unions of finitely many intervals, $S_N$ is shown to grow slower than $(\log N)^2$. Numerical calculations suggest a $\log N$ behaviour. For the case with infinitely many intervals, we present a class of states for which the entropy $S_N$ increases as $N^\alpha$ where $\alpha$ can take any value in $(0,1)$.

abstract: A new geometry of optical lattice is proposed, namely a lattice made of a 1D stack of ring traps. It is obtained though the interference pattern of two counterpropagating beams: one of the beam is a standard gaussian beam, while the other one is a hollow beam obtained through a setup with two conical lenses. The resulting lattice is shown to have a high filling rate and a good confinement, so that it could be loaded directly from a MOT with applications in the domain of quantum computing, or with a Bose-Einstein condensate, which would have in this case a 1D ring geometry.
