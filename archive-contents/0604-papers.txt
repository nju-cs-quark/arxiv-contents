abstract: Quantum circuits are time dependent diagrams describing the process of quantum computation. Usually, a quantum algorithm must be mapped into a quantum circuit. Optimal synthesis of quantum circuits is intractable and heuristic methods must be employed. With the use of heuristics, the optimality of circuits is no longer guaranteed. In this paper, we consider a local optimization technique based on templates to simplify and reduce the depth of non-optimal quantum circuits. We present and analyze templates in the general case, and provide particular details for the circuits composed of NOT, CNOT and controlled-sqrt-of-NOT gates. We apply templates to optimize various common circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates and quantum Boolean arithmetic circuits. We also show how templates can be used to compact the number of levels of a quantum circuit. The runtime of our implementation is small while the reduction in number of quantum gates and number of levels is significant.

abstract: An analytical calculation of the interaction geometry of two interlinked second-order nonlinear processes fulfilling phase-matching conditions is presented. The method is developed for type-I uniaxial crystals and gives the positions on a screen beyond the crystal of the entangled triplets generated by the interactions. The analytical results are compared to experiments realized in the macroscopic regime. Preliminary tests to identify the triplets are also performed based on intensity correlations.

abstract: We describe the influence of continuous measurement in a decaying system and the role of the distance from the detector to the initial location of the system. The detector is modeled first by a step absorbing potential. For a close and strong detector, the decay rate of the system is reduced; weaker detectors do not modify the exponential decay rate but suppress the long-time deviations above a coupling threshold. Nevertheless, these perturbing effects of measurement disappear by increasing the distance between the initial state and the detector, as well as by improving the efficiency of the detector.

abstract: The phase diagram of a simple area-preserving map, which was motivated by the quantum dynamics of cold atoms, is explored analytically and numerically. Periodic orbits of a given winding ratio are found to exist within wedge-shaped regions in the phase diagrams, which are analogous to the Arnol'd tongues which have been extensively studied for a variety of dynamical systems, mostly dissipative ones. A rich variety of bifurcations of various types are observed, as well as period doubling cascades. Stability of periodic orbits is analyzed in detail.

abstract: If there exists a classical, i.e. deterministic theory underlying quantum mechanics, an explanation must be found of the fact that the Hamiltonian, which is defined to be the operator that generates evolution in time, is bounded from below. The mechanism that can produce exactly such a constraint is identified in this paper. It is the fact that not all classical data are registered in the quantum description. Large sets of values of these data are assumed to be indistinguishable, forming equivalence classes. It is argued that this should be attributed to information loss, such as what one might suspect to happen during the formation and annihilation of virtual black holes. The nature of the equivalence classes is further elucidated, as it follows from the positivity of the Hamiltonian. Our world is assumed to consist of a very large number of subsystems that may be regarded as approximately independent, or weakly interacting with one another. As long as two (or more) sectors of our world are treated as being independent, they all must be demanded to be restricted to positive energy states only. What follows from these considerations is a unique definition of energy in the quantum system in terms of the periodicity of the limit cycles of the deterministic model.

abstract: We investigate the cases where a set $S$ of states $\{\ket{\psi_i} \}$ cannot be cloned by itself, but is clonable with the help of another system prepared in state $\hat{\rho}_i$. When $S$ is pair-wise nonorthogonal, it is known that one can generate the copy from $\hat{\rho}_i$ alone, with no interaction with the original system. Here we show that a set containing orthogonal pairs exhibits a property forming a striking contrast; For any such set, there is a choice of $\hat{\rho}_i$ that enables cloning only when the two systems are interacted in a purely quantum manner that is not achievable via classical communication.

abstract: We investigate which entanglement resources allow universal measurement-based quantum computation via single-qubit operations. We find that any entanglement feature exhibited by the 2D cluster state must also be present in any other universal resource. We obtain a powerful criterion to assess universality of graph states, by introducing an entanglement measure which necessarily grows unboundedly with the system size for all universal resource states. Furthermore, we prove that graph states associated with 2D lattices such as the hexagonal and triangular lattice are universal, and obtain the first example of a universal non-graph state.

We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, a non zero Berry phase is obtained only if a path in parameter space is followed that encircles the critical point. Furthermore, we investigate the precursors of this critical behavior for a system with finite size and obtain the leading order in the 1/N expansion of the Berry phase and its critical exponent.

In particular, for the harmonic oscillator perturbed by a cubic non-Hermitian term, we evaluate explicitly various transition amplitudes, for the situation when these systems are exposed to a monochromatic linearly polarized electric field.

abstract: Bipartite entanglement in the ground state of a chain of $N$ quantum spins can be quantified either by computing pairwise concurrence or by dividing the chain into two complementary subsystems. In the latter case the smaller subsystem is usually a single spin or a block of adjacent spins and the entanglement differentiates between critical and non-critical regimes. Here we extend this approach by considering a more general setting: our smaller subsystem $S_A$ consists of a {\it comb} of $L$ spins, spaced $p$ sites apart. Our results are thus not restricted to a simple `area law', but contain non-local information, parameterized by the spacing $p$. For the XX model we calculate the von-Neumann entropy analytically when $N\to \infty$ and investigate its dependence on $L$ and $p$. We find that an external magnetic field induces an unexpected length scale for entanglement in this case.

abstract: We have developed a rigorous quantum model of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear 1D photonic-band-gap structure based upon expansion of the field into monochromatic plane waves. The model provides a two-photon amplitude of a created photon pair. The spectra of the signal and idler fields, their intensity profiles in the time domain, as well as the coincidence-count interference pattern in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer are determined both for cw and pulsed pumping regimes in terms of the two-photon amplitude. A broad range of parameters characterizing the emitted down-converted fields can be used. As an example, a structure composed of 49 layers of GaN/AlN is analyzed as a suitable source of photon pairs having high efficiency.

abstract: In Echo experiments, imperfect time-reversal operations are performed on a subset of the total number of degrees of freedom. To capture the physics of these experiments, we introduce a partial fidelity, the Boltzmann echo, where only part of the system's degrees of freedom can be time-reversed. We present a semiclassical calculation of the Boltzmann echo. We show that, as the time-reversal operation is performed more and more accurately, the decay rate of the Boltzmann echo saturates at a value given by the decoherence rate of the controlled degrees of freedom due to their coupling to uncontrolled ones. We connect these results with NMR spin echo experiments.

The microscope has inherent advantages over existing techniques of scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope. Presently available experimental technology makes it possible to develop the device in the laboratory.

abstract: We use the quantum jump approach to study the entanglement dynamics of a quantum register, which is composed of two or three dipole-dipole coupled two-level atoms, interacting with a common environment. Our investigation of entanglement dynamics reflects that the environment has dual actions on the entanglement of the qubits in the model. While the environment destroys the entanglement induced by the coherent dipole-dipole interactions, it can produce stable entanglement between the qubits prepared initially in a separable state. The analysis shows that it is the entangled decoherence-free states contained as components in the initial state that contribute to the stable entanglement. Our study indicates how the environmental noise produces the entanglement and exposes the interplay of environmental noise and coherent interactions of qubits on the entanglement.

abstract: The high inertial sensitivity of atom interferometers has been used to build accelerometers and gyrometers but this sensitivity makes these interferometers very sensitive to the laboratory seismic noise. This seismic noise induces a phase noise which is large enough to reduce the fringe visibility in many cases. We develop here a model calculation of this phase noise in the case of Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers and we apply this model to our thermal lithium interferometer. We are thus able to explain the observed dependence of the fringe visibility with the diffraction order. The dynamical model developed in the present paper should be very useful to further reduce this phase noise in atom interferometers and this reduction should open the way to improved interferometers.

abstract: Positive matrices in SL(2,C) have a double physical interpretation; they can be either considered as "fuzzy projections" of a spin 1/2 quantum system, or as Lorentz boosts. In the present paper, concentrating on this second interpretation, we follow the clues given by Pertti Lounesto and, using the classical Clifford algebraic methods, interpret them as conformal maps of the "heavenly sphere" S^2. The fuzziness parameter of the first interpretation becomes the "boost velocity" in the second one. We discuss simple iterative function systems of such maps, and show that they lead to self--similar fractal patterns on S^2. The final section of this paper is devoted to an informal discussion of the relations between these concepts and the problems in the foundations of quantum theory, where the interplay between different kinds of algebras and maps may enable us to describe not only the continuous evolution of wave functions, but also quantum jumps and "events" that accompany these jumps. Paper dedicated to the memory of Pertti Lounesto.

abstract: We review our results on a mathematical dynamical theory for observables for open many-body quantum nonlinear bosonic systems for a very general class of Hamiltonians. We show that non-quadratic (nonlinear) terms in a Hamiltonian provide a singular "quantum" perturbation for observables in some "mesoscopic" region of parameters. In particular, quantum effects result in secular terms in the dynamical evolution, that grow in time. We argue that even for open quantum nonlinear systems in the deep quasi-classical region, these quantum effects can survive after decoherence and relaxation processes take place. We demonstrate that these quantum effects in open quantum systems can be observed, for example, in the frequency Fourier spectrum of the dynamical observables, or in the corresponding spectral density of noise. Estimates are presented for Bose-Einstein condensates, low temperature mechanical resonators, and nonlinear optical systems prepared in large amplitude coherent states. In particular, we show that for Bose-Einstein condensate systems the characteristic time of deviation of quantum dynamics for observables from the corresponding classical dynamics coincides with the characteristic time-scale of the well-known quantum nonlinear effect of phase diffusion.

abstract: The influence of imperfections on achievable secret-key generation rates of quantum key distribution protocols is investigated. As examples of relevant imperfections, we consider tagging of Alice's qubits and dark counts at Bob's detectors, while we focus on a powerful eavesdropping strategy which takes full advantage of tagged signals. It is demonstrated that error correction and privacy amplification based on a combination of a two-way classical communication protocol and asymmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes may significantly postpone the disastrous influence of dark counts. As a result, the distances are increased considerably over which a secret key can be distributed in optical fibres reliably. Results are presented for the four-state, the six-state, and the decoy-state protocols.

abstract: Very recently we have witnessed a new development of quantum information, the so-called continuous variable (CV) quantum information theory. Such a further development has been mainly due to the experimental and theoretical advantages offered by CV systems, i.e., quantum systems described by a set of observables, like position and momentum, which have a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues. According to this novel trend, quantum information protocols like quantum teleportation have been suitably extended to the CV framework. Here, we briefly review some mathematical tools relative to CV systems and we consequently develop the concepts of quantum entanglement and teleportation in the CV framework, by analogy with the qubit-based approach. Some connections between teleportation fidelity and entanglement properties of the underlying quantum channel are inspected. Next, we face the study of CV quantum teleportation networks where more users share a multipartite state and an arbitrary pair of them performs quantum teleportation. In this context, we show alternative protocols and we investigate the optimal strategy that maximizes the performance of the network.

abstract: Atom interferometers are very sensitive to accelerations and rotations. This property, which has some very interesting applications, induces a deleterious phase noise due to the seismic noise of the laboratory and this phase noise is sufficiently large to reduce the fringe visibility in many experiments. We develop a model calculation of this phase noise in the case of Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers and we apply this model to our thermal lithium interferometer. We are able to explain the observed phase noise which has been detected through the rapid dependence of the fringe visibility with the diffraction order. We think that the dynamical model developed in the present paper should be very useful to reduce the vibration induced phase noise in atom interferometers, making many new experiments feasible.

abstract: We study the decoherence properties of an entangled bipartite qubit system, represented by two two-level atoms that are individually coupled to non-Markovian reservoirs. This coupling ensures that the dynamical equations of the atoms can be treated independently. The non-Markovian reservoirs are described by a model which leads to an exact non-Markovian master equation of the Nakajima-Zwanzig form [J. Salo, S. M. Barnett, and S. Stenholm, Optics Commun. 259, 772 (2006)]. We consider the evolution of the entanglement of a two-atom state that is initially completely entangled, quantified by its concurrence. Collapses and revivals in the concurrence, induced by the memory effects of the reservoir, govern the dynamics of the entangled quantum system. These collapses and revivals in the concurrence are a strong manifestation of the non-Markovian reservoir.

For the $xxx$ cluster in the absence of magnetic field we prove that only the N=2 ferromagnetic cluster shows entanglement. An external magnetic field $B$ can only entangle $xxx$ anti-ferromagnetic clusters in certain regions of the $B-T$ plane. On the other hand, the $xxz$ clusters of size $N>2$ are entangled only when the interaction is ferromagnetic. Detailed dependence of the entanglement on various parameters is investigated in each case.

abstract: Using the master equation we calculate the contribution of the excited state of a two-level atom to its interacting potential with a perfectly conducting wall at finite temperature. For low temperature, $\hbar \omega_0/k_B T = k_0 \lambda_T\gg 1$, where $\omega_0 = k_0 c$ is the transition frequency of the atom and $\lambda_T$ is the thermal wavelength, we show that this contribution is very small $(\propto e^{-k_0\lambda_T})$. In the opposite limit $(k_0\lambda_T \ll 1)$, however, we show that the expression for the interacting potential, for all relevant distance regimes, becomes exactly the same as that for very short distances $(k_0 z \ll 1)$ and with the field in the vacuum state.

abstract: We use the density matrix formalism in order to calculate the energy level shifts, in second order on interaction, of an atom in the presence of a perfectly conducting wall in the dipole approximation. The thermal corrections are also examined when $\hbar \omega_0/k_B T = k_0 \lambda_T \gg 1$, where ${$\omega_0=k_0 c$}$ is the dominant transition frequency of the atom and $\lambda_T$ is the thermal length. When the distance $z$ between the atom and the wall is larger than $\lambda_T$ we find the well known result obtained from Lifshitz's formula, whose leading term is proportional to temperature and is independent of $c$, $\hbar$ and $k_0$. In the short distance limit, when $z\ll\lambda_T$, only very small corrections to the leading vacuum term occur. We also show, for all distance regimes, that the main thermal corrections are independent of $k_0$ (dispersion is not important) and dependent of $c$, which means that there is not a non-retarded regime for the thermal contributions.

title: A master equation approach for the interaction of an atom with a dielectric semi-infinite medium
authors: T.N.C. Mendes, C. Farina

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604034
abstract: We use the master equation approach to calculate the energy level shifts of an atom in the presence of a general dielectric semi-infinite medium characterized by a dielectric constant $\epsilon(\omega)$. Particularly, we analyze the case of a non-dispersive medium for which we obtain a general expression for the interaction as well as the asymptotic behaviors for $k_0 z \ll 1$ (non-retarded regime) and $k_0 z \gg 1$ (retarded regime), where $\omega_0 = k_0 c$ is the main transition frequency of the atom. The limiting cases $\epsilon \simeq 1$ and $\epsilon \gg 1$ are discussed for both retarded and non-retarded limits. For the retarded limit, we compute the non-additivity contribution of van der Waals forces.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604036
abstract: This paper presents the security analysis on the quantum stream cipher so called Yuen-2000 protocol (or $\alpha\eta$ scheme) against the fast correlation attack, the typical attack on stream ciphers. Although a very simple experimental model of the quantum stream cipher without a random mapper may be decrypted in the information theoretic sense by the fast correlation algorithm, it is not a basic feature of Yuen 2000 protocol. In fact, we clarify that there exists a randomization scheme which attains the perfect correlation immunity against such attacks under an approximation. And in this scheme, the running key correlation from the second randomization that determines the mapping patterns is dismissed also by quantum noise. In such a case, any fast correlation attack does not work on the quantum stream cipher.

abstract: We present a universal physical picture for describing storage and retrieval of photon wave packets in a Lambda-type atomic medium. This physical picture encompasses a variety of different approaches to pulse storage ranging from adiabatic reduction of the photon group velocity and pulse-propagation control via off-resonant Raman fields to photon-echo based techniques. Furthermore, we derive an optimal control strategy for storage and retrieval of a photon wave packet of any given shape. All these approaches, when optimized, yield identical maximum efficiencies, which only depend on the optical depth of the medium.

abstract: We show the flaws found in the customary fidelity-based definitions of disturbance in quantum measurements and evolutions. We introduce the "entropic disturbance" D and show that it adequately measures the degree of disturbance, intended essentially as an irreversible change in the state of the system. We also find that it complies with an information-disturbance tradeoff, namely the mutual information between the eigenvalues of the initial state and the measurement results is less than or equal to D.

abstract: The tomographic description of a quantum state is formulated in an abstract infinite dimensional Hilbert space framework, the space of the Hilbert-Schmidt linear operators, with trace formula as scalar product. Resolutions of the unity, written in terms of over-complete sets of rank-one projectors and of associated Gram-Schmidt operators taking into account their non-orthogonality, are then used to reconstruct a quantum state from its tomograms. Examples of well known tomographic descriptions illustrate the exposed theory.

abstract: Using a density matrix approach, we study the simplest systems that display both gain and feedback: clusters of 2 to 5 atoms, one of which is pumped. The other atoms supply feedback through multiple scattering of light. We show that, if the atoms are in each other's near-field, the system exhibits large gain narrowing and spectral mode redistribution. The observed phenomena are more pronounced if the feedback is enhanced. Our system is to our knowledge the simplest exactly solvable microscopic system which shows the approach to laser oscillation.

abstract: By using the ghost imaging technique, we experimentally demonstrate the reconstruction of the diffraction pattern of a {\em pure phase} object by using the classical correlation of incoherent thermal light split on a beam splitter. The results once again underline that entanglement is not a necessary feature of ghost imaging. The light we use is spatially highly incoherent with respect to the object ($\approx 2 \mu$m speckle size) and is produced by a pseudo-thermal source relying on the principle of near-field scattering. We show that in these conditions no information on the phase object can be retrieved by only measuring the light that passed through it, neither in a direct measurement nor in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) scheme. In general, we show a remarkable complementarity between ghost imaging and the HBT scheme when dealing with a phase object.

abstract: The standard Bell inequality experiments test for violation of local realism by repeatedly making local measurements on individual copies of an entangled quantum state. Here we investigate the possibility of increasing the violation of a Bell inequality by making collective measurements. We show that nonlocality of bipartite pure entangled states, quantified by their maximal violation of the Bell-Clauser-Horne inequality, can always be enhanced by collective measurements, even without communication between the parties. For mixed states we also show that collective measurements can increase the violation of Bell inequalities, although numerical evidence suggests that the phenomenon is not common as it is for pure states.

abstract: We investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atoms one of which is excited. We show that the perturbation theory results in divergence of integrals for the interaction between an excited atom and a media of dilute gas. We considered the interaction between two atoms embedded in a dielectric medium. The non-perturbative method used in this paper shows that the interaction between the atoms is suppressed due to absorption of photons by the medium. Now the integrals are divergent no more. Interaction between two media of dilute gases is considered for the case of high temperatures.

abstract: We introduce observable quantities, borrowing from concepts of quantum information theory, for the characterization of quantum phase transitions in spin systems. These observables are uniquely defined in terms of single spin unitary operations. We define the energy gap between the ground state and the state produced by the action of a single-qubit local gate. We show that this static quantity involves only single-site expectations and two-point correlation functions on the ground state. We then discuss a dynamical local observable defined as the acceleration of quantum state evolution after performing an instaneous single-qubit perturbation on the ground state. This quantity involves three-point correlations as well. We show that both the static and the dynamical observables detect and characterize completely quantum critical points in a class of spin systems.

We develop analytical models of the latency, bandwidth, error rate and resource utilization of such channels, and show that 100s of qubits must be distributed to accommodate a single data communication. Next, we show that a grid of teleportation nodes forms a good substrate on which to distribute EPR pairs. We also explore the control requirements for such a network. Finally, we propose a specific routing architecture and simulate the communication patterns of the Quantum Fourier Transform to demonstrate the impact of resource contention.

abstract: We introduce a class of informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures which are, in analogy with a tight frame, "as close as possible" to orthonormal bases for the space of quantum states. These measures are distinguished by an exceptionally simple state-reconstruction formula which allows "painless" quantum state tomography. Complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures are both members of this class, the latter being the unique minimal rank-one members. Recast as ensembles of pure quantum states, the rank-one members are in fact equivalent to weighted 2-designs in complex projective space. These measures are shown to be optimal for quantum cloning and linear quantum state tomography.

abstract: We experimentally investigate a double-pass parametric down-conversion scheme for producing pulsed, polarization-entangled photon pairs with high visibility. The amplitudes for creating photon pairs on each pass interfere to compensate for distinguishing characteristics that normally degrade two-photon visibility. The result is a high-flux source of polarization-entangled photon pulses that does not require spectral filtering. We observe quantum interference visibility of over 95% without the use of spectral filters for 200 femtosecond pulses, and up to 98.1% with 5 nm bandwidth filters.

comments: 
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Complexity (cs.CC)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604052
abstract: Despite the apparent similarity between shared randomness and shared entanglement in the context of Communication Complexity, our understanding of the latter is not as good as of the former. In particular, there is no known "entanglement analogue" for the famous theorem by Newman, saying that the number of shared random bits required for solving any communication problem can be at most logarithmic in the input length (i.e., using more than O(log n) shared random bits would not reduce the complexity of an optimal solution). In this paper we prove that the same is not true for entanglement. We establish a wide range of tight (up to a polylogarithmic factor) entanglement vs. communication tradeoffs for relational problems. The low end is: for any t>2, reducing shared entanglement from log^t(n) to o(log^{t-2}(n)) qubits can increase the communication required for solving a problem almost exponentially, from O(log^t(n)) to \Omega(\sqrt n). The high end is: for any \eps>0, reducing shared entanglement from n^{1-\eps}log(n) to o(n^{1-\eps}/log(n)) can increase the required communication from O(n^{1-\eps}log(n)) to \Omega(n^{1-\eps/2}/log(n)). The upper bounds are demonstrated via protocols which are exact and work in the \e{simultaneous message passing model}, while the lower bounds hold for \e{bounded-error protocols}, even in the more powerful \e{model of 1-way communication}. Our protocols use shared EPR pairs while the lower bounds apply to any sort of prior entanglement. We base the lower bounds on a strong direct product theorem for communication complexity of a certain class of relational problems. We believe that the theorem might have applications outside the scope of this work.

abstract: In a recent paper Yu and Eberly [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 140404 (2004)] have shown that two initially entangled and afterwards not interacting qubits can become completely disentangled in a finite time. We study transient entanglement between two qubits coupled collectively to a multimode vacuum field and find an unusual feature that the irreversible spontaneous decay can lead to a revival of the entanglement that has already been destroyed. The results show that this feature is independent of the coherent dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms but it depends critically on whether or not the collective damping is present. We show that the ability of the system to revival entanglement via spontaneous emission relies on the presence of very different timescales for the evolution of the populations of the collective states and coherence between them.

journal:

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604056
abstract: This paper studies whether quantum proofs are more powerful than classical proofs, or in complexity terms, whether QMA=QCMA. We prove three results about this question. First, we give a "quantum oracle separation" between QMA and QCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs order sqrt(2^n/(m+1)) queries to find an n-qubit "marked state" |psi>, even if given an m-bit classical description of |psi> together with a quantum black box that recognizes |psi>. Second, we give an explicit QCMA protocol that nearly achieves this lower bound. Third, we show that, in the one previously-known case where quantum proofs seemed to provide an exponential advantage, classical proofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even with no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the group oracle. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical oracles, and about the possibility of a classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604057
abstract: An analysis of the analytical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation (which is a second order differential equation) for $H_2^+$ shows that the second linear independent solution of this equation is a square integrable function and therefore the ground state total wave function is a linear combination of two linear independent wave functions of different space symmetry: cylindrical and spherical. The wave function of cylindrical symmetry is well known. It has maxima at the positions of nuclei. The wave function of spherical symmetry and the corresponding spherical electron distribution, which exists at $R\neq0$ and locates at the middle of the bond, represents a quasiatom of electron density of non-nuclear united atom. In the light of the new result the qualitative behavior of the ground state wave function and the electron density of $H_2^+$ has been reinvestigated. It is shown analytically that a transformation of the total molecular wave function with two maxima to that one with one maximum passes through a flat wave function. The presented three-dimension figures of the electron density visualize the spherical component of the total wave function and its transformation with increasing internuclear separation.

The exact expression for the energy spectrum of created particles is obtained and its dependence on parameters of the problem is discussed. Unexpectedly, the number of created particles depends on the duration of the cavity contracting non-monotonously. This is explained by quantum interference of the events of particle creation which are taking place only at the moments of acceleration and deceleration of a boundary, while stable particle states exist (and thus no particles are created) at the time of contracting.

Grover's original quantum search algorithm has been generalized to the case of multiple solutions, but no one has calculated the query complexity in this case. We will use a generalized algorithm with higher precision to solve such a search problem that we should find all marked states and show that the practical query complexity increases with the number of marked states. In the end we will introduce an algorithm for the problem on a ``duality computer'' and show its advantage over other algorithms.

abstract: We present a fake-signal-and-cheating attack strategy for the dishonest agent in quantum secret sharing (QSS) to steal the information of the other agents' fully and freely. It is found that almost all the QSS protocols existing, such as the two famous QSS protocols, the Hillery-Bu$\check{z}$ek-Berthiaume [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{59}, 1829 (1999)] and the Karlsson-Koashi-Imoto [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{59}, 162 (1999)], can be eavesdropped freely if the process for the eavesdropping check is accomplished with the cooperation of the dishonest agent. He can sends a fake signal to the other agents after intercepting the original photons and storing them. His action can be hidden with entanglement swapping and cheating when the photons are chosen as the samples for checking eavesdropping. Finally, we present a possible improvement of these QSS protocols' security with decoy photons.

abstract: An (n,1,p)-Quantum Random Access (QRA) coding, introduced by Ambainis, Nayak, Ta-shma and Vazirani in ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing 1999, is the following communication system: The sender which has n-bit information encodes his/her information into one qubit, which is sent to the receiver. The receiver can recover any one bit of the original n bits correctly with probability at least p, through a certain decoding process based on positive operator-valued measures. Actually, Ambainis et al. shows the existence of a (2,1,0.85)-QRA coding and also proves the impossibility of its classical counterpart. Chuang immediately extends it to a (3,1,0.79)-QRA coding and whether or not a (4,1,p)-QRA coding such that p > 1/2 exists has been open since then. This paper gives a negative answer to this open question.

abstract: We calculate the radiation resulting from the Unruh effect for strongly accelerated electrons and show that the photons are created in pairs whose polarizations are maximally entangled. Apart from the photon statistics, this quantum radiation can further be discriminated from the classical (Larmor) radiation via the different spectral and angular distributions. The signatures of the Unruh effect become significant if the external electromagnetic field accelerating the electrons is not too far below the Schwinger limit and might be observable with future facilities. Finally, the corrections due to the birefringent nature of the QED vacuum at such ultra-high fields are discussed. PACS: 04.62.+v, 12.20.Fv, 41.60.-m, 42.25.Lc.

abstract: The interaction of an atom with an electromagnetic field is discussed in the presence of a time periodic external modulating force. It is explained that a control on atom by electromagnetic fields helps to design the quantum analog of classical optical systems. In these atom optical systems chaos may appear at the onset of external fields. The classical and quantum chaotic dynamics is discussed, in particular in an atom optics Fermi accelerator. It is found that the quantum dynamics exhibits dynamical localization and quantum recurrences.

abstract: We present some dynamic and entropic considerations about the evolution of a continuous time quantum walk implementing the clock of an autonomous machine. On a simple model, we study in quite explicit terms the Lindblad evolution of the clocked subsystem, relating the evolution of its entropy to the spreading of the wave packet of the clock. We explore possible ways of reducing the generation of entropy in the clocked subsystem, as it amounts to a deficit in the probability of finding the target state of the computation. We are thus lead to examine the benefits of abandoning some classical prejudice about how a clocking mechanism should operate.

abstract: We obtain lower and upper bounds on the heat kernel and Green functions of the Schroedinger operator in a random Gaussian magnetic field and a fixed scalar potential. We apply stochastic Feynman-Kac representation, diamagnetic upper bounds and the Jensen inequality for the lower bound. We show that if the covariance of the electromagnetic (vector) potential is increasing at large distances then the lower bound is decreasing exponentially fast for large distances and a large time.

abstract: The evolution of a surface excitation in a two dimentional model is analyzed. I) It starts quadratically up to a spreading time t_{S}. II) It follows an exponential behavior governed by a self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule. III) At longer times, the exponential is overrun by an inverse power law describing return processes governed by quantum diffusion. At this last transition time t_{R} a survival collapse becomes possible, bringing the survival probability down by several orders of magnitude. We identify this strongly destructive interference as an antiresonance in the time domain.

abstract: The assumption of maximum parallelism support for the successful realization of scalable quantum computers has led to homogeneous, ``sea-of-qubits'' architectures. The resulting architectures overcome the primary challenges of reliability and scalability at the cost of physically unacceptable system area. We find that by exploiting the natural serialization at both the application and the physical microarchitecture level of a quantum computer, we can reduce the area requirement while improving performance. In particular we present a scalable quantum architecture design that employs specialization of the system into memory and computational regions, each individually optimized to match hardware support to the available parallelism. Through careful application and system analysis, we find that our new architecture can yield up to a factor of thirteen savings in area due to specialization. In addition, by providing a memory hierarchy design for quantum computers, we can increase time performance by a factor of eight. This result brings us closer to the realization of a quantum processor that can solve meaningful problems.

abstract: A nonperturbative electron transfer rate theory is developed based on the reduced density matrix dynamics, which can be evaluated readily for the Debye solvent model without further approximation. Not only does it recover for reaction rates the celebrated Marcus' inversion and Kramers' turnover behaviors, the present theory also predicts for reaction thermodynamics, such as equilibrium Gibbs free-energy and entropy, some interesting solvent-dependent features that are calling for experimental verification. Moreover, a continued fraction Green's function formalism is also constructed, which can be used together with Dyson equation technique, for efficient evaluation of nonperturbative reduced density matrix dynamics.

abstract: The knowledge of quantum phase flow induced under the Weyl's association rule by the evolution of Heisenberg operators of canonical coordinates and momenta allows to find the evolution of symbols of generic Heisenberg operators. The quantum phase flow curves obey the quantum Hamilton's equations and play the role of characteristics. At any fixed level of accuracy of semiclassical expansion, quantum characteristics can be constructed by solving a coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations for quantum trajectories and generalized Jacobi fields. Classical and quantum constraint systems are discussed. The phase-space analytic geometry based on the star-product operation can hardly be visualized. The statement "quantum trajectory belongs to a constraint submanifold" can be changed e.g. to the opposite by a unitary transformation. Some of relations among quantum objects in phase space are, however, left invariant by unitary transformations and support partly geometric relations of belonging and intersection. Quantum phase flow satisfies the star-composition law and preserves hamiltonian and constraint star-functions.

abstract: Quantum adiabatic computation is a novel paradigm for the design of quantum algorithms, which is usually used to find the minimum of a classical function. In this paper, we show that if the initial hamiltonian of a quantum adiabatic evolution with a interpolation path is too simple, the minimal gap between the ground state and the first excited state of this quantum adiabatic evolution is an inverse exponential distance. Thus quantum adiabatic evolutions of this kind can't be used to design efficient quantum algorithms. Similarly, we show that a quantum adiabatic evolution with a simple final hamiltonian also has a long running time, which suggests that some functions can't be minimized efficiently by any quantum adiabatic evolution with a interpolation path.

We show that this result is robust, and deduce that neither hidden variable theories nor mechanisms of the GRW type for wave function collapse can be made relativistic. We also establish the consistency of our axioms and discuss the philosophical implications.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604080
abstract: In this work, we report that the Hawking radiation effect on fermions is fundamentally different from the case of scalar particles. Intrinsic properties of fermions (exclusion principle and spin) affect strongly the interaction of fermions with both Hawking radiation and metric of the spacetime. In particular we have found the following: first, while the fermion vacuum state seen by the Rindler observer is an entangled state in which the right and left Rindler wedge states appear in correlated pairs as in the case of the scalar particles, the entanglement disappears in the excited state due to the exclusion principle; second, the spin of the fermion experiences the Winger rotation under a uniform acceleration; and third, the quantum information of fermions encoded in spin (entangled state is composed of different spin states but with the same mode function) is dissipated not by the Hawking radiation but by the Wigner rotation as the pair approaches the event horizon.

First, we show how a single nanoscopic emitter attached to a near-field probe can be coupled to high-Q whispering-gallery modes of a silica microsphere at will. Then we demonstrate transfer of energy between this and a second nanoparticle deposited on the sphere surface. We estimate the photon transfer efficiency to be about six orders of magnitude higher than that via free space propagation at comparable separations.

abstract: Aspects of coherence and decoherence are analyzed within the optical Bloch equations. By rewriting the analytic solution in an alternate form, we are able to emphasize a number of unusual features: (a) despite the Markovian nature of the bath, coherence at long times can be retained; (b) the long-time asymptotic degree of coherence in the system is intertwined with the asymptotic difference in level populations; (c) the traditional population-relaxation and decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, lose their meaning when the system is in the presence of an external field, and are replaced by more general overall timescales; (d) increasing the field strength, quantified by the Rabi frequency, $\Omega$, increases the rate of decoherence rather than reducing it, as one might expect; and (e) maximum asymptotic coherence is reached when the system parameters satisfy $\Omega^2 = 1/(T_1 T_2)$.

abstract: An differential equation for wave functions is proposed, which is equivalent to Schr\"{o}dinger's wave equation and can be used to determine energy-level gaps of quantum systems. Contrary to Schr\"{o}dinger's wave equation, this equation is on `bipartite' wave functions. It is shown that those `bipartite' wave functions satisfy all the basic properties of Schr\"{o}dinger's wave functions. Further, it is argued that `bipartite' wave functions can present a mathematical expression of wave-particle duality. This provides an alternative approach to the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We generalize the concept of optical Galton board (OGB), first proposed by Bouwmeester et al. {[}Phys. Rev. A \textbf{61}, 013410 (2000)], by introducing the possibility of nonlinear self--phase modulation on the wavefunction during the walker evolution. If the original Galton board illustrates classical diffusion, the OGB, which can be understood as a grid of Landau--Zener crossings, illustrates the influence of interference on diffusion, and is closely connected with the quantum walk. Our nonlinear generalization of the OGB shows new phenomena, the most striking of which is the formation of non-dispersive pulses in the field distribution (soliton--like structures). These exhibit a variety of dynamical behaviors, including ballistic motion, dynamical localization, non--elastic collisions and chaotic behavior, in the sense that the dynamics is very sensitive to the nonlinearity strength.

abstract: Quantum sequential machines (QSMs) are a quantum version of stochastic sequential machines (SSMs). Recently, we showed that two QSMs M_1 and M_2 with n_1 and n_2 states, respectively, are equivalent iff they are (n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent (Theoretical Computer Science 358 (2006) 65-74). However, using this result to check the equivalence likely needs exponential expected time. In this paper, we consider the time complexity of deciding the equivalence between QSMs and related problems. The main results are as follows: (1) We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between QSMs, and, if two QSMs are not equivalent, this algorithm will produce an input-output pair with length not more than (n_1+n_2)^2. (2) We improve the bound for the equivalence between QSMs from (n_1+n_2)^2 to n_1^2+n_2^2-1, by employing Moore and Crutchfield's method (Theoretical Computer Science 237 (2000) 275-306). (3) We give that two MO-1QFAs with n_1 and n_2 states, respectively, are equivalent iff they are (n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent, and further obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between two MO-1QFAs. (4) We provide a counterexample showing that Koshiba's method to solve the problem of deciding the equivalence between MM-1QFAs may be not valid, and thus the problem is left open again.

abstract: In this paper, we consider a method for implementing a quantum logic gate with photons whose wave function propagates in a one-dimensional Kerr-nonlinear photonic crystal. The photonic crystal causes the incident photons to undergo Bragg reflection by its periodic structure of dielectric materials and forms the photonic band structure, namely, the light dispersion relation. This dispersion relation reduces the group velocity of the wave function of the photons, so that it enhances nonlinear interaction of the photons. (Because variation of the group velocity against the wave vector is very steep, we have to tune up the wavelength of injected photons precisely, however.) If the photonic crystal includes layers of a Kerr medium, we can rotate the phase of the wave function of the incident photons by a large angle efficiently. We show that we can construct the nonlinear sign-shift (NS) gate proposed by Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) by this method. Thus, we can construct the conditional sign-flip gate for two qubits, which is crucial for quantum computation. Our NS gate works with probability unity in principle while KLM's original one is a nondeterministic gate conditioned on the detection of an auxiliary photon.

abstract: We show that the quantum wavefunction, interpreted as the probability density of finding a single non-localized quantum particle, which evolves according to classical laws of motion, is an intermediate description of a material quantum particle between the quantum and classical realms. Accordingly, classical and quantum mechanics should not be treated separately, a unified description in terms of the Wigner distribution function being possible. Although defined on classical phase space coordinates, the Wigner distribution function accommodates the nonlocalization property of quantum systems, and leads to both the Schrodinger equation for the quantum wavefunction and to the definition of position and momentum operators.

abstract: It has been recently shown (Bartlett et al. 2003) that information encoded into relative degrees of freedom enables communication without a common reference frame using entangled bipartite states. In this case the relative information stored in the two-qubit system is shared between the polarization degrees of freedom and the degree of entanglement. In the present article a specific state discrimination problem is envisioned where the degree of entanglement carries the only relative parameter, so that certain maximally entangled states are perfectly distinguishable, while discrimination of product states is impossible.

This type of quantum/classical interpolation phenomenon appears to new.

abstract: We consider a model of quantum computation in which the set of operations is limited to nearest-neighbor interactions on a 2D lattice. We model movement of qubits with noisy SWAP operations. For this architecture we design a fault-tolerant coding scheme using the concatenated [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Our scheme is potentially applicable to ion-trap and solid-state quantum technologies. We calculate a lower bound on the noise threshold for our local model using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of 1.85 x 10^-5 for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of the failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the analogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3.61 x 10^-5. Our results thus show that the additional SWAP operations required to move qubits in the local model affect the noise threshold only moderately.

The main examples discussed in the paper are related the Weyl algebra and to the exponential family of states. The characterization of sufficiency in terms of quantum Fisher information is a new result.

abstract: The statistical properties of three-level lasing are investigated theoretically. It is assumed that the three-level medium is coherently excited by another laser with an arbitrary photon statistics. It is proved that, under the specific conditions, the photon statistics of the three-level laser duplicate the photon statistics of the exciting laser. We call this phenomenon an induced photon statistics. We suggest to use this to analyze the statistical properties of a laser involved into a feedback process. Applying this laser for the coherent pump of a three-level laser, we can follow its photon statistics by means of direct following the three-level generation. In accordance with [H. M. Wiseman and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A, 49, 1350-1366 (1994)], we conclude that the feedback in itself is unable to generate the non-classical manifestation in the laser field.

abstract: Decoy states have recently been proposed as a useful method for substantially improving the performance of quantum key distribution protocols when a coherent state source is used. Previously, data post-processing schemes based on one-way classical communications were considered for use with decoy states. In this paper, we develop two data post-processing schemes for the decoy-state method using two-way classical communications. Our numerical simulation (using parameters from a specific QKD experiment as an example) results show that our scheme is able to extend the maximal secure distance from 142km (using only one-way classical communications with decoy states) to 181km. The second scheme is able to achieve a 10% greater key generation rate in the whole regime of distances.

As a special case, the analytical bound-state series solutions and the recursion relation of the linear-plus-Coulomb (Cornell) potential with the decaying position-dependent mass m=m_{0}e^{-\lambda r} are also found.

abstract: The Mean King's problem with mutually unbiased bases is reconsidered for arbitrary d-level systems. Hayashi, Horibe and Hashimoto [Phys. Rev. A 71, 052331 (2005)] related the problem to the existence of a maximal set of d-1 mutually orthogonal Latin squares, in their restricted setting that allows only measurements of projection-valued measures. However, we then cannot find a solution to the problem when e.g., d=6 or d=10. In contrast to their result, we show that the King's problem always has a solution for arbitrary levels if we also allow positive operator-valued measures. In constructing the solution, we use orthogonal arrays in combinatorial design theory.

abstract: We employ a generalized Dicke model to study theoretically the quantum criticality of an extended two-level atomic ensemble interacting with a single-mode quantized light field. Effective Hamiltonians are derived and diagonalized to investigate numerically their eigenfrequencies for different quantum phases in the system. Based on the analysis of the eigenfrequencies, an intriguing quantum-phase transition from a normal phase to a superradiant phase is revealed clearly, which is quite different from that observed with a standard Dicke model.

As concrete examples we obtain properties of this dynamics on mean field graphs of arbitrary sizes. In the same way that chains can be used for transmitting entanglement by their natural dynamics, these graphs can be used to store entanglement. We also consider two kinds of regular polyhedron which show interesting features of entanglement sharing.

abstract: A formula to evaluate the entanglement in an one-dimensional ferrimagnetic system is derived. Based on the formula, we find that the thermal entanglement in a small size spin-1/2 and spin-s ferrimagnetic chain is rather robust against temperature, and the threshold temperature may be arbitrarily high when s is sufficiently large. This intriguing result answers unambiguously a fundamental question: ``can entanglement and quantum behavior in physical systems survive at arbitrary high temperatures?"

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604100
abstract: In the present work, quantum theory is founded on the framework of consciousness, in contrast to earlier suggestions that consciousness might be understood starting from quantum theory. The notion of streams of consciousness, usually restricted to conscious beings, is extended to the notion of a Universal/Global stream of conscious flow of ordered events. The streams of conscious events which we experience constitute sub-streams of the Universal stream. Our postulated ontological character of consciousness also consists of an operator which acts on a state of potential consciousness to create or modify the likelihoods for later events to occur and become part of the Universal conscious flow. A generalized process of measurement-perception is introduced, where the operation of consciousness brings into existence, from a state of potentiality, the event in consciousness. This is mathematically represented by (a) an operator acting on the state of potential-consciousness before an actual event arises in consciousness and (b) the reflecting of the result of this operation back onto the state of potential-consciousness for comparison in order for the event to arise in consciousness. Beginning from our postulated ontology that consciousness is primary and from the most elementary conscious contents, such as perception of periodic change and motion, quantum theory follows naturally as the description of the conscious experience.

abstract: 1-qubit quantum states form a space called the three-dimensional Bloch ball. To compute Holevo capacity, Voronoi diagrams in the Bloch ball with respect to the quantum divergence have been used as a powerful tool. These diagrams basically treat mixed quantum states corresponding to points in the interior of the Bloch ball. Due to the existence of logarithm in the quantum divergence, the diagrams are not defined on pure quantum states corresponding to points on the two-dimensional sphere. This paper first defines the Voronoi diagrams for pure quantum states on the Bloch sphere by the Fubini-Study distance and the Bures distance. We also introduce other Voronoi diagrams on the sphere obtained by taking a limit of Voronoi diagrams for mixed quantum states by the quantum divergences in the Bloch ball. These diagrams are shown to be equivalent to the ordinary Voronoi diagram on the sphere.

abstract: Classical BCH codes that contain their (Euclidean or Hermitian) dual codes can be used to construct quantum stabilizer codes; this correspondence studies the properties of such codes. It is shown that a BCH code of length n can contain its dual code only if its designed distance d=O(sqrt(n)), and the converse is proved in the case of narrow-sense codes. Furthermore, the dimension of narrow-sense BCH codes with small design distance is completely determined, and - consequently - the bounds on their minimum distance are improved. These results make it possible to determine the parameters of quantum BCH codes in terms of their design parameters.

abstract: We propose a novel interferometer by using optical transverse modes in multimode waveguide that can beat the standard quantum limit. In the scheme, the classical simulation of $N$-partical quantum entangled states is generated by using $N$ independent classical fields and linear optical elements. Similar to the quantum-enhanced measurements, the classical simulation can also achieve $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement over the precision of the measurement $N$ times for independent fields. Due to only using classical fields and linear optical elements, the scheme can be realized much more easily.

abstract: It is known that mutually unbiased bases, whenever they exist, are optimal in an information theoretic sense for the determination of unknown state of a quantum ensemble. These bases may not exist in most dimensions and some suboptimal choices have to be made. The present paper deals with estimates of the information loss in suboptimal choice of bases. The information is calculated directly in terms of transition probabilities. I give estimates for the information content of measurement in some approximate MUBs proposed recently.

abstract: A striking feature of quantum error correcting codes is that they can sometimes be used to correct more errors than they can uniquely identify. Such degenerate codes have long been known, but have remained poorly understood. We provide a heuristic for designing degenerate quantum codes for high noise rates, which is applied to generate codes that can be used to communicate over almost any Pauli channel at rates that are impossible for a nondegenerate code. The gap between nondegenerate and degenerate code performance is quite large, in contrast to the tiny magnitude of the only previous demonstration of this effect. We also identify a channel for which none of our codes outperform the best nondegenerate code and show that it is nevertheless quite unlike any channel for which nondegenerate codes are known to be optimal.

abstract: The concepts of concurrence and mode concurrence are the measures of entanglement for spin-1/2 and spinless fermion systems respectively. Based on the Jordan-Wigner transformation, any spin-1/2 system is always associated with a fermion system (called counterpart system). The comparison of concurrence and mode concurrence can be made with the aid of the Marshall's sign rule for the ground states of spin-1/2 $XXZ$ and spinless fermion chain systems. We observe that there exists an inequality between concurrence and mode concurrence for the ground states of the two corresponding systems. The spin-1/2 XY chain system and its spinless fermion counterpart as a realistic example is discussed to demonstrate the analytical results.

abstract: We construct a single observable measurement of which mean value on four copies of an {\it unknown} two-qubit state is sufficient for unambiguous decision whether the state is separable or entangled. In other words, there exists a universal collective entanglement witness detecting all two-qubit entanglement. The test is directly linked to a function which characterizes to some extent the entanglement quantitatively. This function is an entanglement monotone under so--called local pure operations and classical communication (pLOCC) which preserve local dimensions. Moreover it provides tight upper and lower bounds for negativity and concurrence. Elementary quantum computing device estimating unknown two-qubit entanglement is designed.

abstract: Quantum resonances in the kicked rotor are characterized by a dramatically increased energy absorption rate, in stark contrast to the momentum localization generally observed. These resonances occur when the scaled Planck's constant hbar=(r/s)*4pi, for any integers r and s. However only the hbar=r*2pi resonances are easily observable. We have observed high-order quantum resonances (s>2) utilizing a sample of low temperature, non-condensed atoms and a pulsed optical standing wave. Resonances are observed for hbar=(r/16)*4pi r=2-6. Quantum numerical simulations suggest that our observation of high-order resonances indicates a larger coherence length than expected from an initially thermal atomic sample.

abstract: We provide compelling evidence for the presence of quantum chaos in the unitary part of Shor's factoring algorithm. In particular we analyze the spectrum of this part after proper desymmetrization and show that the fluctuations of the eigenangles as well as the distribution of the eigenvector components follow the CUE ensemble of random matrices, of relevance to quantized chaotic systems that violate time-reversal symmetry. However, as the algorithm tracks the evolution of a single state, it is possible to employ other operators, in particular it is possible that the generic quantum chaos found above becomes of a nongeneric kind such as is found in the quantum cat maps, and in toy models of the quantum bakers map.

The first one models decoherence in a quantum channel while the second one models transverse relaxation. We demonstrated that the bang-bang control suppresses decoherence in both cases.

abstract: We demonstrate a scheme to spectrally manipulate a collinear, continuous stream of time and energy entangled photons to generate beamlike, bandwidth-limited fuxes of polarization-entangled photons with nearly-degenerate wavelengths. Utilizing an ultrashort-pulse shaper to control the spectral phase and polarization of the photon pairs, we tailor the shape of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference pattern, demonstrating the rules that govern the dependence of this interference pattern on the spectral phases of the photons. We then use the pulse shaper to generate all four polarization Bell states. The singlet state generated by this scheme forms a very robust decoherence-free subspace, extremely suitable for long distance fiber-optics based quantum communication.

abstract: Recently M. Ziman [quant-ph/0603151] criticized our approach for quantifying the required physical resources in the theory of Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics (DCQD) [quant-ph/0601033, quant-ph/0601034] in comparison to other quantum process tomography (QPT) schemes. Here we argue that Ziman's comments regarding optimality, quantumness, and the novelty of DCQD are inaccurate. Specifically, we demonstrate that DCQD is optimal with respect to both the required number of experimental configurations and the number of possible outcomes over all known QPT schemes in the 2^{2n} dimensional Hilbert space of n system and n ancilla qubits. Moreover, we show DCQD is more efficient than all known QPT schemes in the sense of overall required number of quantum operations. Furthermore, we argue that DCQD is a new method for characterizing quantum dynamics and cannot be considered merely as a subclass of previously known QPT schemes.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604117
abstract: We study different techniques that allow us to gain complete knowledge about an unknown quantum state, e.g. to perform full tomography of this state. We focus on two apparently simple cases, full tomography of one and two qubit systems. We analyze and compare those techniques according to two figures of merit. Our first criterion is the minimisation of the redundancy of the data acquired during the tomographic process. In the case of two-qubits tomography, we also analyze this process from the point of view of factorisability, so to say we analyze the possibility to realise the tomographic process through local operations and classical communications between local observers. This brings us naturally to study the possibility to factorize the (discrete) Wigner distribution of a composite system into the product of local Wigner distributions. The discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group is an essential ingredient of our approach. Possible extensions of our results to higher dimensions are discussed in the last section and in the conclusions.

abstract: The $D$-dimensional $(\beta, \beta')$-two-parameter deformed algebra introduced by Kempf is generalized to a Lorentz-covariant algebra describing a ($D+1$)-dimensional quantized space-time. In the D=3 and $\beta=0$ case, the latter reproduces Snyder algebra. The deformed Poincar\'e transformations leaving the algebra invariant are identified. It is shown that there exists a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position (minimal length). The Dirac oscillator in a 1+1-dimensional space-time described by such an algebra is studied in the case where $\beta'=0$. Extending supersymmetric quantum mechanical and shape-invariance methods to energy-dependent Hamiltonians provides exact bound-state energies and wavefunctions. Physically acceptable states exist for $\beta < 1/(m^2 c^2)$. A new interesting outcome is that, in contrast with the conventional Dirac oscillator, the energy spectrum is bounded.

abstract: Current proposals focusing on neutral atoms for quantum computing are mostly based on using single atoms as quantum bits (qubits), while using cavity induced coupling or dipole-dipole interaction for two-qubit operations. An alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as qubits. However, when an atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition (or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as more and more photons are absorbed^1. In order to make use of an ensemble as a qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple example illustrating the concept of light shift imbalanced induced blockade (LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat the ensemble as a two level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing excitations of higher order collective states.

abstract: Recently, we have shown that for conditions under which the so-called light-shift imbalance induced blockade (LSIIB) occurs, the collective excitation of an ensemble of a multi-level atom can be treated as a closed two level system. In this paper, we describe how such a system can be used as a quantum bit (qubit) for quantum communication and quantum computing. Specifically, we show how to realize a C-NOT gate using the collective qubit and an easily accessible ring cavity, via an extension of the so-called Pellizzari scheme. We also describe how multiple, small-scale quantum computers realized using these qubits can be linked effectively for implementing a quantum internet. We describe the details of the energy levels and transitions in 87Rb atom that could be used for implementing these schemes.

abstract: Two protocols of quantum direct communication with authentication [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 73}, 042305 (2006)] are recently proposed by Lee, Lim and Yang. In this paper we will show that in the two protocols the authenticator Trent should be prevented from knowing the secret message of communication. The first protocol can be eavesdropped by Trent using the the intercept-measure-resend attack, while the second protocol can be eavesdropped by Trent using single-qubit measurement. To fix these leaks, I revise the original versions of the protocols by using the Pauli-Z operation $\sigma_z$ instead of the original bit-flip operation $X$. As a consequence, the protocol securities are improved.

abstract: We propose a scheme for generating the superposition and the entanglement of squeezed vacuum states of electromagnetical fields. The scheme involves single-photon source, single photon detector, and cross Kerr nonlinearity. The Kerr nonlinearity required for generating the superposition of squeezed vacuum states is 1/2 of that required for generating the superposition of coherent states. The proposal can also be extended to generate the entanglement states between two coherent states and that between one coherent state and one squeezed vacuum state.

abstract: We analyze the capacity of a simultaneous quantum secure direct communication scheme between the central party and other $M$ parties via $M+1$-particle GHZ states and swapping quantum entanglement. It is shown that the encoding scheme should be secret if other $M$ parties wants to transmit $M+1$ bit classical messages to the center party secretly. However when the encoding scheme is announced publicly, we prove that the capacity of the scheme in transmitting the secret messages is 2 bits, no matter how big $M$ is.

abstract: The endohedral fullerene Er3N@C80 shows characteristic 1.5 micron photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures associated with radiative relaxation from the crystal-field split Er3+ 4I13/2 manifold to the 4I15/2 manifold. Previous observations of this luminescence were carried out by photoexcitation of the fullerene cage states leading to relaxation via the ionic states. We present direct non-cage-mediated optical interaction with the erbium ion. We have used this interaction to complete a photoluminescence-excitation map of the Er3+ 4I13/2 manifold. This ability to interact directly with the states of an incarcerated ion suggests the possibility of coherently manipulating fullerene qubit states with light.

abstract: Spatial quantum enhancement effects are studied under a unified framework. It is shown that the multiphoton absorption rate of photons with a quantum-enhanced lithographic resolution is reduced, not enhanced, contrary to popular belief. The use of adiabatic soliton expansion is proposed to beat the standard quantum limit on the optical beam displacement accuracy, as well as to engineer an arbitrary multiphoton interference pattern for quantum lithography. The proposed scheme provides a conceptually simple method that works for an arbitrary number of photons.

abstract: In recent papers, Zurek has objected to the decision-theoretic approach of Deutsch and Wallace to deriving the Born rule for quantum probabilities on the grounds that it courts circularity. Deutsch and Wallace assume that the many worlds theory is true and that decoherence gives rise to a preferred basis. However, decoherence arguments use the reduced density matrix, which relies upon the partial trace and hence upon the Born Rule for its validity. Using the Heisenberg Picture and quantum Darwinism - the notion that classical information is quantum information that can proliferate in the environment pioneered by Olliver et al - I show that measurement interactions between two systems only create correlations between a specific set of commuting observables of system 1 and a specific set of commuting observables of system 2. This argument picks out a unique basis in which information flows in the correlations between those sets of commuting observables. I then derive the Born rule for both pure and mixed states and answer some other criticisms of the decision theoretic approach to quantum probability.

abstract: We observed continuous-variable entanglement between the bright beams emitted above threshold by an ultrastable optical parametric oscillator, classically phase-locked at a frequency difference of 161.8273240(5) MHz. The amplitude-difference squeezing is -3 dB and the phase-sum one is -1.35 dB. Besides proving entanglement in a new physical system, the phase-locked OPO, such unprecedented frequency-difference stability paves the way for transferring entanglement between different optical frequencies and densely implementing continuous-variable quantum information in the frequency domain.

abstract: This work is based on a description of quantum reference frames that seems more basic than others in the literature. Here a frame is based on a set of real and of complex numbers and a space time as a 4-tuple of the real numbers. There are many isomorphic frames as there are many isomorphic sets of real numbers. Each frame is suitable for construction of all physical theories as mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers. The organization of the frames into a field of frames is based on the representations of real and complex numbers as Cauchy operators defined on complex rational states of finite qubit strings. The structure of the field is based on noting that the construction of real and complex numbers as Cauchy operators in a frame can be iterated to create new frames coming from a frame. Gauge transformations on the rational string states greatly expand the number of quantum frames as, for each gauge U, there is one frame coming from the original frame. Forward and backward iteration of the construction yields a two way infinite frame field with satisfying properties. There is no background space time and there are no real or complex numbers for the field as a whole. Instead these are relative concepts associated with each frame in the field. Extension to include qukit strings for different k bases, is described as is the problem of reconciling the frame field to the existence of just one frame with one background space time for the observable physical universe.

abstract: Decoherence induced by coupling a system with an environment may display universal features. Here we demostrate that when the coupling to the system drives a quantum phase transition in the environment, the temporal decay of quantum coherences in the system is Gaussian with a width independent of the system-environment coupling strength. The existence of this effect opens the way for a new type of quantum simulation algorithm, where a single qubit is used to detect a quantum phase transition. We discuss possible implementations of such algorithm and we relate our results to available data on universal decoherence in NMR echo experiments.

abstract: We present a Hamiltonian that can be used for amplifying the signal from a quantum state, enabling the measurement of a macroscopic observable to determine the state of a single spin. We prove a general mapping between this Hamiltonian and an exchange Hamiltonian for arbitrary coupling strengths and local magnetic fields. This facilitates the use of existing schemes for perfect state transfer to give perfect amplification. We further prove a link between the evolution of this fixed Hamiltonian and classical Cellular Automata, thereby unifying previous approaches to this amplification task. Finally, we show how to use the new Hamiltonian for perfect state transfer in the, to date, unique scenario where total spin is not conserved during the evolution, and demonstrate that this yields a significantly different response in the presence of decoherence.

abstract: We discuss quantum random walk of two photons using linear optical elements. We analyze the quantum random walk using photons in a variety of quantum states including entangled states. We find that for photons initially in separable Fock states, the final state is entangled. For polarization entangled photons produced by type II downconverter, we calculate the joint probability of detecting two photons at a given site. We show the remarkable dependence of the two photon detection probability on the quantum nature of the state. In order to understand the quantum random walk, we present exact analytical results for small number of steps like five. We present in details numerical results for a number of cases and supplement the numerical results with asymptotic analytical results.

Here, we show that bootstrapping techniques can be used to create high-fidelity noon states of arbitrary size.

The quantum memory realized by collective spin states (ensemble qubit) is coupled to a high-Q stripline cavity via microwave Raman processes. We show that for convenient trap-surface distances of a few $\mu$m, strong coupling between the cavity and ensemble qubit can be achieved. We discuss basic quantum information protocols, including a swap from the cavity photon bus to the molecular quantum memory, and a deterministic two qubit gate. Finally, we investigate coherence properties of molecular ensemble quantum bits.

abstract: We show that quantum circuits cannot be made fault-tolerant against a depolarizing noise level of approximately 45%, thereby improving on a previous bound of 50% (due to Razborov). Our precise quantum circuit model enables perfect gates from the Clifford group (CNOT, Hadamard, S, X, Y, Z) and arbitrary additional one-qubit gates that are subject to that much depolarizing noise. We prove that this set of gates cannot be universal for arbitrary (even classical) computation, from which the upper bound on the noise threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation follows.

abstract: In this work we investigate the possibility to create cold Fr$\_2$, RbFr, and CsFr molecules through photoassociation of cold atoms. Potential curves, permanent and transition dipole moments for the Francium dimer and for the RbFr and RbCs molecules are determined for the first time. The Francium atom is modelled as a one valence electron moving in the field of the Fr$^+$ core, which is described by a new pseudopotential with averaged relativistic effects, and including effective core polarization potential. The molecular calculations are performed for both the ionic species Fr$\_2^+$, RbFr$^+$, CsFr$^+$ and the corresponding neutral, through the CIPSI quantum chemistry package where we used new extended gaussian basis sets for Rb, Cs, and Fr atoms. As no experimental data is available, we discuss our results by comparison with the Rb$\_2$, Cs$\_2$, and RbCs systems. The dipole moment of CsFr reveals an electron transfer yielding a Cs$^+$Fr$^-$ arrangement, while in all other mixed alkali pairs the electron is transferred towards the lighter species. Finally the perturbative treatment of the spin-orbit coupling at large distances predicts that in contrast with Rb$\_2$ and Cs$\_2$, no double-well excited potential should be present in Fr$\_2$, probably preventing an efficient formation of cold dimers via photoassociation of cold Francium atoms.

abstract: We strengthen the bound on the correlations of two spin-1/2 particles (qubits) in separable (non-entangled) states for locally orthogonal spin directions by much tighter bounds than the well-known Bell inequality. This provides a sharper criterion for the experimental distinction between entangled and separable states, and even one which is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. However, these improved bounds do not apply to local hidden-variable theories, and hence they provide a criterion to test the correlations allowed by local hidden-variable theories against those allowed by separable quantum states. Furthermore, these bounds are stronger than some recent alternative experimentally accessible entanglement criteria. We also address the issue of finding a finite subset of these inequalities that would already form a necessary and sufficient condition for non-entanglement. For mixed state we have not been able to resolve this, but for pure states a set of six inequalities using only three sets of orthogonal observables is shown to be already necessary and sufficient for separability.

abstract: In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Bohmian mechanics as a numerical tool because of its local dynamics, which suggest the possibility of significant computational advantages for the simulation of large quantum systems. However, closer inspection of the Bohmian formulation reveals that the nonlocality of quantum mechanics has not disappeared -- it has simply been swept under the rug into the quantum force. In this paper we present a new formulation of Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be complex. This leads to a single equation for complex S, and ultimately complex x and p but there is a reward for this complexification -- a significantly higher degree of localization. The quantum force in the new approach vanishes for Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, and its effect on barrier tunneling processes is orders of magnitude lower than that of the classical force. We demonstrate tunneling probabilities that are in virtually perfect agreement with the exact quantum mechanics down to 10^{-7} calculated from strictly localized quantum trajectories that do not communicate with their neighbors. The new formulation may have significant implications for fundamental quantum mechanics, ranging from the interpretation of non-locality to measures of quantum complexity.

abstract: I describe, in the simplified context of finite groups and their representations, a mathematical model for a physical system that contains both its quantum and classical aspects. The physically observable system is associated with the space containing elements fxf for f an element in the regular representation of a given finite group G. The Hermitian portion of fxf is the Wigner distribution of f whose convolution with a test function leads to a mathematical description of the quantum measurement process. Starting with the Jacobi group that is formed from the semidirect product of the Heisenberg group with its automorphism group SL(2,F{N}) for N an odd prime number I show that the classical phase space is the first order term in a series of subspaces of the Hermitian portion of fxf that are stable under SL(2,F{N}). I define a derivative that is analogous to a pseudodifferential operator to enable a treatment that parallels the continuum case. I give a new derivation of the Schrodinger-Weil representation of the Jacobi group. Keywords: quantum mechanics, finite group, metaplectic. PACS: 03.65.Fd; 02.10.De; 03.65.Ta.

Some examples are considered. Finally, we deal with the exponential complexity problem of quantum physics and introduce the concept of classical dimension for a quantum system.

For comparison, the time spent, the fidelity, and the success probability for this teleportation are considered.

abstract: The Born-Markov master equation analysis of the vibrating mirror and photon experiment proposed by Marshall, Simon, Penrose and Bouwmeester is completed by including the important issues of temperature and friction. We find that at the level of cooling available to date, visibility revivals are purely classical, and no quantum effect can be detected by the setup, no matter how strong the photon-mirror coupling is. Checking proposals of universal nonenvironmental decoherence is ruled out by dominating thermal decoherence; a conjectured coordinate-diffusion contribution to decoherence may become observable on reaching moderately low temperatures.

abstract: We present a new approach for the analysis of Bose-Einstein condensates in a few mode approximation. This method has already been used to successfully analyze the vibrational modes in various molecular systems and offers a new perspective on the dynamics in many particle bosonic systems. We discuss a system consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a triple well potential. Such systems correspond to classical Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom. The semiclassical approach allows a simple visualization of the eigenstates of the quantum system referring to the underlying classical dynamics. From this classification we can read off the dynamical properties of the eigenstates such as particle exchange between the wells and entanglement without further calculations. In addition, this approach offers new insights into the validity of the mean-field description of the many particle system by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, since we make use of exactly this correspondence in our semiclassical analysis. We choose a three mode system in order to visualize it easily and, moreover, to have a sufficiently interesting structure, although the method can also be extended to higher dimensional systems.

abstract: We put forward an alternative approach to the SLOCC classification of entanglement states of three-qubit and four-qubit systems. By directly solving matrix equations, we obtain the relations satisfied by the amplitudes of states. The relations are readily tested since in them only addition, subtraction and multiplication occur.

abstract: Recently, operator quantum error-correcting codes have been proposed to unify and generalize decoherence free subspaces, noiseless subsystems, and quantum error-correcting codes. This note introduces a natural construction of such codes in terms of Clifford codes, an elegant generalization of stabilizer codes due to Knill. Character-theoretic methods are used to derive a simple method to construct operator quantum error-correcting codes from any classical additive code over a finite field.

abstract: The separation between the spin and the charge converts the quantum mechanical Pauli Hamiltonian into the Hamiltonian of the non-Abelian Georgi-Glashow model, notorious for its magnetic monopoles and confinement. The independent spin and charge fluctuations both lead to the Faddeev model, suggesting the existence of a deep duality structure and indicating that the fundamental carriers of spin and charge are knotted solitons.

abstract: Entanglement distillation aims at preparing highly entangled states out of a supply of weakly entangled pairs, using local devices and classical communication only. In this note we discuss the experimentally feasible schemes for optical continuous-variable entanglement distillation that have been presented in [D.E. Browne, J. Eisert, S. Scheel, and M.B. Plenio, Phys. Rev. A 67, 062320 (2003)] and [J. Eisert, D.E. Browne, S. Scheel, and M.B. Plenio, Annals of Physics (NY) 311, 431 (2004)]. We emphasize their versatility in particular with regards to the detection process and discuss the merits of the two proposed detection schemes, namely photo-detection and homodyne detection, in the light of experimental realizations of this idea becoming more and more feasible.

Here we experimentally clarified that in an ensemble of atoms and a photon system, there also exists an entanglement concerned with spatial degrees of freedom. Generation of higher-dimensional entanglement between remote atomic ensemble and an application to condensed matter physics are also discussed.

abstract: Suppose we have an n-qubit system, and we are given a collection of local density matrices rho_1,...,rho_m, where each rho_i describes a subset C_i of the qubits. We say that the rho_i are ``consistent'' if there exists some global state sigma (on all n qubits) that matches each of the rho_i on the subsets C_i. This generalizes the classical notion of the consistency of marginal probability distributions. We show that deciding the consistency of local density matrices is QMA-complete (where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP). This gives an interesting example of a hard problem in QMA. Our proof is somewhat unusual: we give a Turing reduction from Local Hamiltonian, using a convex optimization algorithm by Bertsimas and Vempala, which is based on random sampling. Unlike in the classical case, simple mapping reductions do not seem to work here.

abstract: We study the Moyal evolution of the canonical position and momentum variables. We compare it with the classical evolution and show that, contrary to what is commonly found in the literature, the two dynamics do not coincide. We prove that this divergence is quite general by studying Hamiltonians of the form $p^2 /2m + V(q)$. Several alternative formulations of Moyal dynamics are then suggested. We introduce the concept of starfunction and use it to reformulate the Moyal equations in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations on the noncommutative Moyal plane. We then use this formulation to study the semiclassical expansion of Moyal trajectories, which is cast in terms of a (order by order in $\hbar$) recursive hierarchy of i) first order partial differential equations as well as ii) systems of first order ordinary differential equations. The latter formulation is derived independently for analytic Hamiltonians as well as for the more general case of smooth local integrable ones. We present various examples illustrating these results.

abstract: James Clerk Maxwell unknowingly discovered a correct relativistic, quantum theory for the light quantum, forty-three years before Einstein postulated the photon's existence. In this theory, the usual Maxwell field is the quantum wave function for a single photon. When the non-operator Maxwell field of a single photon is second quantized, the standard Dirac theory of quantum optics is obtained. Recently, quantum-state tomography has been applied to experimentally determine photon wave functions.

abstract: One of the central issues in the hidden subgroup problem is to bound the sample complexity, i.e., the number of identical samples of coset states sufficient and necessary to solve the problem. In this paper, we present general bounds for the sample complexity of the identification and decision versions of the hidden subgroup problem. As a consequence of the bounds, we show that the sample complexity for both of the decision and identification versions is $\Theta(\log|\HH|/\log p)$ for a candidate set $\HH$ of hidden subgroups in the case that the candidate subgroups have the same prime order $p$, which implies that the decision version is at least as hard as the identification version in this case. In particular, it does so for the important instances such as the dihedral and the symmetric hidden subgroup problems. Moreover, the upper bound of the identification is attained by the pretty good measurement. This shows that the pretty good measurement can identify any hidden subgroup of an arbitrary group with at most $O(\log|\HH|)$ samples.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relation between the curvature of the physical space and the deformation function of the deformed oscillator algebra using non-linear coherent states approach. For this purpose, we study two-dimensional harmonic oscillators on the flat surface and on a sphere by applying the Higgs modell. With the use of their algebras, we show that the two-dimensional oscillator algebra on a surface can be considered as a deformed one-dimensional oscillator algebra where the effect of the curvature of the surface is appeared as a deformation function. We also show that the curvature of the physical space plays the role of deformation parameter. Then we construct the associated coherent states on the flat surface and on a sphere and compare their quantum statistical properties, including quadrature squeezing and antibunching effect.

abstract: Considerable effort has been devoted to deriving the Born rule (e.g. that $|\psi(x)|^2 dx$ is the probability of finding a system, described by $\psi$, between $x$ and $x + dx$) in quantum mechanics. Here we show that the Born rule is not solely quantum mechanical; rather, it arises naturally in the Hilbert space formulation of {\it classical} mechanics as well. These results provide new insights into the nature of the Born rule, and impact on its understanding in the framework of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Broadcast encryption allows the sender to securely distribute his/her secret to a dynamically changing group of users over a broadcast channel. In this paper, we just consider a simple broadcast communication task in quantum scenario, which the central party broadcasts his secret to multi-receiver via quantum channel. We present three quantum broadcast communication schemes. The first scheme utilizes entanglement swapping and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state to realize a task that the central party broadcasts his secret to a group of receivers who share a group key with him. In the second scheme, based on dense coding, the central party broadcasts the secret to multi-receiver who share each of their authentication key with him. The third scheme is a quantum broadcast communication scheme with quantum encryption, which the central party can broadcast the secret to any subset of the legal receivers.

abstract: A more detailed analysis of the measurement problem continues to support the position taken by Shimony and the author that collapse of the wave function takes place in an objective manner in the rhodopsin molecule of the retina. This casts further doubts on the theories involving a spontaneous localization collapse process or a no-collapse decoherence process taking place in the visual cortex in a subjective fashion. The possibility is then raised, as per Anandan, as to whether the solution of the measurement problem in quantum theory allows one to address the problem of quantizing gravitation.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604182
abstract: Using a single spin-1 object as an example, we discuss a recent approach to quantum entanglement. The key idea of the approach consists in presetting of basic observables in the very definition of quantum system. Specification of basic observables defines the dynamic symmetry of the system. Entangled states of the system are then interpreted as states with maximal amount of uncertainty of all basic observables. The approach gives purely physical picture of entanglement. In particular, it separates principle physical properties of entanglement from inessential. Within the model example under consideration, we show relativity of entanglement with respect to dynamic symmetry and argue existence of single-particle entanglement. A number of physical examples are considered.

In the first part, the representation theory of the unitary and symmetric groups is used to analyse the spectra of quantum states. In particular, it is shown how to derive a one-to-one relation between the spectra of a bipartite quantum state and its reduced states, and the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group. In the second part, the focus lies on the entanglement of bipartite quantum states. Drawing on an analogy between entanglement distillation and secret-key agreement in classical cryptography, a new entanglement measure, `squashed entanglement', is introduced.

abstract: In this Paper, we investigate the security of Zhang, Li and Guo quantum key distribution via quantum encryption protocol [$\text{Phys. Rev. A} \textbf{64}, 24302 (2001)$] and show that it is not secure against some of Eve's attacks and with the probability one half she gets all of keys without being detected by the two parties. The main defect in this protocol is that there is an attack strategy by which Eve can change the previously shared Bell state between Alice and Bob to two Bell states among herself and Alice and Bob. Hence, we show that with probability $1/d$ its generalization to $d$-dimension systems is not secure and show that its extension to the case of more partners based on the reusable GHZ states is not secure and with probability one half Eve gets all of keys without being detected by the two parties. In what follows, we show how in going to higher dimensions those protocols can be repaired.

abstract: The renormalization group is a tool that allows one to obtain a reduced description of systems with many degrees of freedom while preserving the relevant features. In the case of quantum systems, in particular, one-dimensional systems defined on a chain, an optimal formulation is given by White's "density matrix renormalization group". This formulation can be shown to rely on concepts of the developing theory of quantum information. Furthermore, White's algorithm can be connected with a peculiar type of quantization, namely, angular quantization. This type of quantization arose in connection with quantum gravity problems, in particular, the Unruh effect in the problem of black-hole entropy and Hawking radiation. This connection highlights the importance of quantum system boundaries, regarding the concentration of quantum states on them, and helps us to understand the optimal nature of White's algorithm.

abstract: We present a design for a quantum key distribution(QKD) system in a Sagnac loop configuration, employing a novel phase modulation scheme based on frequency shift, and demonstrate stable BB84 QKD operation with high interference visibility and low quantum bit error rate (QBER). The phase modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and by modulating the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon leaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or the optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be controlled by varying the amount of frequency shift. To demonstrate its operation, we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) as the frequency-shift element, and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase information.The interference visibility for a 40km and a 10km fiber loop is 96% and 99%, respectively, at single photon level. We ran BB84 protocol in a 40-km Sagnac loop setup continuously for one hour and the measured QBER remained within the 2%~5% range. A further advantage of our scheme is that both phase and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously by frequency and amplitude modulation of the AOM's driving signal, allowing our QKD system the capability of implementing other protocols, such as the decoy-state QKD and the continuous- variable QKD. We also briefly discuss a new type of Eavesdropping strategy ("phaseremapping" attack) in bidirectional QKD system.

abstract: Research in quantum games has flourished during recent years. However, it seems that opinion remains divided about their true quantum character and content. For example, one argument says that quantum games are nothing but 'disguised' classical games and that to quantize a game is equivalent to replacing the original game by a different classical game. The present thesis contributes towards the ongoing debate about quantum nature of quantum games by developing two approaches addressing the related issues. Both approaches take Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type experiments as the underlying physical set-ups to play two-player quantum games. In the first approach, the players' strategies are unit vectors in their respective planes, with the knowledge of coordinate axes being shared between them. Players perform measurements in an EPR-type setting and their payoffs are defined as functions of the correlations, i.e. without reference to classical or quantum mechanics. Classical bimatrix games are reproduced if the input states are classical and perfectly anti-correlated, as for a classical correlation game. However, for a quantum correlation game, with an entangled singlet state as input, qualitatively different solutions are obtained. The second approach uses the result that when the predictions of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model are made to violate the Bell inequalities the result is that some probability measures assume negative values. With the requirement that classical games result when the predictions of a LHV model do not violate the Bell inequalities, our analysis looks at the impact which the emergence of negative probabilities has on the solutions of two-player games which are physically implemented using the EPR-type experiments.

abstract: Let M be the set of mixed states and S the set of separable states of the two-qubit system, and G = SU(2) x SU(2) the group of local unitary transformations (ignoring the overall phase factor). We compute the multigraded Poincare series for the algebra of G-invariant polynomial functions on the affine space of all Hermitian operators of trace 1. We check that this series is consistent with the list of invariants computed by Makhlin. By using the recent result of Augusiak et al., we show that the boundary of S decomposes naturally into two pieces. We prove that the part of this boundary which is contained in the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.

abstract: It is often objected that the Everett interpretation of QM cannot make sense of quantum probabilities, in one or both of two ways: either it can't make sense of probability at all, or it can't explain why probability should be governed by the Born rule. David Deutsch has attempted to meet these objections. He argues not only that rational decision under uncertainty makes sense in the Everett interpretation, but also that under reasonable assumptions, the credences of a rational agent in an Everett world should be constrained by the Born rule. David Wallace has developed and defended Deutsch's proposal, and greatly clarified its conceptual basis. In particular, he has stressed its reliance on the distinguishing symmetry of the Everett view, viz., that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are treated as equally real. The argument thus tries to make a virtue of what has usually been seen as the main obstacle to making sense of probability in the Everett world. In this note I outline some objections to the Deutsch-Wallace argument, and to related proposals by Hilary Greaves about the epistemology of Everettian QM. (In the latter case, my arguments include an appeal to an Everettian analogue of the Sleeping Beauty problem.) The common thread to these objections is that the symmetry in question remains a very significant obstacle to making sense of probability in the Everett interpretation.

abstract: In most proposals for the generation of entanglement in large ensembles of atoms via projective measurements, the interaction with the vacuum is responsible for both the generation of the signal that is detected and the spin depolarization or decoherence. In consequence, one has to usually work in a regime where the information aquisition via detection is sufficiently slow (weak measurement regime) such as not to strongly disturb the system. We propose here a four-wave mixing scheme where, owing to the pumping of the atomic system into a dark state, the polarization of the ensemble is not critically affected by spontaneous emission, thus allowing one to work in a strong measurement regime.

abstract: The calculation time for the energy of atoms and molecules scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chemical interest using modest numbers of quantum bits. Calculations of the water and lithium hydride molecular ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estimation algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the number of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum bits.

abstract: We will demonstrate in this paper that Bell's theorem (Bell's inequality) does not really conflict with quantum mechanics, the controversy between them originates from the different definitions for the expectation value using the probability distribution in Bell's inequality and the expectation value in quantum mechanics. We can not use quantum mechanical expectation value measured in experiments to show the violation of Bell's inequality and then further deny the local hidden-variables theory. Considering the difference of their expectation values, a generalized Bell's inequality is presented, which is coincided with the prediction of quantum mechanics.

abstract: In the well known treatment of quantum teleportation, the receiver should convert the state of his EPR particle into the replica of the unknown quantum state by one of four possible unitary transformations. However, the importance of these unitary transformations must be emphasized. We will show in this paper that the receiver can not transform the state of his particle into an exact replica of the unknown state which the sender want to transfer if he have not a proper implementation of these unitary transformations. In the procedure of converting state, the inevitable coupling between EPR particle and environment which is needed by the implementation of unitary transformations will reduce the accuracy of the replica.

The state functions at each time step are expressed as a simple sum of three Chebyshev polynomials. The functions provide an analytic expression for the development of the walks with time.

abstract: We analyze dynamical consequences of a conjecture that there exists a fundamental (indivisible) quant of time. In particular we study the problem of discrete energy levels of hydrogen atom. We are able to reconstruct potential which in discrete time formalism leads to energy levels of unperturbed hydrogen atom. We also consider linear energy levels of quantum harmonic oscillator and show how they are produced in the discrete time formalism. More generally, we show that in discrete time formalism finite motion in central potential leads to discrete energy spectrum, the property which is common for quantum mechanical theory. Thus deterministic (but discrete time!) dynamics is compatible with discrete energy levels.

abstract: Decoherence-Free Subsystems (DFS) are a powerful means of protecting quantum information against noise with known symmetry properties. Although Hamiltonians theoretically exist that can implement a universal set of logic gates on DFS encoded qubits without ever leaving the protected subsystem, the natural Hamiltonians that are available in specific implementations do not necessarily have this property. Here we describe some of the principles that can be used in such cases to operate on encoded qubits without losing the protection offered by the DFS. In particular, we show how dynamical decoupling can be used to control decoherence during the unavoidable excursions outside of the DFS. By means of cumulant expansions, we show how the fidelity of quantum gates implemented by this method on a simple two-physical-qubit DFS depends on the correlation time of the noise responsible for decoherence. We further show by means of numerical simulations how our previously introduced "strongly modulating pulses" for NMR quantum information processing can permit high-fidelity operations on multiple DFS encoded qubits in practice, provided that the rate at which the system can be modulated is fast compared to the correlation time of the noise. The principles thereby illustrated are expected to be broadly applicable to many implementations of quantum information processors based on DFS encoded qubits.

As a special case, we demonstrate that W state can be created with unit probability within this framework.

We investigate different geometries of the trapping potential, in particular we study the properties of eigenenergies and eigenfunctions for quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional traps. We show that the quasi-one- and the quasi-two-dimensional regimes for two atoms can be already realized in the traps with moderately large (or small) ratios of the trapping frequencies in the axial and the transverse directions. Finally, we apply our theory to Feshbach resonances for trapped atoms. Introducing in our description an energy-dependent scattering length we calculate analytically the eigenenergies for two trapped atoms in the presence of a Feshbach resonance.

abstract: We propose a more general method for detecting a set of entanglement measures, i.e. negativities, in an \emph{arbitrary} tripartite quantum state by local operations and classical communication. To accomplish the detection task using this method, three observers, Alice, Bob and Charlie, do not need to perform the partial transposition maps by the structural physical approximation; instead, they are only required to collectively measure some functions via three local networks supplemented by a classical communication. With these functions, they are able to determine the set of negativities related to the tripartite quantum state.

abstract: In quantum computation and information science, the geometrical representations based on the Bloch sphere representation for transformations of two state systems have been traditionally used. While this representation is very useful for the two state qubit, it cannot be generalized easily to multiple states like that of qudits and when it is generalized, it looses its simple geometrical representation. This paper proposes the use of an alternative representation in quantum information and computation for qubits as well as qudits based on the Majorana representation on the Riemann Sphere, which preserves the simple sphere representation.

abstract: The photon density operator function is used to calculate light beam propagation through turbulent atmosphere. A kinetic equation for the photon distribution function is derived and solved using the method of characteristics. Optical wave correlations are described in terms of photon trajectories that depend on fluctuations of the refractive index. It is shown that both linear and quadratic disturbances produce sizable effects for long-distance propagation. The quadratic terms are shown to suppress the correlation of waves with different wave vectors. We examine the intensity fluctuations of partially coherent beams (beams whose initial spatial coherence is partially destroyed). Our calculations show that it is possible to significantly reduce the intensity fluctuations by using a partially coherent beam. The physical mechanism responsible for this pronounced reduction is similar to that of the Hanbury-Braun, Twiss effect.

abstract: By extending Einstein's separation of wave and particle parts of the second order thermal fluctuation to encompass "generalized fluctuations" in any Bose field, P. E. Gordon has proposed alternative definitions for nth order coherence and nth order coherent states. The main point of this paper is to explore some of the physical insights to be gained by extending dualism to higher orders. Recent experiments have examined aspects of the coherence of Bose-Einstein condensates. It has been argued that the condensate state is coherent to (at least) second or third order, but the coherence properties of Bose-Einstein condensates remain somewhat controversial. Using probability distributions developed by M. O. Scully and V. V. Kocharovsky et. al., we apply Gordon's dualistic expression of the coherence conditions to investigate coherence properties in Bose-Einstein condensation. Via numerical calculations, we present a graphical survey of wave-like and particle-like fluctuations in condensed and uncondensed fractions. Near the critical point, we find a very marked peak in the ratio of nth order wave to nth order particle fluctuations in the condensate. Not surprisingly, n-point correlations between the positions of condensate atoms also peak near the critical temperature, and this apparently mirrors, to higher orders, the well-known relation between the integral of the 2-point correlation function over a certain volume and the rms fluctuation in the number of particles in that volume.

In this Letter, we focus on the peculiarity of some systems to distribute entanglement between distant parties. Even in realistic models, like the spin-1 Heisenberg chain, sizable entanglement is present between arbitrarily distant particles. We show that long distance entanglement appears for values of the microscopic parameters which do not coincide with known quantum critical points, hence signaling a transition detected only by genuine quantum correlations.

Recently, a Bell-type theorem has been proven using a weaker notion of local causality, yet assuming the existence of perfectly correlated event types. Here we present a similar Bell-type theorem without this latter assumption. The derived inequality differs from the Clauser-Horne inequality by some small correction terms, which render it less constraining.

abstract: In the thermodynamic limit two distinct states of matter cannot be analytic continuations of each other. Classical phase transitions are characterized by non-analyticities of the free energy. For quantum phase transitions (QPTs) the ground state energy often assumes the role of the free energy. But in a number of important cases this criterion fails to predict a QPT, such as the three-dimensional metal-insulator transition of non-interacting electrons in a random potential (Anderson localization). It is therefore essential that we find alternative criteria that can track fundamental changes in the internal correlations of the ground state wavefunction. Here we propose that QPTs are generally accompanied by non-analyticities of the von Neumann (entanglement) entropy. In particular, the entropy is non-analytic at the Anderson transition, where it exhibits unusual fractal scaling. We also examine two dissipative quantum systems of considerable interest to the study of decoherence and find that non-analyticities occur if and only if the system undergoes a QPT.

abstract: We generalize the scattering theory of quantum shot noise to include the full spin-density matrix of electrons injected from a spin-filtering or ferromagnetic electrode into a quantum-coherent nanostructure governed by various spin-dependent interactions. This formalism yields the spin-resolved shot noise power for different experimental measurement setups--with ferromagnetic source and ferromagnetic or normal drain electrodes--whose evaluation for the diffusive multichannel quantum wires with the Rashba (SO) spin-orbit coupling shows how spin decoherence and dephasing lead to substantial enhancement of charge current fluctuations (characterized by Fano factors $> 1/3$). However, these processes and the corresponding shot noise increase are suppressed in narrow wires, so that charge transport experiments measuring the Fano factor $F_{\uparrow \to \uparrow \downarrow}$ in a ferromagnet/SO-coupled-wire/paramagnet setup also quantify the degree of phase-coherence of transported spin--we predict a one-to-one correspondence between the magnitude of the spin polarization vector and $F_{\uparrow \to \uparrow \downarrow}$.

abstract: We present a measurement scheme for observing the Berry phase in a flux assisted Cooper pair pump - the Cooper pair sluice. In contrast to the recent experiments, in which the sluice was employed to generate accurate current through a resistance, we consider a device in a superconducting loop. This arrangement introduces a connection between the pumped current and the Berry phase accumulated during the adiabatic pumping cycles. From the adiabaticity criterion, we derive equations for the maximum pumped current and optimize the sluice accordingly. These results apply also to the high accuracy pumping which results in a potential candidate for a metrological current standard. For measuring the pumped current, an additional Josephson junction is installed into the superconducting loop. We show in detail that the switching of this system from superconducting state into normal state as a consequence of an external current pulse through it may be employed to probe the pumped current. The experimental realization of our scheme would be the first observation of the Berry phase in superconducting circuits.

We find that the measurement can be completed with high fidelity on a timescale of 100 ps, shorter than the typical T2. Furthermore, we show that the scheme can be used to induce and observe spin oscillations without the need of time-dependent magnetic fields.

abstract: We present a 3D quantum mechanical theory of radio-frequency outcoupled atom lasers from trapped atomic gases in the presence of the gravitational force. Predictions for the total outcoupling rate as a function of the radio-frequency and for the beam wave function are given. We establish a sum rule for the energy integrated outcoupling, which leads to a separate determination of the coupling strength between the atoms and the radiation field. For a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions. The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify the outcoupling rate of the atom laser. We provide a complete quantum mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows to determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods. We also extend the formalism to a fermionic atom laser and analyze the effect of superfluidity on the outcoupling of atoms.

abstract: We consider the phase-coherent transport of electrons passing through an Aharonov-Bohm ring while interacting with a tunnel charge in a double quantum dot (representing a charge qubit) which couples symmetrically to both arms of the ring. For Aharonov-Bohm flux Phi_AB=h/2e we find that electrons can only be transmitted when they flip the charge qubit's pseudospin parity an odd number of times. The perfect correlations of the dynamics of the pseudospin and individual electronic transmission and reflection events can be used to entangle the charge qubit with an individual passing electron.

abstract: We discuss symmetry breaking in two-dimensional quantum dots resulting from strong interelectron repulsion relative to the zero-point kinetic energy associated with the confining potential. Such symmetry breaking leads to the emergence of crystalline arrangements of electrons in the dot. The so-called Wigner molecules form already at field-free conditions. The appearance of rotating Wigner molecules in circular dots under high magnetic field, and their relation to magic angular momenta and quantum-Hall-effect fractional fillings, is also discussed. Recent calculations for two electrons in an elliptic quantum dot, using exact diagonalization and an approximate generalized-Heitler-London treatment, show that the electrons can localize and form a molecular dimer for screened interelectron repulsion. The calculated singlet-triplet splitting (J) as a function of the magnetic field (B) agrees with cotunneling measurements; its behavior reflects the effective dissociation of the dimer for large B. Knowledge of the dot shape and of J(B) allows determination of two measures of entanglement (concurrence and von Neumann entropy for indistinguishable fermions), whose behavior correlates also with the dissociation of the dimer. The theoretical value for the concurrence at B=0 agrees with the experimental estimates.

abstract: We describe how the spin coherence time of a localized electron spin in solids, i.e. a solid state spin qubit, can be prolonged by applying designed electron spin resonance pulse sequences. In particular, the spin echo decay due to the spectral diffusion of the electron spin resonance frequency induced by the non-Markovian temporal fluctuations of the nuclear spin flip-flop dynamics can be strongly suppressed using multiple-pulse sequences akin to the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence in nuclear magnetic resonance. Spin coherence time can be enhanced by factors of 4-10 in GaAs quantum dot and Si:P quantum computer architectures using composite sequences with an even number of pulses.

abstract: We find a close correspondence between generalized Bell inequalities of a special kind and certain frustrated spin systems. For example, the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality corresponds to the frustrated square with the signs +++- for the nearest neighbor interaction between the spins. Similarly, the Pearle-Braunstein-Cave inequality corresponds to a frustrated even ring with the corresponding signs +...+-. Upon this correspondence, the violation of such inequalities by the entangled singlet state in quantum mechanics is equivalent to the spin system possessing a classical coplanar ground state, the energy of which is lower than the Ising ground state's energy. We propose a scheme which generates new inequalities and give further examples, the frustrated hexagon with additional diagonal bonds and the frustrated hypercubes in n=3,4,5 dimensions. Surprisingly, the hypercube in n=4 dimensions yields an inequality which is not violated by the singlet state. We extend the correspondence to other entangled states and XXZ-models of spin systems.

We get a scaling law with a critical exponent is $\nu=1$ in agreement with the Chayes criterion $\nu\ge 1$. The case we are considering is for off-diagonal disorder. The method we use is a perturbation approach holding in the limit of an infinitely large perturbation as recently devised and the Anderson model is considered with a Gaussian distribution of disorder. The localization length diverges when energy goes to zero with a scaling law in agreement to numerical and theoretical expectations.

abstract: For a two-state quantum object interacting with a slow mesoscopic interacting spin bath, we show that a many-body solution of the bath dynamics conditioned on the quantum-object state leads to an efficient control scheme to recover the lost quantum-object coherence through disentanglement. We demonstrate the theory with the realistic problem of one electron spin in a bath of many interacting nuclear spins in a semiconductor quantum dot. The spin language is easily generalized to a quantum object in contact with a bath of interacting multi-level quantum units with the caveat that it is mesoscopic and its dynamics is slow compared with the quantum object.

abstract: This work investigates how a conical singularity can affect the specific heat of systems. A free nonrelativistic particle confined to the lateral surface of a cone -- conical box -- is taken as a toy model. Its specific heat is determined as a function of the deficit angle and the temperature. For a vanishing deficit angle, the specific heat is that of a particle in a flat disk where a characteristic temperature separates quantum and classical behaviors, as usual. By increasing the deficit angle the characteristic temperature increases also, and eventually another characteristic temperature (which does not depend on the deficit angle) arises. When the cone gets sufficiently sharp, at low and intermediate temperatures the azimuthal degree of freedom is suppressed. At low temperatures the specific heat varies discontinuously with the deficit angle. Connections between certain theorems regarding common zeros of the Bessel functions and this discontinuity are reported.

abstract: We consider a multilevel hydrogen atom in interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field and separately calculate the contributions of the vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy of the atom for uniform acceleration. It is found that the acceleration disturbs the vacuum fluctuations in such a way that the delicate balance between the contributions of vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction that exists for inertial atoms is broken, so that the transitions to higher-lying states from ground state are possible even in vacuum. In contrast to the case of an atom interacting with a scalar field, the contributions of both electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the spontaneous emission rate are affected by the acceleration, and furthermore the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations contains a non-thermal acceleration-dependent correction, which is possibly observable.

abstract: Contradiction between Hawking's semi-classical arguments and string theory on the evaporation of black hole has been one of the most intriguing problems in fundamental physics. A final-state boundary condition inside the black hole was proposed by Horowitz and Maldacena to resolve this contradiction. We point out that original Hawking effect can be also regarded as a separate boundary condition at the event horizon for this scenario. Here, we found that the change of Hawking boundary condition may affect the information transfer from the initial collapsing matter to the outgoing Hawking radiation during evaporation process and as a result the evaporation process itself, significantly.

abstract: The quantum version of a non-linear oscillator, previouly analyzed at the classical level, is studied. This is a problem of quantization of a system with position-dependent mass of the form $m={(1+\lambda x^2)}^{-1}$ and with a $\la$-dependent nonpolynomial rational potential. This $\la$-dependent system can be considered as a deformation of the harmonic oscillator in the sense that for $\la\to 0$ all the characteristics of the linear oscillator are recovered. Firstly, the $\la$-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solved as a Sturm-Liouville problem and the $\la$-dependent eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are obtained for both $\la>0$ and $\la<0$. The $\la$-dependent wave functions appear as related with a family of orthogonal polynomials that can be considered as $\la$-deformations of the standard Hermite polynomials. In the second part, the $\la$-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is solved by using the Schr\"odinger factorization method, the theory of intertwined Hamiltonians and the property of shape invariance as an approach. Finally, the new family of orthogonal polynomials is studied. We prove the existence of a $\la$-dependent Rodrigues formula, a generating function and $\la$-dependent recursion relations between polynomials of different orders.

abstract: In 1932 Ettore Majorana proposed an infinite-component relativistic wave equation for particles of arbitrary integer and half-integer spin. In the late 80s and early 90s it was found that the higher-derivative geometric particle models underlie the Majorana equation, and that its (2+1)-dimensional analogue provides with a natural basis for the description of relativistic anyons. We review these aspects and discuss the relationship of the equation to the exotic planar Galilei symmetry and noncommutative geometry. We also point out the relation of some Abelian gauge field theories with Chern-Simons terms to the Landau problem in the noncommutative plane from the perspective of the Majorana equation.

abstract: We consider an infinite spin chain as a bipartite system consisting of the left and right half-chain and analyze entanglement properties of pure states with respect to this splitting. In this context we show that the amount of entanglement contained in a given state is deeply related to the von Neumann type of the observable algebras associated to the half-chains. Only the type I case belongs to the usual entanglement theory which deals with density operators on tensor product Hilbert spaces, and only in this situation separable normal states exist. In all other cases the corresponding state is infinitely entangled in the sense that one copy of the system in such a state is sufficient to distill an infinite amount of maximally entangled qubit pairs. We apply this results to the critical XY model and show that its unique ground state provides a particular example for this type of entanglement.

abstract: The paper gives a succinct appraisal of the properties of the projective line defined over the direct product ring $R\_{\triangle} \equiv$ GF(2)$\otimesGF(2)\otimes$GF(2). The ring is remarkable in that except for unity, all the remaining seven elements are zero-divisors, the non-trivial ones forming two distinct sets of three; elementary ('slim') and composite ('fat'). Due to this fact, the line in question is endowed with a very intricate structure. It contains twenty-seven points, every point has eighteen neighbour points, the neighbourhoods of two distant points share twelve points and those of three pairwise distant points have six points in common -- namely those with coordinates having both the entries `fat' zero-divisors. Algebraically, the points of the line can be partitioned into three groups: a) the group comprising three distinguished points of the ordinary projective line of order two (the 'nucleus'), b) the group composed of twelve points whose coordinates feature both the unit(y) and a zero-divisor (the 'inner shell') and c) the group of twelve points whose coordinates have both the entries zero-divisors (the 'outer shell'). The points of the last two groups can further be split into two subgroups of six points each; while in the former case there is a perfect symmetry between the two subsets, in the latter case the subgroups have a different footing, reflecting the existence of the two kinds of a zero-divisor. The structure of the two shells, the way how they are interconnected and their link with the nucleus are all fully revealed and illustrated in terms of the neighbour/distant relation. Possible applications of this finite ring geometry are also mentioned.

abstract: We solve the generalized relativistic harmonic oscillator in 1+1 dimensions, i.e., including a linear pseudoscalar potential and quadratic scalar and vector potentials which have equal or opposite signs. We consider positive and negative quadratic potentials and discuss in detail their bound-state solutions for fermions and antifermions. The main features of these bound states are the same as the ones of the generalized three-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator bound states. The solutions found for zero pseudoscalar potential are related to the spin and pseudospin symmetry of the Dirac equation in 3+1 dimensions. We show how the charge conjugation and $\gamma^5$ chiral transformations relate the several spectra obtained and find that for massless particles the spin and pseudospin symmetry related problems have the same spectrum, but different spinor solutions. Finally, we establish a relation of the solutions found with single-particle states of nuclei described by relativistic mean-field theories with scalar, vector and isoscalar tensor interactions and discuss the conditions in which one may have both nucleon and antinucleon bound states.

For simple and representative systems, we illustrate how to cast the equations of motion in a form encoding all classical states simultaneously through a ``state parameter''. By suitably selecting the parameter one may project the system into any desired classical state.

By considering the Lagrangians which are uniquely defined only to within an additive total time derivative of a function of co-ordinates and time the author has tried to show that the gauge transformations which relate these Lagrangians are canonical transformations. He has obtained the right conclusion only by using wrong canonical equations and the entire exercise has hence become erroneous and inconclusive. By using the definition of canonical transformation through Poisson brackets we prove that the above gauge transformations are canonical transformations.

abstract: The time dependent Schrodinger equation inclusive of curvature effects is developed for a spinless electron constrained to motion on a toroidal surface and subjected to circularly polarized and linearly polarized waves in the microwave regime. A basis set expansion is used to determine the character of the surface currents as the system is driven at a particular resonance frequency. Surface current densities and magnetic moments corresponding to those currents are calculated. It is shown that the currents can yield magnetic moments large not only along the toroidal symmetry axis, but along directions tangential and normal to the toroidal surface as well.

Within this framework, we will show that a W state in a system of three or more qubits can be generated by exploiting the sequential one by one coupling of the qubits with one of them playing the role of an entanglement mediator.

abstract: All indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the homogeneous Galilei group which when restricted to the rotation subgroup are decomposed to spin 0, 1/2 and 1 representations are constructed and classified. These representations are also obtained via contractions of the corresponding representations of the Lorentz group. Finally the obtained representations are used to derive a general Pauli anomalous interaction term and Darwin and spin-orbit couplings of a Galilean particle interacting with an external electric field.

abstract: In 1981, Takeuti introduced quantum set theory as the quantum counterpart of Boolean valued models of set theory by constructing a model of set theory based on quantum logic represented by the lattice of closed subspaces in a Hilbert space and showed that appropriate quantum counterparts of ZFC axioms hold in the model. Here, Takeuti's formulation is extended to construct a model of set theory based on the logic represented by the lattice of projections in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra. A transfer principle is established that enables us to transfer theorems of ZFC to their quantum counterparts holding in the model. The set of real numbers in the model is shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the set of self-adjoint operators affiliated with the von Neumann algebra generated by the logic. Despite the difficulty pointed out by Takeuti that equality axioms do not generally hold in quantum set theory, it is shown that equality axioms hold for any real numbers in the model. It is also shown that any observational proposition in quantum mechanics can be represented by a corresponding statement for real numbers in the model with the truth value consistent with the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, and that the equality relation between two real numbers in the model is equivalent with the notion of perfect correlation between corresponding observables (self-adjoint operators) in quantum mechanics. The paper is concluded with some remarks on the relevance to quantum set theory of the choice of the implication connective in quantum logic.

abstract: Magnetic trapping potentials for atoms on atom chips are determined by the current flow in the chip wires. By modifying the shape of the conductor we can realize specialized current flow patterns and therefore micro-design the trapping potentials. We have demonstrated this by nano-machining an atom chip using the focused ion beam technique. We built a trap, a barrier and using a BEC as a probe we showed that by polishing the conductor edge the potential roughness on the selected wire can be reduced. Furthermore we give different other designs and discuss the creation of a 1D magnetic lattice on an atom chip.
