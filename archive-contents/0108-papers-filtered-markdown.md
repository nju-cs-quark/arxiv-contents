**1.    Quantum walks in higher dimensions**

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the quantum walk in higher spatial dimensions and compare classical and quantum spreading as a function of time. Tensor products of Hadamard transformations and the discrete Fourier transform arise as natural extensions of the quantum coin toss in the one-dimensional walk simulation, and other illustrative transformations are also investigated. We find that entanglement between the dimensions serves to reduce the rate of spread of the quantum walk. The classical limit is obtained by introducing a random phase variable.

**2.    Robustness of adiabatic quantum computation**  
Andrew M. Childs, Edward Farhi, John Preskill  
Phys.Rev. A65 (2002) 012322

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the fault tolerance of quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, a quantum algorithm for solving various combinatorial search problems. We describe an inherent robustness of adiabatic computation against two kinds of errors, unitary control errors and decoherence, and we study this robustness using numerical simulations of the algorithm.
