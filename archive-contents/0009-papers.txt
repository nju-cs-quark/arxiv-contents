abstract: What has so far prevented us from decrypting quantum mechanics is the Cookie Cutter Paradigm, according to which the world's synchronic multiplicity derives from surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three-dimensional cookie cutters. This insidious notion is shown to be rooted in our neurophysiological make-up. An effort is made to liberate the physical world from this innate fallacy.

abstract: A pair of coupled quantum dissipative oscillators, serving as a model for a nanosystem, is here described by the Lindblad equation. Its dynamic evolution is shown to exhibit the features of decoherence (spatial extent of quantum behavior), correlation (spatial scale over which the system localizes to its physical dimensions), and entanglement (a special quantum feature making its appearance first in such bipartite systems) as a function of the coupling constants of the Lindblad equation. One interesting feature emerging out of this calculation is that the entanglement may exhibit revivals in time. An initially entangled state need not remain so for all time and may exhibit regions of nonentanglement. Interpreting the parameters of the Lindblad theory as environmental features in certain experimental situations, this model calculation gives us clues to possible control of decoherence, correlation, and entanglement. We indicate possible interpretation of the Lindblad parameters as control parameters in more general contexts of some recent experiments.

abstract: It is an open problem to characterize the class of languages recognized by quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a subclass of regular languages we get a condition which is necessary and sufficient. Also, we prove that the class of languages recognizable by a QFA is not closed under union or any other binary Boolean operation where both arguments are significant.

Certain similarity between classical and quantum computing errors is also discussed.

We find that eavesdropper's optimal information in QKD without public announcement of bases [Phys. Lett. A 244 (1998) 489] is the same as that of a corresponding QKD WITH it in the coherent attack. We observe a sum-rule concerning each party's information.

abstract: The semi-classical solution of the three state system is considered to study the population inversion at and away from resonance. At resonance, it is shown that if the system is initially populated either in the upper or in the lower level, then the population oscillation occurs in a way which is quite different from that if it is initially populated in the middle state. At off resonance, there is gradual suppression of the population in the excited states and in the asymptotic limit of the detuning, the system returns to its initial state.

abstract: An extension of the product operator formalism of NMR is introduced, which uses the Hadamard matrix product to describe many simple spin 1/2 relaxation processes. The utility of this formalism is illustrated by deriving NMR gradient-diffusion experiments to simulate several decoherence models of interest in quantum information processing, along with their Lindblad and Kraus representations. Gradient-diffusion experiments are also described for several more complex forms of decoherence, including the well-known collective isotropic model. Finally, it is shown that the Hadamard formalism gives a concise representation of decoherence with arbitrary correlations among the fluctuating fields at the different spins involved, and that this can be applied to both decoherence (T2) as well as nonadiabatic relaxation (T1) processes.

abstract: I present a simple two-party quantum communication complexity protocol with higher success rate than the best possible classical protocol for the same task. The quantum protocol is shown to be equivalent to a quantum non-locality test, except that it is not necessary to close the locality loophole. I derive bounds for the detector efficiency and background count rates necessary for an experimental implementation and show that they are close to what can be currently achieved using ion trap technology. I also analyze the requirements for a three-party protocol and show that they are less demanding than those for the two-party protocol. The results can be interpreted as sufficient experimental conditions for quantum non-locality tests using two or three entangled qubits.

abstract: We suggest to test the premise of ``macroscopic local realism'' which is sufficient to derive Bell inequalities when measurements of photon number are only accurate to an uncertainty of order $n$ photons, where $n$ is macroscopic. Macroscopic local realism is only sufficient to imply, in the context of the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument, fuzzy ``elements of reality'' which have a macroscopic indeterminacy. We show therefore how the violation of local realism in the presence of macroscopic uncertainties implies the failure of ``macroscopic local realism''. Quantum states violating this macroscopic local realism are presented.

By calculating the free energy of an anharmonic oscillator model, we investigated this variational expansion scheme for its efficiency. Using the modified Feynman rules for the diagrams, we obtained the analytical expression of the free energy up to the fourth order. Our numerical results at various orders are compared with the exact and other relevant results.

abstract: If we reduce coherence in a given quantum system, the result is an increase in entropy. Does this necessarily convert this quantum system into a classical system? The answer to this question is No. The decrease of coherence means more uncertainty. This does not seem to make the system closer to classical system where there are no uncertainties. We examine the problem using two coupled harmonic oscillators where we make observations on one of them while the other oscillator is assumed to be unobservable or to be in Feynman's rest of the universe. Our ignorance about the rest of the universe causes an increase in entropy. However, does the system act like a classical system? The answer is again No. When and how does this system appear like a classical system? It is shown that this paradox can be resolved only if measurements are taken along the normal coordinates. It is also shown that Feynman's parton picture is one concrete physical example of this decoherence mechanism.

abstract: We reconsider a well known problem of quantum theory, i.e. the so called measurement (or macro-objectification) problem, and we rederive the fact that it gives rise to serious problems of interpretation. The novelty of our approach derives from the fact that the relevant conclusion is obtained in a completely general way, in particular, without resorting to any of the assumptions of ideality which are usually done for the measurement process. The generality and unescapability of our assumptions (we take into account possible malfunctionings of the apparatus, its unavoidable entanglement with the environmment, its high but not absolute reliability, its fundamentally uncontrollable features) allow to draw the conclusion that the very possibility of performing measurements on a microsystem combined with the assumed general validity of the linear nature of quantum evolution leads to a fundamental contradiction.

We review this ``quantum Zeno effect'' in the light of the criticism that has been raised upon a previous attempt to demonstrate it, of later reexaminations of both the projection postulate and the significance of the observations, and of the results of a recent experiment on an individual cold atom. Here, the micro-state of the quantum system gets unveiled with the observation, and the effect of measurement is no longer mixed up with dephasing the object's wave function by the reactive effect of the detection. A procedure is outlined that promises to provide, by observation, an upper limit for the delay of even an exponential decay.

Invariant functions are suggested for arbitrary groups. The group SU(2) is studied in particular and the orbit spaces of its j=1/2 and j=1 representations completely determined. The orbits of SU(2) in CP^N can be either 2 or 3 dimensional, the first of them being either isomorphic to S^2 or to RP^2 and the latter being isomorphic to quotient spaces of RP^3. We end with a look from the same perspective to the quantum mechanical space of states in particle mechanics.

Moreover, its basic ingredients may play a role towards large-scale quantum-information processing in solid-state devices.

abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of practical quantum cryptography (QC) systems implemented in actual physical environments via either free-space or fiber-optic cable quantum channels for ground-ground, ground-satellite, air-satellite and satellite-satellite links. (1) We obtain universal expressions for the effective secrecy capacity and rate for QC systems taking into account three important attacks on individual quantum bits, including explicit closed-form expressions for the requisite amount of privacy amplification. Our analysis also includes the explicit calculation in detail of the total cost in bits of continuous authentication, thereby obtaining new results for actual ciphers of finite length. (2) We perform for the first time a detailed, explicit analysis of all systems losses due to propagation, errors, noise, etc. as appropriate to both optical fiber cable- and satellite communications-based implementations of QC. (3) We calculate for the first time all system load costs associated to classical communication and computational constraints that are ancillary to, but essential for carrying out, the pure QC protocol itself. (4) We introduce an extended family of generalizations of the Bennett-Brassard (BB84) QC protocol that equally provide unconditional secrecy but allow for the possibility of optimizing throughput rates against specific cryptanalytic attacks. (5) We obtain universal predictions for maximal rates that can be achieved with practical system designs under realistic environmental conditions. (6) We propose a specific QC system design that includes the use of a novel method of high-speed photon detection that may be able to achieve very high throughput rates for actual implementations in realistic environments.

abstract: Coulomb blockade effects in capacitively coupled quantum dots can be utilized for constructing an N-qubit system with antiferromagnetic Ising interactions. Starting from the tunneling Hamiltonian, we theoretically show that the Hamiltonian for a weakly coupled quantum-dot array is reduced to that for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Quantum operations are carried out by applying only electrical pulse sequences. Thus various error-correction methods developed in NMR spectroscopy and NMR quantum computers are applicable without using magnetic fields. A possible measurement scheme in an N-qubit system is quantitatively discussed.

abstract: We have cooled a two-ion-crystal to the ground state of its collective modes of motion. Laser cooling, more specific resolved sideband cooling is performed sympathetically by illuminating only one of the two $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in the crystal. The heating rates of the motional modes of the crystal in our linear trap have been measured, and we found them considerably smaller than those previously reported by Q. Turchette {\em et. al.} Phys. Rev. A 61, 063418 (2000) in the case of trapped $^9$Be$^+$ ions. After the ground state is prepared, coherent quantum state manipulation of the atomic population can be performed. Within the coherence time, up to 12 Rabi oscillations are observed, showing that many coherent manipulations can be achieved. Coherent excitation of each ion individually and ground state cooling are important tools for the realization of quantum information processing in ion traps.

abstract: We prove that any exact quantum algorithm searching an ordered list of N elements requires more than \frac{1}{\pi}(\ln(N)-1) queries to the list. This improves upon the previously best known lower bound of {1/12}\log_2(N) - O(1). Our proof is based on a weighted all-pairs inner product argument, and it generalizes to bounded-error quantum algorithms. The currently best known upper bound for exact searching is roughly 0.526 \log_2(N). We give an exact quantum algorithm that uses \log_3(N) + O(1) queries, which is roughly 0.631 \log_2(N). The main principles in our algorithm are an quantum parallel use of the classical binary search algorithm and a method that allows basis states in superpositions to communicate.

abstract: A major question for condensed matter physics is whether a solid-state quantum computer can ever be built. Here we discuss two different schemes for quantum information processing using semiconductor nanostructures. First, we show how optically driven coupled quantum dots can be used to prepare maximally entangled Bell and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states by varying the strength and duration of selective light pulses. The setup allows us to perform an all-optical generation of the quantum teleportation of an excitonic state in an array of coupled quantum dots. Second, we give a proposal for reliable implementation of quantum logic gates and long decoherence times in a quantum dots system based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where the nuclear resonance is controlled by the ground state transitions of few-electron QDs in an external magnetic field. The dynamical evolution of these systems in the presence of environmentally-induced decoherence effects is also discussed.

abstract: A nonrelativistic equation for the system of two interacting particles within the framework of a model with noncommuting operators of coordinates and momenta of different particles is proposed, and a self-consistent system of equations for the wave function of every quantum state is deduced. Solutions for the lowest states of a hydrogenlike atom are found, and the comparison with analogous solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for the relativistic spinless problem is performed. In the case where the size of a two-particle system and the Compton wavelengths of particles forming it are of the same order, the essential differences with solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger nonrelativistic equation are revealed.

abstract: Electron gas in a wire connected to two terminals with potential drop is studied with the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. Recent studies, where the current is enforced to flow with a Lagrange-multiplier term, demonstrated that the current enhances the one-particle-correlation function. We report that in our model, such enhancement is not guaranteed to occur, but conditional both on the potential drop and the positions where we observe the correlation function. That is, under a certain condition, spatially modulated pattern is formed in the wire owing to the nonequilibrium current.

abstract: We provide several new results on quantum state space, on lattice of subspaces of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and on infinite dimensional Hilbert space equations as well as on connections between them. In particular we obtain an n-variable generalized orthoarguesian equation which holds in any infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Then we strengthen Godowski's result by showing that in an ortholattice on which strong states are defined Godowski's equations as well as the orthomodularity hold. We also prove that all 6- and 4-variable orthoarguesian equations presented in the literature can be reduced to new 4- and 3-variable ones, respectively and that Mayet's examples follow from Godowski's equations. To make a breakthrough in testing these massive equations we designed several novel algorithms for generating Greechie diagrams with an arbitrary number of blocks and atoms (currently testing with up to 50) and for automated checking of equations on them. A way of obtaining complex infinite dimensional Hilbert space from the Hilbert lattice equipped with several additional conditions and without invoking the notion of state is presented. Possible repercussions of the results to quantum computing problems are discussed.

abstract: We give a new algorithm for generating Greechie diagrams with arbitrary chosen number of atoms or blocks (with 2,3,4,... atoms) and provide a computer program for generating the diagrams. The results show that the previous algorithm does not produce every diagram and that it is at least 100,000 times slower. We also provide an algorithm and programs for checking of Greechie diagram passage by equations defining varieties of orthomodular lattices and give examples from Hilbert lattices. At the end we discuss some additional characteristics of Greechie diagrams.

abstract: In this investigation, we have suggested a special two-slit experiment which can distinguish between the standard and the Bohmian quantum mechanics. At the first step, we have shown that observable individual predictions obtained from these two theories are inconsistent for a special case. But, at the ensemble level, they are consistent as was expected. Then, as another special case and using selective detection, it is shown that an observable disagreement between the two theories can exist at the ensemble level of particles. This can encourage new efforts for finding other inconsistencies between the two theories, theoretically and experimentally.

abstract: Consider a ring of N qubits in a translationally invariant quantum state. We ask to what extent each pair of nearest neighbors can be entangled. Under certain assumptions about the form of the state, we find a formula for the maximum possible nearest-neighbor entanglement. We then compare this maximum with the entanglement achieved by the ground state of an antiferromagnetic ring consisting of an even number of spin-1/2 particles. We find that, though the antiferromagnetic ground state does not maximize the nearest-neighbor entanglement relative to all other states, it does so relative to other states having zero z-component of spin.

The effect of the errors from imperfect control of the classical parameters, the looping variation of which builds up holonomic gates, is investigated. Additionally, the influence of quantum decoherence on holonomic teleportation used as a computational primitive is studied. Advantages of the holonomic implementation with respect to control errors and dissipation are presented.

We observe a qualitative change in decoherence versus separation as the number of scattered photons increases, and verify quantitatively the decoherence rate constant in the many-photon limit. Our results illustrate an evolution of decoherence consistent with general models developed for a broad class of decoherence phenomenon.

abstract: The radial momentum operator in quantum mechanics is usually obtained through canonical quantization of the (symmetrical form of the) classical radial momentum. We show that the well known connection between the Hamiltonian of a free particle and the radial momentum operator $\hat{H}=\hat{P}_{r}^2/2m+ $\hat{L}^2$}/2mr^{2}$ is true only in one or three dimensions. In general, an extra term of the form $\hbar^{2}(n-1)(n-3)/ 2m \cdot 4r^{2}$ has to be added to the Hamiltonian.

abstract: Entanglement between particle and detector is known to be inherent in the measurement process. Gurvitz recently analyzed the coupling of an electron in a double dot (DD) to a quantum point contact (QPC) detector. In this paper we examine the dynamics of entanglement that result between the DD and QPC. The rate of entanglement is optimized as a function of coupling when the electron is initially in one of the dots. It decreases asymptotically towards zero with increased coupling. The opposite behavior is observed when the DD is initially in a superposition: the rate of entanglement increases unboundedly as the coupling is increased. The possibility that there are conditions for which measurement occurs versus entanglement is considered.

When the sender prepares the signal states by mutually orthogonal unitary transformations with equal {\it a priori} probabilities, the capacity of dense coding is maximized. It is also proved that the optimal capacity of dense coding $\chi ^{*}$ satisfies $E_{R}(\rho)\leq \chi ^{*}\leq E_{R}(\rho )+\log_{2}d$, where $E_{R}(\rho)$ is the relative entropy of entanglement of the shared entangled state.

abstract: We consider second order differential operators with coefficients which are Gaussian random fields. When the covariance becomes singular at short distances then the propagators of the Schr\"odinger equation as well as of the wave equation behave in an anomalous way. In particular, the Feynman propagator for the wave equation is less singular than the one with deterministic coefficients. We suggest some applications to quantum gravity.

abstract: In a recent paper Griffiths claims that the consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics gives rise to results that contradict those obtained from the Bohm interpretation. This is in spite of the fact that both claim to provide a realist interpretation of the formalism without the need to add any new mathematical content and both always produce exactly the same probability predictions of the outcome of experiments. In constrasting the differences Griffiths argues that the consistent histories interpretation provides a more physically reasonable account of quantum phenomena. We examine this claim and show that the consistent histories approach is not without its difficulties.

abstract: The decay rate and the classical radiation power of an excited molecule (atom) located in the center of a dispersive and absorbing dielectric sphere taken as a simple model of a cavity are calculated adopting the Onsager model for the local field. The local-field correction factor to the external (radiation and absorption) power loss of the molecule is found to be $|3\epsilon(\omega)/[3\epsilon(\omega)+1]|^2$, with $\epsilon(\omega)$ being the dielectric function of the sphere. However, local-field corrections to the total decay rate (power loss) of the molecule are found to be much more complex, including those to the decay rate in the infinite cavity medium, as derived very recently by Scheel et al. [Rev. A 60, 4094 (1999)], and similiar corrections to the cavity-induced decay rate. The results obtained can be cast into model-independent forms. This suggests the general results for the local-field corrections to the decay rate and to the external power loss of a molecule in an absorbing cavity valid for molecule positions away from the cavity walls.

abstract: Bell's theorem states that quantum correlation function of two spins can not be represented as an expectation value of two classical random variables. Spin is described in Bell's model by a single scalar random variable. We discuss another classical model of spin in which spin is described by a triple of classical random variables. It is shown that in this model the quantum correlation function can be represented as the expectation value of classical random variables. Implications of this result to the problem of local causality of quantum mechanics and relations with problems of moments are briefly mentioned.

Pulse sequences which include non 90 degree pulses are given.

Increasing the field can also create entanglement between otherwise disentangled spins. This entanglement can be confirmed by testing Bell's inequalities involving any two spins in the solid.

The second one, a single-photon experiment, utilizes the same trick to emulate two particle correlations, and is an "event ready" test of a Bell-like inequality, derived from the noncontextuality assumption. Modulo fair sampling, the data falsify NCHV's.

abstract: Orthodox Copenhagen quantum theory renounces the quest to understand the reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules that describe connections between our observations. However, an examination of certain nonlocal features of quantum theory suggests that the perceived need for this renunciation was due to the uncritical importation from classical physics of a crippling metaphysical prejudice, and that rejection of that prejudice opens the way to a dynamical theory of the interaction between mind and brain that has significant explanatory power.

Such real entanglement is different from entanglement in standard quantum mechanics over the complex numbers. The differences provide insight into the nature of entanglement in standard quantum theory. Wootters [Phys. Rev.

We give a contrasting formula for the entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two ``rebits,'' a rebit being a system whose Hilbert space is a 2-dimensional real vector space.

abstract: We study the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect and the related He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) effect in 2+1 dimensions. In this restricted space these effects are the result of the interaction of the electromagnetic field tensor with the dual of a current. Transferring the dual operation from the current to the field tensor shows that this interaction may be reinterpreted as due to the interaction of an effective vector potential and a current, and the AC and HMW effects follow immediately. A general proof of this for particles with an arbitrary spin is provided. The restriction to 2+1 dimensions, with this interpretation, provides a unified way of treating the AC and HMW effects for an arbitrary spin. Perhaps more interestingly the treatment shows that a spin-0 particle can show AC and HMW effects, although it has no magnetic or electric dipole moment in the usual sense.

abstract: An analogous model system for quantum information processing is discussed, based on classical wave optics. The model system is applied to three examples that involve three qubits: ({\em i}) three-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement, ({\em ii}) quantum teleportation, and ({\em iii}) a simple quantum error correction network. It is found that the model system can successfully simulate most features of entanglement, but fails to simulate quantum nonlocality. Investigations of how far the classical simulation can be pushed show that {\em quantum nonlocality} is the essential ingredient of a quantum computer, even more so than entanglement. The well known problem of exponential resources required for a classical simulation of a quantum computer, is also linked to the nonlocal nature of entanglement, rather than to the nonfactorizability of the state vector.

abstract: Shr\"odinger equation for two-step spontaneous cascade transition in a three-level quantum system is solved by means of Markovian approximation for non-Markovian integro-differential evolution equations for amplitudes of states. It is shown that both decay constant and radiation shift of initial level are affected by instability of intermediate level of the cascade. These phenomena are interpreted as the different manifestations of quantum Zeno-like effect. The spectra of particles emitted during the cascade transition are calculated in the general case and, in particular, for an unusual situation when the initial state is lower than the intermediate one. It is shown that the spectra of particles do not have a peak-like shape in the latter case.

abstract: Accounting for resources is the central issue in computational efficiency. We point out physical constraints implicit in information readout that have been overlooked in classical computing. The basic particle-counting mode of read-out sets a lower bound on the resources needed to implement a quantum computer. As a consequence, computers based on classical waves are as efficient as those based on single quantum particles.

abstract: We extend the notion of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) models from potential ones and differential equations to Bose systems. We obtain conditions under which algebraization of the part of the spectrum occurs. In some particular cases simple exact expressions for several energy levels of an anharmonic Bose oscillator are obtained explicitly. The corresponding results do not exploit perturbation theory and include strong coupling regime. A generic Hamiltonian under discussion cannot, in contrast to QES potential models, be expressed as a polynomial in generators of $sl_{2}$ algebra. The suggested approach is extendable to many-particle Bose systems with interaction.

abstract: Quantum constraints of the type Q \psi = 0 can be straightforwardly implemented in cases where Q is a self-adjoint operator for which zero is an eigenvalue. In that case, the physical Hilbert space is obtained by projecting onto the kernel of Q, i.e. H_phys = ker(Q) = ker(Q*). It is, however, nontrivial to identify and project onto H_phys when zero is not in the point spectrum but instead is in the continuous spectrum of Q, because in this case the kernel of Q is empty. Here, we observe that the topology of the underlying Hilbert space can be harmlessly modified in the direction perpendicular to the constraint surface in such a way that Q becomes non-self-adjoint. This procedure then allows us to conveniently obtain H_phys as the proper Hilbert subspace H_phys = ker(Q*), on which one can project as usual. In the simplest case, the necessary change of topology amounts to passing from an L^2 Hilbert space to a Sobolev space.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Based on the concept of many-letter theory, an observable is defined measuring the raw quantum information content of single messages. A general characterization of quantum codes using the Kraus representation is given. Compression codes are defined by their property of decreasing the expected raw information content of a given message ensemble. Lossless quantum codes, in contrast to lossy codes, provide the retrieval of the original data with perfect fidelity. A general lossless coding scheme is given that translates between two quantum alphabets. It is shown that this scheme is never compressive. Furthermore, a lossless quantum coding scheme, analog to the classical Huffman scheme but different from the Braunstein scheme, is implemented, which provides optimal compression. Motivated by the concept of lossless quantum compression, an observable is defined that measures the core quantum information content of a particular message with respect to a given a priori message ensemble. The average of this observable yields the von Neumann entropy.

abstract: Each Bell state has the property that by performing just local operations on one qubit, the complete Bell basis can be generated. That is, states generated by local operations are totally distinguishable. This remarkable property is due to maximal quantum entanglement between the two particles. We present a set of local unitary transformations that generate out of partially entangled two-qubit state a set of four maximally distinguishable states that are mutually equally distant. We discuss quantum dense coding based on these alphabet states.

abstract: We show that for any Hilbert-space dimension, the optimal universal quantum cloner can be constructed from essentially the same quantum circuit, i.e., we find a universal design for universal cloners. In the case of infinite dimensions (which includes continuous variable quantum systems) the universal cloner reduces to an essentially classical device. More generally, we construct a universal quantum circuit for distributing qudits in any dimension which acts covariantly under generalized displacements and momentum kicks. The behavior of this covariant distributor is controlled by its initial state. We show that suitable choices for this initial state yield both universal cloners and optimized cloners for limited alphabets of states whose states are related by generalized phase-space displacements.

abstract: Spin is commonly thought to reflect the true quantum nature of microphysics. We show that spin is related to intrinsic and field-like properties of single particles. These properties change continuously in external magnetic fields. Interactions of massive particles with homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields result in two discrete particle states, symmetric to the original one. We analyze the difficulties in quantum mechanics to give a precise spacetime account of the experiments and find that they arise from unsuitable analogies for spin. In particular from the analogy of an angular momentum. Several experiments are suggested to check the model against the standard model in quantum mechanics.

abstract: We model an isolated quantum computer as a two-dimensional lattice of qubits (spin halves) with fluctuations in individual qubit energies and residual short-range inter-qubit couplings. In the limit when fluctuations and couplings are small compared to the one-qubit energy spacing, the spectrum has a band structure and we study the quantum computer core (central band) with the highest density of states. Above a critical inter-qubit coupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of eigenstates in an isolated quantum computer. The onset of chaos results in the interaction induced dynamical thermalization and the occupation numbers well described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This thermalization destroys the noninteracting qubit structure and sets serious requirements for the quantum computer operability.

abstract: One-particle properties of non-interacting Fermions in a one-dimensional harmonic trap and at zero temperature are studied. Exact expressions and asymptotic results for large Fermion number N are given for the particle density distribution n_0(z,N). For large N and near the classical boundary at the Fermi energy the density displays increasing fluctuations. A simple scaling of these tails of the density distribution with respect to N is established. The Fourier transform of the density distribution is calculated exactly. It displays a small but characteristic hump near 2 k_F with k_F being a properly defined Fermi wave number. This is due to Friedel oscillations which are identified and discussed. These quantum effects are missing in the semi-classical approximation. Momentum distributions are also evaluated and discussed. As an example of a time-dependent one-particle problem we calculate exactly the evolution of the particle density when the trap is suddenly switched off and find a simple scaling behaviour in agreement with recent general results.

abstract: We introduce the concepts of Grover operators and Grover kernels to systematically analyse Grover's searching algorithms. Then, we investigate a one-parameter family of quantum searching algorithms of Grover's type and we show that the standard Grover's algorithm is a distinguished member of this family. We show that all the algorithms of this class solve the searching problem with an efficiency of order $O(\sqrt{N})$, with a coefficient which is class-dependent. The analysis of this dependence is a test of the stability and robustness of the algorithms. We show the stability of this constructions under perturbations of the initial conditions and extend them upon a very general class of Grover operators.

abstract: The derivation of Bell inequalities for beables is well-known to require a "no-conspiracy" assumption. This assumption is widely accepted, the alternative being correlations between instrument settings and hidden beables. Two further assumptions are identified here: (1) a "no-contextuality" assumption, similar to the prohibition of contextuality that is required to derive the Kochen-Specker theorem, which is closely related to the "no-conspiracy" assumption; (2) a "no-correlation" assumption, which prohibits correlations between hidden beables. The three assumptions together are less acceptable than the "no-conspiracy" assumption alone.

abstract: Recent work has extended Bell's theorem by quantifying the amount of communication required to simulate entangled quantum systems with classical information. The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from a set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that reproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is measured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a finite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell state. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the communication is merely required to be finite {\em on average}, Bell states can be simulated {\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show that arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell states can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average (again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the communication is required to be {\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite number of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell state. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic communication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the quantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.

abstract: A model is presented for dissipationless energy transfer in cell microtubules due to quantum coherent states. The model is based on conjectured (hydrated) ferroelectric properties of microtubular arrangements. Ferroelectricity is essential in providing the necessary isolation against thermal losses in thin interior regions, full of ordered water, near the tubulin dimer walls of the microtubule. These play the role of cavity regions, which are similar to electromagnetic cavities of quantum optics. As a result, the formation of (macroscopic) quantum coherent states of electric dipoles on the tubulin dimers may occur. Some experiments, inspired by quantum optics, are suggested for the falsification of this scenario.

abstract: Every entangled state can be perturbed, for instance by decoherence, and stay entangled. For a large class of pure entangled states, we show how large the perturbation can be. Our class includes all pure bipartite and all maximally entangled states. For an entangled state, E, the constucted neighborhood of entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check if the trace of EQ is greater than a constant which depends upon E and which we determine.

Furthermore we prove a lower bound on the growth of large-scale entanglement depending on the chromatic index.

This is different from recently presented strategies,where the cavity is supposed to be initially empty and the field is built up photon by photon through resonant atom-field interactions. Here, a coherent state is previously injected into the cavity. So, the Wigner distribution function of the desired state is constructed from that of the initially coherent state. Such an engineering process is achieved through an adaptation of the recently proposed technique of projection synthesis to cavity QED phenomena.

abstract: In an interferometer, path information and interference visibility are incompatible quantities. Complete determination of the path will exclude any possibility of interference, rendering the visibility zero. However, if the composite object and probe state is pure, it is, under certain conditions, possible to trade the path information for improved (conditioned) visibility. Such a procedure is called quantum erasure. We have performed such experiments with polarization entangled photon pairs. Using a partial polarizer we could vary the degree of entanglement between object and probe. We could also vary the interferometer splitting ratio and thereby vary the a priori path predictability. We have tested quantum erasure under a number of different experimental conditions and found good agreement between experiments and theory.

abstract: Single-site measurement in a distributed macroscopic antiferromagnet is considered; we show that it can create antiferromagnetic sublattices at macroscopic scale. We demonstrate that the result of measurement depends on the symmetry of the ground state: for the easy-axis case the Neel state is formed, while for the easy-plane case unusual ``fan'' sublattices appear with unbroken rotational symmetry, and a decoherence wave is generated. For the latter case, a macroscopically large number of measurements is needed to pin down the orientation of the sublattices, in spite of the high degeneracy of the ground state. We note that the type of the final state and the appearance of the decoherence wave are governed by the degree of entanglement of spins in the system.

abstract: A general principle of `causal duality' for physical systems, lying at the base of representation theorems for both compound and evolving systems, is proved; formally it is encoded in a quantaloidal setting. Other particular examples of quantaloids and quantaloidal morphisms appear naturally within this setting; as in the case of causal duality, they originate from primitive physical reasonings on the lattices of properties of physical systems. Furthermore, an essentially dynamical operational foundation for studying physical systems is outlined; complementary as it is to the existing static operational foundation, it leads to the natural axiomatization of `causal duality' in operational quantum logic.

abstract: In this paper we give a new way to quantify the folklore notion that quantum measurements bring a disturbance to the system being measured. We consider two observers who initially assign identical mixed-state density operators to a two-state quantum system. The question we address is to what extent one observer can, by measurement, increase the purity of his density operator without affecting the purity of the other observer's. If there were no restrictions on the first observer's measurements, then he could carry this out trivially by measuring the initial density operator's eigenbasis. If, however, the allowed measurements are those of finite strength---i.e., those measurements strictly within the interior of the convex set of all measurements---then the issue becomes significantly more complex. We find that for a large class of such measurements the first observer's purity increases the most precisely when there is some loss of purity for the second observer. More generally the tradeoff between the two purities, when it exists, forms a monotonic relation. This tradeoff has potential application to quantum state control and feedback.

abstract: A great number of problems of relativistic position in quantum mechanics are due to the use of coordinates which are not inherent objects of spacetime, cause unnecessary complications and can lead to misconceptions. We apply a coordinate-free approach to rule out such problems. Thus it will be clear, for example, that the Lorentz covariance of position, required usually on the analogy of Lorentz covariance of spacetime coordinates, is not well posed and we show that in a right setting the Newton--Wigner position is Poincar\'e covariant, in contradiction with the usual assertions.

abstract: We present a method for the determination of the completely positive (CP) map describing a physical device based on random preparation of the input states, random measurements at the output, and maximum-likelihood principle. In the numerical implementation the constraint of completely positivity can be imposed by exploiting the isomorphism between linear transformations from Hilbert spaces $\cal H$ to $\cal K$ and linear operators in ${\cal K}\otimes {\cal H}$. The effectiveness of the method is shown on the basis of some examples of reconstruction of CP maps related to quantum communication channels for qubits.

abstract: Ground state cooling and coherent manipulation of ions in an rf-(Paul) trap is the prerequisite for quantum information experiments with trapped ions. With resolved sideband cooling on the optical S1/2 - D5/2 quadrupole transition we have cooled one and two 40Ca+ ions to the ground state of vibration with up to 99.9% probability. With a novel cooling scheme utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency on the S1/2 - P1/2 manifold we have achieved simultaneous ground state cooling of two motional sidebands 1.7 MHz apart. Starting from the motional ground state we have demonstrated coherent quantum state manipulation on the S1/2 - D5/2 quadrupole transition at 729 nm. Up to 30 Rabi oscillations within 1.4 ms have been observed in the motional ground state and in the n=1 Fock state. In the linear quadrupole rf-trap with 700 kHz trap frequency along the symmetry axis (2 MHz in radial direction) the minimum ion spacing is more than 5 micron for up to 4 ions. We are able to cool two ions to the ground state in the trap and individually address the ions with laser pulses through a special optical addressing channel.

abstract: We study the spontaneous emission, the absorption and dispersion properties of a ${\bf \Lambda}$-type atom where one transition interacts near resonantly with a double-band photonic crystal. Assuming an isotropic dispersion relation near the band edges, we show that two distinct coherent phenomena can occur. First, the spontaneous emission spectrum of the adjacent free space transition obtains `dark lines' (zeroes in the spectrum). Second, the atom can become transparent to a probe laser field coupling to the adjacent free space transition.

This classification is related to the values of the polynomial invariants under local unitary transformations by a one-to-one correspondence.

abstract: A method of fundamental solutions has been used to investigate transitions in two energy level systems with no level crossing in a real time. Compact formulas for transition probabilities have been found in their exact form as well as in their adiabatic limit. No interference effects resulting from many level complex crossings as announced by Joye, Mileti and Pfister (Phys. Rev. {\bf A44} 4280 (1991)) have been detected in either case. It is argued that these results of this work are incorrect. However, some effects of Berry's phases are confirmed.

We present a canonical form of such witnesses and provide constructive methods for their optimization. Finally, we present strong evidence that all bound entangled states with positive partial transpose in two qutrit systems have Schmidt number 2.

abstract: We show that the optical Kerr effect can be used to construct a quantum phase gate. It is well known from quantum nondemolition techniques that, as two photon field modes pass through a Kerr medium, the phase of each mode will be shifted, and the size of the phase shift will depend on the number of photons in both modes. We discuss the Hamiltonian responsible for this effect and show how this can produce an effective photon-photon interaction which corresponds to the quantum phase gate operating on two qubits each of which is represented by the elliptical polarization of one photon field. We discuss decoherence and losses and suggest some methods for dealing with them.

It is shown that it can take any value, depending on the control of the interferometer phase differences. It is possible to identify the interference of the single and two-photon wavepackets as particular cases of the most general interference process. The variable wavelength has no implication on the energy of the individual photons neither on the total energy of the biphoton.

The possibility is also indicated for obtaining unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment protocols with this technique.

abstract: A semiclassical formula for the coherent-state propagator requires the determination of specific classical paths inhabiting a complex phase-space through a Hamiltonian flux. Such trajectories are constrained to special boundary conditions which render their determination difficult by common methods. In this paper we present a new method based on Runge-Kutta integrator for a quick, easy and accurate determination of these trajectories. Using nonlinear one dimensional systems we show that the semiclassical formula is highly accurate as compared to its exact counterpart . Further we clarify how the phase of the semiclassical approximation is correctly retrieved under time evolution.

abstract: Two particles that are entangled with respect to continuous variables such as position and momentum exhibit a variety of nonclassical features. First, measurement of one particle projects the other particle into the state that is the complex conjugate of the state of the first particle, i.e., measurement of one particle projects the other particle into the time-reversed state. Second, continuous-variable entanglement can be used to implement a quantum "magic bullet": when one particle manages to pass through a scattering potential, then no matter how low the probability of this event, the second particle will also pass through a related scattering potential with probability one. This phenomenon is investigated in terms of the original EPR state, and experimental realizations are suggested in terms of entangled photon states.

abstract: We derive the optimal N-photon two-mode input state for obtaining an estimate \phi of the phase difference between two arms of an interferometer. For an optimal measurement [B. C. Sanders and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2944 (1995)], it yields a variance (\Delta \phi)^2 \simeq \pi^2/N^2, compared to O(N^{-1}) or O(N^{-1/2}) for states considered by previous authors. Such a measurement cannot be realized by counting photons in the interferometer outputs. However, we introduce an adaptive measurement scheme that can be thus realized, and show that it yields a variance in \phi very close to that from an optimal measurement.

However, this implications fails with two oscillators on each side, as we show by a five parameter family of explicit counterexamples.

An abstract representation on an L fold tensor product Hilbert space H^{arith} of number states and operators for the basic arithmetic operations is described. Unitary maps onto a physical parameter based tensor product space H^{phy} are defined and the relations between these two spaces and the dependence of algorithm dynamics on the unitary maps is discussed. The important condition of efficient implementation by physically realizable Hamiltonians of the basic arithmetic operations is also discussed.

abstract: Quantum gates that temporarily increase singlet-triplet splitting in order to swap electronic spins in coupled quantum dots, lead inevitably to a finite double-occupancy probability for both dots. By solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a coupled dot model, we demonstrate that this does not necessarily lead to quantum computation errors. Instead, the coupled dot ground state evolves quasi-adiabatically for typical system parameters so that the double-occupancy probability at the completion of swapping is negligibly small. We introduce a measure of entanglement which explicitly takes into account the possibilty of double occupancies and provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for entangled states.

abstract: We evaluate the detector nonideality (and energy sensitivity) of a normal-state single-electron transistor (SET) in the cotunneling regime in a two-charge-state approximation. For small conductances and at zero temperature, the SET's performance as a charge-qubit readout device is characterized by a universal one-parameter function. The result shows that near-ideal, quantum-limited measurement is possible for a wide range of small bias voltages. However, near the threshold voltage for crossover to sequential tunneling, the device becomes strongly nonideal. The (symmetrized) current-charge cross-correlation vanishes for low frequencies, causing two different definitions of detector nonideality to agree. Interpretations of these findings are discussed.

The separation of the entangled quasi-particles is achieved with a fork geometry and normal leads containing spin- or energy-selective filters. Measuring the current-current cross-correlator between the two normal leads allows to probe the efficiency of the entanglement.

abstract: A novel mechanism for sympatric speciation that takes into account complex bio-processes within each individual organism is proposed. According to dynamical systems theory, organisms with identical genotypes can possess differentiated physiological states and may coexist `symbiotically' through appropriate mutual interaction. With mutations, the phenotypically differentiated organisms gradually come to possess distinct genotypes, while maintaining their symbiotic relationship. This symbiotic speciation is robust against sexual recombination, because offspring of mixed parentage, with intermediate genotypes, are less fit than their parents. This leads to sterility of the hybrid. Accordingly, a basis for mating preference also arises.

abstract: We study spatial correlation functions of local operators of interacting many bosons confined in a box of a large, but volume V, for various `ground states' whose energy densities are almost degenerate. The ground states include the coherent state of interacting bosons (CSIB), the number state of interacting bosons (NSIB), and the number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons, which interpolates between the CSIB and NSIB. It was shown previously that only the CSIB is robust (i.e., does not decohere for a macroscopically long time) against the leakage of bosons into an environment. We show that for the CSIB the spatial correlation of any local operators A(r) and B(r') (which are localized around r and r', respectively) vanishes as |r - r' | \sim V^{1/3} \to \infty, i.e., the CSIB has the `cluster property.' In contrast, the other ground states do not possess the cluster property. Therefore, we have successfully shown that the robust state has the cluster property. This ensures the consistency of the field theory of bosons with macroscopic theories.

abstract: Can the quantum-mechanical sojourn time be clocked without the clock affecting the sojourn time? Here we re-examine the previously proposed non-unitary clock, involving absorption/amplification by an added infinitesimal imaginary potential($iV_{i}$), and find it {\it not} to preserve, in general, the positivity of the sojourn time, conditional on eventual reflection or transmission. The sojourn time is found to be affected by the scattering concomitant with the mismatch, however small, due to the very clock potential($iV_{i}$) introduced for the purpose, as also by any prompt scattering involving partial waves that have not traversed the region of interest. We propose a formal procedure whereby the sojourn time so clocked can be corrected for these spurious scattering effects. The resulting conditional sojourn times are then positive definite for an arbitrary potential, and have the proper high- and low-energy limits.

The derivation involves mapping to an equivalent physical problem concerning the quantum entropy and energy currents of particles flowing in a one-dimensional channel connecting thermal reservoirs, and which obey Gentile's intermediate statistics with statistical parameter 'a'. The method is also applied to partitions associated with Haldane's fractional exclusion statistics.

abstract: We propose two potential realisations for quantum bits based on nanometre scale magnetic particles of large spin S and high anisotropy molecular clusters. In case (1) the bit-value basis states |0> and |1> are the ground and first excited spin states Sz = S and S-1, separated by an energy gap given by the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency. In case (2), when there is significant tunnelling through the anisotropy barrier, the qubit states correspond to the symmetric, |0>, and antisymmetric, |1>, combinations of the two-fold degenerate ground state Sz = +- S. In each case the temperature of operation must be low compared to the energy gap, \Delta, between the states |0> and |1>. The gap \Delta in case (2) can be controlled with an external magnetic field perpendicular to the easy axis of the molecular cluster. The states of different molecular clusters and magnetic particles may be entangled by connecting them by superconducting lines with Josephson switches, leading to the potential for quantum computing hardware.

abstract: In this paper we consider a quantum computational variant of nondeterminism based on the notion of a quantum proof, which is a quantum state that plays a role similar to a certificate in an NP-type proof. Specifically, we consider quantum proofs for properties of black-box groups, which are finite groups whose elements are encoded as strings of a given length and whose group operations are performed by a group oracle. We prove that for an arbitrary group oracle there exist succinct (polynomial-length) quantum proofs for the Group Non-Membership problem that can be checked with small error in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Classically this is impossible--it is proved that there exists a group oracle relative to which this problem does not have succinct proofs that can be checked classically with bounded error in polynomial time (i.e., the problem is not in MA relative to the group oracle constructed). By considering a certain subproblem of the Group Non-Membership problem we obtain a simple proof that there exists an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in MA. Finally, we show that quantum proofs for non-membership and classical proofs for various other group properties can be combined to yield succinct quantum proofs for other group properties not having succinct proofs in the classical setting, such as verifying that a number divides the order of a group and verifying that a group is not a simple group.

abstract: The transverse group associated to some continuous quantum measuring processes is analyzed in the presence of nonvanishing gravitational fields. This is done considering, as an exmaple, the case of a particle whose coordinates are being monitored. Employing the so called restricted path integral formalism, it will be shown that the measuring process could always contain information concerning the gravitational field. In other words, it seems that with the presence of a measuring process the equivalence principle may, in some cases, break down. The relation between the breakdown of the equivalence principle, at quantum level, and the fact that the gravitational field could act always as a decoherence environment, is also considered. The phenomena of quantum beats of quantum optics will allow us to consider the possibility that the experimental corroboration of the equivalence principle at quantum level could be taken as an indirect evidence in favor of the quantization of the gravitational field, i.e., the quantum properties of this field avoid the violation of the equivalence principle.

abstract: We consider quantum geometrodynamics and parametrized quantum field theories in the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation. In the first case, and following the lines of our previous work [1], where a hamiltonian formalism for the bohmian trajectories was constructed, we show the consistency of the theory for any quantum potential, completing the scenarios for canonical quantum cosmology presented there. In the latter case, we prove the consistency of scalar field theory in Minkowski spacetime for any quantum potential, and we show, using this alternative hamiltonian method, a concrete example where Lorentz invariance of individual events is broken.

abstract: We consider the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory, in particular information erasure and Landauer's principle (namely, that erasure of information produces at least the equivalent amount of entropy). A small quantum system outside a black hole in the Hartle-Hawking state is studied, and the quantum system comes into thermal equilibrium with the radiation surrounding the black hole. For this scenario, we present a simple proof of the generalized second law based on quantum relative entropy. We then analyze the corresponding information erasure process, and confirm our proof of the generalized second law by applying Landauer's principle.

abstract: The displacement fluctuations of mirrors in optomechanical devices, induced via thermal expansion by temperature fluctuations due either to thermodynamic fluctuations or to fluctuations in the photon absorption, can be made smaller than quantum fluctuations, at the low temperatures, high reflectivities and high light powers needed to readout displacements at the standard quantum limit. The result is relevant for the design of quantum limited gravitational-wave detectors, both "interferometers" and "bars", and for experiments to study directly mechanical motion in the quantum regime.

abstract: In these lectures we provide a short introduction to the Monte Carlo integration method and its applications. We show how the origin of ultraviolet divergences if Field Theories is in the undefined formal product of distributions and how one can define the Path Integral in terms of regularized distributions in order to cancel these divergences. This technique provides the only non perturbative regularization procedure of continuum Field Theories and, at the same time, provides a practical method to compute correlation (Green) functions (using Monte Carlo integration for the regularized path integrals). We then apply these tools to formulate QCD on a lattice. Some of the examples are accompanied by complete computer programs.

abstract: We present the status of an experimental test for gravitational strength forces below 1 mm. Our experiment uses small 1 kilohertz oscillators as test masses, with a stiff counducting shield between them to suppress backgrounds. At the present sensitivity of approximately 1000 times gravitational strength, we see no evidence for new forces with interaction ranges between 75 microns and 1 mm. While the Casimir background is not expected to be significant at this range, an extension of the shielding technique we employ may be useful for reducing this background in experiments below a few microns. We describe a possible implementation.

abstract: Recent papers by Busza et al. (BJSW) and Dar et al. (DDH) argue that astrophysical data can be used to establish small bounds on the risk of a ``killer strangelet'' catastrophe scenario in the RHIC and ALICE collider experiments. DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested that these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems unsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good measure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main bound, $p_{\rm catastrophe} < 2 \times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the expectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper reappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other areas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions are made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a catastrophe risk no higher than $\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required for consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization. It is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been significantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other commentators. Lessons for future policy are proposed.

abstract: A critical look is taken at the calculation of the Casimir effect. The boundary conditions play an important role and should be imposed in a physical way. An acceptable result for the vacuum energy is only obtained when different regularization schemes yield the same result. Radiative corrections to the Casimir force between two parallel plates due to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations have been obtained both in full QED and in a low-energy, effective field theory with conflicting results. Including surface terms in the effective Lagrangian, the QED result can be understood. Finally, a problem with the electromagnetic vacuum energy on $S^3$ is pointed out and a solution suggested. The structure of higher order corrections to this result is discussed.

abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, the propagation of polarized photons can be effectively described using quantum dynamical semigroups. These extended time-evolutions induce irreversibility and dissipation. Planned, high sensitive experiments, both in the laboratory and in space, will be able to put stringent bounds on these non-standard effects.

abstract: Generalized quantum statistics will be presented in the context of representation theory of Lie (super)algebras. This approach provides a natural mathematical framework, as is illustrated by the relation between para-Bose and para-Fermi operators and Lie (super)algebras of type B. Inspired by this relation, A-statistics is introduced, arising from representation theory of the Lie algebra A_n. The Fock representations for A_n=sl(n+1) provide microscopic descriptions of particular kinds of exclusion statistics, which may be called quasi-Bose statistics. It is indicated that A-statistics appears to be the natural statistics for certain lattice models in condensed matter physics.

abstract: Clifford number formalism for Maxwell equations is considered. The Clifford imaginary unit for space-time is introduced as coordinate independent form of fully antisymmetric fourth-rank tensor. The representation of Maxwell equations in massless Dirac equation form is considered; we also consider two approaches to the invariance of Dirac equation in respect of the Lorentz transformations. According to the first approach, the unknown column is invariant and according to the second approach it has the transformation properties known as spinorial ones. Clifford number representation for nonlinear electrodynamics equations is obtained. From this representation, we obtain the nonlinear like Dirac equation which is the form of nonlinear electrodynamics equations. As a special case we have the appropriate representations for Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics.

abstract: We study the stationary problem of a charged Dirac particle in (2+1) dimensions in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B and a singular magnetic tube of flux Phi = 2 pi kappa/e. The rotational invariance of this configuration implies that the subspaces of definite angular momentum l+1/2 are invariant under the action of the Hamiltonian H. We show that, for l different from the integer part of kappa, the restriction of H to these subspaces, H_l is essentially self-adjoint, while for l equal to the integer part of kappa, H_l admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions (SAE). In the later case, the functions in the domain of H_l are singular (but square-integrable) at the origin, their behavior being dictated by the value of the parameter gamma that identifies the SAE. We also determine the spectrum of the Hamiltonian as a function of kappa and gamma, as well as its closure.

abstract: In this lecture results on the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of arbitrary compact quantizable Kaehler manifolds are presented. These results are obtained in joint work with M. Bordemann and E. Meinrenken. The existence of the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization is also covered. Recent results obtained in joint work with A. Karabegov on the asymptotic expansion of the Berezin transform for arbitrary quantizable compact Kaehler manifolds are explained. As an application the asymptotic expansion of the Fubini-Study fundamental form under the coherent state embedding is considered. Some comments on the dynamics of the quantum operators are given. (This is an extended write-up of an invited lecture presented at the workshop ``Asymptotic properties of time evolutions in classical and quantum systems'', September 13-17, 1999, Bologna, Italy.)

abstract: We study the utility of a complex Langevin (CL) equation as an alternative for the Monte Carlo (MC) procedure in the evaluation of expectation values occurring in fermionic many-body problems. We find that a CL approach is natural in cases where non-positive definite probability measures occur, and remains accurate even when the corresponding MC calculation develops a severe ``sign problem''. While the convergence of CL averages cannot be guaranteed in principle, we show how convergent results can be obtained in three examples ranging from simple one-dimensional integrals over quantum mechanical models to a schematic shell model path integral.

abstract: We have demonstrated a 165 micron oblate spheroidal microcavity with free spectral range 383.7 GHz (3.06nm), resonance bandwidth 25 MHz (Q ~ 10^7) at 1550nm, and finesse F > 10^4. The highly oblate spheroidal dielectric microcavity combines very high Q-factor, typical of microspheres, with vastly reduced number of excited whispering-gallery (WG) modes (by two orders of magnitude). The very large free spectral range in the novel microcavity - few hundred instead of few GigaHertz in typical microspheres - is desirable for applications in spectral analysis, narrow-linewidth optical and RF oscillators, and cavity QED.
