**1.    Scattering model for quantum random walk on the hypercube**  
Jozef Ko?��k, Vladim��r Bu?ek

<blockquote>
<p>
We elaborate on a model of quantum random walk proposed by Hillery et. al., and Jeong et. al., which uses the multiports for quantum "coin tossing". The dynamics of this model is analyzed for the case when the multiports are arranged on the hypercube. If the hypercube is attached to semi-infinite lines, then it can act as a scattering potential, which can be reduced to a quantum walk on the line with non-unitary evolution. We also show how this model can be implemented using simple quantum gates.

**2.    Slow transport by continuous time quantum walks**  
Oliver Muelken, Alexander Blumen  
Phys. Rev. E 71, 016101 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410243  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) do not necessarily perform better than their classical counterparts, the continuous time random walks (CTRW). For one special graph, where a recent analysis showed that in a particular direction of propagation the penetration of the graph is faster by CTQWs than by CTRWs, we demonstrate that in another direction of propagation the opposite is true; In this case a CTQW initially localized at one site displays a slow transport. We furthermore show that when the CTQW's initial condition is a totally symmetric superposition of states of equivalent sites, the transport gets to be much more rapid.
