abstract: A property of a system is called actual, if the observation of the test that pertains to that property, yields an affirmation with certainty. We formalize the act of observation by assuming that the outcome correlates with the state of the observed system and is codified as an actual property of the state of the observer at the end of the measurement interaction. For an actual property, the observed outcome has to affirm that property with certainty, hence in this case the correlation needs to be perfect. A property is called classical if either the property or its negation is actual. It is shown by a diagonal argument that there exist classical properties of an observer that he cannot observe perfectly. Because states are identified with the collection of properties that are actual for that state, it follows that no observer can perfectly observe his own state. Implications for the quantum measurement problem are briefly discussed.

abstract: The stochastic-gauge representation is a method of mapping the equation of motion for the quantum mechanical density operator onto a set of equivalent stochastic differential equations. One of the stochastic variables is termed the "weight", and its magnitude is related to the importance of the stochastic trajectory. We investigate the use of Monte Carlo algorithms to improve the sampling of the weighted trajectories and thus reduce sampling error in a simulation of quantum dynamics. The method can be applied to calculations in real time, as well as imaginary time for which Monte Carlo algorithms are more-commonly used. The method is applicable when the weight is guaranteed to be real, and we demonstrate how to ensure this is the case. Examples are given for the anharmonic oscillator, where large improvements over stochastic sampling are observed.

abstract: We introduce a novel semiclassical approach to the Lipkin model. In this way the well-known phase transition arising at the critical value of the coupling is intuitively understood. New results -- showing for strong couplings the existence of a threshold energy which separates deformed from undeformed states as well as the divergence of the density of states at the threshold energy -- are explained straightforwardly and in quantitative terms by the appearance of a double well structure in a classical system corresponding to the Lipkin model. Previously unnoticed features of the eigenstates near the threshold energy are also predicted and found to hold.

abstract: We show the influence of surface plasmons on the Casimir effect between two plane parallel metallic mirrors at arbitrary distances. Using the plasma model to describe the optical response of the metal, we express the Casimir energy as a sum of contributions associated with evanescent surface plasmon modes and propagative cavity modes. In contrast to naive expectations, the plasmonic modes contribution is essential at all distances in order to ensure the correct result for the Casimir energy. One of the two plasmonic modes gives rise to a repulsive contribution, balancing out the attractive contributions from propagating cavity modes, while both contributions taken separately are much larger than the actual value of the Casimir energy. This also suggests possibilities to tailor the sign of the Casimir force via surface plasmons.

abstract: The Fermion Spherical harmonics [$Y_\ell^{m}(\theta,\phi)$ for half-odd-integer $\ell$ and $m$ - presented in a previous paper] are shown to have the same eigenfunction properties as the well-known Boson Spherical Harmonics [$Y_\ell^{m}(\theta,\phi)$ for integer $\ell$ and $m$]. The Fermion functions are shown to differ from the Boson functions in so far as the ladder operators $M_+$ ($M_-$) that ascend (descend) the sequence of harmonics over the values of $m$ for a given value of $\ell$, do not produce the expected result {\em in just one case}: when the value of $m$ changes from $\pm{1/2}$ to $\mp{1/2}$; i.e. when $m$ changes sign; in all other cases the ladder operators produce the usually expected result including anihilation when a ladder operator attempts to take $m$ outside the range: $-\ell\le m\le +\ell$. The unexpected result in the one case does not invalidate this scalar coordinate representation of spin angular momentum, because the eigenfunction property is essential for a valid quantum mechanical state, whereas ladder operators relating states with different eigenvalues are not essential, and are in fact known only for a few physical systems; that this coordinate representation of spin angular momentum differs from the abstract theory of angular momentum in this respect, is simply an interesting curiosity. This new representation of spin angular momentum is expected to find application in the theoretical description of physical systems and experiments in which the spin-angular momentum (and associated magnetic moment) of a particle is oriented in space, since the orientation is specifiable by the spherical polar angles, $\theta$ and $\phi$.

abstract: The maximum likelihood strategy to the estimation of group parameters allows to derive in a general fashion optimal measurements, optimal signal states, and their relations with other information theoretical quantities. These results provide a deep insight into the general structure underlying optimal quantum estimation strategies. The entanglement between representation spaces and multiplicity spaces of the group action appear to be the unique kind of entanglement which is really useful for the optimal estimation of group parameters.

comments: 7 Pages: submitted to the International Journal of Quantum Chemistry

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507008
abstract: The recently established existence of spherical harmonic functions, $Y_\ell^{m}(\theta,\phi)$ for half-odd-integer values of $\ell$ and $m$, allows for the introduction into quantum chemistry of explicit electron spin-coordinates; i.e. spherical polar angles $\theta_s, \phi_s$, that specify the orientation of the spin angular momentum vector in space. In this coordinate representation the spin angular momentum operators, $S^2, S_z$, are represented by the usual differential operators in spherical polar coordinates (commonly used for $L^2, L_z$), and their electron-spin eigenfunctions are $\sqrt{\sin\theta_s} \exp(\pm\phi_s/2)$. This eigenfunction representation has the pedagogical advantage over the abstract spin eigenfunctions, $\alpha, \beta,$ that ``integration over spin coordinates'' is a true integration (over the angles $\theta_s, \phi_s$). In addition they facilitate construction of many electron wavefunctions in which the electron spins are neither parallel nor antiparallel, but inclined at an intermediate angle. In particular this may have application to the description of EPR correlation experiments.

abstract: The realization of Karl Popper's experiment by Shih and Kim (published 1999) produced the result that Popper hoped for: no ``action at a distance'' on one photon of an entangled pair when a measurement is made on the other photon. This experimental result is interpretable in local realistic terms: each photon has a definite position and transverse momentum most of the time; the position measurement on one photon (localization in a slit) disturbs the transverse momentum of that photon in a non-predictable way in accordance with the uncertainty principle; however, there is no effect on the other photon (the photon that is not in a slit) no action at a distance. The position measurement (localization within a slit) of the one photon destroys the coherence (entanglement) between the photons; i.e. decoherence occurs. This can be understood physically as an electromagnetic interaction between the photon in the slit and the electrons of the atoms in the surface of the solid that forms the slit.

abstract: In Phys. Rev. A {\bf 71}, 060312(R) (2005) the robustness of the local adiabatic quantum search to decoherence in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the search Hamiltonian was examined. We expand this analysis to include the case of the global adiabatic quantum search. As in the case of the local search the asymptotic time complexity for the global search is the same as for the ideal closed case, as long as the Hamiltonian dynamics is present. In the case of pure decoherence, where the environment monitors the search Hamiltonian, we find that the time complexity of the global quantum adiabatic search scales like $N^{3/2}$, where $N$ is the list length. We moreover extend the analysis to include success probabilities $p<1$ and prove bounds on the run time with the same scaling as in the conditions for the $p\to 1$ limit. We supplement the analytical results by numerical simulations of the global and local search.

abstract: We introduce a self-consistent framework for the analysis of both Abelian and non-Abelian geometric phases associated with open quantum systems, undergoing cyclic adiabatic evolution. We derive a general expression for geometric phases, based on an adiabatic approximation developed within an inherently open-systems approach. This expression provides a natural generalization of the analogous one for closed quantum systems, and we prove that it satisfies all the properties one might expect of a good definition of a geometric phase, including gauge invariance. A striking consequence is the emergence of a finite time interval for the observation of geometric phases. The formalism is illustrated via the canonical example of a spin-1/2 particle in a time-dependent magnetic field. Remarkably, the geometric phase in this case is immune to dephasing and spontaneous emission in the renormalized Hamiltonian eigenstate basis. This result positively impacts holonomic quantum computing.

comments: 18 pages, 8 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507014
abstract: We find, in an analysis involving four prior probabilities (p's), that the information-theoretic-based comparative noninformativity test devised by Clarke, and applied by Slater in a quantum setting, yields a ranking (p_{F_{q=1}} > p_{B} > p_{B_{q=1}trunc} >p_{F}) fully consistent with Srednicki's recently-stated criterion for priors of ``biasedness to pure states''. Two of the priors are formed by extending certain metrics of quantum-theoretic interest from three- to four-dimensions -- by incorporating the q-parameter (nonextensivity/Tsallis index/escort parameter). The three-dimensional metrics are the Bures (minimal monotone) metric over the two-level quantum systems and the Fisher information metric over the corresponding family of Husimi distributions. The priors p_{B} and p_{F} are the (independent-of-q) normalized volume elements of these metrics, and p_{F_{q=1}} is the normalized volume element of the q-extended Fisher information metric, with q set to 1. While originally intended to similarly be the q-extension of the Bures metric, with q then set to 1, the prior p_{B_{q=1}trunc}, actually entails the truncation of the only off-diagonal entry of the extended Bures metric tensor. Without this truncation, the q-extended Bures volume element is null, as is also the case in two other quantum scenarios we examine.

abstract: Models of PT symmetric quantum mechanics provide examples of biorthogonal quantum systems. The latter incorporporate all the structure of PT symmetric models, and allow for generalizations, especially in situations where the PT construction of the dual space fails. The formalism is illustrated by a few exact results for models of the form H=(p+\nu)^2+\sum_{k>0}\mu_{k}exp(ikx). In some non-trivial cases, equivalent hermitian theories are obtained and shown to be very simple: They are just free (chiral) particles. Field theory extensions are briefly considered.

In the limit, it becomes a classical measurement apparatus obeying the stochastic axioms of quantum mechanics. Thus we derive the probabilities from a deterministic Schroedinger's equation by procedures analogous to those of classical statistical mechanics. This requires making precise the notion of `macroscopic.'

abstract: String theory, quantum geometry, loop quantum gravity and black hole physics all indicate the existence of a minimal observable length on the order of Planck length. This feature leads to a modification of Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Such a modified Heisenberg uncertainty principle is referred as gravitational uncertainty principle(GUP) in literatures. This proposal has some novel implications on various domains of theoretical physics. Here, we study some consequences of GUP in the spirit of Quantum mechanics. We consider two problem: a particle in an one-dimensional box and momentum space wave function for a "free particle". In each case we will solve corresponding perturbational equations and compare the results with ordinary solutions.

abstract: Wave packet broadening in usual quantum mechanics is a consequence of dispersion behavior of the medium which the wave propagates in it. In this paper, we consider the problem of wave packet broadening in the framework of Generalized Uncertainty Principle(GUP) of quantum gravity. New dispersion relations are derived in the context of GUP and it has been shown that there exists a gravitational induced dispersion which leads to more broadening of the wave packets. As a result of these dispersion relations, a generalized Klein-Gordon equation is obtained and its interpretation is given.

abstract: We propose a physically reversible quantum measurement of an arbitrary spin-s system using a spin-j probe via an Ising interaction. In the case of a spin-1/2 system (s=1/2), we explicitly construct a reversing measurement and evaluate the degree of reversibility in terms of fidelity. The recovery of the measured state is pronounced when the probe has a high spin (j>1/2), because the fidelity changes drastically during the reversible measurement and the reversing measurement. We also show that the reversing measurement scheme for a spin-1/2 system can serve as an experimentally feasible approximate reversing measurement for a high-spin system (s>1/2). If the interaction is sufficiently weak, the reversing measurement can recover a cat state almost deterministically in spite of there being a large fidelity change.

We find that for different decoherence models, there exist some special class of entangled states of which the pairwise entanglement is the most stable. The lifetime of the entanglement in these states is larger than other states with the same initial entanglement. In addition, we also investigate the dynamics of pairwise entanglement in the ground state of spin models such as Heisenberg and XXY models.

abstract: We describe a model for the interaction of the internal (spin) degree of freedom of a quantum lattice-gas particle with an environmental bath. We impose the constraints that the particle-bath interaction be fixed, while the state of the bath is random, and that the effect of the particle-bath interaction be parity invariant. The condition of parity invariance defines a subgroup of the unitary group of actions on the spin degree of freedom and the bath. We derive a general constraint on the Lie algebra of the unitary group which defines this subgroup, and hence guarantees parity invariance of the particle-bath interaction. We show that generalizing the quantum lattice gas in this way produces a model having both classical and quantum discrete random walks as different limits. We present preliminary simulation results illustrating the intermediate behavior in the presence of weak quantum noise.

abstract: We show how the execution time of algorithms on quantum computers depends on the architecture of the quantum computer, the choice of algorithms (including subroutines such as arithmetic), and the ``clock speed'' of the quantum computer. The primary architectural features of interest are the ability to execute multiple gates concurrently, the number of application-level qubits available, and the interconnection network of qubits. We analyze Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers in this context. Our results show that, if arbitrary interconnection of qubits is possible, a machine with an application-level clock speed of as low as one-third of a (possibly encoded) gate per second could factor a 576-bit number in under one month, potentially outperforming a large network of classical computers. For nearest-neighbor-only architectures, a clock speed of around twenty-seven gates per second is required.

The dynamics of this quasi-probability function on the Bloch sphere allows us to visualize the consequences of the entanglement process between the boson and the spin subsystems. Such investigation shows a distinct localization behavior of the spin state with respect to the polar and azimuthal Bloch sphere angles. A complete {\em breakdown of reflection symmetry} in the azimuthal angle is shown in the non-integrable case, even at short evolution times. Also, in the classically chaotic situation, the appearance of {\em sub-planck structures} in the Wigner function is shown, and its evolution analyzed.

abstract: A discussion of the quantum mechanical use of superposition or entangled states shows that descriptions containing only statements about state vectors and experiments outputs are the most suitable for Quantum Mechanics. In particular, it is shown that statements about the undefined values of physical quantities before measurement can be dropped without changing the predictions of the theory. If we apply these ideas to EPR issues, we find that the concept of non-locality with its 'instantaneous action at a distance' evaporates. Finally, it is argued that usual treatments of philosophical realist positions end up in the construction of theories whose major role is that of being disproved by experiment. This confutation proves simply that the theories are wrong; no conclusion about realism (or any other philosophical position) can be drawn, since experiments deal always with theories and these are never logical consequences of philosophical positions.

We provide here a systematic study of this effect for pure states of bipartite systems of low dimensionality, considering both distinguishable (two-qubits) subsystems, and systems constituted of two indistinguishable particles.

We demonstrate that dynamic properties of entangled states in an atom-photon system with spontaneous radiation are defined by a parameter equal to the product of the fine structure constant and the atom-electron mass ratio. We then consider the evolution of the system during radiation and show that the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom are entangling for the times of the same order of magnitude as the excited state life-time. Then the degrees of freedom are de-entangling and asymptotically approach to the level of small residual entanglement that is caused by momentum dispersion of the initial atomic packet.Finally, we investigate the process of coherence loss between modes in type-II parametric down conversion that is caused by non-linear crystal properties.

abstract: A local hidden-variable model based on `isolato' hypothesis of the EPR--Bohm Gedanken experiment is presented. The `isolato' hypothesis states that one of a pair of spin-${1}/{2}$ particles can be in `isolato' mode in which the spin-${1}/{2}$ particle shuts itself from any external interactions, and hence it can never be detected. As a result of this, data rejection is made; Bell's inequality is violated, although the model is genuinely local. In this model, $2/\pi$ ($\simeq$ 63.6%) of the initially prepared ensemble of pairs of spin-${1}/{2}$ particles are detected as a pair of particles, and others are detected as a single particle. This does not disagree with the results of the experiments performed before, since these single spin-${1}/{2}$ particles were regarded as noise.

abstract: The quantum modes of a nonlinear Klein Gordon lattice have been computed numerically [L. Proville, Phys. Rev. B, vol. 71, 104306 (2005)]. The on-site nonlinearity has been found to lead to a phonon pairing and consequently some phonon bound states. In the present paper, the time dependent Wannier transform of these states is shown to exhibit a breather-like behavior, i.e., it is spatially localized and time-periodic. The typical time the lattice may sustain such breather states is studied as a function of the trapped energy and the intersite lattice coupling.

We show that any two orthogonal pure states are distinguishable by local operations and classical communications, even for infinite dimensional systems. An estimate of the local discrimination probability is also given for some family of more than two pure states.

abstract: It has been shown that finding generic Bell states diagonal entanglement witnesses (BDEW) for $d_{1}\otimes d_{2}\otimes ....\otimes d_{n}$ systems exactly reduces to a linear programming if the feasible region be a polygon by itself and approximately obtains via linear programming if the feasible region is not a polygon. Since solving linear programming for generic case is difficult, the multi-qubits, $2\otimes N$ and $3 \otimes 3$ systems for the special case of generic BDEW for some particular choice of their parameters have been considered. In the rest of this paper we obtain the optimal non decomposable entanglement witness for $3 \otimes 3$ system for some particular choice of its parameters. By proving the optimality of the well known reduction map and combining it with the optimal and non-decomposable 3 $\otimes$ 3 BDEW (named critical entanglement witnesses) the family of optimal and non-decomposable 3 $\otimes$ 3 BDEW have also been obtained. Using the approximately critical entanglement witnesses, some 3 $\otimes$ 3 bound entangled states are so detected. So the well known Choi map as a particular case of the positive map in connection with this witness via Jamiolkowski isomorphism has been considered which approximately is obtained via linear programming.

abstract: We introduce a scheme for fault tolerantly dealing with losses (or other "leakage" errors) in cluster state computation that can tolerate up to 50% qubit loss. This is achieved passively using an adaptive strategy of measurement - no coherent measurements or coherent correction is required. Since the scheme relies on inferring information about what would have been the outcome of a measurement had one been able to carry it out, we call this "counterfactual" error correction.

abstract: In this thesis, several new procedures for the generation and manipulation of entangled states in quantum optical systems are introduced. Each is evaluated in terms of realistic models of the imperfect apparatus of any real laboratory implementation. The first half of the thesis considers entanglement generation in Cavity QED, introducing several proposals for the creation of maximally entangled two-qubit states. The second half of the thesis focuses on the manipulation of entangled states of light pulses. In particular, an entanglement distillation procedure for Gaussian states is introduced. This combines a Procrustean protocol for the generation of highly entangled non-Gaussian states, with a "Gaussification" procedure, which allows more highly entangled approximately Gaussian states to be distilled from a non-Gaussian supply.

The motion of the non-relativistic particle along the plane curve and on a surface is considered. The results coincide with those of the "thin layer method". Influence of the non-physical variables on the physical sector is demonstrated.

abstract: Shannon information entropies in position and momentum spaces and their sum are calculated as functions of Z (Z=2-54) in atoms. Roothaan-Hartree-Fock electron wave functions are used. The universal property S=a+b lnZ is verified. In addition, we calculate the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, Onicescu's information energy and a complexity measure recently proposed. Shell effects at closed shells atoms are observed. The complexity measure shows local minima at the closed shells atoms indicating that for the above atoms complexity decreases with respect to neighboring atoms. It is seen that complexity fluctuates around an average value, indicating that the atom cannot grow in complexity as Z increases. Onicescu's information energy is correlated with the ionization potential. Kullback distance and Jensen-Shannon distance are employed to compare Roothaan-Hartree-Fock density distributions with other densities of previous works.

abstract: We present a method to find the decompositions of tripartite entangled pure states which are smaller than two successive Schmidt decompositions. The method becomes very simple when one of the subsystems is a qubit. In this particular case, we get a classification of states according to their decompositions. Furthermore, we also use this method to classify the entangled states that can be inter-converted through stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). More general tripartite systems are briefly discussed.

We work three examples in detail: parallel plates, the Casimir pendulum and a sphere opposite a plate. We also show how to calculate thermal corrections, proving that the high temperature `classical limit' is indeed valid for any smooth geometry.

The randomized stream cipher with randomization by quantum noise based on Y-00 is called quantum stream cipher in this paper, and it may have security against known plaintext attacks which has no analog with any conventional symmetric key ciphers. We present a simple cryptanalysis based on an attacker's heterodyne measurement and the quantum unambiguous measurement to make clear the strength of Y-00 in real communication. In addition, we give a design for the implementation of an intensity modulation scheme and report the experimental demonstration of 1 Gbps quantum stream cipher through 20 km long transmission line.

abstract: I comment on the interpretation of a recent experiment showing quantum interference in time. It is pointed out that the standard nonrelativistic quantum theory, used by the authors in their analysis, cannot account for the results found, and therefore that this experiment has fundamental importance beyond the technical advances it represents. Some theoretical structures which consider the time as an observable, and thus could, in principle, have the required coherence in time, are discussed briefly, and the application of Floquet theory and the manifestly covariant quantum theory of Stueckelberg are treated in some detail. In particular, the latter is shown to account for the results in a simple and consistent way.

authors: Andreas Winter
comments: 9 pages revtex4, 1 stolen figure (eps)
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507045
abstract: Following initial work by Gregoratti and Werner [J. Mod. Optics 50, 913-933, 2003 and quant-ph/0403092] and Hayden and King [quant-ph/0409026], we study the problem of the capacity of a quantum channel assisted by a "friendly (channel) environment" that can locally measure and communicate classical messages to the receiver. Previous work [quant-ph/0505038] has yielded a capacity formula for the quantum capacity under this kind of help from the environment. Here we study the problem of the environment-assisted classical capacity, which exhibits a somewhat richer structure (at least, it seems to be the harder problem). There are several, presumably inequivalent, models of the permitted local operations and classical communications between receiver and environment: one-way, arbitrary, separable and PPT POVMs. In all these models, the task of decoding a message amounts to discriminating a set of possibly entangled states between the two receivers, by a class of operations under some sort of locality constraint. After introducing the operational capacities outlined above, we show that a lower bound on the environment-assisted classical capacity is always half the logarithm of the input space dimension. Then we develop a few techniques to prove the existence of channels which meet this lower bound up to terms of much smaller order, even when PPT decoding measurements are allowed (assuming a certain superadditivity conjecture).

abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the emission characteristics and the flux of photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion in quasi-phase matched bulk crystals for the use in quantum communication sources. We show that, by careful design, one can attain well defined modes close to the fundamental mode of optical fibers and obtain high coupling efficiencies also for bulk crystals, these being more easily aligned than crystal waveguides. We distinguish between singles coupling, conditional coincidence, and pair coupling, and show how each of these parameters can be maximized by varying the focusing of the pump mode and the fiber-matched modes using standard optical elements. Specifically we analyze a periodically poled KTP-crystal pumped by a 532 nm laser creating photon pairs at 810 nm and 1550 nm. Numerical calculations lead to coupling efficiencies above 94% at optimal focusing, which is found by the geometrical relation L/z_R to be ~ 1 to 2 for the pump mode and ~ 2 to 3 for the fiber-modes, where L is the crystal length and z_R is the Rayleigh-range of the mode-profile. These results are independent on L. By showing that the single-mode bandwidth decreases as 1/L, we can therefore design the source to produce and couple narrow bandwidth photon pairs well into the fibers. Smaller bandwidth means both less chromatic dispersion for long propagation distances in fibers, and that telecom Bragg gratings can be utilized to compensate for broadened photon packets--a vital problem for time-multiplexed qubits. Longer crystals also yield an increase in fiber photon flux proportional to sqrt{L}, and so, assuming correct focusing, we can only see advantages using long crystals.

abstract: Matter-wave interference experiments enable us to study matter at its most basic, quantum level and form the basis of high-precision sensors for applications such as inertial and gravitational field sensing. Success in both of these pursuits requires the development of atom-optical elements that can manipulate matter waves at the same time as preserving their coherence and phase. Here, we present an integrated interferometer based on a simple, coherent matter-wave beam splitter constructed on an atom chip. Through the use of radio-frequency-induced adiabatic double-well potentials, we demonstrate the splitting of Bose-Einstein condensates into two clouds separated by distances ranging from 3 to 80 microns, enabling access to both tunnelling and isolated regimes. Moreover, by analysing the interference patterns formed by combining two clouds of ultracold atoms originating from a single condensate, we measure the deterministic phase evolution throughout the splitting process. We show that we can control the relative phase between the two fully separated samples and that our beam splitter is phase-preserving.

abstract: Fingerprinting enables two parties to infer whether the messages they hold are the same or different when the cost of communication is high: each message is associated with a smaller fingerprint and comparisons between messages are made in terms of their fingerprints alone. In the simultaneous message passing model, it is known that fingerprints composed of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than those composed of classical information. For small message lengths, we present constructions of optimal classical fingerprinting strategies with one-sided error, in both the one-way and simultaneous message passing models, and provide bounds on the worst-case error probability with the help of extremal set theory. The performance of these protocols is then compared to that for quantum fingerprinting strategies constructed from spherical codes, equiangular tight frames and mutually unbiased bases.

abstract: Given a bipartite quantum state (in arbitrary dimension) and a decomposition of it as a superposition of two others, we find bounds on the entanglement of the superposition state in terms of the entanglement of the states being superposed. In the case that the two states being superposed are bi-orthogonal, the answer is simple, and, for example, the entanglement of the superposition cannot be more than one e-bit more than the average of the entanglement of the two states being superposed. However for more general states, the situation is very different.

Later, we analyze numerically the dynamics of the whole system when interspecies collisions are inhibited. Variables such as fractional population, Mandel parameter and variances of annihilation and number operators are used to show that the evolved state is entangled and exhibits sub-Poisson statistics.

abstract: It is claimed in the above paper that, if time travel were possible, quantum propagation would prevent classic time travel paradoxes by establishing consistent loops; an example circuit is used to demonstrate such a loop. It is argued here that established loops are not the framework in which the classic paradoxes arise; rather they arise via the establishment of a concrete initial history in which no disturbing time travel is allowed and then disturbing that history via the launch of the time traveller. It is shown that, operated in this two-pass fashion, if the first forward evolution of their circuit produces a definite triggering of a backwards time travelling state, the re-evolution thereby engendered may be organised so as to prohibit the triggering of this state, thereby creating a classic time travel paradox.

abstract: A complete solution to the problem of setting up Wigner distribution for N-level quantum systems is presented. The scheme makes use of some of the ideas introduced by Dirac in the course of defining functions of noncommuting observables and works uniformly for all N. Further, the construction developed here has the virtue of being essentially input-free in that it merely requires finding a square root of a certain N^2 x N^2 complex symmetric matrix, a task which, as is shown, can always be accomplished analytically. As an illustration, the case of a single qubit is considered in some detail and it is shown that one recovers the result of Feynman and Wootters for this case without recourse to any auxiliary constructs.

abstract: In order to make a unified treatment for estimation problems of a very small noise or a very weak signal in a quantum process, we introduce the notion of a low-noise quantum channel with one noise parameter. It is known in several examples that prior entanglement together with nonlocal output measurement improves the performance of the channel estimation. In this paper, we study this ``ancilla-assisted enhancement'' for estimation of the noise parameter in a general low-noise channel. For channels on two level systems we prove that the enhancement factor, the ratio of the Fisher information of the ancilla-assisted estimation to that of the original one, is always upper bounded by 3/2. Some conditions for the attainability are also given with illustrative examples.

We also use our formalism to calculate the correlation function in the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen--Bohm type experiment with massive relativistic particles.

abstract: Nonlocality of two-mode states of light is addressed by means of CHSH inequality based on displaced on/off photodetection. Effects due to non-unit quantum efficiency and nonzero dark counts are taken into account. Nonlocality of both balanced and unbalanced superpositions of few photon-number states, as well as that of multiphoton twin beams, is investigated. We find that unbalanced superpositions show larger nonlocality than balanced one when noise affects the photodetection process. De-Gaussification by means of (inconclusive) photon subtraction is shown to enhance nonlocality of twin beams in the low energy regime. We also show that when the measurement is described by a POVM, rather than a set of projectors, the maximum achievable value of the Bell parameter in the CHSH inequality is decreased, and is no longer given by the Cirel'son bound.

An example is given by an atomic Sagnac interferometer, where for two ensembles propagating in opposite directions in the interferometer this phase difference encodes the angular velocity of the experimental setup. We discuss methods of squeezing separately or jointly observables of the two atomic ensembles, and compare in detail advantages and drawbacks of such schemes. In particular we show that the method of joint squeezing may improve the variance by up to a factor of 2. We take into account fluctuations of the number of atoms in both the preparation and the measurement stage, and obtain bounds on the difference of the numbers of atoms in the two ensembles, as well as on the detection efficiency, which have to be fulfilled in order to surpass the standard quantum limit. Under realistic conditions, the performance of both schemes can be improved significantly by reading out the phase difference via a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement. Finally, we discuss a scheme using macroscopically entangled ensembles.

abstract: Multiparticle entangled states generated via interaction between narrow-band light and an ensemble of identical two-level atoms are considered. Depending on the initial photon statistics, correlation between atoms and photons can give rise to entangled states of these systems. It is found that the state of any pair of atoms interacting with weak single-mode squeezed light is inseparable and robust against decay. Optical schemes for preparing entangled states of atomic ensembles by projective measurement are described.

abstract: General Trojan horse attacks on quantum key distribution systems are analyzed. We illustrate the power of such attacks with today's technology and conclude that all system must implement active counter-measures. In particular all systems must include an auxiliary detector that monitors any incoming light. We show that such counter-measures can be efficient, provided enough additional privacy amplification is applied to the data. We present a practical way to reduce the maximal information gain that an adversary can gain using Trojan horse attacks. This does reduce the security analysis of the 2-way {\it Plug-&-Play} system to those of the standard 1-way systems.

abstract: Recent realizations of single-atom trapping and tracking in cavity QED open the door for feedback schemes which actively stabilize the motion of a single atom in real time. We present feedback algorithms for cooling the radial component of motion for a single atom trapped by strong coupling to single-photon fields in an optical cavity. Performance of various algorithms is studied through simulations of single-atom trajectories, with full dynamical and measurement noise included. Closed loop feedback algorithms compare favorably to open-loop "switching" analogs, demonstrating the importance of applying actual position information in real time. The high optical information rate in current experiments enables real-time tracking that approaches the standard quantum limit for broadband position measurements, suggesting that realistic active feedback schemes may reach a regime where measurement backaction appreciably alters the motional dynamics.

In support of these measurements, here we provide an expanded discussion of the general phenomenology of photon blockade as well as of the theoretical model and results that were presented in Ref.

We explore the effect of different driving mechanisms on the photon statistics. We also present additional corrections to the model to describe cavity birefringence and ac-Stark shifts. [1] K. M.

We show that the receiver can successfully restore the original state of each qubit as long as all the agents cooperate. However, it is remarkable that for certain type of teleported states, the receiver can not gain any amplitude information even if one agent does not collaborate. In addition, our analysis shows that for general input states of each message qubit, the average fidelity for the output states, when even one agent does not take action, is the same as that for the previous proposals.

abstract: A family of N-qubit entanglement monotones invariant under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) is defined. This class of entanglement monotones includes the well-known examples of the concurrence, the three-tangle, and some of the four, five and N-qubit SLOCC invariants introduced recently. The construction of these invariants is based on bipartite partitions of the Hilbert space in the form ${\bf C}^{2^N}\simeq{\bf C}^L\otimes{\bf C}^l$ with $L=2^{N-n}\geq l=2^n$. Such partitions can be given a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of Grassmannians Gr(L,l) of l-planes in ${\bf C}^L$ that can be realized as the zero locus of quadratic polinomials in the complex projective space of suitable dimension via the Plucker embedding. The invariants are neatly expressed in terms of the Plucker coordinates of the Grassmannian.

abstract: We consider the problem of estimating an SU(d) quantum operation when n copies of it are available at the same time. It is well known that, if one uses a separable state as the input for the unitaries, the optimal mean square error will decrease as 1/n. However it is shown here that, if a proper entangled state is used, the optimal mean square error will decrease at a 1/n^2 rate. It is also shown that spherical 2-designs (e.g. complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures) can be used to design optimal input states. Although 2-designs are believed to exist for every dimension, this has not yet been proven. Therefore, we give an alternative input state based on approximate 2-designs which can be made arbitrarily close to optimal. It is shown that measurement strategies which are based on local operations and classical communication between the ancilla and the rest of the system can be optimal.

abstract: We demonstrate broadband laser cooling of atomic ions in an rf trap using ultrafast pulses from a modelocked laser. The temperature of a single ion is measured by observing the size of a time-averaged image of the ion in the known harmonic trap potential. While the lowest observed temperature was only about 1 K, this method efficiently cools very hot atoms and can sufficiently localize trapped atoms to produce near diffraction-limited atomic images.

abstract: Shannon in celebrated works had shown that n bits of shared key is necessary and sufficient to transmit n-bit classical information in an information-theoretically secure way. Ambainis, Mosca, Tapp and de Wolf in quant-ph/0003101 considered a more general setting, referred to as Private quantum channels, in which instead of classical information, quantum states are required to be transmitted and only one-way communication is allowed. They show that in this case 2n bits of shared key is necessary and sufficient to transmit an n-qubit state. We consider the most general setting in which we allow for all possible combinations i.e. we let the input to be transmitted, the message sent and the shared resources to be classical/quantum. We develop a general framework by which we are able to show tight bounds on communication/shared resources in all of these cases and this includes the results of Shannon and Ambainis et al. As a consequence of our arguments we also show that in a one-way oblivious Remote state preparation protocol for transferring an n-qubit pure state, the entropy of the communication must be 2n and the entanglement measure of the shared resource must be n. This generalizes on the result of Leung and Shor which shows same bound on the length of communication in the special case when the shared resource is maximally entangled e.g. EPR pairs and hence settles an open question asked in their paper regarding protocols without maximally entangled shared resource.

The scheme generalizes to measure both linear and non-linear functionals of an arbitrary oscillator state. This leads to many applications including purity tests, eigenvalue estimation, entropy and distance measures - all without the need for non-linear interactions or complete state reconstruction. Remarkably, experimental realization of the proposed scheme is already within the reach of current technology with linear optics.

abstract: Quantum tomography is a procedure to determine the quantum state of a physical system, or equivalently, to estimate the expectation value of any operator. It consists in appropriately averaging the outcomes of the measurement results of different observables, obtained on identical copies of the same system. Alternatively, it consists in maximizing an appropriate likelihood function defined on the same data. The procedure can be also used to completely characterize an unknown apparatus. Here we focus on the electromagnetic field, where the tomographic observables are obtained from homodyne detection.

We investigate the phase-space dynamics of the coherent state through the Wigner function approach and identify the interference phenomena behind the sub-Planck-scale structures. The optimal parameter ranges are specified for observing these features.

abstract: Quantum information processing (QIP) offers the promise of being able to do things that we cannot do with conventional technology. Here we present a new route for distributed optical QIP, based on generalized quantum non-demolition measurements, providing a unified approach for quantum communication and computing. Interactions between photons are generated using weak non-linearities and intense laser fields--the use of such fields provides for robust distribution of quantum information. Our approach requires only a practical set of resources, and it uses these very efficiently. Thus it promises to be extremely useful for the first quantum technologies, based on scarce resources. Furthermore, in the longer term this approach provides both options and scalability for efficient many-qubit QIP.

abstract: Simple examples of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with purely real spectra defined in $L^2(R^+)$ having spectral singularities inside the continuous spectrum are given. It is shown that such Hamiltonians may appear by shifting the ndependent variable of a real potential into the complex plane. Also they may be created as SUSY partners of Hermitian Hamiltonians. In the latter case spectral singularities of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are ordinary points of the continuous spectrum for its Hermitian SUSY partner. Conditions for transformation functions are formulated when a complex potential with complex eigenenergies and spectral singularities has a SUSY partner with a real spectrum without spectral singularities. Finally we shortly discuss why Hamiltonians with spectral singularities are `bad'.

abstract: Cluster states are a new type of multiqubit entangled states with entanglement properties exceptionally well suited for quantum computation. In the present work, we experimentally demonstrate that correlations in a four-qubit linear cluster state cannot be described by local realism. This exploration is based on a recently derived Bell-type inequality [V. Scarani et al., Phys. Rev A 71, 042325 (2005)] which is tailored, by using a combination of three- and four-particle correlations, to be maximally violated by cluster states but not violated at all by GHZ states. We observe a cluster state Bell parameter of $2.59\pm 0.08$, which is more than 7 standard deviations larger than the threshold of 2 imposed by local realism.

Experimental realization of the scheme is within reach of current technology. A variation of the technique allows for controlled generation of entangled subsequent pulses, with the atomic motion serving as intermediate memory of the quantum state.

abstract: Quantum state filtering is a variant of the unambiguous state discrimination problem: the states are grouped in sets and we want to determine to which particular set a given input state belongs.The simplest case, when the N given states are divided into two subsets and the first set consists of one state only while the second consists of all of the remaining states, is termed quantum state filtering. We derived previously the optimal strategy for the case of N non-orthogonal states, {|\psi_{1} >, ..., |\psi_{N} >}, for distinguishing |\psi_1 > from the set {|\psi_2 >, ..., |\psi_N >} and the corresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. In a previous paper [PRL 90, 257901 (2003)], we sketched an appplication of the results to probabilistic quantum algorithms. Here we fill in the gaps and give the complete derivation of the probabilstic quantum algorithm that can optimally distinguish between two classes of Boolean functions, that of the balanced functions and that of the biased functions. The algorithm is probabilistic, it fails sometimes but when it does it lets us know that it did. Our approach can be considered as a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that was developed for the discrimination of balanced and constant Boolean functions.

The first conclusion is that all the irreducible representations lead to equivalent physical predictions. However, the reducible representation recently introduced as a candidate for `QED without infinities' leads to new effects. We analyze from this perspective the experiments on Rabi oscillations performed by the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory group from Paris. Surprisingly, the results seem to support the reducible representation approach. We also discuss possibilities of more definitive tests of the new formalism.

abstract: We discuss questions pertaining to the definition of `momentum', `momentum space', `phase space', and `Wigner distributions'; for finite dimensional quantum systems. For such systems, where traditional concepts of `momenta' established for continuum situations offer little help, we propose a physically reasonable and mathematically tangible definition and use it for the purpose of setting up Wigner distributions in a purely algebraic manner. It is found that the point of view adopted here is limited to odd dimensional systems only. The mathematical reasons which force this situation are examined in detail.

abstract: Recently, there have been several suggestions that weak Kerr nonlinearity can be used for generation of macroscopic superpositions and entanglement and for linear optics quantum computation. However, it is not immediately clear that this approach can overcome decoherence effects. Our numerical study in this paper shows that nonlinearity of weak strength could be useful for macroscopic entanglement generation and quantum gate operations in the presence of decoherence. We suggest specific values for real experiments based on our analysis. Our discussion shows that the generation of macroscopic entanglement using this approach is within reach of current technology.

abstract: We provide explicit quantum circuits for the non-destructive deterministic discrimination of Bell states in the Hilbert space $C^{d^{n}}$, where $d$ is qudit dimension. We discuss a method for generalizing this to non-destructive measurements on any set of orthogonal states distributed among $n$ parties. From the practical viewpoint, we show that such non-destructive measurements can help lower quantum communication complexity under certain conditions.

abstract: In a previous paper we have presented a general scheme for the implementation of symmetric generalized measurements (POVMs) on a quantum computer. This scheme is based on representation theory of groups and methods to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations. We extend this scheme in such a way that the measurement is minimally disturbing, i.e., it changes the state vector \ket{\Psi} of the system to \sqrt{\Pi} \ket{\Psi} where \Pi is the positive operator corresponding to the measured result. Using this method, we construct quantum circuits for measurements with Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry. A continuous generalization leads to a scheme for optimal simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a Schr"odinger particle moving in one dimension such that the outcomes satisfy \Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar. The particle to be measured collides with two probe particles, one for the position and the other for the momentum measurement. The position and momentum resolution can be tuned by the entangled joint state of the probe particles which is also generated by a collision with hard-core potential. The parameters of the POVM can then be controlled by the initial widths of the wave functions of the probe particles. We point out some formal similarities and differences to simultaneous measurements of quadrature amplitudes in quantum optics.

abstract: We investigate multipartite entanglement dynamics in disordered spin-1/2 lattice models exhibiting a transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Borrowing from the recently introduced generalized entanglement framework, we construct measures for correlations relative to arbitrary local and bi-local spin observables, and show how they naturally signal the crossover between distinct dynamical regimes. In particular, we find that the generation of global entanglement is directly ruled by the local density of states in the short time limit, whereas the asymptotic amount of entanglement is proportional to the degree of delocalization of the chaotic many-body state. Our results are relevant to the stability of quantum information in disordered quantum computing hardware.

abstract: In a recent Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 (2005) 010503) Barrett, Hardy and Kent (BHK) considered a very interesting question which of the fundamental laws of physics ensure security of quantum cryptographic protocols. In particular, they presented quantum key distribution protocol and claimed its security in a very general framework, which allows - what they call - postquantum eavesdropping strategies i.e. which "allows for eavesdroppers who can break the laws of quantum mechanics, as long as nothing they can do implies the possibility of superluminal signaling". In this Comment, however, we show that it is still possible to construct a strategy, which although consistent with all asumptions explicitely stated in BHK paper, enables perfect eavesdropping in their protocol.

abstract: We propose a new way to generate an observable geometric phase by means of a completely incoherent phenomenon. We show how to imprint a geometric phase to a system by "adiabatically" manipulating the environment with which it interacts. As a specific scheme we analyse a multilevel atom interacting with a broad-band squeezed vacuum bosonic bath. As the squeezing parameters are smoothly changed in time along a closed loop, the ground state of the system acquires a geometric phase. We propose also a scheme to measure such geometric phase by means of a suitable polarization detection.

abstract: In contrast to the intuitively plausible assumption of local realism, entangled particles, even when isolated, are not allowed to possess definite properties in their own right, as quantitatively expressed by violations of Bell's inequalities [1]. Even as entanglement is now a key feature of quantum information and communication technology [2,3], it remains the most puzzling feature of quantum mechanics [4] and its conceptual foundation is still widely debated. Here we demonstrate that physical systems providing dicotomic outcomes are not able to guarantee both the rotation properties of physical quantities and local realism. This result opens the way to a new formulation of quantum mechanics based on only two elementary physical principles replacing the abstract mathematical axiomes of the present theory. According to this formulation, the coexistence of discrete outcomes with the classical continuous transformation properties of physical quantities under coordinate transformation inevitably implies quantum probabilities. These results, provide a simple physical explanation to the most debated quantum features and put into question the existence of physical quantities displaying continuous outcomes in agreement with approaches that attempt to integrate quantum theory with general relativity [5-8].

abstract: We explore connections between an operator's matrix element distribution and its entanglement generation. Operators with matrix element distributions similar to those of random matrices generate states of high multi-partite entanglement. This occurs even when other statistical properties of the operators do not conincide with random matrices. Similarly, operators with some statistical properties of random matrices may not exhibit random matrix element distributions and will not produce states with high levels of multi-partite entanglement. Finally, we show that operators with similar matrix element distributions generate similar amounts of entanglement.

abstract: Informationally complete measurements allow the estimation of expectation values of any operator on a quantum system, by changing only the data-processing of the measurement outcomes. In particular, an informationally complete measurement can be used to perform quantum tomography, namely to estimate the density matrix of the quantum state. The data-processing is generally nonunique, and can be optimized according to a given criterion. In this paper we provide the solution of the optimization problem which minimizes the variance in the estimation. We then consider informationally complete measurements performed over bipartite quantum systems focusing attention on universally covariant measurements, and compare their statistical efficiency when performed either locally or globally on the two systems. Among global measurements we consider the special case of Bell measurements, which allow to estimate the expectation of a restricted class of operators. We compare the variance in the three cases: local, Bell, and unrestricted global--and derive conditions for the operators to be estimated such that one type of measurement is more efficient than the other. In particular, we find that for factorized operators and Bell projectors the Bell measurement always performs better than the unrestricted global measurement, which in turn outperforms the local one. For estimation of the matrix elements of the density operator, the relative performances depend on the basis on which the state is represented, and on the matrix element being diagonal or off-diagonal, however, with the global unrestricted measurement generally performing better than the local one.

abstract: Niels Bohr introduced the concept of complementarity in order to give a general account of quantum mechanics, however he stressed that the idea of complementarity is related to the general difficulty in the formation of human ideas, inherent in the distinction between subject and object. The complementary descriptions approach is a framework for the interpretation of quantum mechanics, more specifically, it focuses in the development of the idea of complementarity and the concept of potentiality in the orthodox quantum formulation. In PART I of this article, we analyze the ideas of Bohr and present the principle of complementary description which takes into account Einstein's ontological position. We argue, in PART II, that this development allows a better understanding of some of the paradigmatic interpretational problems in quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem and the quantum to classical limit. We conclude that one should further develop complementarity in order to elaborate a consistent worldview.

abstract: The effect induced by an environment on a composite quantum system is studied. The model considers the composite system as comprised by a subsystem A coupled to a subsystem B which is also coupled to an external environment. We study all possible four combinations of subsystems A and B made up with a harmonic oscillator and an upside down oscillator. We analyzed the decoherence suffered by subsystem A due to an effective environment composed by subsystem B and the external reservoir. In all the cases we found that subsystem A decoheres even though it interacts with the environment only through its sole coupling to B. However, the effectiveness of the diffusion depends on the unstable nature of subsystem A and B. Therefore, the role of this degree of freedom in the effective environment is analyzed in detail

abstract: Let Alice and Bob be able to make local quantum measurements and communicate classically. The set of mathematically consistent joint probability assignments (``states'') for such measurements is properly larger than the set of quantum-mechanical mixed states for the Alice-Bob system. It is canonically isomorphic to the set of positive (not necessarily completely positive) linear maps Phi from the bounded linear operators on Alice's space to those on Bob's, for which Tr Phi(I)=1. We review the fact that allowing classical communication is equivalent to enforcing ``no-instantaneous-signalling'' (``no--influence'') in the direction opposite the communication. We establish that in the subclass of ``decomposable'' states, i.e. convex combinations of positive states with "PTP" ones whose partial transpose is positive, the extremal states are just the extremal positive and extremal PTP states. We show that two such states, shared by the same pair of parties, cannot necessarily be combined as independent states (their tensor product) if the full set of quantum operations is allowed locally to each party. We use a framework of ``test spaces'' and states on these, suited for exhibiting the analogies and deviations of empirical probabilistic theories from classical probability theory. This leads to a deeper understanding of analogies between quantum mechanics and Bayesian probability theory. The existence of a ``most Bayesian'' quantum rule for updating states after measurement, and its association with the situation when information on one system is gained by measuring another, is a case of a general proposition holding for test spaces combined subject to the no-signalling requirement.

abstract: Since several papers appeared in 2000, the quantum key distribution (QKD) community has been well aware that photon number splitting (PNS) attack by Eve severely limits the secure key distribution distance in BB84 QKD systems with Poissonian photon sources. In attempts to solve this problem, entanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement swapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many technological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can become practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which secure keys were generated over >100 km fibre for the first time. We used an alternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a Poissonian source. We analysed the security of the DPSK protocol and showed that it is robust even against hybrid attacks including collective PNS attack over consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting (BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a quantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector for the 1.5 um band based on frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD). The use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to > 1 Mbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the previous record.

abstract: Quantum field theory is the traditional solution to the problems inherent in melding quantum mechanics with special relativity. However, it has also long been known that an alternative first-quantized formulation can be given for relativistic quantum mechanics, based on the parametrized paths of particles in spacetime. Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates, rather than as an evolution parameter, such a spacetime approach has proved particularly useful in the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. This paper shows how a spacetime path formalism can be considered to arise naturally from the fundamental principles of the Born probability rule, superposition, and Poincar\'e invariance. The resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for a number of previous parametrized approaches in the literature, relating, in particular, "off-shell" theories to traditional on-shell quantum field theory. It reproduces the results of perturbative quantum field theory for free and interacting particles, but provides intriguing possibilities for a natural program for regularization and renormalization. Further, an important consequence of the formalism is that a clear probabilistic interpretation can be maintained throughout, with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

abstract: Consider a database most of whose entries are marked but the precise fraction of marked entries is not known. What is known is that the fraction of marked entries is 1-X, where X is a random variable that is uniformly distributed in the range (0,X_0) (X_0 is a small number). The problem is to try to select a marked item from the database in a single query. If the algorithm selects a marked item, it succeeds, else if it selects an unmarked item, it makes an error. How low can we make the probability of error? The best possible classical algorithm can lower the probability of error to O((X_0)^2). The best known quantum algorithms for this problem could also only lower the probability of error to O((X_0)^2). Using a recently invented quantum search technique, this paper gives an algorithm that reduces the probability of error to O((X_0)^3). The algorithm is asymptotically optimal.

abstract: It is known that quantum correlations exhibited by a maximally entangled qubit pair can be simulated with the help of shared randomness, supplemented with additional resources, such as communication, post-selection or non-local boxes. For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to solve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one use of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed sampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased distribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform distribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach allows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for projective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value measurements. Moreover, this approach naturally leads to a local hidden variable model for Werner states.

abstract: Scholars have wondered for a long time whether quantum mechanics (QM) subtends a quantum concept of truth which originates quantum logic (QL) and is radically different from the classical (Tarskian) concept of truth. We show in this paper that QL can be interpreted as a pragmatic language of pragmatically decidable assertive formulas, which formalize statements about physical systems that are empirically justified or unjustified in the framework of QM. According to this interpretation, QL formalizes properties of the metalinguistic concept of empirical justification within QM rather than properties of a quantum concept of truth. This conclusion agrees with a general integrationist perspective, according to which nonstandard logics can be interpreted as theories of metalinguistic concepts different from truth, avoiding competition with classical notions and preserving the globality of logic. By the way, some elucidations of the standard concept of quantum truth are also obtained.

We and that, with reasonably low levels of injected signal, the system allows for demonstrations of quantum entanglement and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. In contrast to the normal optical parametric oscillator operating below threshold, these features are demonstrated with relatively intense felds.

In this work several approximations to the coherent state propagator are derived that make use only of real trajectories, which are easier to handle and have a more direct physical interpretation. It is verified in a particular example that these real trajectories approximations may have excellent accuracy.

abstract: A useful kind of continuity of quantum states functions in asymptotic regime is so-called asymptotic continuity. In this paper we provide general tools for checking if a function possesses this property. First we prove equivalence of asymptotic continuity with so-called it robustness under admixture. This allows us to show that relative entropy distance from a convex set including maximally mixed state is asymptotically continuous. Subsequently, we consider it arrowing - a way of building a new function out of a given one. The procedure originates from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation. We show that arrowing preserves asymptotic continuity for a class of functions (so-called subextensive ones). The result is illustrated by means of several examples.

abstract: We report an investigation to establish the physical mechanisms responsible for decoherence in the generation of photon pairs from atomic ensembles, via the protocol of Duan et. al for long distance quantum communication [Nature (London) 414, 413 (2001)] and present the experimental techniques necessary to properly control the process. We develop a theory to model in detail the decoherence process in experiments with magneto-optical traps. The inhomogeneous broadening of the ground state by the trap magnetic field is identified as the principal mechanism for decoherence. In conjunction with our theoretical analysis, we report a series of measurements to characterize and control the coherence time in our experimental setup. We use copropagating stimulated Raman spectroscopy to access directly the ground state energy distribution of the ensemble. These spectroscopic measurements allow us to switch off the trap magnetic field in a controlled way, optimizing the repetition rate for single-photon measurements. With the magnetic field off, we then measure nonclassical correlations for pairs of photons generated by the ensemble as a function of the storage time of the single collective atomic excitation. We report coherence times longer than 10 microseconds, corresponding to an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to previous results in cold ensembles. The coherence time is now two orders of magnitude longer than the duration of the excitation pulses. The comparison between these experimental results and the theory shows good agreement. Finally, we employ our theory to devise ways to improve the experiment by optical pumping to specific initial states.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the first quantum system entangled in every degree of freedom (hyperentangled). Using pairs of photons produced in spontaneous parametric downconversion, we verify entanglement by observing a Bell-type inequality violation in each degree of freedom: polarization, spatial mode and time-energy. We also produce and characterize maximally hyperentangled states and novel states simultaneously exhibiting both quantum and classical correlations. Finally, we report the tomography of a 2x2x3x3 system (36-dimensional Hilbert space), which we believe is the first reported photonic entangled system of this size to be so characterized.

abstract: Following the proposal by F. Yamaguchi et al.[Phys. Rev. A 66, 010302 (R) (2002)], we present an alternative way to implement the two-qubit Grover search algorithm in cavity QED. Compared with F. Yamaguchi et al.'s proposal, with a strong resonant classical field added, our method is insensitive to both the cavity decay and thermal field, and doesn't require that the cavity remain in the vacuum state throughout the procedure. Moreover, the qubit definitions are the same for both atoms, which makes the experiment easier. The strictly numerical simulation shows that our proposal is good enough to demonstrate a two-qubit Grover's search with high fidelity.

abstract: We investigate the problem of cloning a set of states that is invariant under the action of an irreducible group representation. We then characterize the cloners that are "extremal" in the convex set of group covariant cloning machines, among which one can restrict the search for optimal cloners. For a set of states that is invariant under the discrete Weyl-Heisenberg group, we show that all extremal cloners can be unitarily realized using the so-called "double-Bell states", whence providing a general proof of the popular ansatz used in the literature for finding optimal cloners in a variety of settings. Our result can also be generalized to continuous-variable optimal cloning in infinite dimensions, where the covariance group is the customary Weyl-Heisenberg group of displacements.

abstract: We analyze the two-dimensional momentum distribution of electrons ionized by few-cycle laser pulses in the transition regime from multiphoton absorption to tunneling by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and by a classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulation with tunneling (CTMC-T). We find a complex two-dimensional interference pattern that resembles ATI rings at higher energies and displays Ramsauer-Townsend diffraction oscillations in the angular distribution near threshold. CTMC-T calculations provide a semiclassical explanation for the dominance of selected partial waves. While the present calculation pertains to hydrogen, we find surprising qualitative agreement with recent experimental data for rare gases [1].

We discuss in this paper two elementary models provided in the two approaches as intuitive supports to general reasonings and as a proof of consistency of general assumptions, and show that Aerts' quantum machine can be embodied into a macroscopic version of the microscopic SR model, overcoming the seeming incompatibility between the two models. This result provides some hints for the construction of a unified perspective in which the two approaches can be properly placed.

abstract: We consider noisy, non-local unitary operations or interactions, i.e. the corresponding evolutions are described by completely positive maps or master equations of Lindblad form. We show that by random local operations the completely positive maps can be depolarized to a standard form with a reduced number of parameters describing the noise process in such a way that the noiseless (unitary) part of the evolution is not altered. A further reduction of the parameters, in many cases even to a single one (i.e. global white noise), is possible by tailoring the decoherence process and increasing the amount of noise. We generalize these results to the dynamical case where the ideal unitary operation is given by some interaction Hamiltonian. The resulting standard forms may be used to compute lower bounds on channel capacities, to simplify quantum process tomography or to derive error thresholds for entanglement purification and quantum computation.

abstract: Inspired by an old idea of von Neumann, we seek a pair of commuting operators X,P which are, in a specific sense, "close" to the canonical non-commuting position and momentum operators, x,p. The construction of such operators is related to the problem of finding complete sets of orthonormal phase space localized states, a problem severely constrained by the Balian-Low theorem. Here these constraints are avoided by restricting attention to situations in which the density matrix is reasonably decohered (i.e., spread out in phase space). Commuting position and momentum operators are argued to be of use in discussions of emergent classicality from quantum mechanics. In particular, they may be used to give a discussion of the relationship between exact and approximate decoherence in the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory.

abstract: We present a full quantum treatment of a five-level atomic system coupled to two quantum and two classical light fields. The two quantum fields undergo a cross-phase modulation induced by electro-magnetically induced transparency. The performance of this configuration as a two-qubit quantum phase gate for travelling single-photons is examined. A trade-off between the size of the conditional phase shift and the fidelity of the gate is found. Nonetheless, a satisfactory gate performance is still found to be possible in the transient regime, corresponding to a fast gate operation.

abstract: The behavior of simply pulsed qubits (quantum systems with two linearly independent states) may be characterized by the energy difference $\Delta E$ between the two states of the qubit and by an external stimulating potential $V(t)$ that causes transitions between them. Thus, the operation of such quantum mechanical systems may be categorized in various regions that explicitly depend on $\Delta E$ and $V(t)$. Limiting cases of degenerate, perturbative, and adiabatic regions are discussed. A comprehensive and illustrative map for simply pulsed qubits is presented that can be used as a visual tool for students. Furthermore, analytic solutions may be obtained when the interaction $V(t)$ is proportional to $\delta(t-t_k)$, namely when a fast interaction, called a kick, is used.

In particular, we show that a dual-chamber Fabry-Perot interferometer with a shared mirror-pair can be used in a way so that its sensitivity is increased by operating near the critically anomalous dispersion condition where the group index is much less than unity. The enhancement factor can be as high as 108 for realistic conditions. The process of bi-frequency pumped Raman gain in a lambda-type atomic medium can be used to achieve this effect.

abstract: In this paper we present a new unified theoretical framework that describes the full dynamics of quantum computation. Our formulation allows any questions pertaining to the physical behavior of a quantum computer to be framed, and in principle, answered. We refer to the central organizing principle developed in this paper, on which our theoretical structure is based, as the *Quantum Computer Condition* (QCC), a rigorous mathematical statement that connects the irreversible dynamics of the quantum computing machine, with the reversible operations that comprise the quantum computation intended to be carried out by the quantum computing machine. Armed with the QCC, we derive a powerful result that we call the *Encoding No-Go Theorem*. This theorem gives a precise mathematical statement of the conditions under which fault-tolerant quantum computation becomes impossible in the presence of dissipation and/or decoherence. In connection with this theorem, we explicitly calculate a universal critical damping value for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In addition we show that the recently-discovered approach to quantum error correction known as "operator quantum error-correction" (OQEC) is a special case of our more general formulation. Our approach furnishes what we will refer to as "operator quantum fault-tolerance" (OQFT). In particular, we show how the QCC allows one to derive error thresholds for fault tolerance in a completely general context. We prove the existence of solutions to a class of time-dependent generalizations of the Lindblad equation. Using the QCC, we also show that the seemingly different circuit, graph- (including cluster-) state, and adiabatic paradigms for quantum computing are in fact all manifestations of a single, universal paradigm for all physical quantum computation.

The continuous-variable measurements are made with a photon-counting, parity-inverting Sagnac interferometer based on all-reflecting optics. The technique provides a large numerical aperture without distorting the shape of the wave front, does not introduce astigmatism, and allows for characterization of fully or partially coherent optical fields at the single-photon level. Measurements of the transverse spatial Wigner functions for highly attenuated coherent beams are presented and compared to theoretical predictions.

Lett. \textbf{89}, 187902 (2002)] freely in a noise channel. The vicious eavesdropper, Eve, intercepts and measures the travel photon transmitted between the sender and the receiver. Then she replaces the quantum signal with a multi-photon signal in a same state, and measures the photons return with the measuring basis with which Eve prepares the fake signal except for one photon. This attack increase neither the quantum channel losses nor the error rate in the sampling instances for eavesdropping check. It works for eavesdropping the secret message transmitted with the ping-pong protocol. Finally, we propose a way for improving the security of the ping-pong protocol.

abstract: There are several examples of bipartite entangled states of continuous variables for which the existing criteria for entanglement using the inequalities involving the second order moments are insufficient. We derive new inequalities involving higher order correlation, for testing entanglement in non-Gaussian states. In this context we study an example of a non-Gaussian state, which is a bipartite entangled state of the form $\psi(x_{\rm a},x_{\rm b})\propto (\alpha x_{\rm a}+\beta x_{\rm b})e^{-(x_{\rm a}^2+x_{\rm b}^2)/2}$. Our results open up an avenue to search for new inequalities to test entanglement in non-Gaussian states.

abstract: The issue of the Gibbs paradox is that when considering mixing of two gases within classical thermodynamics, the entropy of mixing appears to be a discontinuous function of the difference between the gases: it is finite for whatever small difference, but vanishes for identical gases. The resolution offered in the literature, with help of quantum mixing entropy, was later shown to be unsatisfactory precisely where it sought to resolve the paradox. Macroscopic thermodynamics, classical or quantum, is unsuitable for explaining the paradox, since it does not deal explicitly with the difference between the gases. The proper approach employs quantum thermodynamics, which deals with finite quantum systems coupled to a large bath and a macroscopic work source. Within quantum thermodynamics, entropy generally looses its dominant place and the target of the paradox is naturally shifted to the decrease of the maximally available work before and after mixing (mixing ergotropy). In contrast to entropy this is an unambiguous quantity. For almost identical gases the mixing ergotropy continuously goes to zero, thus resolving the paradox. In this approach the concept of ``difference between the gases'' gets a clear operational meaning related to the possibilities of controlling the involved quantum states. Difficulties which prevent resolutions of the paradox in its entropic formulation do not arise here. The mixing ergotropy has several counter-intuitive features. It can increase when less precise operations are allowed. In the quantum situation (in contrast to the classical one) the mixing ergotropy can also increase when decreasing the degree of mixing between the gases, or when decreasing their distinguishability. These points go against a direct association of physical irreversibility with lack of information.

For the case of a single receiver, the capacity of such information transfer is found exactly. It is shown that the capacity is not enhanced by allowing the senders to perform joint operations. We provide a nontrivial upper bound on the capacity in the case of two receivers. We also give a classification of the set of all multiparty states in terms of their usefulness for dense coding. We provide examples for each of these classes, and discuss some of their properties.

abstract: In quantum chemistry calculations, the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the Hartree-Fock limit energy and the exact solution of the nonrelativistic Schrodinger equation. With this definition, the electron correlation effects are not directly observable. In this report, we show that the entanglement can be used as an alternative measure of the electron correlation in quantum chemistry calculations. Entanglement is directly observable and it is one of the most striking properties of quantum mechanics. As an example we calculate the entanglement for He atom and H2 molecule with different basis sets.

abstract: The strongest attack against quantum mechanics came in 1935 in the form of a paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. It was argued that the theory of quantum mechanics could not be called a complete theory of Nature, for every element of reality is not represented in the formalism as such. The authors then put forth a proposition: we must search for a theory where, upon knowing everything about the system, including possible hidden variables, one could make precise predictions concerning elements of reality. This project was ultimatly doomed in 1964 with the work of Bell Bell, who showed that the most general local hidden variable theory could not reproduce correlations that arise in quantum mechanics. There exist mainly three forms of no-go theorems for local hidden variable theories. Although almost every physicist knows the consequences of these no-go theorems, not every physicist is aware of the distinctions between the three or even their exact definitions. Thus we will discuss here the three principal forms of no-go theorems for local hidden variable theories of Nature. We will define Bell inequalities, Bell inequalities without inequalities and pseudo-telepathy. A discussion of the similarities and differences will follow.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Quantum entanglement has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of interferometric sensing by providing many orders of magnitude improvement in interferometer sensitivity. The quantum-entangled particle interferometer approach is very general and applies to many types of interferometers. In particular, without nonlocal entanglement, a generic classical interferometer has a statistical-sampling shot-noise limited sensitivity that scales like $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles passing through the interferometer per unit time. However, if carefully prepared quantum correlations are engineered between the particles, then the interferometer sensitivity improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ to scale like 1/N, which is the limit imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For optical interferometers operating at milliwatts of optical power, this quantum sensitivity boost corresponds to an eight-order-of-magnitude improvement of signal to noise. This effect can translate into a tremendous science pay-off for space missions. For example, one application of this new effect is to fiber optical gyroscopes for deep-space inertial guidance and tests of General Relativity (Gravity Probe B). Another application is to ground and orbiting optical interferometers for gravity wave detection, Laser Interferometer Gravity Observatory (LIGO) and the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), respectively. Other applications are to Satellite-to-Satellite laser Interferometry (SSI) proposed for the next generation Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE II).

abstract: The so-called entanglement with vacuum is not a property of the Fock space, but of some rather pathological representations of CCR/CAR algebras. In some other Fock space representations the notion simply does not exist. We have checked all the main Gedanken experiments where the notion of entanglement with vacuum was used, and found that all the calculations could be performed at a representation-independent level. In particular any such experiment can be formulated in a Fock-space representation where the notion of entanglement with vacuum is meaningless. So, for the moment there is no single experiment where the notion is needed, and probably it is simply unphysical.

abstract: Noise correlations, such as those observable in the time of flight images of a released cloud, are calculated for hard-core bosonic (HCB) atoms. We find that the standard mapping of HCB systems onto spin-1/2 XY models fails in application to computation of noise correlations. This is due to the contribution of multiply occupied virtual states to noise correlations in bosonic systems. Such states do not exist in spin models. We use these correlations to explore quantum coherence of the ground states and re-address the relationship between the peaks present in noise correlation and the Mott phase. Our analysis points to distinctive new experimental signatures of the Mott phase. The importance of these correlations is illustrated in an example of a quasiperiodic potential that exhibits a localization transition. In this case, in contrast to the momentum distribution, the noise correlations reveal the presence of quasiperiodic order in the localized phase.

When M=4, the proof covers the so-called SARG04 protocol [V.~Scarani et al., Phys. Rev.\ Lett. {\bf 92}, 057901 (2004)], which uses exactly the same quantum communication as the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol. For a channel with transmission $\eta$, we show that the key rate in SARG04 scales as $O(\eta^{3/2})$. When we increase the number of states to M=2k-1 or 2k, the key rate scaling improves as $O(\eta^{(k+1)/k})$.

abstract: We show that any unitary transformation performed on the quantum state of a closed quantum system, describes an inner, reversible, generalized quantum measurement. We also show that under some specific conditions it is possible to perform a unitary transformation on the state of the closed quantum system by means of a collection of generalized measurement operators. In particular, given a complete set of orthogonal projectors, it is possible to implement a reversible quantum measurement that preserves the probabilities. In this context, we introduce the concept of "Truth-Observable", which is the physical counterpart of an inner logical truth.

abstract: An integral relation is established between the Green functions corresponding to two Hamiltonians which are supersymmetric (SUSY) partners and in general may possess both discrete and continuous spectra. It is shown that when the continuous spectrum is present the trace of the difference of the Green functions for SUSY partners is a finite quantity which may or may not be equal to zero despite the divergence of the traces of each Green function. Our findings are illustrated by using the free particle example considered both on the whole real line and on a half line.

Two qubit states are encoded as orthogonal collective spin excitations of an unpolarized atomic ensemble. After a programmable delay, the atomic excitation is converted into a photon (idler). Polarization states of both the signal and the idler are recorded and are found to be in violation of the Bell inequality. Atomic coherence times exceeding several microseconds are achieved by switching off all the trapping fields - including the quadrupole magnetic field of the magneto-optical trap - and zeroing out the residual ambient magnetic field.

abstract: Construction of explicit quantum circuits follows the notion of the "standard circuit model" introduced in the solid and profound analysis of elementary gates providing quantum computation. Nevertheless the model is not always optimal (e.g. concerning the number of computational steps) and it neglects physical systems which cannot follow the "standard circuit model" analysis. We propose a computational scheme which overcomes the notion of the transposition from classical circuits providing a computation scheme with the least possible number of Hamiltonians in order to minimize the physical resources needed to perform quantum computation and to succeed a minimization of the computational procedure (minimizing the number of computational steps needed to perform an arbitrary unitary transformation). It is a general scheme of construction, independent of the specific system used for the implementation of the quantum computer. The open problem of controllability in Lie groups is directly related and rises to prominence in an effort to perform universal quantum computation.

After deriving the metric of a sonic black hole from the Schrodinger equation and quantizing the perturbation fields near the sonic event horizon, we show particles of Hawking radiation can act as a source of entanglement: two-mode squeezed entanglement is produced near the event horizon, which can be used in quantum teleportation. The fidelity of the teleportation is closely related to the temperature of the sonic black holes, but high fidelity seems difficult to reach in our case.

abstract: Whereas boson coherent states with complex parametrization provide an elegant, and intuitive representation, there is no counterpart for fermions using complex parametrization. However, a complex parametrization provides a valuable way to describe amplitude and phase of a coherent beam. Thus we pose the question of whether a fermionic beam can be described, even approximately, by a complex-parametrized coherent state and define, in a natural way, approximate complex-parametrized fermion coherent states. Then we identify four appealing properties of boson coherent states (eigenstate of annihilation operator, displaced vacuum state, preservation of product states under linear coupling, and factorization of correlators) and show that these approximate complex fermion coherent states fail all four criteria. The inapplicability of complex parametrization supports the use of Grassman algebras as an appropriate alternative.

We initially consider observables that are quadratic in the mode creation and annihilation operators and find conditions under which a two-mode state is entangled. Further examination allows us to formulate additional conditions for detecting entanglement. We conclude by showing how the methods used here can be extended to find entanglement in systems of more than two modes.

abstract: We have found that encapsulated atoms in fullerene molecules, which carry a spin, can be used for fast quantum computing. We describe the scheme for performing quantum computations, going through the preparation of the qubit state and the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate. When we apply a static magnetic field to each encased spin, we find out the ideal design for the preparation of the quantum state. Therefore, adding to our system a time dependent magnetic field, we can perform a phase-gate. The operational time related to a $\pi-$phase gate is of the order of $ns$. This finding shows that, during the decoherence time, which is proportional to $\mu s$, we can perform many thousands of gate operations. In addition, the two-qubit state which arises after a $\pi-$gate is characterized by a high degree of entanglement. This opens a new avenue for the implementation of fast quantum computation.

abstract: The auxiliary rules of quantum mechanics have always included the Born rule that connects probability with square modulus. This need not be the case, for it is possible to introduce probability into the theory through probability current alone. When this is done, other rules can provide for stochastically triggered measurements within a system of any size, microscopic or macroscopic; and solutions to the Schrodinger equation can be consistently applied to individual trials, not just to ensembles of trials. Other advantages appear. The rules can then resolve the paradox associated with the Schrodinger cat experiment, and remove the possibility of the many world thesis of Everett. As a result, the system can accommodate any conscious observer, including the principal investigator who cannot otherwise be included in a quantum mechanical system.

abstract: This paper presents no new results; its goals are purely pedagogical. A special case of the Cartan Decomposition has found much utility in the field of quantum computing, especially in its sub-field of quantum compiling. This special case allows one to factor a general 2-qubit operation (i.e., an element of U(4)) into local operations applied before and after a three parameter, non-local operation. In this paper, we give a complete and rigorous proof of this special case of Cartan's Decomposition. From the point of view of QC programmers who might not be familiar with the subtleties of Lie Group Theory, the proof given here has the virtues, that it is constructive in nature, and that it uses only Linear Algebra. The constructive proof presented in this paper is implemented in some Octave/Matlab m-files that are included with the paper. Thus, this paper serves as documentation for the attached m-files.

First, we demonstrate generation of entanglement and local realization of quantum gates in a quantum spin glass system. Entanglement in such systems attains significantly high values, after quenched averaging, and has a stable positive value for arbitrary times. Complex systems with long range interactions, such as ion chains or dipolar atomic gases, can be modeled by neural network Hamiltonians. In such systems, we find the characteristic time of persistence of quenched averaged entanglement, and also find the time of its revival.

We show that the features of our study are embodied by suitably prepared optical lattices, where effective three-spin interactions have been theoretically demonstrated. We use this to provide a compact construction for the Toffoli gate. Information flow and two-qubit interactions are also outlined, together with a brief analysis of relevant sources of imperfection.

abstract: In our Letter we proposed a scheme for nondeterministic quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the polarization of a single photon--a photonic qubit--using linear optics and photodetection. The scheme works with nonunit probability, but success is heralded by the detection of a single photon in the meter output. We provided an experimental demonstration of this scheme and introduced three universally applicable fidelity measures--the measurement fidelity F_M, the quantum state preparation fidelity F_QSP, and the QND fidelity F_QND--to quantify its performance. The claim of Kok and Munro in their Comment [quant-ph/0406120] is that one of our fidelity measures F_M is not appropriate because it relies on coincidence measurements. We show why this claim is wrong from both a fundamental and an operational perspective.

abstract: We construct a formal framework for investigating epistemic and temporal notions in the context of distributed quantum computation. While we rely on structures developed earlier, we stress that our notion of quantum knowledge makes sense more generally in any agent-based model for distributed quantum systems. Several arguments are given to support our view that an agent's possibility relation should not be based on the reduced density matrix, but rather on local classical states and local quantum operations. In this way, we are able to analyse distributed primitives such as superdense coding and teleportation, obtaining interesting conclusions as to how the knowledge of individual agents evolves. We show explicitly that the knowledge transfer in teleportation is essentially classical, in that eventually, the receiving agent knows that its state is equal to the initial state of the sender. The relevant epistemic statements for teleportation deal with this correlation rather than with the actual quantum state, which is unknown throughout the protocol.

abstract: A dynamical decoupling scheme for the deterrence of errors in the non-Markovian (usually corresponding to low temperature, short time, and strong coupling) regimes suitable for qubits constructed out of a multilevel structure is studied. We use the effective spin-boson model (ESBM) introduced recently [K. Shiokawa and B. L. Hu, Phys. Rev. A70, 062106 (2004)] as a low temperature limit of the quantum Brownian oscillator model, where one can obtain exact solutions for a general environment with colored noises. In our decoupling scheme a train of pairs of strong pulses are used to evolve the interaction Hamiltonian instantaneously. Using this scheme we show that the dynamical decoupling method can suppress $1/f$ noise with slower and hence more accessible pulses than previously studied, but it still fails to decouple super-Ohmic types of environments.

abstract: By modeling a linear polarizable and magnetizable medium (magneto-dielectric) with two quantum fields, namely E and M, electromagnetic field is quantized in such a medium consistently and systematically. A Hamiltonian is proposed from which, using the Heisenberg equations, Maxwell and constitutive equations of the medium are obtained. For a homogeneous medium, the equation of motion of the quantum vector potential, $\vec{A}$, is derived and solved analytically. Two coupling functions which describe the electromagnetic properties of the medium are introduced. Four examples are considered showing the features and the applicability of the model to both absorptive and nonabsorptive magneto-dielectrics.

We present a scheme based on adiabatic passage that allows for transportation of a qubit, operator measurements and entanglement, using a 1-D array of quantum sites with a single sender (Alice) and multiple receivers (Bobs). Alice need not know which Bob is the receiver, and if several Bobs try to receive the signal, they obtain a superposition state which can be used to realize two-qubit operator measurements for the generation of maximally entangled states.

We next discuss Gleason's theorem and Kochen-Specker theorem and bring out the troublems with non contextual hidden variable theories. An important role is played by Einstein locality in the discussion of hidden variable theories as was first brought out by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. We elaborate it's various implications such as Bell's theorem in terms of Bell's inequalities as well as later work in which Bell's theorem follows without using inequalities.

abstract: Complementarity was originally introduced as a qualitative concept for the discussion of properties of quantum mechanical objects that are classically incompatible. More recently, complementarity has become a \emph{quantitative} relation between classically incompatible properties, such as visibility of interference fringes and "which-way" information, but also between purely quantum mechanical properties, such as measures of entanglement. We discuss different complementarity relations for systems of 2-, 3-, or \textit{n} qubits. Using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we have experimentally verified some of these complementarity relations in a two-qubit system.

Further on the entanglement evolution is investigated and it is shown that the symmetry of the probability distribution is reflected by the symmetry of the entanglement distribution.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) in a triple-well trap in a three-level approximation. The inter-atomic interactions are taken into account in a mean-field approximation (Gross-Pitaevskii equation), leading to a nonlinear three-level model. New eigenstates emerge due to the nonlinearity, depending on the system parameters. Adiabaticity breaks down if such a nonlinear eigenstate disappears when the parameters are varied. The dynamical implications of this loss of adiabaticity are analyzed for two important special cases: A three level Landau-Zener model and the STIRAP scheme. We discuss the emergence of looped levels for an equal-slope Landau-Zener model. The Zener tunneling probability does not tend to zero in the adiabatic limit and shows pronounced oscillations as a function of the velocity of the parameter variation. Furthermore we generalize the STIRAP scheme for adiabatic coherent population transfer between atomic states to the nonlinear case. It is shown that STIRAP breaks down if the nonlinearity exceeds the detuning.

abstract: In the scientific and engineering literature, the second law of thermodynamics is expressed in terms of the behavior of entropy in reversible and irreversible processes. According to the prevailing statistical mechanics interpretation the entropy is viewed as a nonphysical statistical attribute, a measure of either disorder in a system, or lack of information about the system, or erasure of information collected about the system, and a plethora of analytic expressions are proposed for the various measures. In this paper, we present two expositions of thermodynamics (both 'revolutionary' in the sense of Thomas Kuhn with respect to conventional statistical mechanics and traditional expositions of thermodynamics) that apply to all systems (both macroscopic and microscopic, including single particle or single spin systems), and to all states (thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and other states).

abstract: A novel form of Ramsey narrowing is identified and characterized. For long-lived coherent atomic states coupled by laser fields, the diffusion of atoms in-and-out of the laser beam induces a spectral narrowing of the atomic resonance lineshape. Illustrative experiments and an intuitive analytical model are presented for this diffusion-induced Ramsey narrowing, which occurs commonly in optically-interrogated systems.

abstract: Consider the following generalized hidden shift problem: given a function f on {0,...,M-1} x Z_N satisfying f(b,x)=f(b+1,x+s) for b=0,1,...,M-2, find the unknown shift s in Z_N. For M=N, this problem is an instance of the abelian hidden subgroup problem, which can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer, whereas for M=2, it is equivalent to the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, for which no efficient algorithm is known. For any fixed positive epsilon, we give an efficient (i.e., poly(log N)) quantum algorithm for this problem provided M > N^epsilon. The algorithm is based on the "pretty good measurement" and uses H. Lenstra's (classical) algorithm for integer programming as a subroutine.

abstract: We propose a spin-half approximation method for two-component condensation in double wells to discuss the quantum entanglement of two components. This approximation is presented to be valid under stationary tunneling effect for odd particle number of each component. The evolution of the entanglement is found to be affected by the particle number both quantitatively and qualitatively. In detail, the maximal entanglement are shown to be hyperbolic like with respect to tunneling rate and time. To successively obtain large and long time sustained entanglement, the particle number should not be large.

abstract: Photon counting induces an effective nonlinear optical phase shift on certain states derived by linear optics from single photons. Although this no nlinearity is nondeterministic, it is sufficient in principle to allow scalable linear optics quantum computation (LOQC). The most obvious way to encode a qubit optically is as a superposition of the vacuum and a single photon in one mode -- so-called "single-rail" logic. Until now this approach was thought to be prohibitively expensive (in resources) compared to "dual-rail" logic where a qubit is stored by a photon across two modes. Here we attack this problem with real-time feedback control, which can realize a quantum-limited phase measurement on a single mode, as has been recently demonstrated experimentally. We show that with this added measurement resource, the resource requirements for single-rail LOQC are not substantially different from those of dual-rail LOQC. In particular, with adaptive phase measurements an arbitrary qubit state $\alpha \ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$ can be prepared deterministically.

These times are valid both for the stationary and time-dependent scattering processes, without any restrictions on the shape of Gaussian-like wave packets. We show that in the stationary case both the Larmor times coincide with the corresponding dwell times obtained in quant-ph/0502073. The Larmor-time concept gives the way to verify the approach presented in quant-ph/0405028.

Projecting an entire qubit-detector wave function on the detector eigenstates we determine the precision limit for the qubit measurements, allowed by quantum mechanics. We found that this quantity is determined by qubit dynamics as well as decoherence, generated by the measurement. Our results show how the quantum precision limit can be improved by a proper design of a measurement procedure.

abstract: We study numerically the behavior of continuous-time quantum walks over networks which are topologically equivalent to square lattices. On short time scales, when placing the initial excitation at a corner of the network, we observe a fast, directed transport through the network to the opposite corner. This transport is not ballistic in nature, but rather produced by quantum mechanical interference. In the long time limit, certain walks show an asymmetric limiting probability distribution; this feature depends on the starting site and, remarkably, on the precise size of the network. The limiting probability distributions show patterns which are correlated with the initial condition. This might have consequences for the application of continuous time quantum walk algorithms.

abstract: Taking several statistical examples, in particular one involving a choice of experiment, as points of departure, and making symmetry assumptions, the link towards quantum theory developed in Helland (2005a,b) is surveyed and clarified. The quantum Hilbert space is constructed from the parameters of the various experiments using group representation theory. It is shown under natural assumptions that a subset of the set of unit vectors of this space, the generalized coherent state vectors, can be put in correspondence with questions of the kind: What is the value of the (complete) parameter? - together with a crisp answer to that question. Links are made to statistical models in general, to model reduction of overparametrized models and to the design of experiments. It turns out to be essential that the range of the statistical parameter is an invariant set under the relevant symmetry group.

abstract: Given a non-hermitean matrix M, the structure of its minimal polynomial encodes whether M is diagonalizable or not. This note will explain how to determine the minimal polynomial of a matrix without going through its characteristic polynomial. The approach is applied to a quantum mechanical particle moving in a square well under the influence of a piece-wise constant PT-symmetric potential. Upon discretizing the configuration space, the system is decribed by a matrix of dimension three. It turns out not to be diagonalizable for a critical strength of the interaction, also indicated by the transition of two real into a pair of complex energy eigenvalues. The systems develops a three-fold degenerate eigenvalue, and two of the three eigenfunctions disappear at this exceptional point, giving a difference between the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue equal to two.

abstract: The Horodecki family employed the Jaynes maximum-entropy principle, fitting the mean (b_{1}) of the Bell-CHSH observable (B). This model was extended by Rajagopal by incorporating the dispersion (\sigma_{1}^2) of the observable, and by Canosa and Rossignoli, by generalizing the observable (B_{\alpha}). We further extend the Horodecki one-parameter model in both these manners, obtaining a three-parameter (b_{1},\sigma_{1}^2,\alpha) two-qubit model, for which we find a highly interesting/intricate continuum (-\infty < \alpha < \infty) of Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) separability probabilities -- in which, the golden ratio is featured. Our model can be contrasted with the three-parameter (b_{q}, \sigma_{q}^2,q) one of Abe and Rajagopal, which employs a q(Tsallis)-parameter rather than $\alpha$, and has simply q-invariant HS separability probabilities of 1/2. Our results emerge in a study initially focused on embedding certain information metrics over the two-level quantum systems into a q-framework. We find evidence that Srednicki's recently-stated biasedness criterion for noninformative priors yields rankings of priors fully consistent with an information-theoretic test of Clarke, previously applied to quantum systems by Slater.

We exactly study the stability of these gates in presence of imperfections in coupling strengths and interaction times and prove them to be robust. Moreover, we analyse the effect of spontaneous emission and losses and show that such gates are very promising in view of the high level of coherent control currently achievable in optical cavities.

The first one consists of boson strings and more generally homogeneous polynomials, while the second one treats operators linear in one of the creation or annihilation operators. Both solutions generalize Bell and Stirling numbers arising in the number operator case. We use the advanced combinatorial analysis to provide closed form expressions, generating functions, recurrences, etc. The analysis is based on the Dobi\'nski-type relations and the umbral calculus methods. As an illustration of this framework we point out the applications to the construction of generalized coherent states, operator calculus and ordering of deformed bosons.

abstract: We study a generalized Hadamard walk in one dimension with three inner states. The particle governed by the three-state quantum walk moves, in superposition, both to the left and to the right according to the inner state. In addition to these two degrees of freedom, it is allowed to stay at the same position. We calculate rigorously the wavefunction of the particle starting from the origin for any initial qubit state, and show the spatial distribution of probability of finding the particle. In contrast with the Hadamard walk with two inner states on a line, the probability of finding the particle at the origin does not converge to zero even after infinite time steps except special initial states. This implies that the particle is trapped near the origin after long time with high probability.

abstract: The three-qubit space of entanglement types is the orbit space of the local unitary action on the space of three-qubit pure states, and hence describes the types of entanglement that a system of three qubits can achieve. We show that this orbit space is homeomorphic to a certain subspace of R^6, which we describe completely. We give a topologically based classification of three-qubit entanglement types, and we argue that the nontrivial topology of the three-qubit space of entanglement types forbids the existence of standard states with the convenient properties of two-qubit standard states.

In this paper, those modifications are written directly into the nRules, reducing their number from four to three. It is shown that the nRules in either form provide for a definite direction in time, guaranteeing that a statistically irreversible interaction is absolutely irreversible.

As an application, we propose a method for finding all such subspaces and subsystems for arbitrary quantum operations. We suggest that this work brings the fundamental passive technique for error correction in quantum computing an important step closer to practical realization.

abstract: A controversy that has arisen many times over in disparate contexts is whether quantum coherences between eigenstates of certain quantities are fact or fiction. We present a pedagogical introduction to the debate in the form of a hypothetical dialogue between proponents from each of the two camps: a factist and a fictionist. A resolution of the debate can be achieved, we argue, by recognizing that quantum states do not only contain information about the intrinsic properties of a system but about its extrinsic properties as well, that is, about its relation to other systems external to it. Specifically, the coherent quantum state of the factist is the appropriate description of the relation of the system to one reference frame, while the incoherent quantum state of the fictionist is the appropriate description of the relation of the system to another, uncorrelated, reference frame. The two views, we conclude, are alternative but equally valid paradigms of description.

abstract: A system of diagrams is introduced that allows the representation of various elements of a quantum circuit, including measurements, in a form which makes no reference to time (hence ``atemporal''). It can be used to relate quantum dynamical properties to those of entangled states (map-state duality), and suggests useful analogies, such as the inverse of an entangled ket. Diagrams clarify the role of channel kets, transition operators, dynamical operators (matrices), and Kraus rank for noisy quantum channels. Positive (semidefinite) operators are represented by diagrams with a symmetry that aids in understanding their connection with completely positive maps. The diagrams are used to analyze standard teleportation and dense coding, and for a careful study of unambiguous (conclusive) teleportation. A simple diagrammatic argument shows that a Kraus rank of 3 is impossible for a one-qubit channel modeled using a one-qubit environment in a mixed state.

abstract: We describe quantum controllability under the influences of the quantum decoherence induced by the quantum control itself. It is shown that, when the controller is considered as a quantum system, it will entangle with its controlled system and then cause quantum decoherence in the controlled system. In competition with this induced decoherence, the controllability will be limited by some uncertainty relation in a well-armed quantum control process. In association with the phase uncertainty and the standard quantum limit, a general model is studied to demonstrate the possibility of realizing a decoherence-free quantum control with a finite energy within a finite time. It is also shown that if the operations of quantum control are to be determined by the initial state of the controller, then due to the decoherence which results from the quantum control itself, there exists a low bound for quantum controllability.

comments: 22 pages. Argument sharpened and references updated

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Einstein's philosophy of physics (as clarified by Fine, Howard, and Held) was predicated on his Trennungsprinzip, a combination of separability and locality, without which he believed objectification, and thereby "physical thought" and "physical laws", to be impossible. Bohr's philosophy (as elucidated by Hooker, Scheibe, Folse, Howard, Held, and others), on the other hand, was grounded in a seemingly different doctrine about the possibility of objective knowledge, namely the necessity of classical concepts. In fact, it follows from Raggio's Theorem in algebraic quantum theory that - within an appropriate class of physical theories - suitable mathematical translations of the doctrines of Bohr and Einstein are equivalent. Thus - upon our specific formalization - quantum mechanics accommodates Einstein's Trennungsprinzip if and only if it is interpreted a la Bohr through classical physics. Unfortunately, the protagonists themselves failed to discuss their differences in this constructive way, since their debate was dominated by Einstein's ingenious but ultimately flawed attempts to establish the "incompleteness" of quantum mechanics. This aspect of their debate may still be understood and appreciated, however, as reflecting a much deeper and insurmountable disagreement between Bohr and Einstein on the knowability of Nature. Using the theological controversy on the knowability of God as a analogy, Einstein was a Spinozist, whereas Bohr could be said to be on the side of Maimonides. Thus Einstein's off-the-cuff characterization of Bohr as a 'Talmudic philosopher' was spot-on.

abstract: We investigate the security bounds of quantum cryptographic protocols using $d$-level systems. In particular, we focus on schemes that use two mutually unbiased bases, thus extending the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme to higher dimensions. Under the assumption of general coherent attacks, we derive an analytic expression for the ultimate upper security bound of such quantum cryptography schemes. This bound is well below the predictions of optimal cloning machines. The possibility of extraction of a secret key beyond entanglement distillation is discussed. In the case of qutrits we argue that any eavesdropping strategy is equivalent to a symmetric one. For higher dimensions such an equivalence is generally no longer valid.

abstract: Systems with constraints pose problems when they are quantized. Moreover, the Dirac procedure of quantization prior to reduction is preferred. The projection operator method of quantization, which can be most conveniently described by coherent state path integrals, enables one to directly impose a regularized form of the quantum constraints. This procedure also overcomes conventional difficulties with normalization and second class constraints that invalidate conventional Dirac quantization procedures.

abstract: We present an extension of the Wootters concurrence for the case of two qutrits in mixed states. The reduction of our extension to the case of two levels shows complete agreement with Wootters concurrence for two qubits. As an explicit example, we compute the concurrence for a family of symmetric states and we obtain the bounds on the limit for separability. Our results are compared with those of the negativity.

abstract: Electrometers measure electric charge, but there must be a fundamental speed limit to measuring one electric charge. Since there are no dimensional inputs to this question, the answer must be expressible in terms of the fundamental physical constants of Nature, e,h,m,c. In general the question should be posed without reference to any specific technology, but for definiteness, we analyze the field effect transistor, which is essentially an electrometer. In spite of selecting a specific technology, we find that the speed limit is related to a fundamental constant, the Rydberg frequency, or as appropriate, the semiconductor Rydberg frequency including the electron effective mass, and the relative dielectric constant. We do not know whether the Rydberg frequency represents the upper speed limit, but on dimensional grounds we claim that the final limit can only differ by some power of the fine-structure-constant.

abstract: In this paper we investigate a open two-qubit model whose dynamics is not exactly solvable. When the initial state is the maximum entangled state, as the exactly solvable open two-qubit model [D. Tolkunov and V. Privman, Phys. Rev. A 71, 060308(R) (2005)], the decay of entanglement of formation of the model, expressed by concurrence is also governed by the product of suppression factors describing decoherence of the subsystems (qubits). However, if the initial state is not the maximum entangled state, its concurrence will decrease faster than the product of the suppression factors describing decoherence of the qubits.

abstract: We investigate the maximal violation of Bell inequalities for two $d$-dimensional systems by using the method of Bell operator. The maximal violation corresponds to the maximal eigenvalue of the Bell operator matrix. The eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are described by asymmetric entangled states. We estimate the maximum value of the eigenvalue for large dimension. A family of elegant entangled states $|\Psi>_{\rm app}$ that violate Bell inequality more strongly than the maximally entangled state but are somewhat close to these eigenvectors is presented. These approximate states can potentially be useful for quantum cryptography as well as many other important fields of quantum information.

abstract: The Casimir interaction between two thick parallel plates, one made of metal and the other of dielectric, is investigated at nonzero temperature. It is shown that in some temperature intervals the Casimir pressure and the free energy of a fluctuating field are the nonmonotonous functions of temperature and the respective Casimir entropy can be negative. The physical interpretation for these conclusions is given. At the same time we demonstrate that the entropy vanishes when the temperature goes to zero, i.e., in the Casimir interaction between metal and dielectric the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. The investigation is performed both analytically, by using the model of an ideal metal and dilute dielectric or dielectric with a frequency-independent dielectric permittivity, and numerically for real metal (Au) and dielectrics with different behavior of the dielectric permittivity along the imaginary frequency axis (Si and Al_2O_3).

abstract: In this paper, without any priori assumption about the post-measurement state of system, we will examine how this state is restricted by assuming each of these following assumptions. First, by using this reasonable assumption that two successive measurements should be describable as one measurement. Second, by assuming the impossibility of faster than light signaling, "No-signaling condition". However, only by using these assumptions it is not possible to obtain the usual projection postulate. Instead, by means of a simple lemma, we will show that the density operator of system after a measurement is a linear function of the density operator determined by the usual post-measurement postulate. Furthermore we will show this linear function has a Kraus representation. Finally, we will discuss about the physical meaning of this consequence.

We study algebras of operators that abstract from the algebra of projections on closed subspaces of a Hilbert space. The properties of such operators are justified on epistemological grounds. Commutation of measurements is a central topic of interest. Classical logical systems may be viewed as measurement algebras in which all measurements commute.

abstract: In a fundamental paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 325 (1997)] Grover showed how a quantum computer can find a single marked object in a database of size N by using only O(N^{1/2}) queries of the oracle that identifies the object. His result was generalized to the case of finding one object in a subset of marked elements. We consider the following computational problem: A subset of marked elements is given whose number of elements is either M or K, M<K, our task is to determine which is the case. We show how to solve this problem with a high probability of success using only iterations of Grover's basic step (and no other algorithm). Let m be the required number of iterations; we prove that under certain restrictions on the sizes of M and K the estimation m < (2N^{1/2})/(K^{1/2}-M^{1/2}) obtains. This bound sharpens previous results and is known to be optimal up to a constant factor. Our method involves simultaneous Diophantine approximations, so that Grover's algorithm is conceptualized as an orbit of an ergodic automorphism of the torus. We comment on situations where the algorithm may be slow, and note the similarity between these cases and the problem of small divisors in classical mechanics.

We consider the so-called trusted device scenario where Eve cannot modify the actual detection devices employed by Alice and Bob. The upper bound obtained is based on the available measurements results, but it includes the effect of the noise and losses present in the detectors of the legitimate users.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The hardness to solve an unstructured quantum search problem by a standard quantum search algorithm mainly originates from the low efficiency to amplify the amplitude of the marked state by the oracle unitary operation associated with other known quantum operations. In order to bypass the square speedup limitation of a standard quantum search algorithm it is necessary to develop other type of quantum search algorithms. It is described in detail in the paper for a quantum dynamical method to solve the quantum search problems in the cyclic group state space. The binary dynamical representation for a quantum state in the Hilbert space of the n-qubit quantum system is generalized to the multi-base dynamical representation for a quantum state in the cyclic group state space. Thus, any quantum state in the cyclic group state space may be described completely in terms of a set of dynamical parameters that are closely related to the symmetric property and structure of the cyclic group. The quantum search problem therefore could be solved by determining the set of dynamical parameters that describe completely the unknown marked state of the search problem instead by directly measuring the marked state which is a necessary step in the standard quantum search algorithm. An unstructured quantum search problem in the Hilbert space is inevitably affected greatly by the symmetric property and structure of a group. The main attempt of the paper is to make use of the symmetric properties and structures of groups to help solving the quantum search problems in the group state spaces. It is shown how the quantum search process could be reduced from the cyclic group state space to these cyclic group state subspaces with the help of the symmetric property and structure of the cyclic group on a universal quantum computer.

abstract: We address a problem of identifying a given pure state with one of two reference pure states, when no classical knowledge on the reference states is given, but a certain number of copies of them are available. We assume the input state is guaranteed to be either one of the two reference states. This problem, which we call quantum pure state identification, is a natural generalization of the standard state discrimination problem. The two reference states are assumed to be independently distributed in a unitary invariant way in the whole state space. We give a complete solution for the averaged maximal success probability of this problem for an arbitrary number of copies of the reference states in general dimension. It is explicitly shown that the obtained mean identification probability approaches the mean discrimination probability as the number of the reference copies goes to infinity.

abstract: We have constructed a pulsed laser system for the manipulation of cold Rb atoms. The system combines optical telecommunications components and frequency doubling to generate light at 780 nm. Using a fast, fibre-coupled intensity modulator, output from a continuous laser diode is sliced into pulses with a length between 1.3 and 6.1 ns and a repetition frequency of 5 MHz. These pulses are amplified using an erbium-doped fibre amplifier, and frequency-doubled in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal, yielding a peak power up to 12 W. Using the resulting light at 780 nm, we demonstrate Rabi oscillations on the F = 2 <-> F=3-transition of a single 87Rb atom.

abstract: Quantum cryptography promises in-principle secure communication between two parties via a quantum channel, with the ability to discover eavesdropping when it occurs. In 1999, a telecloning protocol was invented [M. Murao {\it et al}., Phys. Rev. A {\bf 59}, 156 (1999)] that provides a way for an eavesdropper to remotely monitor a quantum cryptographic channel such that even if eavesdropping is discovered, the identity and location of the eavesdropper is guaranteed uncompromised. Here we demonstrate unconditional telecloning experimentally for the first time. We symmetrically teleclone coherent states of light, achieving a fidelity for each clone of $F = 0.58 \pm 0.01$.

Depending on the operating regime we observe either photofield emission or optical field emission with up to 200 electrons per pulse at a repetition rate of 1 GHz. This pulsed electron emitter, triggered by a femtosecond oscillator, could serve as an efficient source for time-resolved electron interferometry, for time-resolved nanometric imaging and for synchrotrons.

abstract: The solutions of the time independent Schrodinger equation for non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians have been extensively studied and calculated in many different fields of physics by using L^2 methods that originally have been developed for the calculations of bound states. The existing non-Hermitian formalism breaks down when dealing with wavepackets(WP). An open question is how time dependent expectation values can be calculated when the Hamiltonian is NH ? Using the F-product formalism, which was recently proposed, [J. Phys. Chem., 107, 7181 (2003)] we calculate the time dependent expectation values of different observable quantities for a simple well known study test case model Hamiltonian. We carry out a comparison between these results with those obtained from conventional(i.e., Hermitian) quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. The remarkable agreement between these results emphasizes the fact that in the NH-QM, unlike standard QM, there is no need to split the entire space into two regions; i.e., the interaction region and its surrounding. Our results open a door for a type of WP propagation calculations within the NH-QM formalism that until now were impossible.

abstract: The collective interaction via the environmental vacuum is investigated for a mixture of two deviating multi-atom ensembles in a moderately intense laser field. Due to the numerous inter-atomic couplings, the laser-dressed system may react sensitively and rapidly with respect to changes in the atomic and laser parameters. We show for weak probe fields that in the absence of absorption both the index of refraction and the group velocity may be modified strongly and rapidly due to the collectivity.

abstract: Somewhat surprisingly, quantum features can be extracted from a classical bath. For this, we discuss a sample of three-level atoms in ladder configuration interacting only via the surrounding bath, and show that the fluorescence light emitted by this system exhibits non-classical properties. Typical realizations for such an environment are thermal baths for microwave transition frequencies, or incoherent broadband fields for optical transitions. In a small sample of atoms, the emitted light can be switched from sub- to super-poissonian and from anti-bunching to super-bunching controlled by the mean number of atoms in the sample. Larger samples allow to generate super-bunched light over a wide range of bath parameters and thus fluorescence light intensities. We also identify parameter ranges where the fields emitted on the two transitions are correlated or anti-correlated, such that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is violated. As in a moderately strong baths this violation occurs also for larger numbers of atoms, such samples exhibit mesoscopic quantum effects.

We also prove that the generalized geometric phase information cannot be copied by a unitary operation. We argue that our result also holds in the consistent history formulation of quantum mechanics.

abstract: A quantum many-body model is presented with features similar to those of certain particle detectors. The energy spectrum contains a single metastable 'ready'-state and macroscopically-distinct 'pointer' states. Measurements do not pose paradoxes or require interventions outside the field theory formalism. Transitions into classical-like states can be triggered by a single particle with help of the thermal bath. Schroedinger cat states are associated with superpositions of inequivalent vacua, thus relating wavefunction collapse to the dynamics of symmetry breaking in phase transformations.

We also show that for these systems, and for states with a sufficiently large photon number, the conservation-law based constraint represents an ultimate limit closely related to the fluctuations in the quantum field phase.

abstract: We consider a scalar quantum field theory, in which the interaction takes the form of a field cutoff; the energy diverges to infinity whenever the value of the field at some point falls outside a finite interval. In a simple (1+1)-dimensional version of this theory, we may calculate the results of certain scattering processes exactly. The main feature of the nontrivial solutions is the appearance of shock fronts, whose time development is irreversible. The resulting nonunitarity implies that these theories are, at a minimum, radically different from conventional quantum field theories.

abstract: We demonstrate that the Global Entanglement (GE) measure defined by Meyer and Wallach, J. Math. Phys. 43, 4273 (2002), is maximal at the critical point for the Ising chain in a transverse magnetic field. Our analysis is based on the equivalence of GE to the averaged linear entropy, allowing the understanding of multipartite entanglement (ME) features through a generalization of GE for bipartite blocks of qubits. Moreover, in contrast to GE, the proposed ME measure can distinguish three paradigmatic entangled states: $GHZ_{N}$, $W_{N}$, and $EPR^{\otimes N/2}$. As such the generalized measure can detect genuine ME and is maximal at the critical point.

abstract: We study the quantum Arnol'd diffusion for a particle moving in a quasi-1D waveguide bounded by a periodically rippled surface, in the presence of the time-periodic electric field. It was found that in a deep semiclassical region the diffusion-like motion occurs for a particle in the region corresponding to a stochastic layer surrounding the coupling resonance. The rate of the quantum diffusion turns out to be less than the corresponding classical one, thus indicating the influence of quantum coherent effects. Another result is that even in the case when such a diffusion is possible, it terminates in time due to the mechanism similar to that of the dynamical localization. The quantum Arnol'd diffusion represents a new type of quantum dynamics, and may be experimentally observed in measurements of a conductivity of low-dimensional mesoscopic structures.

A narrow resonance is observed marked by quadratic energy growth, in parallel with a complete freezing of the energy absorption away from the resonance peak. Both phenomena are explained by classical means, taking proper account of the atoms' initial momentum distribution.

abstract: Coupling the output of a source quantum system into a target quantum system is easily treated by cascaded systems theory if the intervening quantum channel is dispersionless. However, dispersion may be important in some transfer protocols, especially in solid-state systems. In this paper we show how to generalize cascaded systems theory to treat such dispersion, provided it is not too strong. We show that the technique also works for fermionic systems with a low flux, and can be extended to treat fermionic systems with large flux. To test our theory, we calculate the effect of dispersion on the fidelity of a simple protocol of quantum state transfer. We find good agreement with an approximate analytical theory that had been previously developed for this example.

abstract: The theorem known from Pauli equation about operators that anticommute with Dirac's $K$-operator is generalized to the Dirac equation. By means of this theorem the operator is constructed which governs the hidden symmetry in relativistic Coulomb problem (Dirac equation). It is proved that this operator coincides with the familiar Johnson-Lippmann one and is intimately connected to the famous Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector. Our derivation is very simple and informative. It does not require a longtime and tedious calculations, as is offten underlined in most papers.

abstract: Quantum branching programs (quantum binary decision diagrams, respectively) are a convenient tool for examining quantum computations using only a logarithmic amount of space. Recently several types of restricted quantum branching programs have been considered, e. g. read--once quantum branching programs. This paper considers quantum ordered binary decision diagrams (QOBDDs) and answers the question: How does the computational power of QOBDDs increase, if we allow repeated tests. Additionally it is described how to synthesize QOBDDs according to Boolean operations.

A simple estimation of the detection efficiency required to close the detection loophole using this proof gives eta > 0.69. This efficiency is lower than that required for previous proposals.

abstract: We show that nonlinear response of a quantum oscillator displays antiresonant dips and resonant peaks with varying frequency of the driving field. The effect is a consequence of special symmetry and is related to resonant multiphoton mixing of several pairs of oscillator states at a time. We also discuss escape from a metastable state of forced vibrations. Two important examples show that the probability of escape via diffusion over quasienergy is larger than via dynamical tunneling provided the relaxation rate exceeds both of them. Diffusion dominates even for zero temperature, so that escape occurs via quantum rather than thermal activation. The effects can be studied using Josephson junctions and Josephson-junction based systems.

abstract: Lloyd has considered the ultimate limitations physics places on quantum computers. He concludes in particular that for an ``ultimate laptop'' (a computer of one liter of volume and one kilogram of mass) the maximum number of operations per second is bounded by $10^{51}$. The limit is derived considering ordinary quantum mechanics. Here we consider additional limits that are placed by quantum gravity ideas, namely the use of a relational notion of time and fundamental gravitational limits that exist on time measurements. We then particularize for the case of an ultimate laptop and show that the maximum number of operations is further constrained to $10^{47}$ per second.

abstract: The conditional shift in the evolution operator of a quantum walk generates entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom. This entanglement can be quantified by the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator (entropy of entanglement). In the long time limit, it converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. Exact expressions for the asymptotic (long-time) entanglement are obtained for (i) localized initial conditions and (ii) initial conditions in the position subspace spanned by the +1 and -1 position eigenstates.

abstract: We develop a theory of continuous decoupling with bounded controls from a geometric perspective. Continuous decoupling with bounded controls can accomplish the same decoupling effect as the bang-bang control while using realistic control resources and it is robust against systematic implementation errors. We show that the decoupling condition within this framework is equivalent to average out error vectors whose trajectories are determined by the control Hamiltonian. The decoupling pulses can be intuitively designed once the structure function of the corresponding SU(n) is known and is represented from the geometric perspective. Several examples are given to illustrate the basic idea. From the physical implementation point of view we argue that the efficiency of the decoupling is determined not by the order of the decoupling group but by the minimal time required to finish a decoupling cycle.

We probe the response of the system in this region by studying the spin dynamics after projective measurement of one local spin which leads to the appearance of the ``decoherence wave''. We investigate time-dependent spin correlation functions, the entanglement dynamics, and the fidelity of the quantum information transfer after the measurement.

abstract: We present an experimental implementation of the coined discrete time quantum walk on a square using a three qubit liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processor (QIP). Contrary to its classical counterpart, we observe complete interference after certain steps and a periodicity in the evolution. Complete state tomography has been performed for each of the eight steps making a full period. The results have extremely high fidelity with the expected states and show clearly the effects of quantum interference in the walk. We also show and discuss the importance of choosing a molecule with a natural Hamiltonian well suited to NMR QIP by implementing the same algorithm on a second molecule. Finally, we show experimentally that decoherence after each step makes the statistics of the quantum walk tend to that of the classical random walk.

abstract: We suggest an interpretation of quantum mechanics, inspired by the ideas of Aharonov et al. of a time-symmetric description of quantum theory. We show that a special final boundary condition for the Universe, may be consistently defined as to determine single classical-like measurement outcomes, thus solving the "measurement problem". No other deviation is made from standard quantum mechanics, and the resulting theory is deterministic (in a two-time sense) and local. Quantum mechanical probabilities are recovered in general, but are eliminated from the description of any single measurement. We call this the Two-time interpretation of quantum mechanics. We analyze ideal measurements, showing how the quantum superposition is, in effect, dynamically reduced to a single classical state via a "two-time decoherence" process. We discuss some philosophical aspects of the suggested interpretation. We also discuss weak measurements using the two-time formalism, and remark that in these measurement situations, special final boundary conditions for the Universe, might explain some unaccounted for phenomena.

abstract: Two-party one-way quantum communication has been extensively studied in the recent literature. We target the size of minimal information that is necessary for a feasible party to finish a given combinatorial task, such as distinction of instances, using one-way communication from another party. This type of complexity measure has been studied under various names: advice complexity, Kolmogorov complexity, distinguishing complexity, and instance complexity. We present a general framework focusing on underlying combinatorial takes to study these complexity measures using quantum information processing. We introduce the key notions of relative hardness and quantum advantage, which provide the foundations for task-based quantum minimal one-way information complexity theory.

abstract: We review the standard treatment of open quantum systems in relation to quantum entanglement, analyzing, in particular, the behaviour of bipartite systems immersed in a same environment. We first focus upon the notion of complete positivity, a physically motivated algebraic constraint on the quantum dynamics, in relation to quantum entanglement, i.e. the existence of statistical correlations which can not be accounted for by classical probability. We then study the entanglement power of heat baths versus their decohering properties, a topic of increasing importance in the framework of the fast developing fields of quantum information, communication and computation. The presentation is self contained and, through several examples, it offers a detailed survey of the physics and of the most relevant and used techniques relative to both quantum open system dynamics and quantum entanglement.

It is shown that the results are in good agreement with the ones obtained before.

This article will review some of our recent experimental and theoretical results on the interaction between single quantum dots and photonic crystal cavity fields, and on the integration of multiple photonic crystal devices into functional circuits for quantum information processing.

abstract: We propose a protocol that allows both the creation and distribution of entanglement, resulting in two distant parties (Alice and Bob) conclusively sharing a bipartite Bell State. The system considered is a graph of three-level objects ("qutrits") coupled by SU(3) exchange operators. The protocol begins with a third party (Charlie) encoding two lattice sites in unentangled states, and allowing unitary evolution under time. Alice and Bob perform a projective measurement on their respective qutrits at a given time, and obtain a maximally-entangled Bell state with a certain probablility. We also consider two further protocols, one based on simple repetition and the other based on successive measurements and conditional resetting, and show that the cumulative probability of creating a Bell state between Alice and Bob tends to unity.

The locations and the relative weights of the diffracted atomic wave packets are in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of Carsten Henkel et al. [1].

abstract: We consider the entanglement of orthogonal generalized Bernoulli states in two separate single-mode high-$Q$ cavities. The expectation values and the correlations of the electric field in the cavities are obtained. We then define, in each cavity, a dichotomic operator expressible in terms of the field states which can be, in principle, experimentally measured by a probe atom that ``reads'' the field. Using the quantum correlations of couples of these operators, we construct a Bell's inequality which is shown to be violated for a wide range of the degree of entanglement and which can be tested in a simple way. Thus the cavity fields directly show quantum non-local properties. A scheme is also sketched to generate entangled orthogonal generalized Bernoulli states in the two separate cavities.

abstract: Within leading-order perturbation theory, the Casimir-Polder potential of a ground-state atom placed within an arbitrary arrangement of dispersing and absorbing linear bodies can be expressed in terms of the polarizability of the atom and the scattering Green tensor of the body-assisted electromagnetic field. Based on a Born series of the Green tensor, a systematic expansion of the Casimir-Polder potential in powers of the susceptibilities of the bodies is presented. The Born expansion is used to show how and under which conditions the Casimir-Polder force can be related to microscopic many-atom van der Waals forces, for which general expressions are presented. As an application, the Casimir-Polder potentials of an atom near a dielectric ring and an inhomogeneous dielectric half space are studied and explicit expressions are presented that are valid up to second order in the susceptibility.

abstract: Using an atom interferometer, we have measured the static electric polarizability of $^7$Li $\alpha =(24.33 \pm 0.16)\times10^{-30} $ m$^3$ $= 164.19\pm 1.08 $ atomic units with a 0.66% uncertainty. Our experiment, which is similar to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and co-workers, consists in applying an electric field on one of the two interfering beams and measuring the resulting phase-shift. With respect to D. Pritchard's experiment, we have made several improvements which are described in detail in this paper: the capacitor design is such that the electric field can be calculated analytically; the phase sensitivity of our interferometer is substantially better, near 16 mrad/$\sqrt{Hz}$; finally our interferometer is species selective it so that impurities present in our atomic beam (other alkali atoms or lithium dimers) do not perturb our measurement. The extreme sensitivity of atom interferometry is well illustrated by our experiment: our measurement amounts to measuring a slight increase $\Delta v$ of the atom velocity $v$ when it enters the electric field region and our present sensitivity is sufficient to detect a variation $\Delta v/v \approx 6 \times 10^{-13}$.

abstract: The problem of geometric phase for an open quantum system is reinvestigated in a unifying approach. Two of existing methods to define geometric phase, one by Uhlmann's approach and the other by kinematic approach, which have been considered to be distinct, are shown to be related in this framework. The method is based upon purification of a density matrix by its uniform decomposition and a generalization of the parallel transport condition obtained from this decomposition. It is shown that the generalized parallel transport condition can be satisfied when Uhlmann's condition holds. However, it does not mean that all solutions of the generalized parallel transport condition are compatible with those of Uhlmann's one. It is also shown how to recover the earlier known definitions of geometric phase as well as how to generalize them when degeneracy exists and varies in time.

An explicit formula for the classical capacity $C_1$ and for the minimum output entropy $S_{min}$ of these channels is proposed. We compute $S_{min}$ analytically for any number of qubits under assumption that the minimum is achieved on a Gaussian input. Apart from that, a simple numerical method for evaluating $S_{min}$ is developed. The method is applicable to any channels that are sufficiently noisy. For fermionic product channels the proposed formula for $S_{min}$ agrees with the numerical results with a precision about $10^{-9}$.

abstract: We study controlled methods of preparing vortex configurations in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and their use in the studies of fundamental vortex scattering, reconnection processes and superfluid sound emission. We explore techniques of imprinting closed vortex rings by means of coherently driving internal atomic transitions with electromagnetic fields which exhibit singular phase profiles. In particular, we show that a vortex ring can be prepared in a controlled way by two focused co-propagating Gaussian laser beams. More complex vortex systems may also be imprinted by directly superposing simpler field configurations or by programming their phase profiles on optical holograms. This provides the controlled method of studying vortex reconnections in atomic superfluids. We analyze specific examples of two merging vortex rings in a trapped two-component Rb-87 condensate. We calculate the radiated sound energy in the vortex ring reconnection process and show that the vortex relaxation and the re-distribution of sound energy can be controlled by the imprinting process. The energy is first concentrated towards the trap center and later emitted outwards as sound and transformed to surface excitations. As another such technique, we study creating pairs of 2D point vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates using a 'light roadblock' in ultra-slow light propagation. We show how this can be used to study vortex collisions in compressible superfluids and how these collisions result in energy dissipation via phonons and, sometimes, annihilation of vortex pairs.

abstract: The proposed read-out configuration D+D- for the Kane Si:P architecture[Nature 393, 133 (1998)] depends on spin-dependent electron tunneling between donors, induced adiabatically by surface gates. However, previous work has shown that since the doubly occupied donor state is so shallow the dwell-time of the read-out state is less than the required time for measurement using a single electron transistor (SET). We propose and analyse single-spin read-out using optically induced spin to charge transduction, and show that the top gate biases, required for qubit selection, are significantly less than those demanded by the Kane scheme, thereby increasing the D+D- lifetime. Implications for singlet-triplet discrimination for electron spin qubits are also discussed.

abstract: Recent experiments by Hayashi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 226804 (2003)] demonstrate coherent oscillations of a charge quantum bit (qubit) in laterally defined quantum dots. We study the intrinsic electron-phonon decoherence and gate performance for the next step: a system of two coupled charge qubits. The effective decoherence model contains properties of local as well as collective decoherence. Decoherence channels can be classified by their multipole moments, which leads to different low-energy spectra. It is shown that due to the super-Ohmic spectrum, the gate quality is limited by the single-qubit Hadamard gates. It can be significantly improved, by using double-dots with weak tunnel coupling.

abstract: We present a real-space renormalization group approach for the corner Hamiltonian, which is relevant to the reduced density matrix in the density matrix renormalization group. A set of self-consistent equations that the renormalized Hamiltonian should satisfy in the thermodynamic limit is also derived from the fixed point of the recursion relation for the corner Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the renormalization group algorithm for the $S=1/2$ XXZ spin chain and show that the results are consistent with the exact solution. We further examine the renormalization group for the S=1 Heisenberg spin chain and then discuss the nature of the eigenvalue spectrum of the corner Hamiltonian for the non-integrable model.

abstract: Quantum dynamics of in-plane Josephson junctions between two d-wave superconducting films is described by the anisotropic XY-model where both, quasiparticle and Cooper pair tunneling terms, appear to be equally non-local. Applying a combination of the weak and strong coupling analyses to this model, we find a compelling evidence of a dissipative phase transition. The corresponding critical behavior is studied and contrasted with that found previously in the conventional (s-wave) Josephson junctions.

abstract: Silicon self-assembly at step edges in the initial stage of homoepitaxial growth on a vicinal Si(111) surface is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The resulting atomic structures change dramatically from a parallel array of 0.7 nm wide wires to one dimensionally aligned periodic clusters of the diameter ~ 2 nm and periodicity 2.7 nm in the very narrow range of growth temperatures between 400 and 300 C. These nanostructures are expected to play an important role in future development of silicon quantum computers. Mechanisms leading to such distinct structures are discussed.

abstract: After removing the double-well potential trapping two initially independent Bose condensates, the density expectation value is calculated when both the exchange symmetry of identical bosons and interatomic interaction are considered. After the overlapping, it is shown that there is a nonzero interference term in the density expectation value. This nonzero interference term physically arises from the exchange symmetry of identical bosons and interatomic interaction which make two initially independent condensates become coherent after the overlapping. It is found that the calculated density expectation value with this model agrees with the interference pattern observed in the experiment by Andrews et al (Science 275, 637 (1997)).

abstract: We study the ground state properties of the Bose-Hubbard model with attractive interactions on a M-site one-dimensional periodic -- necklace-like -- lattice, whose experimental realization in terms of ultracold atoms is promised by a recently proposed optical trapping scheme, as well as by the control over the atomic interactions and tunneling amplitudes granted by well-established optical techniques. We compare the properties of the quantum model to a semiclassical picture based on a number-conserving su(M) coherent state, which results into a set of modified discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equations. We show that, owing to the presence of a correction factor ensuing from number conservation, the ground-state solution to these equations provides a remarkably satisfactory description of its quantum counterpart not only -- as expected -- in the weak-interaction, superfluid regime, but even in the deeply quantum regime of large interactions and possibly small populations. In particular, we show that in this regime, the delocalized, Schroedinger-cat-like quantum ground state can be seen as a coherent quantum superposition of the localized, symmetry-breaking ground-state of the variational approach. We also show that, depending on the hopping to interaction ratio, three regimes can be recognized both in the semiclassical and quantum picture of the system.

abstract: Many-particle confinement (localization) is studied for a 1D system of spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor hopping and interaction, or equivalently, for an anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain. This system is frequently used to model quantum computers with perpetually coupled qubits. We construct a bounded sequence of site energies that leads to strong single-particle confinement of all states on individual sites. We show that this sequence also leads to a confinement of all many-particle states in an infinite system for a time that scales as a high power of the reciprocal hopping integral. The confinement is achieved for strong interaction between the particles while keeping the overall bandwidth of site energies comparatively small. The results show viability of quantum computing with time-independent qubit coupling.

abstract: We propose an experimentally realizable method to control the coupling between two flux qubits. In our proposal, the bias fluxes are always fixed for these two inductively-coupled qubits. The detuning of these two qubits can be initially chosen to be sufficiently large, so that their initial interbit coupling is almost negligible. When a time-dependent magnetic flux (TDMF) is applied to one of the qubits, a well-chosen frequency of the TDMF can be used to compensate the initial detuning and to couple two qubits. This proposed method avoids fast changes of either qubit frequencies or the amplitudes of the bias magnetic fluxes through the qubit loops, and also offers a remarkable way to implement any logic gate as well as tomographically measure flux qubit states.

The inclusion of cross-collisional effects significantly extends the validity of the two-mode model approach allowing it to be alternatively employed to explain the recently observed increase of tunneling rates due to nonlinear interactions.

abstract: We consider chains consisting of several identical subsystems weakly coupled by various types of next neighbor interactions. At both ends the chain is coupled to a respective heat bath with different temperature modeled by a Lindblad formalism. The temperature gradient introduced by this environment is then treated as an external perturbation. We propose a method to calculate the heat current and the local temperature profile of the resulting stationary state as well as the heat conductivity in such systems. This method is similar to Kubo techniques used e.g. for electrical transport but extended here to the Liouville space.

abstract: We present an analysis of the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting single electron transistor (SSET) in the vicinity of the Josephson quasiparticle (JQP) and double Josephson quasiparticle (DJQP) resonances. For weak coupling and wide separation of dynamical timescales, we find that for either superconducting resonance the dynamics of the resonator is given by a Fokker-Planck equation, i.e., the SSET behaves effectively as an equilibrium heat bath, characterised by an effective temperature, which also damps the resonator and renormalizes its frequency. Depending on the gate and drain-source voltage bias points with respect to the superconducting resonance, the SSET can also give rise to an instability in the mechanical resonator marked by negative damping and temperature within the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation. Furthermore, sufficiently close to a resonance, we find that the Fokker-Planck description breaks down. We also point out that there is a close analogy between coupling a nanomechanical resonator to a SSET in the vicinity of the JQP resonance and Doppler cooling of atoms by means of lasers.

Through measuring the probability of the persistent current state in flux qubits, one can detect the Berry phase that is acquired with system's Hamiltonian adiabatical circular evolution in the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that one should choose an appropriate amplitude of pulses in an experiment to obtain high readout resolution when detuning frequency of pulses is fixed and controlled phase shift gates can be implemented based on the geometric phases by inductance coupling two flux qubits.

abstract: Exchange coupled {\it spin} qubits in semiconductor nanostructures are shown to be vulnerable to dephasing caused by {\it charge noise} invariably present in the semiconductor environment. This decoherence of exchange gate by environmental charge fluctuations arises from the fundamental Coulombic nature of the Heisenberg coupling, and presents a serious challenge to the scalability of the widely studied exchange gate solid state spin quantum computer architectures. We estimate dephasing times for coupled spin qubits in a wide range (from 1 ns up to $> 1 \mu$s) depending on the exchange coupling strength and its sensitivity to charge fluctuations.

abstract: A theory governing the metric and matter fields in spacetime is {\it locally causal} if the probability distribution for the fields in any region is determined solely by physical data in the region's past, i.e. it is independent of events at space-like separated points. General relativity is manifestly locally causal, since the fields in a region are completely determined by physical data in its past. It is natural to ask whether other possible theories in which the fundamental description of space-time is classical and geometric -- for instance, hypothetical theories which stochastically couple a classical spacetime geometry to a quantum field theory of matter -- might also be locally causal. A quantum theory of gravity, on the other hand, should allow the creation of spacetimes which violate local causality at the macroscopic level. This paper describes an experiment to test the local causality of spacetime, and hence to test whether or not gravity behaves as quantum theories of gravity suggest, in this respect. The experiment will either produce direct evidence that the gravitational field is not locally causal, and thus weak confirmation of quantum gravity, or else identify a definite limit to the domain of validity of quantum theory.

abstract: In this paper we analyze the interaction of a uniformly accelerated detector with a quantum field in (3+1)D spacetime, aiming at the issue of how kinematics can render vacuum fluctuations the appearance of thermal radiance in the detector (Unruh effect) and how they engender flux of radiation for observers afar. Two basic questions are addressed in this study: a) How are vacuum fluctuations related to the emitted radiation? b) Is there emitted radiation with energy flux in the Unruh effect? We adopt a method which places the detector and the field on an equal footing and derive the two-point correlation functions of the detector and of the field separately with full account of their interplay. From the exact solutions, we are able to study the complete process from the initial transient to the final steady state, keeping track of all activities they engage in and the physical effects manifested. We derive a quantum radiation formula for a Minkowski observer. We find that there does exist a positive radiated power of quantum nature emitted by the detector, with a hint of certain features of the Unruh effect. We further verify that the total energy of the dressed detector and a part of the radiated energy from the detector is conserved. However, this part of the radiation ceases in steady state. So the hint of the Unruh effect in radiated power is actually not directly from the energy flux that the detector experiences in Unruh effect. Since all the relevant quantum and statistical information about the detector (atom) and the field can be obtained from the results presented here, they are expected to be useful, when appropriately generalized, for addressing issues of quantum information processing in atomic and optical systems, such as quantum decoherence, entanglement and teleportation.

We find our results are consistent with the one- and two-loop quantum computation. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations of the quantum theory and conclude that the classical scheme is able to produce more accurate results with a fraction of the CPU time.

abstract: Using an appropriatly formulated holographic lightfront projection, we derive an area law for the localization-entropy caused by vacuum polarization on the horizon of a wedge region. Its area density has a simple kinematic relation to the volume extensive heat bath entropy of the lightfront algebra. Apart from a change of parametrization the infinite lighlike length contribution to the lightfront volume factor corresponds to the short-distance divergence of the area density of the localization entropy. This correspondence is a consequence of the conformal invariance of the lightfront holography combined with the well-known fact that in conformality relates short to long distances. In the explicit calculation of the strength factor we use the temperature duality relation of rational chiral theories whose derivation will be briefly reviewed. We comment on the potential relevance for the understanding of Black hole entropy.

abstract: We discuss the relation of the Kerr-Newman spinning particle to the Dirac electron and show that the Dirac equation may naturally be incorporated into Kerr-Schild formalism as a master equation controlling the Kerr-Newman geometry. As a result, the Dirac electron acquires an extended space-time structure of the Kerr-Newman geometry - singular ring of the Compton size and twistorial polarization of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Behavior of this Dirac -- Kerr-Newman system in the weak and slowly changed electromagnetic fields is determined by the wave function of the Dirac equation, and is indistinguishable from the behavior of the Dirac electron. The wave function of the Dirac equation plays in this model the role of an ``order parameter'' which controls dynamics, spin-polarization and twistorial structure of space-time.

In $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory in 1+1 dimensions we find results, in particular for mass renormalization and the critical coupling for symmetry breaking, that are in agreement with their quantum counterparts. We then study the perturbative expansion of the $n$-point Green's functions and find a loop expansion very similar to that of quantum field theory. When compared to the usual Feynman rules, we find some differences associated with particular combinations of internal lines going on-shell simultaneously.

Analytical bound-states solutions are obtained when the scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared to the vector coupling.

abstract: It is known that the entanglement entropy of a scalar field, found by tracing over its degrees of freedom inside a sphere of radius ${\cal R}$, is proportional to the area of the sphere (and not its volume). This suggests that the origin of black hole entropy, also proportional to its horizon area, may lie in the entanglement between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the horizon. We examine this proposal carefully by including excited states, to check probable deviations from the area law.

abstract: In a recent paper Hawking has argued that there is no information loss in black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We remind that there are several types of information (entropy) in statistical physics -- fine grained (microscopic) and coarse grained (macroscopic) ones which behave differently under unitary evolution. We suggest that the coarse grained information of the rest of the Universe is lost while fine grained information is preserved. A possibility to develop in quantum gravity an analogue of the Bogoliubov derivation of the irreversible Boltzmann and Navier - Stokes equations from the reversible mechanical equations is discussed.

abstract: The black hole information loss paradox has plagued physicists since Hawking's discovery that black holes evaporate thermally in contradiction to the unitarity expected by quantum mechanics. Here we show that one of the central presumptions of the debate is incorrect. Ensuring that information not escape during the semi-classical evaporation process does not require that all the information remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation. Using recent results in quantum information theory, we find that the amount of information that must remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation can be very small, even though the amount already radiated away is negligible. Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small number of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it inaccessible. When this small number of locking quanta are finally emitted, the full information (and unitarity) is restored. Only if the number of initial states is restricted will the locking mechanism leak out information early.

abstract: This is the extended version of a talk presented at the J.W.Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt a. M. and at the same time a preview at a forthcoming extensive publication on the same subject. It is shown that there is a common background structure for quantum and classical observables. Moreover, a contextual generalization of the notion of quantum observable is proposed.

abstract: The zero-entropy-density conjecture states that the entropy density, defined as the limit of S(N)/N at infinity, vanishes for all translation-invariant pure states on the spin chain. Or equivalently, S(N), the von Neumann entropy of such a state restricted to N consecutive spins, is sublinear. In this paper it is proved that this conjecture cannot be sharpened, i.e., translation-invariant states give rise to arbitrary fast sublinear entropy growth. The proof is constructive, and is based on a class of states derived from quasifree states on a CAR algebra. The question whether the entropy growth of pure quasifree states can be arbitrary fast sublinear was first raised by Fannes et al. [J. Math. Phys. 44, 6005 (2003)]. In addition to the main theorem it is also shown that the entropy asymptotics of all pure shift-invariant nontrivial quasifree states is at least logarithmic.

abstract: Various problems concerning the geometry of the space $u^*(\cH)$ of Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space $\cH$ are addressed. In particular, we study the canonical Poisson and Riemann-Jordan tensors and the corresponding foliations into K\"ahler submanifolds. It is also shown that the space $\cD(\cH)$ of density states on an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\cH$ is naturally a manifold stratified space with the stratification induced by the the rank of the state. Thus the space $\cD^k(\cH)$ of rank-$k$ states, $k=1,...,n$, is a smooth manifold of (real) dimension $2nk-k^2-1$ and this stratification is maximal in the sense that every smooth curve in $\cD(\cH)$, viewed as a subset of the dual $u^*(\cH)$ to the Lie algebra of the unitary group $U(\cH)$, at every point must be tangent to the strata $\cD^k(\cH)$ it crosses. For a quantum composite system, i.e. for a Hilbert space decomposition $\cH=\cH^1\ot\cH^2$, an abstract criterion of entanglement is proved.

abstract: We consider symmetric powers of a graph. In particular, we show that the spectra of the symmetric square of strongly regular graphs with the same parameters are equal. We also provide some bounds on the spectra of the symmetric squares of more general graphs. The connection with generic exchange Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics is discussed in an appendix.

abstract: The motion of a single vortex is able to originate chaos in the quantum trajectories defined in Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this Letter, we show that this is also the case in the general situation, in which many interacting vortices exist. This result gives support to recent attempts in which Born's probability rule is derived in terms of an irreversible time evolution to equilibrium, rather than being postulated.

abstract: Dynamical localization is a localization phenomenon taking place, for example, in the quantum periodically-driven kicked rotor. It is due to subtle quantum destructive interferences and is thus of intrinsic quantum origin. It has been shown that deviation from strict periodicity in the driving rapidly destroys dynamical localization. We report experimental results showing that this destruction is partially reversible when the deterministic perturbation that destroyed it is slowly reversed. We also provide an explanation for the partial character of the reversibility.

Also, we have analyzed the effect of qubit parameter deviations and studied the quantum feedback control of an energy-asymmetric qubit.
