**1.    Distributed quantum information processing with minimal local resources**  
Earl T. Campbell  
Phys. Rev. A (Rapid Comm) 76, 040302(R) (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1464  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way quantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly imperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits, requiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli error, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce local resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of purification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a biased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more rapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented of how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a single Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\sim 10$ times the imperfection in local operations.

**2.    Probabilit��s et fluctuations quantiques (Probabilities and quantum fluctuations)**  
Michel Fliess  
Comptes rendus de l'acad\'emie des sciences, Math\'ematiques 344 (2007) 663-668  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2019  
<blockquote>
<p>
This note is sketching a simple and natural mathematical construction for explaining the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. It employs nonstandard analysis and is based on Feynman's interpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, i.e., of the quantum fluctuations, which was brought to the forefront in some fractal approaches. It results, as in Nelson's stochastic mechanics, in stochastic differential equations which are deduced from infinitesimal random walks. An extended english abstract gives most of the details.

**3.    Investigation of continuous-time quantum walks via spectral analysis and Laplace transform**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, R. Sufiani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2602  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a given graph is investigated by using the techniques of the spectral analysis and inverse Laplace transform of the Stieltjes function (Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution) associated with the graph. It is shown that, the probability amplitude of observing the CTQW at a given site at time $t$ is related to the inverse Laplace transformation of the Stieltjes function, namely, one can calculate the probability amplitudes only by taking the inverse laplace transform of the function $iG_{\mu}(is)$, where $G_{\mu}(x)$ is the Stieltjes function of the graph. The preference of this procedure is that, there is no any need to know the spectrum of the graph

**4.    Quantum Parrondo's game with random strategies**  
J. Kosik, J. A. Miszczak, V. Buzek  
J. Mod. Optics, Vol. 54, 13 (2007), pp. 2275 - 2287  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2937  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum implementation of Parrondo's game with randomly switched strategies using 1) a quantum walk as a source of ``randomness'' and 2) a completely positive (CP) map as a randomized evolution. The game exhibits the same paradox as in the classical setting where a combination of two losing strategies might result in a winning strategy. We show that the CP-map scheme leads to significantly lower net gain than the quantum walk scheme.

**5.    The effect of dissipation on quantum transmission resonance**  
Kohkichi Konno, Munehiro Nishida, Satoshi Tanda, Noriyuki Hatakenaka  
Physics Letters A 368 (2007) 442-449  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3300  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum transmissions of a free particle passing through a rectangular potential barrier with dissipation are studied using a path decomposition technique. Dissipative processes strongly suppress the transmission probability at resonance just above the barrier resulting in an unexpected reduction of the mean traversal time through the potential barrier.

**6.    A nearly optimal discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating NAND formulas**  
Andris Ambainis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3628  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an O(\sqrt{N}) discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating balanced binary NAND formulas and an O(N^{1/2}+O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log N}})}) discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating arbitrary binary NAND formulas.
