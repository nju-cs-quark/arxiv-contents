**1.    Two-Site Quantum Random Walk**  
Stan Gudder, Rafael D. Sorkin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0705  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the measure theory of a two-site quantum random walk. The truncated decoherence functional defines a quantum measure $\mu_n$ on the space of $n$-paths, and the $\mu_n$ in turn induce a quantum measure $\mu$ on the cylinder sets within the space $\Omega$ of untruncated paths. Although $\mu$ cannot be extended to a continuous quantum measure on the full $\sigma$-algebra generated by the cylinder sets, an important question is whether it can be extended to sufficiently many physically relevant subsets of $\Omega$ in a systematic way. We begin an investigation of this problem by showing that $\mu$ can be extended to a quantum measure on a "quadratic algebra" of subsets of $\Omega$ that properly contains the cylinder sets. We also present a new characterization of the quantum integral on the $n$-path space.

**2.    Bound Molecules in an Interacting Quantum Walk**  
Andre Ahlbrecht, Andrea Alberti, Dieter Meschede, Volkher B. Scholz, Albert H. Werner, Reinhard F. Werner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1051  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a system of two atoms in an optical lattice, performing a quantum walk by state-dependent shift operations and a coin operation acting on the internal states. The atoms interact, e.g., by cold collisions, whenever they are in the same potential well of the lattice. Under such conditions they typically develop a bound state, so that the two atoms effectively perform a quantum walk together, rarely moving further from each other than a few lattice sites. The theoretical analysis is based on a theory of quantum walks with a point defect, applied to the difference variable. We also discuss the feasibility of an experimental realization in existing quantum walk experiments.

**3.    Quantum Simulation of Phylogenetic Trees**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Peter Jarvis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1582  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum simulations constructing probability tensors of biological multi-taxa in phylogenetic trees are proposed, in terms of positive trace preserving maps, describing evolving systems of quantum walks with multiple walkers. Basic phylogenetic models applying on trees of various topologies are simulated following appropriate decoherent quantum circuits. Quantum simulations of statistical inference for aligned sequences of biological characters are provided in terms of a quantum pruning map operating on likelihood operator observables, utilizing state-observable duality and measurement theory.

**4.    Quantum Walk of Two Interacting Bosons**  
Yoav Lahini, Mor Verbin, Sebastian D. Huber, Yaron Bromberg, Rami Pugatch, Yaron Silberberg  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2273  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of interactions on the bosonic two-particle quantum walk and its corresponding spatial correlations. The combined effect of interactions and Hanbury-Brown Twiss interference results in unique spatial correlations which depend on the strength of the interaction, but not on its sign. The results are explained in light of the two-particle spectrum and the physics of attractively and repulsively bound pairs. We experimentally measure the weak interaction limit of these effects in nonlinear photonic lattices. Finally, we discuss an experimental approach to observe the strong interaction limit using single atoms in optical lattices.

**5.    Span Programs for Functions with Constant-Sized 1-certificates**  
Aleksandrs Belovs  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4024  
<blockquote>
<p>
Besides the Hidden Subgroup Problem, the second large class of quantum speed-ups is for functions with constant-sized 1-certificates. This includes the OR function, solvable by the Grover algorithm, the distinctness, the triangle and other problems. The usual way to solve them is by quantum walk on the Johnson graph. We propose a solution for the same problems using span programs. The span program is a computational model equivalent to the quantum query algorithm in its strength, and yet very different in its outfit. We prove the power of our approach by designing a quantum algorithm for the triangle problem with query complexity $O(n^{35/27})$ that is better than $O(n^{13/10})$ of the best previously known algorithm by Magniez et al.

**6.    A measure of tripartite entanglement in bosonic and fermionic systems**  
Fabrizio Buscemi, Paolo Bordone  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 022303 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4061  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe an efficient theoretical criterion suitable for the evaluation of the tripartite entanglement of any mixed three-boson or -fermion state, based on the notion of the entanglement of particles for bipartite systems of identical particles. Our approach allows one to quantify the accessible amount of quantum correlations in the systems without any violation of the local particle number superselection rule. A generalization of the tripartite negativity is here applied to some correlated systems including the continuous-time quantum walks of identical particles (both for bosons and fermions) and compared with other criteria recently proposed in the literature. Our results show the dependence of the entanglement dynamics upon the quantum statistics: the bosonic bunching results into a low amount of quantum correlations while Fermi-Dirac statistics allows for higher values of the entanglement.

**7.    M-Particle Quantum Walks with Delta-Interaction**  
Clement Ampadu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6076  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider directional correlations between M-particles on a line. For non-interacting particles we find analytic asymptotic expressions. When delta-interaction is introduced in the model we study the Fourier analysis and obtain general analytic formula for the wave function of the walk in the case M is 2 for the transformation C-delta, which can be considered an unfactorized version of the Hadamard walk in two-dimensions.

**8.    Observation of topologically protected bound states in a one dimensional photonic system**

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most striking features of quantum mechanics is the appearance of phases of matter with topological origins. These phases result in remarkably robust macroscopic phenomena such as the edge modes in integer quantum Hall systems, the gapless surface states of topological insulators, and elementary excitations with non-abelian statistics in fractional quantum Hall systems and topological superconductors. Many of these states hold promise in the applications to quantum memories and quantum computation. Artificial quantum systems, with their precise controllability, provide a versatile platform for creating and probing a wide variety of topological phases. Here we investigate topological phenomena in one dimension, using photonic quantum walks. The photon evolution simulates the dynamics of topological phases which have been predicted to arise in, for example, polyacetylene. We experimentally confirm the long-standing prediction of topologically protected localized states associated with these phases by directly imaging their wavefunctions. Moreover, we reveal an entirely new topological phenomenon: the existence of a topologically protected pair of bound states which is unique to periodically driven systems. Our experiment demonstrates a powerful new approach for controlling topological properties of quantum systems through periodic driving.
