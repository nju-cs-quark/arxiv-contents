abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are an elusive discrete structure in Hilbert spaces. Many (complete sets of) MUB are group covariant, but little is known whether they can be sharply covariant in the sense that the generating groups can have order equal to the total number of basis states, that is, $d(d+1)$ for MUB in dimension $d$. Sharply covariant MUB, if they exist, would be most appealing from both theoretical and practical point of view. Since stabilizer MUB subsume almost all MUB that have ever been constructed, it is of fundamental interest to single out those candidates that are sharply covariant. We show that, quite surprisingly, only two stabilizer MUB are sharply covariant, and the conclusion still holds even if antiunitary transformations are taken into account. Our study provides valuable insight on the symmetry of stabilizer MUB, which may have implications for a number of research topics in quantum information and foundations. In addition, it exposes a sharp contrast between MUB and another elusive discrete structure known as symmetric informationally complete measurements (SICs), all known examples of which are sharply covariant.

abstract: A pulse of matter waves may dramatically change its shape when traversing an absorbing barrier with time-dependent transparency. Here we show that this effect can be utilized for controlled manipulation of spatially-localized quantum states. In particular, in the context of atom-optics experiments, we explicitly demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to generate spatially shifted, split, squeezed and cooled atomic wave packets. We expect our work to be useful in devising new interference experiments with atoms and molecules and, more generally, to enable new ways of coherent control of matter waves.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality is discussed as an aspect of the quantum formalism that is seriously in need of interpretation. The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which describes quantum processes as transactional "handshakes" between retarded $\psi$ waves and advanced $\psi*$ waves, is discussed. Examples of the use of the Transactional Interpretation in resolving quantum paradoxes and in understanding the counter-intuitive aspects of the formalism, particularly quantum nonlocality, are provided.

abstract: Homonuclear correlation spectroscopy has played a crucial role in elucidating structure of molecules in solution. In all kinds of homonuclear correlation, the most intense peaks appear in the diagonal, and quite often due to its broad dispersive tails obscure the useful cross peaks close to the diagonal. Herein, we demonstrate that by editing the 1H magnetization by a C-13 nucleus in natural abundance before starting the t1 evolution, it is possible to discriminate the inphase 1H magnetizations that leads to the diagonal peaks from the antiphase 1H magnetizations that generates the cross peaks. The 1H magnetization is edited by a C-13 nucleus in natural abundance before starting the t1 period in COSY. After the coherence transfer, the inphase transverse magnetization directly attached to C-13 evolves under one bond heteronuclear coupling for a time period 2{\tau} tuned to one bond heteronuclear coupling while the antiphase transeverse magnetization directly attached to remote C-12 evolves under negligible long range heteronuclear couplings. As a result the inphase magnetization can be eliminated as an unobservable heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence leading to a diagonal free correlated spectrum. The method is demonstrated for COSY.

abstract: In wavelet based electron structure calculations introducing a new, finer resolution level is usually an expensive task, this is why often a two-level approximation is used with very fine starting resolution level. This process results in large matrices to calculate with and a large number of coefficients to be stored. In our previous work we have developed an adaptively refining solution scheme that determines the indices, where refined basis functions are to be included, and later a method for predicting the next, finer resolution coefficients in a very economic way. In the present contribution we would like to determine, whether the method can be applied for predicting not only the first, but also the other, higher resolution level coefficients. Also the energy expectation values of the predicted wave functions are studied, as well as the scaling behaviour of the coefficients in the fine resolution limit.

abstract: The potential of computing based on quantum mechanics has triggered a quest for a scalable quantum bit or qubit technology with local control and long coherence lifetimes. In silicon, which is preferred as a platform due to the maturity of its technology both the on nano- and wafer-scale, nuclear spins of ionized donors show very promising storage times, but due to their weak interactions are challenging to manipulate locally. We demonstrate a mechanism to address arsenic donors in Si by mechanical tuning via the quadrupole interaction allowing for local qubit operations and show that the negative effects on the coherence lifetime can be removed by dynamical decoupling. This will enable local quantum operations which are essential for processing and error correction in a quantum memory.

abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are defects in diamonds, which, due to their electronic structure, have been extensively studied as magnetic field sensors. Such field detection applications usually employ the NV centers to detect field components aligned with the direction of the internally-defined spin axis of the NV center. In this work we detect magnetic fields not only aligned with the NV axis but making an angle $\theta$ with it. This detection scheme clearly shows that NV centers can be used as $\theta^2$ sensors. We further demonstrate that the sensitivity of this sensor increases very rapidly with increasing magnetic field, diverging as the external field approaches a value pre-defined by NV center's internal parameters. We show the sensitivity of this $\theta^2$ sensor matches up perfectly with the theoretical predictions of the same, made in one of our previous works~\cite{Durso11}. These results show that NV centers can be excellent for making quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements on systems such as a harmonic oscillator, to probe the oscillators quantum behavior.

abstract: Quantum illumination is a quantum-optical sensing technique in which an entangled source is exploited to improve the detection of a low-reflectivity object that is immersed in a bright thermal background. Here we describe and analyze a system for applying this technique at microwave frequencies, a more appropriate spectral region for target detection than the optical, due to the naturally-occurring bright thermal background in the microwave regime. We use an electro-optomechanical converter to entangle microwave signal and optical idler fields, with the former being sent to probe the target region and the latter being retained at the source. The microwave radiation collected from the target region is then phase conjugated and upconverted into an optical field that is combined with the retained idler in a joint-detection quantum measurement. The error probability of this microwave quantum-illumination system, or quantum radar, is shown to be superior to that of any classical microwave radar of equal transmitted energy.

abstract: Universal quantum computation on a space consisting of superpositions of $d$ well-separated coherent states can be achieved by two families of adiabatic holonomic gates. The first gate consists of moving a coherent state around a closed path in phase space, resulting in a relative Berry phase between that state and the other states. The second gate consists of colliding two coherent states, resulting in coherent population transfer between them. Such gates should be realizable via reservoir engineering of systems which support tunable nonlinearities, such as trapped ions and circuit QED.

abstract: We present a systematic entanglement concentration protocol (ECP) for an arbitrary unknown less-entangled three-photon W state, resorting to the optical property of the quantum-dot spins inside one-sided optical microcavities. In our ECP, the parties obtain not only some three-photon systems in the partially entangled with two unknown parameters when one of the parties picks up the robust odd-parity instance with the parity-check gate (PCG) on his two photons, but also some entangled two-photon systems by keeping the even-parity instance in the first step. By exploiting the above three-photon and two-photon systems with the same parameters as the resource for the second step of our ECP, the parties can obtain a standard three-photon W state by keeping the robust odd-parity instance. Meanwhile, the systems in the even-parity instance can be used as the resource in the next round of our ECP. The success probability of our ECP is largely increased by iteration of the ECP process. As it does require that all the coefficients are known for the parties, our ECP maybe have good applications in quantum communication network in future.

abstract: We present some compact quantum circuits for a deterministic quantum computing on electron-spin qubits assisted by quantum dots inside single-side optical microcavities, including the CNOT, Toffoli, and Fredkin gates. They are constructed by exploiting the giant optical Faraday rotation induced by a single-electron spin in a quantum dot inside a single-side optical microcavity as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Our universal quantum gates have some advantages. First, all the gates are accomplished with a success probability of 100% in principle. Second, our schemes require no additional electron-spin qubits and they are achieved by some input-output processes of a single photon. Third, our circuits for these gates are simple and economic. Moreover, our devices for these gates work in both the weak coupling and the strong coupling regimes, and they are feasible in experiment.

title: Is Bohmian Mechanics an empirically adequate theory?

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Bohmian mechanics (BM) draws a picture of nature, which is completely different from that drawn by standard quantum mechanics (SQM): Particles are at any time at a definite position, and the universe evolves deterministically. Astonishingly, according to a proof by Bohm the empirical predictions of these two very different theories coincide. From the very beginning, BM has faced all kinds of criticism, most of which are either technical or philosophical. There is, however, a criticism first raised by Correggi and Morchio (2002) and recently strengthened by Kiukas and Werner (2010), which holds that, in spite of Bohm's proof, the predictions of BM do not agree with those of SQM in the case of local position measurements on entangled particles in a stationary state. Hence, given that SQM has been proven to be tremendously successful in the past, BM could most likely not be considered an empirically adequate theory. My aim is to resolve the conflict by showing that 1) it relies on hidden differences in the conceptual thinking, and that 2) the predictions of both theories approximately coincide if the process of measurement is adequately accounted for. My analysis makes no use of any sort of wavefunction collapse, refuting a widespread belief that an "effective collapse" is needed to reconcile BM with the predictions of SQM.

abstract: Circulators and directional amplifiers are crucial signal routing and processing components that are required in order to achieve quantum-limited readout in a variety of applications. Current parametric amplifiers, such as the Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC), which are regularly used for nearly-quantum limited amplification and photon conversion, lack directionality and can only be operated with the aid of external circulators. However, as recently proposed theoretically, by establishing simultaneous pairwise conversion and/or gain processes between the three modes of a single JPC, we can achieve either a phase-preserving directional amplifier or a circulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such a directional amplifier, with noise performance comparable with the standard non-directional JPC implementation. Further, we demonstrate the first experimental implementation of a reversible Josephson circulator. Our device is far simpler in both modes of operation than previous proposals and implementations, requiring only three microwave pumps. It offers the advantage of flexibility, as it can dynamically switch between modes of operation as its pump conditions are changed. Thus, this methodology has excellent prospects for on-chip integration and the construction of complex signal routing systems.

abstract: We analyze an optomechanical system that can be used to efficiently transfer a quantum state between an optical cavity and a distant mechanical oscillator coupled to a second optical cavity. We show that for a moderate mechanical Q-factor it is possible to achieve a transfer efficiency of $99.4\%$ by using adjustable cavity damping rates and destructive interference. We also show that the quantum mechanical oscillator can be used as a quantum memory device with an efficiency of $96\%$ employing a pulsed optomechanical coupling. Although the mechanical dissipation slightly decreases the efficiency, its effect can be significantly reduced by designing a high-Q mechanical oscillator.

abstract: Recently Gouy rotation was observed with focused non-relativistic electron vortex beams. If the electrons in vortex beams are very fast we have to take into account relativistic effects to completely describe the Gouy phase on them. Exact Hermite-Gaussian solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for particle beams are obtained here that make explicit the 4-position of the focal point of the beam. These are Bateman-Hillion solutions with modified phase factors to take into account the rest mass of the particles. They enable a relativistic expression for the Gouy phase to be determined. It is in fact shown all the solutions are form invariant under Lorentz transformations. It is further shown for the exact solutions to correspond to those of the Schr\"odinger equation the relative time between the focal point and any point in the beam must be constrained to be a specific function of the relative spatial coordinates.

abstract: Various schemes have been proposed to overcome the drawback of the decoherence on quantum-enhanced parameter estimation. Here we suggest an alternative method, quantum feedback, to enhance the parameter precision of optimal quantum estimation of a dissipative qubit by investigating its dynamics of quantum Fisher information. We find that compared with the case without feedback, the quantum Fisher information of the dissipative qubit in the case of feedback has a large maximum value in time evolution and a smaller decay rate in the long time.

abstract: Quantum mechanics is among the most important and successful mathematical model for describing our physical reality. The traditional formulation of quantum mechanics is linear and algebraic. In contrast classical mechanics is a geometrical and non-linear theory defined on a symplectic geometry. However, after invention of general relativity, we are convinced that geometry is physical and affect us in all scale. Hence the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics sought to give a unified picture of physical systems based on its underling geometrical structures, e.g., now, the states are represented by points of a symplectic manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric, the observable are real-valued functions on the manifold, and quantum evolution is governed by the symplectic flow that is generated by a Hamiltonian function. In this work we will give a compact introduction to main ideas of geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. We will provide the reader with the details of geometrical structures of both pure and mixed quantum states. We will also discuss and review some important applications of geometric quantum mechanics.

abstract: In quantum mechanics, the variance-based Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations are a series of mathematical inequalities posing the fundamental limits on the achievable accuracy of the state preparations. In contrast, we construct and formulate two quantum uncertainty equalities, which hold for all pairs of incompatible observables and indicate the new uncertainty relations recently introduced by L. Maccone and A. K. Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 260401 (2014)]. Furthermore, we present an explicit interpretation lying behind the derivations and relate these relations to the so-called intelligent states. As an illustration, we investigate the properties of these uncertainty inequalities in the qubit system and a state-independent bound is obtained for the sum of variances. Finally, we apply these inequalities to the spin squeezing scenario and its implication in interferometric sensitivity is also discussed.

We focus on the most significant classical and nonclassical states, such as Glauber coherent, thermal, photon number, and squeezed states. We show that majorization provides a more complete analysis that in some relevant situations contradicts the predictions of variance.

abstract: We report the measurement of the inhomogeneous linewidth, homogeneous linewidth and spin state lifetime of Pr3+ ions in a novel waveguide architecture. The TeO2 slab waveguide deposited on a bulk Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal allows the 3H4 - 1D2 transition of Pr3+ ions to be probed by the optical evanescent field that extends into the substrate. The 2 GHz inhomogeneous linewidth, the optical coherence time of 70 +- 5 us, and the spin state lifetime of 9.8 +- 0.3 s indicate that the properties of ions interacting with the waveguide mode are consistent with those of bulk ions. This result establishes the foundation for large, integrated and high performance rare-earth-ion quantum systems based on a waveguide platform.

abstract: Quantum walks are roughly analogous to classical random walks, and like classical walks they have been used to find new (quantum) algorithms. When studying the behavior of large graphs or combinations of graphs it is useful to find the response of a subgraph to signals of different frequencies. In so doing we can replace an entire subgraph with a single vertex with frequency dependent scattering coefficients. In this paper a simple technique for quickly finding the scattering coefficients of any quantum graph will be presented. These scattering coefficients can be expressed entirely in terms of the characteristic polynomial of the graph's time step operator. Moreover, with these in hand we can easily derive the "impulse response" which is the key to predicting the response of a graph to any signal. This gives us a powerful set of tools for rapidly understanding the behavior of graphs or for reducing a large graph into its constituent subgraphs regardless of how they are connected.

abstract: The possibility to generate and manipulate non-classical light using the tools of mature semiconductor technology carries great promise for the implementation of quantum communication science. This is indeed one of the main driving forces behind ongoing research on the study of semiconductor quantum dots. Often referred to as artificial atoms, quantum dots can generate single and entangled photons on demand and, unlike their natural counterpart, can be easily integrated into well-established optoelectronic devices. However, the inherent random nature of the quantum dot growth processes results in a lack of control of their emission properties. This represents a major roadblock towards the exploitation of these quantum emitters in the foreseen applications. This chapter describes a novel class of quantum dot devices that uses the combined action of strain and electric fields to reshape the emission properties of single quantum dots. The resulting electro-elastic fields allow for control of emission and binding energies, charge states, and energy level splittings and are suitable to correct for the quantum dot structural asymmetries that usually prevent these semiconductor nanostructures from emitting polarization-entangled photons. Key experiments in this field are presented and future directions are discussed.

abstract: We consider the problem of implementing mutually unbiased bases (MUB) for a polarization qubit with only one wave plate, the minimum number of wave plates. We show that one wave plate is sufficient to realize two MUB as long as its phase shift (modulo $360^\circ$) ranges between $45^\circ$ and $315^\circ$. {It can realize} three MUB (a complete set of MUB for a qubit) if the phase shift of the wave plate is within $[111.5^\circ, 141.7^\circ]$ or its symmetric range with respect to 180$^\circ$. The systematic error of the realized MUB using a third-wave plate (TWP) with $120^\circ$ phase is calculated to be a half of that using the combination of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a half-wave plate (HWP). As experimental applications, TWPs are used in single-qubit and two-qubit quantum state tomography experiments and the results show a systematic error reduction by $50\%$. This technique not only saves one wave plate but also reduces the systematic error, which can be applied to quantum state tomography and other applications involving MUB. The proposed TWP may become a useful instrument in optical experiments, replacing multiple elements like QWP and HWP.

abstract: Systematic errors are inevitable in most measurements performed in real life because of imperfect measurement devices. Reducing systematic errors is crucial to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of measurement results. To this end, delicate error-compensation design is often necessary in addition to device calibration to reduce the dependence of the systematic error on the imperfection of the devices. The art of error-compensation design is well appreciated in nuclear magnetic resonance system by using composite pulses. In contrast, there are few works on reducing systematic errors in quantum optical systems. Here we propose an error-compensation design to reduce the systematic error in projective measurements on a polarization qubit. It can reduce the systematic error to the second order of the phase errors of both the half-wave plate (HWP) and the quarter-wave plate (QWP) as well as the angle error of the HWP. This technique is then applied to experiments on quantum state tomography on polarization qubits, leading to a 20-fold reduction in the systematic error. Our study may find applications in high-precision tasks in polarization optics and quantum optics.

abstract: The precision limit in quantum state tomography is of great interest not only to practical applications but also to foundational studies. However, little is known about this subject in the multiparameter setting even theoretically due to the subtle information tradeoff among incompatible observables. In the case of a qubit, the theoretic precision limit was determined by Hayashi as well as Gill and Massar, but attaining the precision limit in experiments has remained a challenging task. Here we report the first experimental verification of this precision limit in adaptive quantum state tomography on optical polarization qubits. The two-step adaptive strategy employed in our experiment is very easy to implement in practice. Yet it is surprisingly powerful in optimizing most figures of merit of practical interest. Our study may have significant implications for multiparameter quantum estimation problems, such as quantum metrology. Meanwhile, it may promote our understanding about the complementarity principle and uncertainty relations from the information theoretic perspective.

The proof that the optimization of such correlation measure is a NP-problem is based on an operational perspective involving a Turing machine, which follows a general algorithm. The implications for the computability of the so called {\it nonlocality} for any number of qubits is similar to recent results involving entanglement or similar quantum correlation-based measures.

abstract: We consider quantum fidelity between two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, where we fix $\rho$ and allow $\sigma$ to be sent through a quantum channel. We determine the minimal fidelity where one minimizes over (a) all unital channels, (b) all mixed unitary channels, and (c) arbitrary channels. We derive results involving the minimal eigenvalue of $\rho$, which we can interpret as a convex combination coefficient. As a consequence, we give a new geometric interpretation of the minimal fidelity with respect to the closed, convex set of density matrices and with respect to the closed, convex set of quantum channels. We further investigate the geometric nature of fidelity by considering density matrices arising as normalized projections onto subspaces; in this way, fidelity can be viewed as a geometric measure of distance between two spaces. We give a connection between fidelity and the canonical (principal) angles between the subspaces.

abstract: In this chapter we review the use of semiconductor quantum dots as sources of quantum light. Principally, we focus on resonant two-photon excitation, which is a method that allows for on-demand generation of photon pairs. We explore the advantages of resonant excitation and present a number of measurements that were made in this excitation regime. In particular, we cover the following topics: photon statistics, coherent manipulation of the ground-excited state superposition, and generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs.

abstract: Recently, Maccone and Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 260401 (2014)] derived few inequalities among variances of incompatible operators which they called stronger uncertainty relations, stronger than Heisenberg-Robertson or Schrodinger uncertainty relations. Here we generalize their study to get infinite number of such inequalities and propose that only one of them may be the correct uncertainty relation between incompatible operators. We get back well known uncertainty relations of Heisenberg-Robertson and Schrodinger under certain limits. We also reexamine the conclusions of Maccone and Pati and comment on their work.

abstract: As a qubit usually has a limited lifetime, its manipulation should be as fast as possible, and thus non-adiabatic operation is more preferable. Moreover, as a qubit inevitably interacts with its surrounding environment, robust operations are of great significance. Here, we propose a scheme for quantum manipulation of the polariton qubit in circuit QED using non-adiabatic holonomy, which is inherently fast and robust. In particularly, the polariton qubit is shown to be robust against arbitrary low-frequency noise due to its near symmetric spectrum, which can also be convenient manipulated by external microwave driven fields in a holonomic way. Therefore, our scheme presents a promising way of manipulating polariton qubits for on-chip solid-state quantum computation.

abstract: We study the scattering problem of photon and polariton in one-dimensional coupled-cavity system. Analytical approximate analysis and numerical simulation show that a photon can stimulate the photon emission from a polariton through polariton-photon collisions. This observation opens the possibility for the amplification photons, i.e., a field radiation can stimulate the transition from insulating to radiative phase of a coupled-cavity QED system. We also find that a single-photon transmission through a quantum switch is affected significantly by a polariton at the switch. Inversely, a polariton can be generated by two colliding single photons by the aid of atom-cavity interaction.

abstract: Quantum secure direct communication can effectively save the computing resource and improve the communication rate. In this paper, we present a coding scheme based on the single-photons modulation which can perform the two-way protocol for quantum secure direct communication with the presence of channel loss and noise. To the modified two-way protocol, the information bits can only be extracted from a batch of qubits, therefore, the leakage of a few qubits would not cause the leakage of information bits. The security condition, the information bit rate and the security communication distance are discussed.

abstract: We investigate the arrival statistics of Stokes (S) and anti-Stokes (aS) Raman photons generated in diamond membranes. Strong quantum correlations between the S and aS signals are observed, which implies that the two processes share the same phonon, that is, the phonon excited by the S process is consumed in the aS process. We show that the intensity cross-correlation $g_{\rm S,aS}^{(2)}(0)$, which describes the simultaneous detection of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons, decreases steadily with laser power as $1/{\rm P_L}$. Contrary to many other material systems, diamond exhibits a maximum $g_{\rm S,aS}^{(2)}(0)$ at very low pump powers, implying that the Stokes-induced aS photons outnumber the thermally generated aS photons. On the other hand, the coincidence rate shows a quadratic plus cubic power dependence, which indicates a departure from the Stokes-induced anti-Stokes process.

abstract: We investigate quantum tomography in scenarios where prior information restricts the state space to a smooth manifold of lower dimensionality. By considering stability we provide a general framework that relates the topology of the manifold to the minimal number of binary measurement settings that is necessary to discriminate any two states on the manifold. We apply these findings to cases where the manifold under consideration is given by states with bounded rank, fixed spectrum, given unitary symmetry or taken from a unitary orbit. For all these cases we provide both upper and lower bounds on the minimal dimension of Euclidean spaces that admit smooth embeddings of the manifolds.

abstract: In this paper we present the new method for entanglement witnesses construction. We show that to construct such object we can deal with maps which are not positive on whole domain, but only on certain sub-domain. In our approach crucial role play such maps which are surjective between sets $\mathcal{P}_{k}^d$ of $k \leq d$ rank projectors and the set $\mathcal{P}_1^d$ of rank one projectors acting in the $d$ dimensional space. In second part of this paper we show that inverse reduction map satisfies this requirement and using it we can obtain bunch of new entanglement witnesses.

abstract: Quantum mechanics and the theory of gravity are presently not compatible. A particular question is whether gravity causes decoherence - an unavoidable source of noise. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been proposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. In parallel, several experiments have been proposed to test some of these models, where the data obtained by such experiments is analyzed assuming quantum mechanics. Since we may need to modify quantum mechanics to account for gravity, however, one may question the validity of using quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to draw conclusions from experiments concerning gravity. Here we propose an experiment to estimate gravitational decoherence whose conclusions hold even if quantum mechanics would need to be modified. We first establish a general information-theoretic notion of decoherence which reduces to the standard measure within quantum mechanics. Second, drawing on ideas from quantum information, we propose a very general experiment that allows us to obtain a quantitative estimate of decoherence of any physical process for any physical theory satisfying only very mild conditions.Finally, we propose a concrete experiment using optomechanics to estimate gravitational decoherence in any such theory, including quantum mechanics as a special case. Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature could similarly be established from experimental observations alone - that is, without already having a rather well formed theory of nature like quantum mechanics to make sense of experimental data.

abstract: The representation of a quantum system as the spatial configuration of its constituents evolving in time as a trajectory under the action of the wave-function, is the main objective of the Bohm theory. However, its standard formulation is referred to the statistical ensemble of its possible trajectories. The statistical ensemble is introduced in order to establish the exact correspondence (the Born's rule) between the probability density on the spatial configurations and the quantum distribution, that is the squared modulus of the wave-function. In this work we explore the possibility of using the pilot wave theory at the level of a single Bohm's trajectory. The pilot wave theory allows a formally self-consistent representation of quantum systems as a single Bohm's trajectory, but in this case there is no room for the Born's rule at least in its standard form. We will show that a correspondence exists between the statistical distribution of configurations along the single Bohm's trajectory and the quantum distribution for a subsystem interacting with the environment in a multicomponent system. To this aim, we present the numerical results of the single Bohm's trajectory description of the model system of six confined rotors with random interactions. We find a rather close correspondence between the coordinate distribution of one rotor along its trajectory and the time averaged marginal quantum distribution for the same rotor. This might be considered as the counterpart of the standard Born's rule. Furthermore a strongly fluctuating behavior with a fast loss of correlation is found for the evolution of each rotor coordinate. This suggests that a Markov process might well approximate the evolution of the Bohm's coordinate of a single rotor and it is shown that the correspondence between coordinate distribution and quantum distribution of the rotor is exactly verified.

abstract: Quantization of $R^2$ and $S^1 \times S^1$ phase spaces are explicitly carried out tweaking the techniques of geometric quantization. Crucial is a combined use of left and right invariant vector fields. Canonical bases, operators and their actions are explicitly presented. Arguments of Dirac and also Wu and Yang for monopoles are applied for obtaining the quantization of the phase space area. Equivalence of states in the infinite dimensional prequantum Hilbert space resulting in a physical Hilbert space of dimension equal to the phase space area in units of the Planck constant is demonstrated. These techniques can be applied to any manifold with a symplectic structure.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a form of nonlocal correlation between two quantum systems where one of them remotely controls another solely via local measurements. This allows two parties to verify their entanglement even if one of them is untrusted, making it essential to quantum cryptography and communications. Here we study temporal steering (TS), which is a temporal counterpart to EPR steering, and discuss how it is related to the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. We report the first experiment on TS by detecting the polarisation of photons sent in specific states through a noisy channel. We implemented two popular QKD protocols based on mutually-unbiased bases (MUB). We analysed TS by applying a TS inequality and a temporal counterpart of the EPR steerable weight. We connected TS, QKD, and quantum cloning to explain why and when the MUB-based protocols are secure.

abstract: We introduce two operational entanglement measures which are applicable for arbitrary multipartite (pure or mixed) states. One of them characterizes the potentiality of a state to generate other states via local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) and the other the simplicity of generating the state at hand. We show how these measures can be generalized to two classes of entanglement measures. Moreover, we compute the new measures for few-partite systems and use them to characterize the entanglement contained in a three-qubit state. We identify the GHZ- and the W-state as the most powerful three-qubit states regarding state manipulation.

authors: Michael Esfeld
comments:

abstract: The paper considers the claim that quantum theories with a deterministic dynamics of objects in ordinary space-time, such as Bohmian mechanics, contradict the assumption that the measurement settings can be freely chosen in the EPR experiment. That assumption is one of the premises of Bell's theorem. I first argue that only a premise to the effect that what determines the choice of the measurement settings is independent of what determines the past state of the measured system is needed for the derivation of Bell's theorem. Determinism as such does not undermine that independence (unless there are particular initial conditions of the universe that would amount to conspiracy). Only entanglement could do so. However, generic entanglement without collapse on the level of the universal wave function can go together with effective wave functions for subsystems of the universe, as in Bohmian mechanics. The paper argues that such effective wave functions are sufficient for the mentioned independence premise to hold.

abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols based on coherent detection have been studied extensively in both theory and experiment. In all the existing implementations of CV-QKD, both the quantum signal and the local oscillator (LO) are generated from the same laser and propagate through the insecure quantum channel. This arrangement may open security loopholes and also limit the potential applications of CV-QKD. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pilot-aided feedforward data recovery scheme which enables reliable coherent detection using a "locally" generated LO. Using two independent commercial laser sources and a spool of 25 km optical fiber, we construct a coherent communication system. The variance of the phase noise introduced by the proposed scheme is measured to be 0.04 (rad^2), which is small enough to enable secure key distribution. This technology also opens the door for other quantum communication protocols, such as the recently proposed measurement-device-independent (MDI) CV-QKD where independent light sources are employed by different users.

abstract: We give bounds on the average fidelity achievable by any quantum state estimator, which is arguably the most prominently used figure of merit in quantum state tomography. Moreover, these bounds can be computed online---that is, while the experiment is running. We show numerically that these bounds are quite tight for relevant distributions of density matrices. We also show that the Bayesian mean estimator is ideal in the sense of performing close to the bound without requiring optimization. Our results hold for all finite dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: (Withdrawn) This work describes an efficient user-side method of calibrating and correcting quantum annealing computers. For quantum annealing computers based on the Ising model, the method measures the residual bias of the h and J coefficients. Once measured, these biases can then be nulled in subsequent runs for any problem of interest. This method also returns a temperature for each qubit based on the measured versus the expected qubit distributions computed from a Boltzmann distribution model.

abstract: Broadcasting information anonymously becomes more difficult as surveillance technology improves, but remarkably, quantum protocols exist that enable provably traceless broadcasting. The difficulty is making scalable entangled resource states that are robust to errors. We propose an anonymous broadcasting protocol that uses a continuous-variable toric-code state, which can be produced using current technology. High squeezing enables large transmission bandwidth and strong anonymity, and the topological nature of the state enables local error correction.

abstract: Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) describes a suite of techniques for characterising electronic systems, with applications in physics, materials science, chemistry, and biology. However, the requirement for large electron spin ensembles in conventional ESR techniques limits their spatial resolution. Here we present a method for measuring the ESR spectrum of nanoscale electronic environments by measuring the relaxation time ($T_1$) of an optically addressed single-spin probe as it is systematically tuned into resonance with the target electronic system. As a proof of concept we extract the spectral distribution for the P1 electronic spin bath in diamond using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres, and demonstrate excellent agreement with theoretical expectations. As the response of each NV spin in this experiment is dominated by a single P1 spin at a mean distance of 2.7\,nm, the extension of this all-optical technique to the single NV case will enable nanoscale ESR spectroscopy of atomic and molecular spin systems.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a type of quantum correlation which allows one to remotely prepare, or steer, the state of a distant quantum system. While EPR steering can be thought of as a purely spatial correlation there does exist a temporal analogue, in the form of single-system temporal steering. However, a precise quantification of such temporal steering has been lacking. Here we show that it can be measured, via semidefinite programming, with a temporal steerable weight, in direct analogy to the recently proposed EPR steerable weight. We find a unique application for both, this and a spatio-temporal extension, by showing that they are monotonically-decreasing functions under completely-positive trace-preserving maps and thus can be used to define a practical measure of strong non-Markovianity. Finally, we discuss how a spatio-temporal steerable weight can be used to check whether two nodes of a quantum network are quantum connected.

abstract: Quantum discord Q is a function of density matrix elements. The domain of such a function in the case of two-qubit system with X density matrix may consist of three subdomains at most: two ones where the quantum discord is expressed in closed analytical forms (Q_{\pi/2} and Q_0) and an intermediate subdomain for which, to extract the quantum discord Q_\theta, it is required to solve in general numerically a one-dimensional minimization problem to find the optimal measurement angle \theta\in(0,\pi/2). Hence the quantum discord is given by a piecewise-analytic-numerical formula Q=\min{Q_{\pi/2}, Q_\theta, Q_0}. Equations for determining the boundaries between these subdomains are obtained. The boundaries consist of bifurcation points. The Q_{\theta} subdomains are discovered in the generalized Horodecki states, in the dynamical phase flip channel model, in the anisotropic spin systems at thermal equilibrium, in the heteronuclear dimers in an external magnetic field. We found that transitions between Q_{\theta} subdomain and Q_{\pi/2} and Q_0 ones occur suddenly but continuously and smoothly, i.e., nonanalyticity is hidden and can be observed in higher derivatives of discord function.

abstract: This work provides a complete description of entanglement properties between electrons inside coupled quantum molecules, nanoestructures which consist of two quantum dots. Each electron can tunnel between the two quantum dots inside the molecule, being also coupled by Coulomb interaction. First, it is shown that Bell states act as a natural basis for the description of this physical system, defining the characteristics of the energy spectrum and the eigenstates. Then, the entanglement properties of the eigenstates are discussed, shedding light on the roles of each physical parameters on experimental setup. Finally, a detailed analysis of the dynamics shows the path to generate states with a high degree of entanglement, as well as physical conditions associated with coherent oscillations between separable and Bell states.

abstract: We demonstrate the emission of highly indistinguishable photons from a quasi-resonantly pumped coupled quantum dot--microcavity system operating in the regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Changing the sample temperature allows us to vary the quantum dot--cavity detuning, and on spectral resonance we observe a three-fold improvement in the Hong--Ou--Mandel interference visibility, reaching values in excess of 80\%. Our measurements off-resonance allow us to investigate varying Purcell enhancements, and to probe the dephasing environment at different temperatures and energy scales. By comparison with our microscopic model, we are able to identify pure-dephasing and not time-jitter as the dominating source of imperfections in our system.

abstract: Quantum systems with sublevel structures prevent full population inversion from one manifold of sublevels to the other using strong ultrafast resonant pulses. In this work we explain the mechanism by which this population transfer is blocked. We then develop a novel concept of geometric control, assuming full or partial coherent manipulation within the manifolds and show that by preparing specific coherent superpositions in the initial manifold, full population inversion or full population blockade, {\it i.e} laser-induced transparency, can be achieved. In particular, by parallel population transfer we show how population inversion between the manifolds can be obtained with minimal pulse area. As the number of sublevels increases, population inversion can overcome the pulse area theorem at the expense of full control over the initial manifold of sublevels.

Such manifolds are determined by the rotation of the eigenstates of the operator of projection of spin-$s$ on some direction. The Fubini-Study metrics of these manifolds are those of spheres with radii dependent on the value of the spin and on the value of the spin projection. The conditions for optimal evolution of the spin-$s$ system on rotational manifolds are obtained.

abstract: We consider the dispersion interaction between two neutral, ground-state atoms at finite temperature by means of a dynamical approach. Our result differs from those obtained with time-independent perturbation theory in that it accounts for the influence of dissipation via the atomic decay rates. Modern measurements of Casimir force seem to only be compatible with Lifshitz theory when neglecting dissipation in the medium response function, which has led heated debates. Our new result offers an explanation for the suppressed dependence on dissipation. We also consider the interaction between a ground-state atom and an excited one. There are discordant results in the literature for the retarded potential: one oscillating and one monotonous. Our dynamical result uniquely leads to the oscillating result when taking into account the decay rates.

abstract: The simulation of quantum systems has been a key aim of quantum technologies for decades, and the generalisation to open systems is necessary to include physically realistic systems. We introduce an approach for quantum simulations of open system dynamics in terms of an environment of minimal size and a time-dependent Hamiltonian. This enables the implementation of a continuous-time simulation with a finite environment, whereas state of the art methods require an infinite environment or only match the simulation at discrete times. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for this Hamiltonian to be well behaved and, when these are not met, we show that there exists an approximate Hamiltonian that is, and look into its applications.

abstract: We introduce a definition of Lorentz transformations in the framework of quantum cellular automata. Our definition does not require space-time, and retains the usual interpretation in the emergent one. The definition is group theoretical, with flatness of space-time corresponding to Abelianity of the cellular automaton group. We consider the covariance in the case of the Weyl automaton. The notion of particle as Poincar\'e irreducible representation survives at all scales. The interpolation of the Lorentz symmetry from the discrete to the continuum scale occurs through a nonlinear representation. We also discuss the connection of the nonlinear Lorentz transformations with the Poincar\'e and k-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra, the emerging non-commutative space-time, and the deformed Heisenberg commutation relations.

abstract: We show that no device built according to the rules of quantum field theory can measure proper time along its path. Highly accelerated quantum clocks experience the Unruh effect, which inevitably influences their time rate. This contradicts the concept of an ideal clock, whose rate should only depend on the instantaneous velocity.

These approaches include: a possible connection between the problem of time and problem of quantum measurement, decoherence models based on space-time uncertainty, the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton equation, attempts to introduce gravity into collapse models such as CSL, ideas based on the black hole - elementary particle complementarity, and the possible role of a complex space-time metric.

abstract: We study the temporal evolution of a coherent state under the action of a parametric oscillator and a nonlinear Kerr-like medium. We make use of the interaction picture representation and use an exact time evolution operator for the time independent part of the Hamiltonian. We approximate the interaction picture Hamiltonian in such a way as to make it a member of a Lie algebra. The corresponding time evolution operator behaves like a squeezing operator due to the temporal dependence of the oscillator's frequency. We analyze the probability amplitude and the auto correlation function for different Hamiltonian parameters and we find a very good agreement between our approximate results and converged numerical calculations.

abstract: With the advent of large-scale quantum annealing devices, several challenges have emerged. For example, it has been shown that the performance of a device can be significantly affected by several degrees of freedom when programming the device; a common example being gauge selection. To date, no experimentally-tested strategy exists to select the best programming specifications. We developed a score function that can be calculated from a number of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find the desired solution. We show how this performance estimator can be used to guide, for example, the selection of the optimal gauges out of a pool of random gauge candidates and how to select the values of parameters for which we have no a priori knowledge of the optimal value. For the latter, we illustrate the concept by applying the score function to set the strength of the parameter intended to enforce the embedding of the logical graph into the hardware architecture, a challenge frequently encountered in the implementation of real-world problem instances. Since the harder the problem instances, the more useful the strategies proposed in this work are, we expect the programming strategies proposed to significantly reduce the time of future benchmark studies and in help finding the solution of hard-to-solve real-world applications implemented in the next generation of quantum annealing devices.

abstract: In this paper I review three different positions on the wave function, namely: nomological realism, dispositionalism, and configuration space realism by regarding as essential their capacity to account for the world of our experience. I conclude that the first two positions are committed to regard the wave function as an abstract entity. The third position will be shown to be a merely speculative attempt to derive a primitive ontology from a reified mathematical space. Without entering any discussion about nominalism, I conclude that an elimination of abstract entities from one's ontology commits one to instrumentalism about the wave function, a position that therefore is not as unmotivated as it has seemed to be to many philosophers.

abstract: In the first part of the paper I argue that an ontology of events is precise, flexible and general enough so as to cover the three main alternative formulations of quantum mechanics as well as theories advocating an antirealistic view of the wave function. Since these formulations advocate a primitive ontology of entities living in four-dimensional spacetime, they are good candidates to connect that quantum image with the manifest image of the world. However, to the extent that some form of realism about the wave function is also necessary, one needs to endorse also the idea that the wave function refers to some kind of power. In the second part, I discuss some difficulties raised by the recent proposal that in Bohmian mechanics this power is holistically possessed by all the particles in the universe.

abstract: In this review the debated rapport between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics is addressed in the framework of the theory of periodically-driven/controlled quantum-thermodynamic machines. The basic model studied here is that of a two-level system (TLS), whose energy is periodically modulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths. When the modulation interval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath correlations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS, depending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS coupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine (QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the modulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the conditions for attaining these bounds. An extension of this model to multilevel systems shows that the QHM power output can be boosted by the multilevel degeneracy. These results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles: (i) Externally-driven/modulated QHMs may attain the Carnot efficiency bound, but when the driving is done by a quantum device ("piston"), the efficiency strongly depends on its initial quantum state. Such dependence has been unknown thus far. (ii) The refrigeration rate effected by QHMs does not vanish as the temperature approaches absolute zero for certain quantized baths, e.g., magnons, thous challenging Nernst's unattainability principle. (iii) System-bath correlations allow more work extraction under periodic control than that expected from the Szilard-Landauer principle, provided the period is in the non-Markovian domain. Thus, dynamically-controlled QHMs may benefit from hitherto unexploited thermodynamic resources.

abstract: Quantum information science promises powerful new technologies and fundamental scientific discoveries. Photonic qubits are appealing for their low noise properties-the cost is the non-deterministic nature of many processes, including photon generation and entanglement. Active multiplexing can increase the success probability of such processes above a required threshold, and spatial multiplexing of up to four heralded photon sources shows great promise. The cost is a proliferation of hardware. Temporal multiplexing-repeated use of the same hardware components-has been proposed as an alternative and is likely to be essential to greatly reduce resource complexity and system sizes. Requirements include the precise synchronization of a system of low-loss switches, delay lines, fast photon detectors, and feed-forward. Here we demonstrate multiplexing of 8 'bins'-four temporal and two spatial-from a heralded photon source. We show enhanced photon emission statistics, observing an increase in both the triggering and heralded photon rates. Despite its current limitations due to extrinsic sources of loss, this system points the way to harnessing temporal multiplexing in quantum technologies, from single-photon sources to large-scale computation.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: This work presents a general unifying theoretical framework for quantum non-equilibrium systems. It is based on a re-statement of the dynamical problem as one of inferring the distribution of collision events that move a system toward thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary starting distribution. Using a form based on maximum entropy for this transition distribution leads to a statistical description of open quantum systems with strong parallels to the conventional, maximum-entropy, equilibrium thermostatics. A precise form of the second law of thermodynamics can be stated for this dynamics at every time-point in a trajectory. Numerical results are presented for low-dimensional systems interacting with cavity fields. The dynamics and stationary state are compared to a reference model of a weakly coupled oscillator plus cavity supersystem thermostatted by periodic partial measurements. Despite the absence of an explicit cavity in the present model of open quantum dynamics, both the relaxation rates and stationary state properties closely match the reference. Additionally, the time-course of energy exchange and entropy increase is given throughout an entire measurement process for a single spin system. The results show the process to be capable of initially absorbing heat when starting from a superposition state, but not from an isotropic distribution. Based on these results, it is argued that logical inference in the presence of environmental noise is sufficient to resolve the paradox of wavefunction collapse.

abstract: A robust quantum state transfer scheme is discussed for three atoms that are trapped by separated cavities linked via optical fibers in ring-connection. It is shown that, under the effective three-atom Ising model, arbitrary quantum state can be transferred from one atom to another deterministically via an auxiliary atom with maximum unit fidelity. The only required operation for this scheme is replicating turning on/off the local laser fields applied to the atoms for two steps with time cost $\frac{\sqrt{2}\pi}{\Gamma_{0}}$. The scheme is insensitive to cavity leakage and atomic position due to the condition $\Delta \approx \kappa\gg g$. Another advantage of this scheme is that the cooperative influence of spontaneous emission and operating time error can reduce the time cost for maximum fidelity and thus speed up the implementation of quantum state transfer.

abstract: A robust scheme for unknown entangled state transfer and C-Not gate implemented between two spatially separated atoms is proposed. It is shown that, in the effective three-atom Ising model, two-atom unknown entangled state can be transferred from one pair of atoms to another deterministically by only repeating a simple operation of turning on/off local laser field applied on atom for two times at controlling time $\frac{\pi}{2\Omega_{0}}$. The whole time cost is less than $\frac{3\pi}{2\Omega_{0}}$. The successful probability and the fidelity are almost 100% for small atomic spontaneous emission rate. Deterministic two-atom C-Not gate can also be implemented in this model by just turning on/off the local laser field applied on the single target atom and leaving the controlling atom in its cavity alone for a while. The whole time cost is less than $\frac{\pi}{2\Omega_{0}}+\frac{3\pi \Delta}{2g^{2}}$. It is demonstrated that the scheme is insensitive to cavity leakage and fiber loss.

abstract: In this work we consider the problem of preparation of the stationary distribution of irreducible, time-reversible Markov chains, which is a fundamental task in algorithmic Markov chain theory. For the classical setting, this task has a complexity lower bound of $\Omega(1/\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of the Markov chain, and other dependencies contribute only logarithmically. In the quantum case, the conjectured complexity is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}})$ (with other dependencies contributing only logarithmically). However, this bound has only been achieved for a few special classes of Markov chains. In this work, we provide a method for the sequential preparation of stationary distributions for sequences of general time-reversible $N-$state Markov chains, akin to the setting of simulated annealing methods. The complexity of preparation we achieve is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} N^{1/4})$, neglecting logarithmic factors. While this result falls short of the conjectured optimal time, it still provides at least a quadratic improvement over other straightforward approaches for quantum mixing applied in this setting.

abstract: Optical phase estimation is a vital measurement primitive that is used to perform accurate measurements of various physical quantities like length, velocity and displacements. The precision of such measurements can be largely enhanced by the use of entangled or squeezed states of light as demonstrated in a variety of different optical systems. Most of these accounts however deal with the measurement of a very small shift of an already known phase, which is in stark contrast to ab-initio phase estimation where the initial phase is unknown. Here we report on the realization of a quantum enhanced and fully deterministic phase estimation protocol based on real-time feedback control. Using robust squeezed states of light combined with a real-time Bayesian estimation feedback algorithm, we demonstrate deterministic phase estimation with a precision beyond the quantum shot noise limit. The demonstrated protocol opens up new opportunities for quantum microscopy, quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

abstract: Adiabatic elimination is a standard tool in quantum optics, which produces an effective Hamiltonian for a relevant subspace of states, incorporating effects of its coupling to states with much higher unperturbed energy. It shares with techniques from other fields the emphasis on the existence of widely separated scales. Given this fact, the question arises whether it is feasible to improve on the adiabatic approximation, similarly to some of those other approaches. A number of authors have addressed the issue from the quantum optics/atomic physics perspective, and have run into the issue of non-hermiticity of the effective Hamiltonian improved beyond the adiabatic approximation, which poses conceptual and practical problems. Here, we first briefly survey methods present in the physics literature. Next, we rewrite the problems addressed by the adiabatic elimination technique to make apparent the fact that they are singular perturbation problems from the point of view of dynamical systems. We apply the invariant manifold method for singular perturbation problems to this case, and show that this method produces the equation named after Bloch in nuclear physics. Given the wide separation of scales, it becomes intuitive that the Bloch equation admits iterative/perturbative solutions. We show, using a fixed point theorem, that indeed the iteration converges to a perturbative solution that produces in turn an exact Hamiltonian for the relevant subspace. We propose thus several sequences of effective Hamiltonians, starting with the adiabatic elimination and improving on it. We show the origin of the non-hermiticity, and that it is inessential given the isospectrality of the effective non-hermitian operator and a corresponding effective hermitian operator, which we build. We propose an application of the introduced techniques to periodic Hamiltonians.

We prove that both methods are equivalent and show the advantages of the Quantum Arnold-Ermakov-Pinney transformation over the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. We show that, in the quantum time-dependent and damped harmonic oscillator, the invariant proposed by Dodonov & Man'ko is more suitable and provide some examples to illustrate it, focusing on the damped case.

abstract: Given a quantum Hamiltonian and its evolution time, the corresponding unitary evolution operator can be constructed in many different ways, corresponding to different trajectories between the desired end-points. A choice among these trajectories can then be made to obtain the best computational complexity and control over errors. As an explicit example, Grover's quantum search algorithm is described as a Hamiltonian evolution problem. It is shown that the computational complexity has a power-law dependence on error when a straightforward Lie-Trotter discretisation formula is used, and it becomes logarithmic in error when reflection operators are used. The exponential change in error control is striking, and can be used to improve many importance sampling methods. The key concept is to make the evolution steps as large as possible while obeying the constraints of the problem. In particular, we can understand why overrelaxation algorithms are superior to small step size algorithms.

abstract: Using a circuit QED device, we demonstrate a simple qubit measurement pulse shape that yields fast ring-up and ring-down of the readout resonator regardless of the qubit state. The pulse differs from a square pulse only by the inclusion of additional constant-amplitude segments designed to effect a rapid transition from one steady-state population to another. Using a Ramsey experiment performed shortly after the measurement pulse to quantify the residual population, we find that compared to a square pulse followed by a delay, this pulse shape reduces the timescale for cavity ring-down by more than twice the cavity time constant. At low drive powers, this performance is achieved using pulse parameters calculated from a linear cavity model; at higher powers, empirical optimization of the pulse parameters leads to similar performance.

abstract: The large available Hilbert space and high coherence of cavity resonators makes these systems an interesting resource for storing encoded quantum bits. To perform a quantum gate on this encoded information, however, complex nonlinear operations must be applied to the many levels of the oscillator simultaneously. In this work, we introduce the Selective Number-dependent Arbitrary Phase (SNAP) gate, which imparts a different phase to each Fock state component using an off-resonantly coupled qubit. We show that the SNAP gate allows control over the quantum phases by correcting the unwanted phase evolution due to the Kerr effect. Furthermore, by combining the SNAP gate with oscillator displacements, we create a one-photon Fock state with high fidelity. Using just these two controls, one can construct arbitrary unitary operations, offering a scalable route to performing logical manipulations on oscillator-encoded qubits.

abstract: Quantum cryptographic protocols solve the longstanding problem of distributing a shared secret string to two distant users by typically making use of one-way quantum channel. However, alternative protocols exploiting two-way quantum channel have been proposed for the same goal and with potential advantages. Here we overview a security proof for two-way quantum key distribution protocols, against the most general eavesdropping attack, that utilize an entropic uncertainty relation. Then, by resorting to the `smooth' version of involved entropies, we extend such a proof to the case of finite key size. The results will be compared to those available for one-way protocols showing some advantages.

abstract: Coherent states provide a natural connection of quantum systems to their classical limit and are employed in various fields of physics. Here we derive general systematic expansions, with respect to quantum parameters, of expectation values of products of arbitrary operators within both oscillator coherent states and SU(2) coherent states. In particular, we generally prove that the energy fluctuations of an arbitrary Hamiltonian are in leading order entirely due to the time dependence of the classical variables. These results add to the list of wellknown properties of coherent states and are applied here to the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, the Dicke model, and to coherent intertwiners in spin networks as considered in Loop Quantum Gravity.

abstract: Design of a large-scale quantum computer has paramount importance for science and technologies. We investigate a scheme for realization of quantum algorithms using noncomposite quantum systems, i.e., systems without subsystems. In this framework, $n$ artificially allocated "subsystems" play a role of qubits in $n$-qubits quantum algorithms. With focus on two-qubit quantum algorithms, we demonstrate a realization of the universal set of gates using a $d=5$ single qudit state. Manipulation for an ancillary level in the systems allows effective implementation of operators from ${\rm U}(4)$ group via operators from ${\rm SU}(5)$ group. Using a possible experimental realization of such systems through anharmonic superconducting many-level quantum circuits, we present a blueprint for a single qudit realization of the Deutsch algorithm, which generalizes previously studied realization based on the virtual spin representation [A.R. Kessel et al., Phys. Rev. A 66, 062322 (2002)].

abstract: We investigate scaling of work output and efficiency of a photonic Carnot engine with the number of quantum coherent resources. Specifically, we consider a generalization of the "phaseonium fuel" for the photonic Carnot engine, which was first introduced as a three-level atom with two lower states in a quantum coherent superposition by [M. O. Scully, M. Suhail Zubairy, G. S. Agarwal, and H. Walther, Science {\bf 299}, 862 (2003)], to the case of $N+1$ level atoms with $N$ coherent lower levels. Deriving a multilevel mesoscopic master equation for the system, we evaluate the harvested work by the engine, and its efficiency. We find that efficiency and extracted work scale quadratically with the number of quantum coherent levels. Quantum coherence boost to the specific energy (work output per unit mass of the resource) is a profound fundamental difference of quantum fuel from classical resources. Besides, we examine the dependence of cavity loss on the number of atomic levels and find that multilevel phaseonium fuel can be utilized to beat the decoherence due to cavity loss. Our results bring the photonic Carnot engines much closer to the capabilities of current resonator technologies.

We tackle the question of how these in- and outfluxes can be realized and introduce model systems in which PT-symmetric subsystems are embedded into a closed hermitian system with no interaction to an external environment. We show that such subsystems still have PT-symmetric states. In addition we examine what degree of detail is necessary to correctly model the PT-symmetric properties and the bifurcation structure of such a system. We examine a four-mode matrix model and a system described by the full Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one dimension. We see that a simple matrix model correctly describes the qualitative properties of the system. For sufficiently isolated wells there is also quantitative agreement with the more advanced system descriptions. We also investigate which properties the wave functions of a system must fulfil to allow for PT-symmetric states. In particular the requirements for the phase difference between different parts of the system are examined.

abstract: We present a systematic approach based on Bloch vector's treatment and the Magnus quantum electrodynamical formalism to study qubit manipulation by a train of pulses. These investigations include one of the basic processes involved in quantum computation. The concrete calculations are performed for multiple resonant excitations of superconducting qubit driven by Gaussian pulses. In this way, the populations of qubit states due to multiple resonant interactions are investigated for various operational regimes including: single-pulse excitation, two-pulse excitation with phase shift between pulse envelopes being controlling parameter and for excitation with sequential pulses. In the last case, we demonstrate the formation of quasienergetic states and quasienergies. For qubit driven by train of identical pulses the transition probability exhibits aperiodic oscillations, but also becomes periodically regular for definite values of the quasienergy.

abstract: We consider a two-level system such as a two-level atom, interacting with a cavity field mode in the rotating wave approximation, when the atomic transition frequency or the field mode frequency is periodically driven in time. We show that in both cases, for an appropriate choice of the modulation parameters, the state amplitudes in a generic $n${-}excitation subspace obey the same equations of motion that can be obtained from a \emph{static} non-Hermitian Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with ${\mathcal PT}$ symmetry, that is with an imaginary coupling constant. This gives further support to recent results showing the possible physical interest of ${\mathcal PT}$ symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also generalize the well-known diagonalization of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian to the non-Hermitian case in terms of pseudo-bosons and pseudo-fermions, and discuss relevant mathematical and physical aspects.

abstract: An ensemble consisting on systems of two entangled spin 1/2 particles, all of them in the same global quantum state, are considered. The two spins are measured, each of them, on a fixed direction, at two randomly selected measurement times. Realism, plus locality and freedom of choice referred to these chosen times, are assumed. Then, from the sole correlation function related to the two measurements, without considering any Bell inequalities, a contradiction between these assumptions and quantum mechanics is found.

abstract: We show how weak non-linearities can be used in a device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using generalized two-mode Schr\"odinger cat states. The QKD protocol is therefore shown to be secure against collective attacks and for some coherent attacks. We derive analytical formulas for the optimal values of the Bell parameter, the quantum bit error rate, and the device- independent secret key rate in the noiseless lossy bosonic channel. Additionally, we give the filters and measurements which achieve these optimal values. We find that over any distance in this channel the quantum bit error rate is identically zero, in principle, and the states in the protocol are always able to violate a Bell inequality. The protocol is found to be superior in some regimes to a device-independent QKD protocol based on polarization entangled states in a depolarizing channel. Finally, we propose an implementation for the optimal filters and measurements.

abstract: Given a quantum Hamiltonian and its evolution time, the corresponding unitary evolution operator can be constructed in many different ways, corresponding to different trajectories between the desired end-points. A choice among these trajectories can then be made to obtain the best computational complexity and control over errors. It is shown how a construction based on Grover's algorithm scales linearly in time and logarithmically in error bound, and is clearly superior to the scheme based on straightforward application of the Lie-Trotter formula. The strategy is then extended to simulation of any Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of two projection operators.

abstract: We report the observation of the vacuum Rabi splitting of a single quantum emitter by measuring its direct spontaneous emission into free space. We used a semiconductor quantum dot inside a photonic crystal nanocavity, in conjunction with an appropriate cavity design and filtering with a polarizer and an aperture, enabling the extraction of the inherently-weak emitter's signal. The emitter's vacuum Rabi spectra exhibit clear differences to those measured by detecting the cavity photon leakage. Moreover, we observed an asymmetric vacuum Rabi spectrum induced by interference between the emitter and cavity detection channels. Our observations lay the groundwork for accessing various cavity quantum electrodynamics phenomena that manifest themselves only in the emitter's direct spontaneous emission.

abstract: The control of slow and fast light propagation, in the probe transmission in a single experiment, is a challenging task. This type of control can only be achieved through highly nonlinear interactions and additional interfering pathway(s), which is therefore seldom reported. Here, we devise a scheme in which slow light, and a tunable switch from slow light to fast light can be achieved in the probe transmission based on a hybrid setup, which is composed of an optical cavity with two charged nano mechanical resonators (MRs). The two MRs are electrostatically coupled via tunable Coulomb coupling strength ($g_{c}$) making a quantum opto-electromechanical system (QOEMS). The parameter $g_{c}$ that couples the two MRs can be switched on and off by controlling the bias voltages on the MRs, and acts as a tunable switch that allows the propagation of transmitted probe field as slow light ($g_{c} \neq 0$) or fast light ($g_{c} = 0$). In our scheme, the magnitude of delay and pulse advancement can be controlled by tuning the Coulomb interaction and power of the pump field. Furthermore, we show that slow light regime in our model is astonishingly robust to the cavity decay rate. In comparison with previous schemes, our scheme has clear advantages that empowers the state-of-the-art photonic industry as well as reflects the strength of emerging hybrid technologies.

abstract: We consider the problem of keeping an arbitrary state $\rho_s$ out of thermal equilibrium. We find that counter-acting thermalisation using only a resource system which is in a stationary state at the initial time and a system-resource interaction that preserves the global energy is possible if and only if the target state $\rho_s$ is block-diagonal in the eigenbasis of the system's Hamiltonian $H_s.$ As a consequence, we compute the extra work the operator must provide by tuning the resource-system interaction to overcome this constraint. This quantity, which is interpreted as the work needed to preserve the coherences in the state, can be expressed in terms of the target state $\rho_s$ and the thermal equilibrium state $\rho_{\beta},$ and it is proportional to the symmetrized relative entropy between $\rho_s$ and $\rho_{\beta}.$

abstract: The Kochen-Specker theorem proves the inability to assign, simultaneously, non-contextual definite values to all (of a finite set of) quantum mechanical observables prior to their measurement. If one assumes that definite values behave non-contextually, one can nonetheless only conclude that some observables (in this set) are value indefinite. The theorem says very little, however, about the extent of this non-classicality. In this paper, building on previous results, we prove a variant of the Kochen-Specker theorem showing that, under the same assumption of non-contextuality, if a system is prepared in a state $|\psi\rangle$, then every observable $A$ is value indefinite unless $|\psi\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $A$. In contrast to standard proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem, this stronger result requires a constructive method of reduction between Kochen-Specker sets. As a consequence we show that: a) the set of value indefinite observables has measure one, that is, almost all observables are value indefinite; and b) value indefiniteness can be localised, that is, we can indicate precisely which observables are value indefinite. The result of measuring a value indefinite observable is thus indeterministic, formalising a notion of quantum randomness. As a consequence, the cause and quality of this type of quantum randomness can be described and studied, thus going beyond the mere postulation that "quantum measurements are indeterministically random" (which neither the Kochen-Specker theorem nor Bell's theorem prove).

abstract: The quantum efficiency in the transfer of an initial excitation in disordered finite networks, modeled by the $k$-body embedded Gaussian ensembles of random matrices, is studied for bosons and fermions. The influence of the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and centrosymmetry/centrohermiticity are addressed. For bosons and fermions, the best efficiencies of the realizations of the ensemble are dramatically enhanced when centrosymmetry (centrohermiticity) is imposed. For few bosons distributed in two single-particle levels this permits perfect state transfer for almost all realizations when one-particle interactions are considered. For fermionic systems the enhancement is found to be maximal for cases when all but one single particle levels are occupied.

abstract: The topological color code and the toric code are two leading candidates for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we show that the color code on a $d$-dimensional closed manifold is equivalent to multiple decoupled copies of the $d$-dimensional toric code up to local unitary transformations and adding or removing ancilla qubits. Our result not only generalizes the proven equivalence for $d=2$, but also provides an explicit recipe of how to decouple independent components of the color code, highlighting the importance of colorability in the construction of the code. Moreover, for the $d$-dimensional color code with $d+1$ boundaries of $d+1$ distinct colors, we find that the code is equivalent to multiple copies of the $d$-dimensional toric code which are attached along a $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary. In particular, for $d=2$, we show that the (triangular) color code with boundaries is equivalent to the (folded) toric code with boundaries. We also find that the $d$-dimensional toric code admits logical non-Pauli gates from the $d$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy, and thus saturates the bound by Bravyi and K\"{o}nig. In particular, we show that the $d$-qubit control-$Z$ logical gate can be fault-tolerantly implemented on the stack of $d$ copies of the toric code by a local unitary transformation.

abstract: Generation of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases has achieved a state-of-the-art in mesoscopic systems with manipulation and control of the AB effect. The possibility of transfer information enconded in such systems to light increases the possible scenarios where the information can be manipulated and transfered. In this paper we propose a bit-enconding of AB phases contrasting with the usual codifications using chirality or flux orientation. We propose a quantum transfer of the AB phase to a coherent state superposition, leading to the possibility of transfering AB phases to non-classical states of light and store the bit information enconded in this phase to a light mode field. We also discuss the storage of a string of bits enconded by AB phases in a product state and show that this scheme can be implemented to store a string of bits in high-Q or multimode cavities. Our propose can also be useful to further progress in methods of quantum information associated to modern techniques in synthetic gauge fields.

abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum nonseparability between an observed system and a measuring apparatus, or multiple measuring apparatuses. We show that the physical meaning of the outcome of the measuring apparatus obtained by weak measurement with a post-selection differs critically from that without any post-selection. In this study, the nonseparability plays the essential role, which is shown to be the same in a simultaneous conventional von Neumann-type measurement of multiple observables. From this viewpoint, we suggest a new concept, known as {\it simultaneous readability}, which is the possibility that multiple measuring apparatuses will give the proper information of the observed system simultaneously. Next, we show that different components of the spin of an electron are not simultaneously measurable even if it has EPR correlation with another electron.

abstract: This paper is concerned with application of the classical Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameterization to finding a set of linear coherent quantum controllers that stabilize a linear quantum plant. The plant and controller are assumed to represent open quantum harmonic oscillators modelled by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The interconnections between the plant and the controller are assumed to be established through quantum bosonic fields. In this framework, conditions for the stabilization of a given linear quantum plant via linear coherent quantum feedback are addressed using a stable factorization approach. The class of stabilizing quantum controllers is parameterized in the frequency domain. Also, this approach is used in order to formulate coherent quantum weighted $H_2$ and $H_\infty$ control problems for linear quantum systems in the frequency domain. Finally, a projected gradient descent scheme is proposed to solve the coherent quantum weighted $H_2$ control problem.

abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by quantum stochastic differential equations. The latter are driven by quantum Wiener processes which represent external boson fields. The system-field coupling operators are linear functions of the system variables. The Hamiltonian consists of a nominal quadratic function of the system variables and an uncertain perturbation which is represented in a Weyl quantization form. Assuming that the nominal linear quantum system is stable, we develop sufficient conditions on the perturbation of the Hamiltonian which guarantee robust mean square stability of the perturbed system. Examples are given to illustrate these results for a class of Hamiltonian perturbations in the form of trigonometric polynomials of the system variables.

abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of the Ising model is a classical stochastic process whereas quantum mechanics has no stochastic elements in the classical sense. Nevertheless, it has been known that there exists a close formal relationship between these two processes. We reformulate this relationship and use it to compare the efficiency of simulated annealing that uses classical stochastic processes and quantum annealing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It is shown that classical dynamics can be efficiently simulated by quantum-mechanical processes whereas the converse is not necessarily true. This may imply that quantum annealing may be regarded as a more powerful tool than simulated annealing for optimization problems.

abstract: Beginning with the principle that a closed mechanical composite system is timeless, time can be de?ned by the regular changes in a suitable position coordinate (clock) in the observing part, when one part of the closed composite observes another part. Translating this scenario into both classical and quantum mechanics allows a transition to be made from a time-independent mechanics for the closed composite to a time-dependent description of the observed part alone. The use of Hamilton- Jacobi theory yields a very close parallel between the derivations in classical and quantum mechanics. The time-dependent equations, Hamilton-Jacobi or Schrodinger, appear as approximations since no observed system is truly closed. The quantum case has an additional feature in the condition that the observing environment must become classical in order to de?ne a real classical time variable. This condition leads to a removal of entanglement engendered by the interaction between the observed system and the observing environment. Comparison is made to the similar emergence of time in quantum gravity theory

We analyze the theoretical structure of these algorithms and their average performance for arbitrary states and for deterministically preparing NOON states. Using a new state synthesis algorithm, we show that NOON states can be prepared in a time linear in the desired photon number and without any state-selective interactions.

abstract: We present a proof for a conjecture previously formulated by Dzhafarov, Kujala, and Larsson (Foundations of Physics, in press, arXiv:1411.2244). The conjecture specifies a measure for the degree of contextuality and a criterion (necessary and sufficient condition) for contextuality in a broad class of quantum systems. This class includes Leggett-Garg, EPR/Bell, and Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky type systems as special cases. In a system of this class certain physical properties $q_{1},...,q_{n}$ are measured in pairs $(q_{i},q_{j})$; every property enters in precisely two such pairs; and each measurement outcome is a binary random variable. Denoting the measurement outcomes for a property $q_{i}$ in the two pairs it enters by $V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$, the pair of measurement outcomes for $(q_{i},q_{j})$ is $(V_{i},W_{j})$. Contextuality is defined as follows: one computes the minimal possible value $\Delta_{0}$ for the sum of $\Pr[V_{i}\not=W_{i}]$ (over $i=1,...,n$) that is allowed by the individual distributions of $V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$; one computes the minimal possible value $\Delta_{\min}$ for the sum of $\Pr[V_{i}\not=W_{i}]$ across all possible couplings of (i.e., joint distributions imposed on) the entire set of random variables $V_{1},W_{1},...,V_{n},W_{n}$ in the system; and the system is considered contextual if $\Delta_{\min}>\Delta_{0}$ (otherwise $\Delta_{\min}=\Delta_{0}$). This definition has its justification in the general approach dubbed Contextuality-by-Default, and it allows for measurement errors and signaling among the measured properties. The conjecture proved in this paper specifies the value of $\Delta_{\min}-\Delta_{0}$ in terms of the distributions of the measurement outcomes $(V_{i},W_{j})$.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of Gaussian wave packets on star graphs whose arms feature each a periodic potential and an external time-dependent field. Assuming that the potentials and the field can be manipulated separately for each arm of the star, we show that it is possible to manipulate the direction of the motion of a Gaussian wave packet through the bifurcation point by a suitable choice of the parameters of the external fields. In doing so, one can achieve a transmission of the wave packet into the desired arm with nearly 70\% while also keeping the shape of the wave packet approximately intact. Since a star graph is the simplest element of many other complex graphs, the obtained results can be considered as the first step to wave packet manipulations on complex networks.

abstract: The dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the phase parameter in a driven two-state system is studied within the framework of non-Markovian dissipative process. The influences of memory effects, classical driving and detunings on the parameter-estimation precision are demonstrated by exactly solving the Hamiltonian under rotating-wave approximation. In sharp contrast with the results obtained in the presence of Markovian dissipation, we find that classical driving can drastically enhance the QFI, namely, the precision of parameter estimation in the non-Markovian regime. Moreover, the parameter-estimation precision may even be preserved from the influence of surrounding non-Markovian dissipation with the assistance of classical driving. Remarkably, we reveal that the enhancement and preservation of QFI highly depend on the combination of classical driving and non-Markovian effects. Finally, a phenomenological explanation of the underlying mechanism is presented in detail via the quasimode theory

abstract: Quantum entanglement is considered to be a very delicate phenomenon that is very hard to maintain in the presence of noise, or non-zero temperatures. In recent years however, and motivated by a quest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem, researches have tried to establish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at constant temperature that is independent of system size. This would imply that any quantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of the Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. However to this date, no such systems were found. Moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians on robust, albeit "non-physical" topologies, namely expanders, does not guarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such robustness may be possible after all: first, we relax the approximation condition in a way that is reminiscent of classical approximation problems: instead of asking that any quantum state with fractional energy at most 0.05 be highly-entangled, we ask that any quantum state violating a fraction at most 0.05 of constraints is highly-entangled. Then, we define a new "handle" on entanglement of a quantum state by considering the minimal-depth Boolean circuit for approximately simulating any tensor-product measurement performed on that state. We then construct an infinite family of local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum error-correcting code with a property of combinatorial inapproximability: any quantum state that violates a fraction at most 0.05 of all local terms cannot be even approximately simulated by classical circuits whose depth is sub-logarithmic in the number of qubits. In a sense, this implies that providing a "witness" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be "almost" satisfied, requires long-range entanglement.

abstract: Can high energy physics can be simulated by low-energy, nonrelativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective, low energy, symmetry, or as an "exact" symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to new type of (table-top) experiments, that shall be used to study various QCD phenomena, as the con?nement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions, and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: The adiabatic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a manifestation of the Berry phase acquired when some slow variables take a planar spin around a loop. While the effect has been observed in molecular spectroscopy, direct measurement of the topological phase shift in a scattering experiment has been elusive in the past. Here, we demonstrate an adiabatic AB effect for neutrons that scatter on a long straight current-carrying wire. We propose an experiment to verify the effect and demonstrate its feasibility by explicit simulation of the dynamics of unpolarized very slow neutrons that scatter on the wire under realistic conditions.

abstract: Powerful Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are required for stabilizing and protecting fragile qubits against the undesirable effects of quantum decoherence. Similar to classical codes, hashing bound approaching QECCs may be designed by exploiting a concatenated code structure, which invokes iterative decoding. Therefore, in this paper we provide an extensive step-by-step tutorial for designing EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart aided concatenated quantum codes based on the underlying quantum-to-classical isomorphism. These design lessons are then exemplified in the context of our proposed Quantum Irregular Convolutional Code (QIRCC), which constitutes the outer component of a concatenated quantum code. The proposed QIRCC can be dynamically adapted to match any given inner code using EXIT charts, hence achieving a performance close to the hashing bound. It is demonstrated that our QIRCC-based optimized design is capable of operating within 0.4 dB of the noise limit.

abstract: With the local resonant interaction between a nitrogen-vacancy-center ensemble (NVE) and a superconducting coplanar resonator, and the single-qubit operation, we propose two protocols for the state transfer between two remote NVEs and for fast controlled-phase (c-phase) on these NVEs, respectively. This hybrid quantum system is composed of two distant NVEs coupled to separated high-Q transmission line resonators (TLRs), which are interconnected by a current-biased Josephsonjunction superconducting phase qubit. The fidelity of our state-transfer protocol is about 99.65% within the operation time of 70.60 ns. The fidelity of our c-phase gate is about 98.23% within the operation time of 93.87 ns. Furthermore, using the c-phase gate, we construct a two-dimensional cluster state on NVEs in n*n square grid based on the hybrid quantum system for the one-way quantum computation. Our protocol may be more robust, compared with the one based on the superconducting resonators, due to the long coherence time of NVEs at room temperature.

abstract: We investigate the electromechanical coupling between a nanomechanical resonator and two parametrically coupled superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities that are driven by a two-mode squeezed microwave source. We show that, with the selective coupling of the resonator to the cavity Bogoliubov modes, the radiation-pressure type coupling can be greatly enhanced by several orders of magnitude, enabling the single photon strong coupling to be reached. This allows the investigation of a number of interesting phenomena such as photon blockade effects and the generation of nonclassical quantum states with electromechanical systems.

abstract: We analyze the diffraction regime of the Kapitza-Dirac effect for particles entangled in momentum. The detection patterns show two-particle interferences. In the single-mode case we identify a discontinuity in the set of joint detection probabilities, associated with the disconnected character of the space of non-separable states. For Gaussian multi-mode states we derive the diffraction patterns, providing an example of the dependence of the light-matter interaction on entanglement. When the particles are identical, we can explore the relation between exchange and entanglement effects. We find a complementary behavior between overlapping and Schmidt's number. In particular, symmetric entanglement can cancel the exchange effects.

abstract: When dealing with system-reservoir interactions in an open quantum system, such as a photosynthetic light-harvesting complex, approximations are usually made to obtain the dynamics of the system. One question immediately arises: how good are these approximations, and in what ways can we evaluate them? Here, we propose to use entanglement and a measure of non-Markovianity as benchmarks for the deviation of approximate methods from exact results. We apply two frequently-used perturbative but non-Markovian approximations to a photosynthetic dimer model and compare their results with that of the numerically-exact hierarchy equation of motion (HEOM). This enables us to explore both entanglement and non-Markovianity measures as means to reveal how the approximations either overestimate or underestimate memory effects and quantum coherence. In addition, we show that both the approximate and exact results suggest that non-Markonivity can, counter-intuitively, increase with temperature, and with the coupling to the environment.

abstract: So far, the two branches of real discrete spectrum of complex PT-symmetric Scarf II potential are kept isolated. Here, we suggest that these two need to be brought together as doublets: $E^n_{\pm}(\lambda)$ with $n=0,1,2...$. Then if strength $(\lambda)$ of the imaginary part of the potential is varied smoothly some pairs of eigenvalue curves can intersect and cross each other. This is unlike one dimensional Hermitian potentials. However, we show that the corresponding eigenstates are linearly dependent denying degeneracy in one dimension, once again. Other pairs of eigenvalue curves coalesce to complex-conjugate pairs completing the scenario of spontaneous breaking of PT-symmetry.

abstract: We propose and analyze a hybrid device by integrating a microscale diamond beam with a single built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin to a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavity. We find that under an ac electric field the quantized motion of the diamond beam can strongly couple to the single cavity photons via polarization interaction. Together with the strong spin-motion interaction via a large magnetic field gradient, it provides a hybrid quantum device where the diamond resonator can strongly couple both to the single microwave cavity photons and to the single NV center spin. This enables coherent information transfer and effective coupling between the NV spin and the CPW cavity via mechanically dark polaritons. This hybrid spin-electromechanical device, with tunable couplings by external fields, offers a realistic platform for implementing quantum information with single NV spins, diamond mechanical resonators, and single microwave photons.

We give the definition of linear canonical transformation with the transformation law of coordinate and momentum operators. We establish successively the transformation laws of mean values, dispersions, basis state and wave functions.Then we introduce the concept of isodispersion linear canonical transformation.

abstract: High-precision gyroscopes are a key component of inertial navigation systems. By considering matter wave gyroscopes that make use of entanglement it should be possible to gain some advantages in terms of sensitivity, size, and resources used over unentangled optical systems. In this paper we consider the details of such a quantum-enhanced atom interferometry scheme based on atoms trapped in a carefully-chosen rotating trap. We consider all the steps: entanglement generation, phase imprinting, and read-out of the signal and show that quantum enhancement should be possible in principle. While the improvement in performance over equivalent unentangled schemes is small, our feasibility study opens the door to further developments and improvements.

abstract: We study the Hilbert-Schmidt measure on the manifold of mixed Gaussian states in multi mode continuous variable quantum systems. An analytical expression for the Hilbert-Schmidt volume element is derived. Its corresponding probability measure can be used to study typical properties of Gaussian states. It turns out that although the manifold of Gaussian states is unbounded, an ensemble of Gaussian states distributed according to this measure still has a normalizable distribution of symplectic eigenvalues, from which unitarily invariant properties can be obtained. By contrast, we find that for an ensemble of one-mode Gaussian states based on the Bures measure the corresponding distribution cannot be normalized. As important applications, we determine the distribution and the mean value of von Neumann entropy and purity for the Hilbert-Schmidt measure.

abstract: We present improved circuits for the control-control-phase (Toffoli) gate and the control-swap (Fredkin) gate using three and four global two-qubit gates, respectively. This is a nearly double speed-up compared to the conventional circuits, which require five (for Toffoli) and seven (for Fredkin) conditional two-qubit gates. We apply the same approach to construct the conditional four-qubit phase gate by seven global two-qubit gates. We also present construction of the Toffoli and the Fredkin gates with five nearest-neighbour interactions. Our constructions do not employ ancilla qubits or ancilla internal states and are particularly well suited for ion qubits and for circuit QED systems, where the entangling operations can be implemented by global addressing.

abstract: We discuss foundational issues of quantum information biology (QIB) -- one of the most successful applications of the quantum formalism outside of physics. QIB provides a multi-scale model of information processing in bio-systems: from proteins and cells to cognitive and social systems. This theory has to be sharply distinguished from "traditional quantum biophysics". The latter is about quantum bio-physical processes, e.g., in cells or brains. QIB models the dynamics of information states of bio-systems. It is based on the quantum-like paradigm: complex bio-systems process information in accordance with the laws of quantum information and probability. This paradigm is supported by plenty of statistical bio-data collected at all scales, from molecular biology and genetics/epigenetics to cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. We argue that the information interpretation of quantum mechanics (its various forms were elaborated by Zeilinger and Brukner, Fuchs and Mermin, and D' Ariano) is the most natural interpretation of QIB. We also point out that QBIsm (Quantum Bayesianism) can serve to find a proper interpretation of bio-quantum probabilities. Biologically QIB is based on two principles: a) adaptivity; b) openness (bio-systems are fundamentally open). These principles are mathematically represented in the framework of a novel formalism -- quantum adaptive dynamics which, in particular, contains the standard theory of open quantum systems as a special case of adaptivity (to environment).

abstract: In superconducting quantum information, machined aluminum superconducting cavities have proven to be a well-controlled, low-dissipation electromagnetic environment for quantum circuits such as qubits. They can possess large internal quality factors, $Q_{int}>10^8$, and present the possibility of storing quantum information for times far exceeding those of microfabricated circuits. However, in order to be useful as a storage element, these cavities require a fast "read/write" mechanism--- in other words, they require tunable coupling between other systems of interest such as other cavity modes and qubits, as well as any associated readout hardware. In this work, we demonstrate these qualities in a simple dual cavity architecture in which a low-Q "readout" mode is parametrically coupled to a high-Q "storage" mode, allowing us to store and retrieve classical information. Specifically, we employ a flux-driven Josephson junction-based coupling scheme to controllably swap coherent states between two cavities, demonstrating full, sequenced control over the coupling rates between modes.

abstract: We measure the quantum speed of the state evolution of the field in a weakly-driven optical cavity QED system. To this end, the mode of the electromagnetic field is considered as a quantum system of interest with a preferential coupling to a tunable environment: the atoms. By controlling the environment, i.e., changing the number of atoms coupled to the optical cavity mode, an environment assisted speed-up is realized: the quantum speed of the state re-population in the optical cavity increases with the coupling strength between the optical cavity mode and this non-Markovian environment (the number of atoms).

abstract: We introduce a class of Markovian quantum master equations, able to describe the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system weakly coupled to one or several heat baths. The dissipative structure is driven by an entropic operator, the so called modular Hamiltonian, which makes it nonlinear. The generated Modular Dynamical Semigroup (MDS) is not, in general, a Quantum Dynamical Semigroup (QDS), whose dynamics is of the popular Lindblad type. The MDS has a robust thermodynamic structure, which guarantees for the positivity of the time evolved state, the correct steady state properties, the positivity of the entropy production, a positive Onsager matrix and Onsager symmetry relations (arising from Green-Kubo formulas). We show that the celebrated Davies generator, obtained through the Born and the secular approximations, generates a MDS. By unravelling the modular structure of the former, we provide a different and genuinely nonlinear MDS, not of QDS type, which is free from the severe spectral restrictions of the Davies generator, while still being supported by a weak coupling limit argument. With respect to the latter, the present work is a substantial extension of \cite{Ottinger2011_GEO,Ottinger2010_TLS_DHO}

abstract: The perturbation of the free rigid rotator by the trigonometric Scarf potential is shown to conserve its energy excitation patterns and change only the wave functions towards spherical harmonics rescaled by a function of an unspecified parity, or mixtures of such rescaled harmonics of equal magnetic quantum numbers and different angular momenta. In effect, no parity can be assigned to the states of the rotational bands emerging in this exotic way, and the electric dipole operator is allowed to acquire non-vanishing expectation values.

abstract: Do the laws of quantum physics still hold for macroscopic objects - this is at the heart of Schr\"odinger's cat paradox - or do gravitation or yet unknown effects set a limit for massive particles? What is the fundamental relation between quantum physics and gravity? Ground-based experiments addressing these questions may soon face limitations due to limited free-fall times and the quality of vacuum and microgravity. The proposed mission MAQRO may overcome these limitations and allow addressing those fundamental questions. MAQRO harnesses recent developments in quantum optomechanics, high-mass matter-wave interferometry as well as state-of-the-art space technology to push macroscopic quantum experiments towards their ultimate performance limits and to open new horizons for applying quantum technology in space. The main scientific goal of MAQRO is to probe the vastly unexplored "quantum-classical" transition for increasingly massive objects, testing the predictions of quantum theory for truly macroscopic objects in a size and mass regime unachievable in ground-based experiments. The hardware for the mission will largely be based on available space technology. Here, we present the MAQRO proposal submitted in response to the (M4) Cosmic Vision call of the European Space Agency for a medium-size mission opportunity with a possible launch in 2025.

abstract: In one dimension the area law for the entanglement entropy is violated maximally by the ground state of a strong inhomogeneous spin chain, the so called concentric singlet phase (CSP), that looks like a rainbow connecting the two halves of the chain. In this paper we show that, in the weak inhomogeneity limit, the rainbow state is a thermofield double of a conformal field theory with a temperature proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter. This result suggests some relation of the CSP with black holes. Finally, we propose an extension of the model to higher dimensions.

Moreover, our derivation allow to connect the decoherence of a relevant set of observables and the RTM through the quantum mixing level.

abstract: Smoothing is an estimation method whereby a classical state (probability distribution for classical variables) at a given time is conditioned on all-time (both past and future) observations. Here we define a smoothed quantum state for a partially monitored open quantum system, conditioned on an all-time monitoring-derived record. We calculate the smoothed distribution for a hypothetical unobserved record which, when added to the real record, would complete the monitoring, yielding a pure-state "quantum trajectory". Averaging the pure state over this smoothed distribution yields the (mixed) smoothed quantum state. We study how the choice of actual unravelling affects the purity increase over that of the conventional (filtered) state conditioned only on the past record.

abstract: We propose and demonstrate a pump-phase locking technique that makes use of weak pump depletion (WPD) - an unavoidable effect that is usually neglected - in a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO). We show that the phase difference between seed and pump beam is imprinted on both light fields by the non-linear interaction in the crystal and can be read out without disturbing the squeezed output. Our new locking technique allows for the first experimental realization of a pump-phase lock by reading out the pre-existing phase information in the pump field. There is no degradation of the detected squeezed states required to implement this scheme.

We generated two pairs of non-degenerate polarization entangled photons at 780~nm and 1551~nm by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and distributed the two photons at 1551~nm through a collective phase damping channel which gives the same amount of random phase shift on the two photons. Through local operation and classical communication, we extracted an entangled photon pair from two phase-disturbed photon pairs. An observed fidelity of the extracted photon pair to a maximally entangled photon pair was 0.73 $\pm$ 0.07 which clearly shows the recovery of entanglement.

abstract: We derive a generalized wave-particle duality relation for arbitrary dimensional multi-path quantum interference phenomena. Beyond the traditional signature of the wave nature of a quantum system, i.e., the fringe visibility, we introduce a novel quantifier as the normalized quantum coherence, recently defined in the frame-work of quantum information theory. To witness the particle nature, we quantify the path distinguishability or the which-path information based on unambiguous quantum state discrimination. Then, the Bohr complementarity principle, for multi-path quantum interference, can be stated as a duality relation between the quantum coherence and the path distinguishability. For two-path interference, the quantum coherence is identical to the interference fringe visibility, and the relation reduces to the well-know complementarity relation. The new duality relation continues to hold in the case where mixedness is introduced due to possible decoherence effects.

abstract: When applied on some particular quantum entangled states, measurements are universal for quantum computing. In particular, despite the fondamental probabilistic evolution of quantum measurements, any unitary evolution can be simulated by a measurement-based quantum computer (MBQC). We consider the extended version of the MBQC where each measurement can occur not only in the (X,Y)-plane of the Bloch sphere but also in the (X,Z)- and (Y,Z)-planes. The existence of a gflow in the underlying graph of the computation is a necessary and sufficient condition for a certain kind of determinism. We extend the focused gflow (a gflow in a particular normal form) defined for the (X,Y)-plane to the extended case, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such normal forms.

abstract: In a recent work, Bombin, Duclos-Cianci, and Poulin showed that every local translationally invariant 2D topological stabilizer code is locally equivalent to a finite number of copies of Kitaev's toric code. For 2D color codes, Delfosse relaxed the constraint on translation invariance and mapped a 2D color code onto three surface codes. In this paper, we propose an alternate map based on linear algebra. We show that any 2D color code can be mapped onto exactly two copies of a related surface code. The surface code in our map is induced by the color code and easily derived from the color code. Furthermore, our map does not require any ancilla qubits for the surface codes.

abstract: The ability to interface multiple optical quantum devices is a key milestone towards the development of future quantum networks that are capable of sharing and processing quantum information encoded in light. One of the requirements for any node of these quantum networks will be cascadability, i.e. the ability to drive the input of a node using the output of another node. Here, we report the cascading of quantum light-matter interfaces by storing few-photon level pulses of light in warm vapor followed by the subsequent storage of the retrieved field onto a second ensemble. We demonstrate that even after the sequential storage, the final signal-to-background ratio can remain greater than 1 for weak pulses containing 8 input photons on average.

abstract: Normally, quantum fluctuations enhance the escape from metastable states in the presence of dissipation. Here we show that dissipation can enhance the stability of a quantum metastable system, consisting of a particle moving in a strongly asymmetric double well potential, interacting with a thermal bath. We find that the escape time from the metastable state has a nonmonotonic behavior versus the system-bath coupling and the temperature, producing a stabilizing effect.

abstract: The trace distance (TD) possesses several of the good properties required for a faithful distance measure in the quantum state space. Despite its importance and ubiquitous use in quantum information science, one of its questionable features, its possible non-monotonicity under taking tensor products of its arguments (NMuTP), has been hitherto unexplored. In this article we advance analytical and numerical investigations of this issue considering different classes of states living in a discrete and finite dimensional Hilbert space. Our results reveal that although this property of TD does not shows up for pure states and for some very particular classes of mixed states, it is present in a non-negligible fraction of the regarded density operators. Hence, even though the percentage of quartets of states leading to the NMuTP drawback of TD and its strength decrease as the system's dimension grows, this property of TD must be taken into account before using it as a figure of merit for distinguishing mixed quantum states.

abstract: The scattering amplitude from a set of discrete states coupled to a continuum became known as the Fano profile, characteristic for its asymmetric lineshape and originally investigated in the context of photoionization. The generality of the model, and the proliferation of engineered nanostructured with confined states gives immense success to the Fano lineshape which is invoked whenever an asymmetric lineshape is encountered. However, many of these systems do not conform to the initial model worked out by Fano in that i) they are subject to dissipative processes and ii) the observables are not entirely analogous to the ones measured in the original photoionization experiments. In this letter, we work out the full optical response of a Fano model with dissipation. We find that the exact result for absorption, Raman, Rayleigh and fluorescence emission is a modified Fano profile where the typical lineshape has an additional Lorentzian contribution.

abstract: Since their discovery in 1927, the Heisenberg Inequalities have become an icon of quantum mechanics. Often inappropriately referred to as the Uncertainty Principle, these inequalities relating the standard deviations of the position and momentum observables to Planck's constant are one of the cornerstones of the quantum formalism even if the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics remains still open to controversy nowadays. The Heisenberg Inequalities governing translational motion are well understood. However, the corresponding inequalities pertaining to rotational motion have not been established so far. To fill this gap, we present here the Rotational Heisenberg Inequalities relating the standard deviations of the orientation axis and orbital angular momentum observables of an isolated molecule. The reason for choosing this system is that a molecule separated from its environment corresponds to a bound system preserving the orbital angular momentum.

abstract: We present the formalism of Time-dependent Exchange Perturbation Theory (TDEPT) built to all orders of perturbation, for the arbitrary time dependency of perturbation. The theory takes into account the rearrangement of electrons among centres. We show how the formalism can be reduced to the standard form of invariant perturbation theory by 'switching off' the re-arrangement of electrons among centres. The elements of the scattering S-matrix and transitions T-matrix and the formula for the electron scattering differential cross section are derived. The application of the theory to scattering and collision problems is discussed. As an example, we apply the theory to proton scattering on a Lithium atom, calculating the differential and total cross-sections.

abstract: The lack of suitable quantum emitters in silicon and silicon-based materials has prevented the realization of room temperature, compact, stable, and integrated sources of single photons in a scalable on-chip architecture, so far. Current approaches rely on exploiting the enhanced optical nonlinearity of silicon through light confinement or slow-light propagation, and are based on parametric processes that typically require substantial input energy and spatial footprint to reach a reasonable output yield. Here we propose an alternative all-silicon device that employs a different paradigm, namely the interplay between quantum interference and the third-order intrinsic nonlinearity in a system of two coupled optical cavities. This unconventional photon blockade allows to produce antibunched radiation at extremely low input powers. We demonstrate a reliable protocol to operate this mechanism under pulsed optical excitation, as required for device applications, thus implementing a true single-photon source. We finally propose a state-of-art implementation in a standard silicon-based photonic crystal integrated circuit that outperforms existing parametric devices either in input power or footprint area.

abstract: We consider the Rabi Hamiltonian which exhibits a quantum phase transition (QPT) despite consisting only of a single-mode cavity field and a two-level atom. We prove QPT by deriving an exact solution in the limit where the atomic transition frequency in unit of the cavity frequency tends to infinity. The effect of a finite transition frequency is studied by analytically calculating finite-frequency scaling exponents as well as performing a numerically exact diagonalization. Going beyond this equilibrium QPT setting, we prove that the dynamics under slow quenches in the vicinity of the critical point is universal, that is, the dynamics is completely characterized by critical exponents. Our analysis demonstrates that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism can precisely predict the universal scaling of residual energy for a model without spatial degrees of freedom. Moreover, we find that the onset of the universal dynamics can be observed even with a finite transition frequency.

abstract: In a periodically driven many-body system, particles will start to oscillate rapidly. If the particles are interacting, they change their distance and therefore their interaction energy rapidly due to the oscillation. We show that in the case of a one-dimensional (1D) system this leads to an average interaction potential in the rotating frame that can be substantially different from the stationary interaction. A short-range 1D interaction, becomes a long-range two-dimensional (2D) interaction which depends on the distance in the phase space of the rotating frame. In fact, for every interaction potential which decays faster than the inverse square of the two particles' distance in real space, the corresponding average interaction energy increases with their distance in phase space of the rotating frame. The \textit{phase space interaction potential} describes the effect of the interaction on the slowly changing amplitude and phase of the particles, while the fast oscillations take on the role of a force carrier, which allows for interaction over much larger effective distances. We directly treat our system quantum mechanically and calculate explicitly the eigenstates of two interacting fermions in a driven harmonic potential. Under a driving which allows for multiple stable states in phase space, we propose the concept of \textit{exchange quasienergy} and investigate its dependence on system parameters. In experiments, the novel effects related to exchange quasienergy can be directly measured and may create a new way to manipulate entangled states of atoms.

abstract: A minimax estimator has the minimum possible error ("risk") in the worst case. We construct the first minimax estimators for quantum state tomography with relative entropy risk. The minimax risk of non-adaptive tomography scales as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, in contrast to that of classical probability estimation which is $O(1/N)$. We trace this deficiency to sampling mismatch: future observations that determine risk may come from a different sample space than the past data that determine the estimate. This makes minimax estimators very biased, and we propose a computationally tractable alternative with similar behavior in the worst case, but superior accuracy on most states.

abstract: We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional array of QED cavities where, besides the single-photon hopping, an additional coupling between neighboring cavities is mediated by an N-type four-level system. By varying the relative strength of the various couplings, the array is shown to exhibit a variety of quantum phases including a polaritonic Mott insulator, a density-wave and a superfluid phase. Our results have been obtained by means of numerical density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The phase diagram was obtained by analyzing the energy gaps for the polaritons, as well as through a study of two-point correlation functions.

abstract: We propose an architecture for realizing quantum information transfer (QIT). In this architecture, a LC circuit is used to induce the necessary interaction between flux qubits, each magnetically coupling to a nitrogen-vacancy center ensemble (NVCE). We explicitly show that for resonant interaction and large detuning cases, high-fidelity QIT between two spatially-separated NVCEs can be implemented. Our proposal can be extended to achieve QIT between any two selected NVCEs in a large hybrid system by adjusting system parameters, which is important in large scale quantum information processing.

abstract: Optically measuring in the photon counting regime is a recurrent challenge in modern physics and a guarantee to develop weakly invasive probes. Here we investigate this idea on a hybrid nano-optomechanical system composed of a nanowire hybridized to a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defect. The vibrations of the nanoresonator grant a spatial degree of freedom to the quantum emitter and the photon emission event can now vary in space and time. We investigate how the nanomotion is encoded on the detected photon statistics and explore their spatio-temporal correlation properties. This allows a quantitative measurement of the vibrations of the nanomechanical oscillator at unprecedentedly low light intensities in the photon counting regime when less than one photon is detected per oscillation period, where standard detectors are dark-noise-limited. These results have implications for probing weakly interacting nanoresonators, for low temperature experiments and for investigating single moving markers.

The developed approaches are applied to a quantitative description of recently predicted flickerings (periodic birth and death) of the quantum-information pair correlation between nuclear 1/2 spin of atoms or molecules of a gas (for examples Xe^129) in a finite asymmetric volume in the presence of a strong magnetic field.

abstract: We address the use of entangled qubits as quantum probes to characterize the dynamical noise induced by complex environments. In particular, we show that entangled probes improve estimation of the correlation time for a broad class of environmental noises compared to any sequential strategy involving single qubit preparation. The effect is present when the noise is faster than a threshold value, a regime which may always be achieved by tuning the coupling between the quantum probe and the environment inducing the noise. Our scheme exploits time-dependent sensitivity of quantum systems to decoherence and does not require dynamical control on the probes. We derive the optimal interaction time and the optimal probe preparation, showing that it corresponds to multiqubit GHZ states when entanglement is useful. We also show robustness of the scheme against depolarization or dephasing of the probe, and discuss simple measurements approaching optimal precision.

abstract: We propose a method for tailoring the frequency spectrum of bright squeezed vacuum by generating it in a nonlinear interferometer, consisting of two down-converting nonlinear crystals separated by a dispersive medium. Due to a faster dispersive spreading of higher-order Schmidt modes, the spectral width of the radiation at the output is reduced as the length of the dispersive medium is increased. Preliminary results show 30\% spectral narrowing.

abstract: The full characterization of quantum polarization of light requires the knowledge of all the moments of the Stokes variables, which are appropriately encoded in the multipole expansion of the density matrix. We look into the cumulative distribution of those multipoles and work out the corresponding extremal states. We find that SU(2) coherent states are maximal to any order. The converse case of pure states minimizing that distribution (which can be seen as the most quantum ones) is investigated for a diverse range of number of photons.

abstract: We compare the quantum and classical properties of the (Quantum) Isoperiodic Stable Structures -- (Q)ISSs -- which organize the parameter space of a paradigmatic dissipative ratchet model, i.e. the dissipative modified kicked rotator. We study the spectral behavior of the corresponding classical Perron-Frobenius operators with thermal noise and the quantum superoperators without it for small $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ values. We find a remarkable similarity between the classical and quantum spectra. This finding significantly extends previous results -- obtained for the mean currents and asymptotic distributions only -- and on the other hand unveils a classical to quantum correspondence mechanism where the classical noise is qualitatively different from the quantum one. This is crucial not only for simple attractors but also for chaotic ones, where just analyzing the asymptotic distribution reveals insufficient. Moreover, we provide with a detailed characterization of relevant eigenvectors by means of the corresponding Weyl-Wigner distributions, in order to better identify similarities and differences. Finally, this model being generic, it allows us to conjecture that this classical to quantum correspondence mechanism is a universal feature of dissipative systems.

abstract: Nonlinear quantum optical systems are of paramount relevance for modern quantum technologies, as well as for the study of dissipative phase transitions. Their nonlinear nature makes their theoretical study very challenging and hence they have always served as great motivation to develop new techniques for the analysis of open quantum systems. In this article we apply the recently developed self-consistent projection operator theory to the degenerate optical parametric oscillator to exemplify its general applicability to quantum optical systems. We show that this theory provides an efficient method to calculate the full quantum state of each mode with high degree of accuracy, even at the critical point. It is equally successful in describing both the stationary limit and the dynamics, including regions of the parameter space where the numerical integration of the full problem is significantly less efficient. We further develop a Gaussian approach consistent with our theory, which yields sensibly better results than the previous Gaussian methods developed for this system, most notably standard linearization techniques.

abstract: We derive perturbation analytic expressions for the Casimir free energy and entropy between two dissimilar ferromagnetic plates which are applicale at arbitrarily low temperature. The dielectric properties of metals are described using either the nondissipative plasma model or the Drude model taking into account the dissipation of free charge carriers. Both cases of constant and frequency-dependent magnetic permeability are considered. It is shown that for ferromagnetic metals described by the plasma model the Casimir entropy goes to zero when the temperature vanishes, i.e., the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. For ferromagnetic metals with perfect crystal lattices described by the Drude model the Casimir entropy goes to a nonzero constant depending on the parameters of a system with vanishing temperature, i.e., the Nernst heat theorem is violated. This constant can be positive which is quite different from the earlier investigated case of two nonmagnetic metals.

abstract: Heralded spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has become the mainstay for single-photon state preparation in present-day photonics experiments. Because they are heralded, in principle one knows when a single photon has been prepared. However, the heralding efficiencies in experimentally realistic SPDC sources are typically very low. To overcome this, multiplexing techniques have been proposed which employ a bank of SPDC sources in parallel, and route successfully heralded photons to the output, thereby effectively boosting the heralding efficiency. However, running a large bank of independent SPDC sources is costly and requires complex switching. We analyse a multiplexing technique based on time-bin encoding that allows the heralding efficiency of just a single SPDC source to be increased. The scheme is simple and experimentally viable using present-day technology. We analyse the operation of the scheme in terms of experimentally realistic considerations, such as losses, detector inefficiency, and pump-power.

abstract: A universal deterministic noiseless quantum amplifier has been shown to be impossible. However, probabilistic noiseless amplification of a certain set of states is physically permissible. Regarding quantum state amplification as quantum state transformation, we show that deterministic noiseless amplification of coherent states chosen from a proper set is possible. The relation between input coherent states and gain of amplification for deterministic noiseless amplification is thus derived. Besides, the potential applications of amplification of coherent states in quantum key distribution (QKD), noisy channel and non-ideal detection are also discussed.

abstract: Light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has great potentials in both classical and quantum optical communications such as enhancing the transmission capacity of a single communication channel because of its unlimited dimensions. Based on OAM conservation in second order nonlinear interaction processes, we create a classical to quantum optical network link in OAM degree of freedoms of light via sum frequency generation (SFG) following by a spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). A coherent OAM-carrying beams at telecom wavelength 1550nm is up-converted to 525.5nm OAM-carrying beams in the first crystal, then up-converted OAM-carrying beam is used to pump a second crystal to generate non-degenerate OAM entangled photon pairs at 795nm and 1550nm. By switching the OAM carries by the classical party, the OAM correlation in the quantum party is shifted. High OAM entanglements in two dimensional subspaces are verified. This primary study enables to build a hybrid optical communication network contains both classical and quantum optical network nodes.

abstract: This is the second of a series of three papers examining how viable it is for entanglement to be sustained at high temperatures for quantum systems in thermal equilibrium (Case A), in nonequilibrium (Case B) and in nonequilibrium steady state conditions (Case C). The system we analyze here consists of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath described by a scalar field, set at temperatures $T_1 > T_2$. For \textit{constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling} studied here (Case C1) owing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary temperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement criterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in contrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the temperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard the entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will disappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the critical temperature $T_c$. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full display of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$ , the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For weak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order of the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it will depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic circumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling, `hot entanglement' is largely a fiction. In Paper III we will examine the case (C2) of \textit{time-dependent driven coupling } which contains the parametric pumping type described in [2] wherein entanglement was first shown to sustain at high temperatures.

abstract: A new type of basis functions is proposed to describe a two-electron continuum which arises as a final state in electron-impact ionization and double photoionization of atomic systems. We name these functions, which are calculated in terms of the recently introduced Quasi Sturmian functions, Convoluted Quasi Sturmian functions (CQS). By construction, the CQS functions look asymptotically like a six-dimensional spherical wave. The driven equation describing an $(e, 3e)$ process on helium in the framework of the Temkin-Poet model has been solved numerically using expansions on the basis CQS functions. The convergence behavior of the solution has been examined as the size of the basis has been increased. The calculations show that the convergence rate is significantly improved by introducing a phase factor corresponding the electron-electron interaction into the basis functions. Such a modification of the boundary conditions leads to appreciable change in the magnitude of the solution.

Analytical expressions for the many-body scattering cross section are derived from a strong-coupling expansion and a site-decoupling mean-field approximation, and compared to numerically obtained exact results. In the thermodynamic limit, we find a non-vanishing inelastic cross section throughout the Mott insulating regime, which decays quadratically as a function of the boson-boson interaction.

abstract: We improve the entropic uncertainty relations for position and momentum coarse-grained measurements. We derive the continuous, coarse-grained counterparts of the discrete uncertainty relations based on the concept of majorization. The obtained entropic inequalities involve two R\'enyi entropies of the same order, and thus go beyond the standard scenario with conjugated parameters. In a special case describing the sum of two Shannon entropies the majorization-based bounds significantly outperform the currently known results in the regime of larger coarse graining, and might thus be useful for entanglement detection in continuous variables.

Here we discuss whether and how partially free random sources bring us new randomness in semi-device-independent scenario. We propose a semi-device-independent randomness expansion protocol with partially free random sources, and obtain the condition that the partially free random sources should satisfy to generate new randomness. In the process of analysis, we acquire a new 2-dimensional quantum witness. Furthermore, we get the analytic relationship between the generated randomness and the 2-dimensional quantum witness violation.

abstract: We generalize the Moyal equation, which describes the dynamics of quantum observables in phase space, to quantum systems coupled to a reservoir. It is shown that phase space observables become functionals of fluctuating noise forces introduced by the coupling to the reservoir. For Markovian reservoirs, the Moyal equation turns into a functional differential equation in which the reservoir's effect can be described by a single parameter.

abstract: Quantum physics revolutionized classical disciplines of mechanics, statistical physics, and electrodynamics. One branch of scientific knowledge however seems untouched: thermodynamics. Major motivation behind thermodynamics is to develop efficient heat engines. Technology has a trend to miniaturize engines, reaching to quantum regimes. Development of quantum heat engines (QHEs) requires emerging field of quantum thermodynamics. Studies of QHEs debate whether quantum coherence can be used as a resource. We explore an alternative where it can function as an effective catalyst. We propose a QHE which consists of a photon gas inside an optical cavity as the working fluid and quantum coherent atomic clusters as the fuel. Utilizing the superradiance, where a cluster can radiate quadratically faster than a single atom, we show that the work output becomes proportional to the square of the number of the atoms. In addition to practical value of cranking up QHE, our result is a fundamental difference of a quantum fuel from its classical counterpart.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the effect of optical feedback from a cavity containing an ultracold two level atomic ensemble, on the bistable behavior shown by mean intracavity optical field and the ground state cooling effect of the mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical cavity resonator. The optical bistability can be controlled by tuning the frequency and power of the single driving laser as well as by varying the atom-cavity coupling strength in the atomic cavity. Study of the cooling of the mechanical oscillator, in both good and bad cavity limits, reveals that the hybrid system is more efficient in cooling in comparison to a generic optomechanical setup, even at room temperature. In essence, our work emphasizes the impact of the coupling with the atomic cavity on the radiation pressure effects in the optomechanical cavity.

abstract: In this work, we are interested on the implementation of single-qubit gates on coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The system, a feasible candidate for a qubit, consists on condensed atoms of different hyperfine levels coupled by a two-photon transition. It is well established that the dynamics of coupled BECs can be described by the two-mode Hamiltonian which takes into account the confinement potential of the trap and the effects of collisions associated with each condensate. Other effects, as collisions between atoms belonging to different BECs and detuning are included in this approach. We demonstrate how to implement two types of quantum logic gates: \textit{transfer-population} gates (NOT, $\hat{Y}$, and Hadamard), which require inversion of population between hyperfine levels, and \textit{phase} gates ($\hat{Z}$, $\hat{S}$, and $\hat{T}$), which require self-trapping. We also discuss the experimental feasibility, checking the robustness of quantum gates against variations of physical parameters out of the ideal conditions for implementation of each quantum logic gate.

abstract: Applications of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond exploit the center's unique optical and spin properties, which at ambient temperature, are predominately governed by electron-phonon interactions. Here, we investigate these interactions at ambient and elevated temperatures by observing the motional narrowing of the center's excited state spin resonances. We determine that the center's Jahn-Teller dynamics are much slower than currently believed and identify the vital role of symmetric phonon modes. Our results have pronounced implications for center's diverse applications (including quantum technology) and for understanding its fundamental properties.

abstract: The complexity of a quantum state may be closely related to the usefulness of the state for quantum computation. We discuss this link using the tree size of a multiqubit state, a complexity measure that has two noticeable (and, so far, unique) features: it is in principle computable, and non-trivial lower bounds can be obtained, hence identifying truly complex states. In this paper, we first review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the most complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we revisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with superpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the Shor's states and the subgroup states, are described. We showed that the universal resource state for measurement based quantum computation, the 2D-cluster state, has superpolynomial tree size. Moreover, we showed how the complexity of subgroup states and the 2D cluster state can be verified efficiently. The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved in quantum computation is also addressed. We show that superpolynomial tree size of the resource state is essential for measurement based quantum computation. The necessary role of large tree size in the circuit model of quantum computation is still a conjecture; and we prove a weaker version of the conjecture.

abstract: We consider a family of translation-invariant quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for these systems to be gapped in the thermodynamic limit. More precisely, let $\psi$ be an arbitrary two-qubit state. We consider a chain of $n$ qubits with open boundary conditions and Hamiltonian $H_n(\psi)$ which is defined as the sum of rank-1 projectors onto $\psi$ applied to consecutive pairs of qubits. We show that the spectral gap of $H_n(\psi)$ is upper bounded by $1/(n-1)$ if the eigenvalues of a certain two-by-two matrix simply related to $\psi$ have equal non-zero absolute value. Otherwise, the spectral gap is lower bounded by a positive constant independent of $n$ (depending only on $\psi$). A key ingredient in the proof is a new operator inequality for the ground space projector which expresses a monotonicity under the partial trace. This monotonicity property appears to be very general and might be interesting in its own right. As an extension of our main result, we obtain a complete classification of gapped and gapless phases of frustration-free translation-invariant spin-1/2 chains with nearest-neighbor interactions.

We present the quantum version of fully homomorphic encryption scheme, which is constructed based on quantum fault-tolerant construction. Two schemes are constructed. The first is a symmetric scheme, and the secret key is the quantum CSS code. In the scheme, when Server performs quantum computation on the encrypted plaintext, some ancillary quantum states should be provided by Client. The second is an asymmetric scheme, which contains the periodical interaction between Client and Server.

We also propose a general procedure for finding unitary propagators and corresponding Hamiltonians to realize such cooling by means of inverse engineering technique.

abstract: Magnetic resonance with ensembles of electron spins is nowadays performed in frequency ranges up to 240 GHz and in corresponding magnetic fields of up to 10 T. However, experiments with single electron and nuclear spins so far only reach into frequency ranges of several 10 GHz, where existing coplanar waveguide structures for microwave (MW) delivery are compatible with single spin readout techniques (e.g. electrical or optical readout). Here, we explore the frequency range up to 90 GHz, respectively magnetic fields of up to $\approx 3\,$T for single spin magnetic resonance in conjunction with optical spin readout. To this end, we develop MW resonators with optical single spin access. In our case, rectangular E-band waveguides guarantee low-loss supply of microwaves to the resonators. Three dimensional cavities, as well as coplanar waveguide resonators enhance MW fields by spatial and spectral confinement with a MW efficiency of $1.36\,\mathrm{mT/\sqrt{W}}$. We utilize single NV centers as hosts for optically accessible spins, and show, that their properties regarding optical spin readout known from smaller fields (<0.65 T) are retained up to fields of 3 T. In addition, we demonstrate coherent control of single nuclear spins under these conditions. Furthermore, our results extend the applicable magnetic field range of a single spin magnetic field sensor. Regarding spin based quantum registers, high fields lead to a purer product basis of electron and nuclear spins, which promises improved spin lifetimes. For example, during continuous single-shot readout the $^{14}$N nuclear spin shows second-long longitudinal relaxation times.

abstract: The recently introduced by us two- and three-parameter (p,q)- and (p,q,\mu)-deformed extensions of the Heisenberg algebra were explored under the condition of their connectedness with the respective (nonstandard) deformed quantum oscillator algebras. In this paper we show that such connectedness dictates certain \eta(N)-pseudo-Hemitian conjugation (with \eta(N) depending on the particle number operator N) between the creation and annihilation operators. Likewise, proper \eta(N)-pseudo-Hemiticity characterizes position and momentum operators, while the involved Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Different possible cases are analyzed, and some interesting features stemming from the use of such \eta(N)-based conjugation are emphasized.

abstract: We provide an experimentally measurable local gauge $U(1)$ invariant Fubini-Study (FS) metric for mixed states. Like the FS metric for pure states, it also captures only the quantum part of the uncertainty in the evolution Hamiltonian. We show that this satisfies the quantum Cramer-Rao bound and thus arrive at a more general and measurable bound. Upon imposing the monotonicity condition, it reduces to the square-root derivative quantum Fisher Information. We show that on the Fisher information metric space dynamical phase is zero. A relation between square root derivative and logarithmic derivative is formulated such that both give the same Fisher information. We generalize the Fubini-Study metric for mixed states further and arrive at a set of Fubini-Study metric---called $\alpha$ metric. This newly defined $\alpha$ metric also satisfies the Cramer-Rao bound. Again by imposing the monotonicity condition on this metric, we derive the monotone $\alpha$ metric. It reduces to the Fisher information metric for $\alpha=1$.

For the particular cases of the Morse and Modified P\"oschl-Teller potentials, modeled as f-deformed oscillators (both supporting a finite number of bound states), the properties of their corresponding nonlinear coherent states, viewed as DOCS, are analyzed in terms of their occupation number distribution, their evolution on phase space, and their uncertainty relations.

Other interferometer effects can occur, including a violation of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt form of the Bell inequality. With interactions, one sees various effects including so-called fermionization, collective tunneling, and self-trapping.

abstract: Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI) can be viewed as a statement of concavity of an entropic function of a continuous random variable under a scaled addition rule: $$f(\sqrt{a}\,X + \sqrt{1-a}\,Y) \geq a f(X) + (1-a) f(Y) \quad \forall \, a \in [0,1].$$ Here, $X$ and $Y$ are continuous random variables and the function $f$ is either the differential entropy or, for $a=1/2$, the entropy power. Konig and Smith [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory. 60(3):1536--1548, 2014] obtained quantum analogues of these inequalities for continuous-variable quantum systems, where $X$ and $Y$ are replaced by bosonic fields and the addition rule is the action of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$ on those fields. In this paper, we similarly establish a class of EPI analogues for $d$-level quantum systems (i.e. qudits). The underlying addition rule for which these inequalities hold is given by a quantum channel that depends on the parameter $a \in [0,1]$ and acts like a finite-dimensional analogue of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$, converting a two-qudit product state into a single qudit state. We refer to this channel as a partial swap channel because of the particular way its output interpolates between the states of the two qudits in the input as $a$ is changed from zero to one. We obtain analogues of Shannon's EPI, not only for the von Neumann entropy and the entropy power for the output of such channels, but for a much larger class of functions as well. This class includes the Renyi entropies and the subentropy. We also prove a qudit analogue of the entropy photon number inequality (EPnI). Finally, for the subclass of partial swap channels for which one of the qudit states in the input is fixed, our EPIs and EPnI yield lower bounds on the minimum output entropy and upper bounds on the Holevo capacity.

abstract: We argue that a quantum annealer at very long annealing times is likely to experience a quasistatic evolution, returning a final population that is close to a Boltzmann distribution of the Hamiltonian at a single (freeze-out) point during the annealing. Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for quantum speedup.

abstract: We propose a new three-party quantum private comparison protocol using genuinely maximally entangled six-qubit states. In our protocol, three participants can determine whether their private information are equal or not without an external third party who helps compute the comparison result. At the same time the participants can preserve the privacy of their inputs, respectively. Our protocol does not need any unitary operations to encode information due to the excellent properties of genuinely maximally entangled six-qubit states. Additionally, the protocol uses one-step quantum transmission and it is congenitally free from Trojan horse attacks. We have also shown that our protocol is secure against outside and participant attacks in this paper.

We analyze the role of the finiteness of the gauge fields and the properties of physical states, that satisfy a generalized Gauss's law. We finally discuss a possible implementation strategy, that involves an effective dynamics in physical space.

abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a promising strategy for generating a significantly increased non-thermal spin polarization in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) applications thereby circumventing the need for strong magnetic fields. Although much explored in recent experiments, a detailed theoretical understanding of the precise mechanism behind DNP is so far lacking. We address this issue by theoretically investigating solid effect DNP in a system where a single electron is coupled to an ensemble of interacting nuclei and which can be microscopically modelled by a quantum master equation. By deriving effective equations of motion that govern the polarization dynamics we show analytically that DNP can be understood as kinetically constrained spin diffusion. On the one hand this approach provides analytical insights into the mechanism and timescales underlying DNP. On the other hand it permits the numerical study of large ensembles which are typically intractable from the perspective of a quantum master equation. This paves the way for a detailed exploration of DNP dynamics which might form the basis for future NMR applications.

We then come up with a duality between the dark state and the quasi-dark state.

We illustrate this difference by providing a simple example based on the classification of 2D data.

abstract: We prove new results on common cause closedness of quantum probability spaces, where by a quantum probability space is meant the projection lattice of a non-commutative von Neumann algebra together with a countably additive probability measure on the lattice. Common cause closedness is the feature that for every correlation between a pair of commuting projections there exists in the lattice a third projection commuting with both of the correlated projections and which is a Reichenbachian common cause of the correlation. The main result we prove is that a quantum probability space is common cause closed if and only if it has at most one measure theoretic atom. This result improves earlier ones published in Z. GyenisZ and M. Redei Erkenntnis 79 (2014) 435-451. The result is discussed from the perspective of status of the Common Cause Principle. Open problems on common cause closedness of general probability spaces $(\mathcal{L},\phi)$ are formulated, where $\mathcal{L}$ is an orthomodular bounded lattice and $\phi$ is a probability measure on $\mathcal{L}$.

abstract: Security against simple eavesdropping attacks is demonstrated for a recently proposed quantum key distribution protocol which uses the Fibonacci recursion relation to enable high-capacity key generation with entangled photon pairs. No transmitted pairs need to be discarded in reconciliation; the only pairs not used for key generation are those used for security-checking. Although the proposed approach does not allow eavesdropper-induced errors to be detected on single trials, it can nevertheless reveal the eavesdropper's action on the quantum channel by detecting changes in the distribution of outcome probabilities over multiple trials, and can do so as well as the BB84 protocol. The mutual information shared by the participants is calculated and used to show that a secret key can always be distilled.

abstract: Quantum technologies based on optical Gaussian states have proven very promising in terms of scalability. However, their use in quantum networking is hindered by the fact that Gaussian entanglement cannot be distilled via Gaussian operations. We take advantage of hybrid optomechanical systems to address this problem, proposing a scheme to distill optical two-mode squeezed vacua via unsharp measurements. Here, one of the optical modes is injected into a single sided Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and non-linearly coupled to a mechanical oscillator. Afterwards, the position of the oscillator is measured using pulsed optomechanics and homodyne detection. Our results show that this measurement can conditionally increase the initial entanglement under an optimal radiation-pressure interaction strength, which corresponds to an effective unsharp non-Gaussian measurement of the photon number inside the cavity. We show how the resulting entanglement distillation can be verified by using a standard quantum teleportation procedure.

Based on a general functional form for the inter-atomic couplings, our description covers a wide range of possible electromagnetic reservoirs. We derive a criterion for the emergence of superradiant states as a function of the dimension and the type of the atom-atom coupling. We then exploit the scaling properties of the decay rate's enhancement factor to categorize and compare superradiant states across different physical realizations, providing a "bridge" between the various theoretical and experimental approaches to superradiance in extended media.

abstract: Here we show that, in principle it is possible to clone (measure) a single arbitrary unknown quantum state of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle (an electron) with arbitrary precision and with success probability tending to one, using protective measurement. We first transfer the information from spin to spatial degree of freedom (d.o.f) of system electron, then trap it in a double well potential, and finally measure it protectively using a probe electron (which donot get entangled with system electron, but still extracts expectation value of an observable from a single quantum system (system electron)) to obtain information about the unknown spin polarization. Nonorthogonal state discrimination being a subclass of cloning, part of the paper (till finding out $\theta_{m}$, polar angle corresponding to the unknown spin polarization) is sufficient for discrimination.

abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient high-dimensional quantum state transfer protocol in an XX coupling spin network with a hypercube structure or chain structure. Under free spin wave approximation, unitary evolution results in a perfect high-dimensional quantum swap operation requiring neither external manipulation nor weak coupling. Evolution time is independent of either distance between registers or dimensions of sent states, which can enable improvements in computational efficiency. In the low temperature regime and thermodynamic limit, the decoherence by noisy environment is studied with a model of an antiferromagnetic spin bath coupled to quantum channels via an Ising type interaction is studied. it is found that while the decoherence reduces the fidelity of state transfer, increasing intra-channel coupling can strongly suppress such effects. These observations demonstrate that robustness of the proposed scheme.

abstract: Isoelectronic differential force measurements provide a unique opportunity to probe controversial features of the thermal Casimir effect, that are still much debated in the current literature. Isolectronic setups offer two major advantages over conventional Casimir setups. On one hand they are immune from electrostatic forces caused by potential patches on the plates surfaces, that plague present Casimir experiments especially for separations in the micron range. On the other hand they can strongly enhance the discrepancy between alternative theoretical models that have been proposed to estimate the thermal Casimir force for metallic and magnetic surfaces. Thanks to these two features, isoelectronic differential experiments should allow to establish conclusively which among these models correctly describes the thermal Casimir force.

abstract: We study a spin-boson chain that exhibits a local Z2 symmetry. We investigate the quantum phase diagram of the model by means of perturbation theory, mean field theory and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our calculations show the existence of a first order phase transition in the region where the boson quantum dynamics is slow compared to the spin-spin interactions. Our model can be implemented with trapped ion quantum simulators, leading to a realization of minimal models showing local gauge invariance and first order phase transitions.

abstract: We study a recently proposed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering inequality [arXiv- 1412.8178 (2014)]. Analogous to Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for Bell nonlocality, in the simplest scenario, i.e., 2 parties, 2 measurements per party and 2 outcomes per measurement, this newly proposed inequality has been proved to be necessary and sufficient for steering. In this article, using an equivalence between measurement incompatibility (non joint measurability) and steering, we find the optimal violation amount of this inequality in quantum theory. Interestingly, the optimal violation amount matches with optimal quantum violation of CHSH inequality, i.e., Cirel'son quantity. We further study the optimal violation of this inequality for different bipartite quantum states. To our surprise we find that optimal violation amount is different for different $2$-qubit pure entangled states, which is not the case for all other existing steering inequalities.

We consider the open-system variant of the Dicke model, where the driven boson mode and also the large N-spin couple to independent reservoirs at zero temperature. The critical exponent, which is $1$ if there is no spin-bath coupling, decreases below 1 when the spin couples to a sub-Ohmic reservoir.

abstract: We investigate the transverse spatial profile of down-converted light produced by noncollinear, degenerate, Type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in two types of nonlinear crystals. We find that the pattern produced by one crystal, beta barium borate (BBO), produces a circular down-conversion pattern while the other crystal, bismuth triborate (BiBO) produces an elliptical pattern. We show this difference is due to the angle-independent refractive index experienced by the daughter photons in BBO, while they experience an angle-dependent refractive index in BiBO. We image the transverse spatial profile of the generated light to determine the eccentricity produced by each crystal and develop a model to explain our observation. Among other things, this model predicts that there is a wavelength for which the eccentricity from BiBO is nearly zero. Finally, we discuss how the elliptical ring pattern produced in BiBO potentially affects polarization entanglement for experimental setups that collect biphotons around the entire down-conversion ring. We show that the quality of polarization entanglement as measured by the overlap integral of the spectrum of the two rings, can remain high (>99.4%) around the entire ring at the expense of decreased biphoton rate.

abstract: Mainstream literature on spontaneous wave function collapse never reflects on or profit from the formal coincidence and conceptual relationship with standard collapse under time-continuous quantum measurement (monitoring). I propose some easy lessons of standard monitoring theory which would make spontaneous collapse models revise some of their claims. In particular, the objective detection of spontaneous collapse remains impossible as long as the correct identification of what corresponds to the signal in standard monitoring is missing from spontaneous collapse models, the physical detectability of the "signal" is not stated explicitly and, finally, the principles of physical detection are not revealed.

abstract: We derive a fine-grained uncertainty relation for the measurement of two incompatible observables on a single quantum system of continuous variables, and show that the range of the sum of certainties is smaller than the corresponding range derived through fine-graining for discrete variable systems. The increment of uncertainty in continuous variable systems imposes a greater restriction on the information leakage to the eavesdropper compared to discrete variable systems, as is borne out by an enhanced lower bound on the secret key rate of a one-sided device independent quantum key distribution protocol. Such a lower bound on the key rate is obtained using a monogamy relation for a steering inequality derived using our uncertainty relation. The steering inequality presented here is able to capture the steerability of N$00$N states that have not been revealed hitherto using other criteria such as entropic steering relations.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04735
abstract: In this paper we address the problem of charaterizing coherence in dissipative (Markovian) quantum evolutions. We base our analysis on the decoherent histories formalism which is the most basic and proper approach to assess coherence properties of quantum evolutions. We introduce and test different quantifiers and we show how these are able to capture the (average) coherence of general quantum evolutions on various time scales and for different levels of environmentally induced decoherence. In order to show the effectiveness of the introduced tools, we thoroughly apply them to a paradigmatic instance of quantum process where the role of coherence is being hotly debated: exciton transport in the FMO photosynthetic complex and its most relevant trimeric subunit. Our analysis illustrates how the high efficiency of environmentally assisted transport can be traced back to the coherence properties of the evolution and the interference between pathways in the decoherent histories formalism. Indeed, we show that the bath essentially implements a quantum recoil avoiding effect on the exciton dynamics: the action of decoherence in the system is set at precisely the right level needed to preserve and sustain the benefits of the fast initial quantum delocalization of the exciton over the network, while preventing the subsequent recoil that would necessarily follow form a purely coherent dynamics. This picture becomes very clear when expressed in terms of pathways leading to the exit site: the action of the bath is seen to selectively kill the negative interference between pathways, while retaining the intial positive one.

abstract: We show that the correct mathematical foundation of quantum decision theory, dealing with uncertain events, requires the use of positive operator-valued measure that is a generalization of the projection-valued measure. The latter is appropriate for operationally testable events, while the former is necessary for characterizing operationally uncertain events. In decision making, one has to distinguish composite non-entangled events from composite entangled events. The mathematical definition of entangled prospects is based on the theory of Hilbert-Schmidt spaces and is analogous to the definition of entangled statistical operators in quantum information theory. We demonstrate that the necessary condition for the appearance of an interference term in the quantum probability is the occurrence of entangled prospects and the existence of an entangled strategic state of a decision maker. The origin of uncertainties in standard lotteries is explained.

abstract: We introduce a new continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol, self-referenced CV-QKD, that eliminates the need for transmission of a high-power local oscillator between the communicating parties. In this protocol, each signal pulse is accompanied by a reference pulse (or a pair of twin reference pulses), used to align Alice's and Bob's measurement bases. We present a proof-of-principle, fiber-based experimental demonstration of the protocol and quantify the expected secret key rates by expressing them in terms of experimental parameters. Our analysis of the secret key rate fully takes into account the inherent uncertainty associated with the quantum nature of the reference pulse(s) and quantifies the limit at which the theoretical key rate approaches that of the respective conventional protocol that requires local oscillator transmission. The self-referenced protocol greatly simplifies the hardware required for CV-QKD, especially for potential integrated photonics implementations of transmitters and receivers, with minimum sacrifice of performance. As such, it provides a pathway towards scalable integrated CV-QKD transceivers, a vital step towards large-scale QKD networks.

abstract: We present a first principles theoretical analysis of the entanglement of two superconducting qubits in spatially separated microwave cavities by a sequential (cascaded) probe of the two cavities with a coherent mode, that provides a full characterization of both the continuous measurement induced dynamics and the entanglement generation. We use the SLH formalism to derive the full quantum master equation for the coupled qubits and cavities system, within the rotating wave and dispersive approximations, and conditioned equations for the cavity fields. We then develop effective stochastic master equations for the dynamics of the qubit system in both a polaronic reference frame and a reduced representation within the laboratory frame. We compare simulations with and analyze tradeoffs between these two representations, including the onset of a non-Markovian regime for simulations in the reduced representation. We provide conditions for ensuring persistence of entanglement and show that using shaped pulses enables these conditions to be met at all times under general experimental conditions. The resulting entanglement is shown to be robust with respect to measurement imperfections and loss channels. We also study the effects of qubit driving and relaxation dynamics during a weak measurement, as a prelude to modeling measurement-based feedback control in this cascaded system.

abstract: Classical correlations of ground states typically decay exponentially and polynomially, respectively for gapped and gapless short-ranged quantum spin systems. In such systems, entanglement decays exponentially even at the quantum critical points. However, quantum discord, an information-theoretic quantum correlation measure, survives long lattice distances. We investigate the effects of quenched disorder on quantum correlation lengths of quenched averaged entanglement and quantum discord, in the anisotropic XY and XYZ spin glass and random field chains. We find that there is virtually neither reduction nor enhancement in entanglement length while quantum discord length increases significantly with the introduction of the quenched disorder.

abstract: Entanglement distillation refers to the task of transforming a collection of weakly entangled pairs into fewer highly entangled ones. It is a core ingredient in quantum repeater protocols, needed to transmit entanglement over arbitrary distances in order to realise quantum key distribution schemes. Usually, it is assumed that the initial entangled pairs are i.i.d. distributed and uncorrelated with each other, an assumption that might not be reasonable at all in any entanglement generation process involving memory channels. Here, we introduce a framework that captures entanglement distillation in the presence of natural correlations arising from memory channels. Conceptually, we bring together ideas from condensed-matter physics - that of renormalisation and of matrix-product states and operators - with those of local entanglement manipulation, Markov chain mixing, and quantum error correction. We identify meaningful parameter regions for which we prove convergence to maximally entangled states, arising as the fixed points of a matrix-product operator renormalisation flow.

abstract: A simple argument is presented which, based on the minimal coupling Lagrangian for a many-body system, keeps the gauge invariance of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation with explicit Coulomb potential. The elimination of longitudinal electric field does not necessarily lead to the breakdown of gauge invariance. The choice of Coulomb gauge cancels the total time derivative term caused by gauge transformation in the Lagrangian. All the linear and nonlinear responses are described only by transverse vector potential and external longitudinal electric field.

We delineate the theoretical development as well as describe recent experiments related to GPs in the context of quantum information.

abstract: The dynamics of a two-state system whose energies undergo a real crossing at some instant of time is studied. At this instant, both the coupling and the detuning vanish simultaneously, which leads to an exact degeneracy of the eigenenergies of the system. It is found that the dynamics of the system is primarily determined by the manner in which the degeneracy occurs. This interesting behavior is reminiscent of a symmetry breaking process, since the totally symmetric situation occurring at the crossing is significantly altered by infinitesimal quantities, which remove the degeneracy, with very important dynamical implications from there on. A very simple analytical formula is derived, which is found to describe the population changes very accurately.

abstract: In this work we obtain analytical expressions for the non-additivity effects in the dispersive interaction between two atoms and perfectly conducting surface of arbitrary shape in the non-retarded regime. We show that this three bodies quantum-mechanical problem can be solved by mapping it into a two-bodies electrostatic one. We apply the general formulas developed in this paper in several examples. Firstly we re-derive the London interaction as a particular case of our formalism. Then we treat two atoms in the presence of a plane, re-obtained the result displayed in the literature. After we add some new examples. A particularly interesting one is two atoms inside a plate capacitor, a situation where non-additivity is very manifest since the plates lead to the exponentially suppression of the interaction of the atoms, provided the atoms are separated by a distance of the order of the distance between the plates or greater. Our results holds even in the presence of other atoms inside the plate capacitor. As a last example we deal with two atoms in the presence of a sphere, both grounded and isolated. We show that for realistic experimental parameters the non-additivity may be relevant for the force in each atom.

abstract: After summarizing three versions of trajectory-based quantum mechanics, it is argued that only the original formulation due to Bohm, which uses the Schr\"odinger wave function to guide the particles, can be readily extended to particles with spin. To extend the two wave function-free formulations, it is argued that necessarily particle trajectories not only determine location, but also spin. Since spin values are discrete, it is natural to revert to a variation of Bohm's pilot wave formulation due originally to Bell. It is shown that within this formulation with stochastic quantum trajectories, a wave function free formulation can be obtained.

It is found that all the enhancements are happened in the small-squeezing and small-catalysis parameter regime.

abstract: A scheme for conditional generating a Hermite polynomial excited squeezed vacuum states (HESVS) is proposed. Injecting a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVS) into a beam splitter (BS) and counting the photons in one of the output channels, the conditional state in the other output channel is just a HESVS. To exhibit a number of nonclassical effects and non-Guassianity, we mainly investigate the photon number distribution, sub-Poissonian distribution, quadrature component distribution, and quasi-probability distribution of the HPESVS. We find that its nonclassicality closely relates to the control parameter of the BS, the squeezed parameter of the TMSVS, and the photon number of conditional measurement. These further demonstrate that performing the conditional measurement on a BS is an effective approach to generate non-Guassian state.

Moreover, we extend this result to a coupled-resonator chain of arbitrary length with different coupling strengths. Effects of decoherence via quantum nondemolition interaction are studied with sources including vacuum quantum fluctuation and bath thermal excitations when the bath is in the thermal equilibrium state. These observations are helpful to understand the decoherence effects on quantum communication in quantum coupled-resonator systems.

abstract: We investigate the Hamming networks that their nodes are considered as quantum harmonic oscillators. The entanglement of the ground state can be used to quantify the amount of information each part of a network shares with the rest of the system via quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the Schmidt numbers and entanglement entropy between two special parts of Hamming network, can be calculated. To this aim, first we use the stratification method to rewrite the adjacency matrix of the network in the stratification basis. Then the entanglement entropy and Schmidt number for special partitions are calculated analytically by using the generalized Schur complement method. Also, we calculate the entanglement entropy between two arbitrary subsets (two equal subsets have the same number of vertices) in H(2; 3) and H(2; 4) numerically, and we give the minimum and maximum values of entanglement entropy in these two Hamming network.

abstract: We derive a hierarchy of continuous-variable multipartite entanglement conditions in terms of second-order moments of position and momentum operators that extends some previous results. Each condition of the hierarchy corresponds to a convex optimization problem which, given the covariance matrix of the state, can be numerically solved in a straightforward way. Our approach can be used to get an analytical condition for genuine multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate that even a special case of our conditions can very efficiently detect entanglement. Using multi-objective optimization it is also possible to numerically verify genuine entanglement of some realistic states realized experimentally. As a by-product of our method, we get some matrix inequalities that are hard to obtain directly.

abstract: This is a polemical response to Howard Wiseman's recent paper, "The two Bell's theorems of John Bell". Wiseman argues that, in 1964, Bell established a conflict between the quantum mechanical predictions and the joint assumptions of determinism and (what is now usually known as) "parameter independence". Only later, in 1976, did Bell, according to Wiseman, first establish a conflict between the quantum mechanical predictions and locality alone (in the specific form that Bell would sometimes call "local causality"). Thus, according to Wiseman, the long-standing disagreements about what, exactly, Bell's theorem does and does not prove can be understood largely as miscommunications resulting from the fact that there are really two quite distinct "Bell's theorems". My goal here is to lay out what Wiseman briefly describes as an "alternate reading" of Bell's 1964 paper, according to which (quoting Wiseman here) "the first paragraph of Bell's `Formulation' section [should be seen] as an essential part of his 1964 theorem, the first part of a two-part argument." I will argue in particular that this "alternate reading" is the correct way to understand Bell's 1964 paper and that Wiseman's reading is strongly inconsistent with the available evidence.

abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a "universal set" of Markovian processes, such that any Markovian open quantum system, described by a one-parameter semigroup of quantum channels, can be simulated through sequential simulations of processes from the universal set. In particular, for quantum systems of dimension $d$, we explicitly construct a universal set of semigroup generators, parametrized by $d^2-3$ continuous parameters, such that in order to simulate the dynamics of an arbitrary $d$ dimensional Markovian quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to be able to implement unitary operations on the system, and quantum channels from the semigroups generated by elements of the universal set of generators. Furthermore, assuming the ability to implement operations from the universal set, we provide an explicit algorithm for the efficient simulation of Markovian open quantum systems for which the number of distinct Lindblad operators scales polynomially with respect to the number of subsystems.

abstract: We experimentally show how classical correlations can be turned into quantum entanglement, via the presence of non-unital local noise and the action of a CNOT gate. We first implement a simple two-qubit protocol in which entanglement production is not possible in the absence of local non-unital noise, while entanglement arises with the introduction of noise, and is proportional to the degree of noisiness. We then perform a more elaborate four-qubit experiment, by employing two hyperentangled photons initially carrying only classical correlations. We demonstrate a scheme where the entanglement is generated via local non-unital noise, with the advantage to be robust against local unitaries performed by an adversary.

abstract: We formulate three new error disturbance relations, one of which is free from explicit dependence upon intrinsic fluctuations of observables. The first error-disturbance relation is tighter than the one provided by the Branciard inequality and the Ozawa inequality for some initial states. Other two error disturbance relations provide a tighter bound to Ozawa's error disturbance relation and one of them is in fact tighter than the bound provided by Branciard's inequality for a small number of states.

abstract: We propose an implementation of quantum neural networks using an array of single-electron quantum dots with dipole-dipole interactions. We demonstrate that this implementation is both feasible and versatile by studying it within the framework of GaAs based quantum dot qubits coupled to a reservoir of acoustic phonons; a system whose decoherence properties have been experimentally and theoretically characterized with meticulous detail, and is considered one of the most accurately understood open quantum systems. Using numerically exact Feynman integral calculations, we have found that the quantum coherence in our neural networks survive for several ns even at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K), which is three orders of magnitude higher than current implementations which are based on SQUIDs operating at temperatures in the mK range. Furthermore, the previous quantum dot based proposals required control via manipulating the phonon bath, which is extremely difficult in real experiments. An advantage of our implementation is that it can be easily controlled, since dipole-dipole interaction strengths can be changed via the spacing between the dots and applying external fields.

abstract: Using pulsed optical excitation and read-out along with single phonon counting techniques, we measure the transient back-action, heating, and damping dynamics of a nanoscale silicon optomechanical crystal cavity mounted in a dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of 11mK. In addition to observing a slow (~740ns) turn-on time for the optical-absorption-induced hot phonon bath, we measure for the 5.6GHz `breathing' acoustic mode of the cavity an initial phonon occupancy as low as 0.021 +- 0.007 (mode temperature = 70mK) and an intrinsic mechanical decay rate of 328 +- 14 Hz (mechanical Q-factor = 1.7x10^7). These measurements demonstrate the feasibility of using short pulsed measurements for a variety of quantum optomechanical applications despite the presence of steady-state optical heating.

abstract: Weak measurement of a quantum system followed by postselection based on a subsequent strong measurement gives rise to a quantity called the weak value: a complex number for which the interpretation has long been debated. We analyse the procedure of weak measurement and postselection, and the interpretation of the associated weak value, using a theory of classical mechanics supplemented by an epistemic restriction that is known to be operationally equivalent to a subtheory of quantum mechanics. Both the real and imaginary components of the weak value appear as phase space displacements in the postselected expectation values of the measurement device's position and momentum distributions, and we recover the same displacements as in the quantum case by studying the corresponding evolution in the classical theory. By using this analogous classical theory, we gain insight into the appearance of the weak value as a result of the statistical effects of post selection, and this provides us with an operational interpretation of the weak value, both its real and imaginary parts. We find that the imaginary part of the weak value is a measure of how much postselection biases the mean phase space distribution for a given amount of measurement disturbance. All such biases proportional to the imaginary part of the weak value vanish in the limit where disturbance due to measurement goes to zero. Our analysis also offers intuitive insight into how measurement disturbance can be minimised and the limits of weak measurement.

abstract: We present a quantum theory of cavityless feedback cooling of an optically trapped harmonically oscillating subwavelength dielectric particle, a configuration recently realized in several experiments. Specifically, we derive a Markovian master equation that treats the mechanical as well as optical degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Employing this equation, we solve for the nanoparticle phonon number dynamics exactly, and extract analytic expressions for the cooling timescale and the steady state phonon number. We present experimental data verifying the predictions of our model in the classical regime, and also demonstrate that quantum ground state preparation is within reach of ongoing experiments. Our work provides a quantitative framework for future theoretical modeling of the cavityless quantum optomechanics of optically trapped dielectric particles.

We provide examples of quantum spin network families admitting polynomial quantum gate complexity with a vanishing fraction of controlled spins. We define a new family of graphs, the efficiently controllable family, which admits efficient computation with vanishing fraction of controls. We explore generalizations to percolation clusters, fractals and random graphs. We show that the classical computational complexity of estimating the ground state of Hamiltonians described by controllable graphs is polynomial in the number of subsystems/qubits.

We find the covariance matrix of the system after the non-ideal Bell-like detection, showing explicitly that one enables manipulation of the quantum correlations, and particularly quantum discord, between remote Bose-Einstein condensates. We also find that the non-ideal Bell-like detection can create entanglement between distant Bose-Einstein condensates at the two remote sites

abstract: Multi-mode entangled coherent states are important resources for linear optics quantum computation and teleportation. Here we introduce the generalized balanced N-mode coherent states which recast in the multi-qudit case. The necessary and sufficient condition for bi-separability of such balanced N-mode coherent states is found. We particularly focus on pure and mixed multi-qubit and multi-qutrit like states and examine the degree of bipartite as well as tripartite entanglement using the concurrence measure. Unlike the N-qubit case, it is shown that there are qutrit states violating monogamy inequality. Using parity, displacement operator and beam splitters, we will propose a scheme for generating balanced N-mode entangled coherent states for even number of terms in superposition.

abstract: We investigate quantum state discrimination with confidentiality. $N$ observers share a given quantum state belonging to a finite set of known states. The observers want to determine the state as accurately as possible and send a discrimination result to a receiver. However, the observers are not allowed to get any information about which state was given. $N-1$ or fewer observers might try to steal the information, but if $N$ observers coexist, the honest ones will keep the dishonest ones from doing anything wrong. Assume that the state set has a certain symmetry, or more precisely, is Abelian geometrically uniform; this letter describes the case of three linearly independent cyclic pure states as a special case. We propose a protocol that realizes any optimal inconclusive measurement, which is a generalized version of a minimum-error measurement and an optimal unambiguous measurement, for such a state set and ensures that any combined state of $N-1$ or fewer observers has absolutely no information about the given state. Our protocol provides a method of performing a quantum measurement securely, which could be useful in quantum information applications.

abstract: Readout and retrieval processes are proposed for efficient, high-fidelity quantum state transfer between a matter qubit, encoded in the level structure of a single atom or ion, and a photonic qubit, encoded in a time-reversal-symmetric single-photon wave packet. They are based on controlling spontaneous photon emission and absorption of a matter qubit on demand in free space by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. As these processes do not involve mode selection by high-finesse cavities or photon transport through optical fibers, they offer interesting perspectives as basic building blocks for free-space quantum-communication protocols.

For intermediate Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strengths, relevant for atoms separated by $\sim$ten $\mu$m, adiabatic excitation can be achieved at experimentally feasible Rabi frequencies and chirp rates of the pulses, resulting in high transfer efficiencies. We also study the adiabatic transfer between ground and Rydberg states as a means to realize a controlled phase gate between atomic qubits.

abstract: We provide a general and consistent formulation for linear subsystem quantum dynamical maps, developed from a minimal set of postulates, primary among which is a relaxation of the usual, restrictive assumption of uncorrelated initial system-bath states. We describe the space of possibilities admitted by this formulation, namely that, far from being limited to only completely positive (CP) maps, essentially any C-linear, Hermiticity- preserving, trace-preserving subsystem map can arise as a legitimate subsystem dynamical map from a joint unitary evolution of a system coupled to a bath. The price paid for this added generality is a trade-off between the set of admissible initial states and the allowed set of joint system-bath unitary evolutions. As an application we present a simple example of a non-CP map constructed as a subsystem dynamical map that violates some fundamental inequalities in quantum information theory, such as the quantum data processing inequality.

abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to implement a strong photon blockade with a single quantum dot coupled to a nanocavity. The photon blockade effect can be tremendously enhanced by driving the cavity and the quantum dot simultaneously with two classical laser fields. This enhancement of photon blockade is ascribed to the quantum interference effect to avoid two-photon excitation of the cavity field. Comparing with Jaynes-Cummings model, the second-order correlation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)}(0)$ in our scheme can be reduced by two orders of magnitude and the system sustains a large intracavity photon number. A red (blue) cavity-light detuning asymmetry for photon quantum statistics with bunching or antibunching characteristics is also observed. The photon blockade effect has a controllable flexibility by tuning the relative phase between the two pumping laser fields and the Rabi coupling strength between the quantum dot and the pumping field. Moreover, the photon blockade scheme based on quantum interference mechanism does not require a strong coupling strength between the cavity and the quantum dot, even with the pure dephasing of the system. This simple proposal provides an effective way for potential applications in solid state quantum computation and quantum information processing.

In this paper, we are going to study another special entanglement states which is stabilizer states. The stabilizer states and their subset graph states play an important role in quantum error correcting codes, multipartite purification and so on. We show that all n- qubit stabilizer states are uniquely determined (among arbitrary states, pure or mixed) by their reduced density matrices for systems which are the supports of n independent generators of the corresponding stabilizer formalisms.

abstract: A significant problem facing next-generation quantum technologies is how to generate and manipulate macroscopic entanglement in light and matter systems. Here we report a new regime of dynamical light-matter behavior in which a giant, system-wide entanglement is generated by varying the light-matter coupling at \emph{intermediate} velocities. This enhancement is far larger and broader-ranged than that occurring near the quantum phase transition of the same model under adiabatic conditions. By appropriate choices of the coupling within this intermediate regime, the enhanced entanglement can be made to spread system-wide or to reside in each subsystem separately.

abstract: Quantum communication holds the promise of creating disruptive technologies that will play an essential role in future communication networks. For example, the study of quantum communication complexity has shown that quantum communication allows exponential reductions in the information that must be transmitted to solve distributed computational tasks. Recently, protocols that realize this advantage using optical implementations have been proposed. Here we report a proof of concept experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting system that is capable of transmitting less information than the best known classical protocol. Our implementation is based on a modified version of a commercial quantum key distribution system using off-the-shelf optical components over telecom wavelengths, and is practical for messages as large as 100 Mbits, even in the presence of experimental imperfections. Our results provide a first step in the development of experimental quantum communication complexity.

abstract: Given a unitary representation of a finite group on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, we show how to find a state whose translates under the group are distinguishable with the highest probability. We apply this to several quantum oracle problems, including the GROUP MULTIPLICATION problem, in which the product of an ordered $n$-tuple of group elements is to be determined by querying elements of the tuple. For any finite group $G$, we give an algorithm to find the product of two elements of $G$ with a single quantum query with probability $2/|G|$. This generalizes Deutsch's Algorithm from $Z_2$ to an arbitrary finite group. We further prove that this algorithm is optimal. We also introduce the HIDDEN CONJUGATING ELEMENT PROBLEM, in which the oracle acts by conjugating by an unknown element of the group. We show that for many groups, including dihedral and symmetric groups, the unknown element can be determined with probability $1$ using a single quantum query.

abstract: With the purpose of controlling the steady state of a dielectric nanosphere levitated within an optical cavity, we study its conditional dynamics under simultaneous sideband cooling and additional time-continuous measurement of either the output cavity mode or the nanosphere's position. We find that the average phonon number, purity and quantum squeezing of the steady-states can all be made more non-classical through the addition of time-continuous measurement. We predict that the continuous monitoring of the system, together with Markovian feedback, allows one to stabilize the dynamics for any value of the laser frequency driving the cavity. By considering state-of-the-art values of the experimental parameters, we prove that one can in principle obtain a non-classical (squeezed) steady-state with an average phonon number $n_{\sf ph}\approx 0.5$.

abstract: We examine the interpretation of individual phase-space trajectories of the Wigner function as corresponding to possible outcomes of single experimental trials. In particular, we focus on the relation between the true (measured) particle number distribution $P_n$ for a single-mode state and that obtained by discretely binning the individual stochastic realisations of squared mode amplitudes $|\alpha|^2$ of the sampled Wigner distribution $W(\alpha)$, which we denote via $\tilde{P}_n$. We provide an operational definition of $\tilde{P}_n$ in terms of the underlying Wigner function, which allows us to explicitly calculate the overlap between the two number distributions and hence quantify the statistical distance between them. We find that there is indeed a close quantitative correspondence between $P_n$ and $\tilde{P}_n$ for a wide range of states, justifying the broadly accepted view that, for highly occupied modes, individual stochastic realisations of Wigner trajectories should approximately correspond to outcomes of single experiments. However, we also find counterexamples for which high mode occupation may not be sufficient for such an interpretation; we find instead that a more relevant and sufficient requirement is the smoothness and broadness of the Wigner function $W(\alpha)$ for the state of interest relative to the scale of oscillations of the Wigner function for a Fock state, $W_{|n\rangle}(\alpha)$.

High-resolution placement of NV centers is achieved using collimation of a 5keV-nitrogen ion beam through a pierced tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM). We demonstrate coupling of the implanted NV centers' broad band fluorescence to a cavity mode and observe Purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission. The results are in good agreement with a master equation model for the cavity coupling.

abstract: Calibration of quantum computing technologies is essential to the effective utilization of their quantum resources. Specifically, the performance of quantum annealers is likely to be significantly impaired by noise in their programmable parameters, effectively misspecification of the computational problem to be solved, often resulting in spurious suboptimal solutions. We developed a strategy to determine and correct persistent, systematic biases between the actual values of the programmable parameters and their user-specified values. We applied the recalibration strategy to two D-Wave Two quantum annealers, one at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, and another at D-Wave Systems in Burnaby, Canada. We show that the recalibration procedure not only reduces the magnitudes of the biases in the programmable parameters but also enhances the performance of the device on a set of random benchmark instances.

abstract: Quantum Fisher information is a key concept in the field of quantum metrology, which aims to enhance the parameter accuracy by using quantum resources. In this paper, utilizing a representation of quantum Fisher information for a general unitary parametrization process, we study unitary parametrization processes governed by su(2) dynamics. We obtain the analytical expression for the Hermitian operator of the parametrization and the maximal quantum Fisher information. We find that the maximal quantum Fisher information over the parameter space consists of two parts, one is quadratic in the time and the other oscillates with the time. We apply our result to the estimation of a magnetic field and obtained the maximal quantum Fisher information. We further discuss a driving field with a time-dependent Hamiltonian and find the maximal quantum Fisher information of the driving frequency attains optimum when it is in resonance with the atomic frequency.

abstract: Grover search algorithm drives a quantum system from an initial state to a desired final state by using selective phase inversions of these two states. In (1), we studied a generalization of Grover algorithm which relaxes the assumption of the efficient implementation of the selective phase inversion of the initial state, also known as diffusion operator. This assumption is known to become a serious handicap in cases of physical interest (2,3,4,5). Our general search algorithm works with almost arbitrary diffusion operator with only restriction of having the initial state as one of its eigenstates. The price that we pay for using arbitrary operator is an increase in the number of oracle queries by a factor of order of B, where B is a characteristic of the eigenspectrum of diffusion operator and it can be large in some situations. Here we show that by using quantum fourier transform, we can regain the optimal query complexity of Grover algorithm without losing the freedom of using arbitrary diffusion operators for quantum searching. However, the total number of operators required by algorithm is still order of B times more than that of Grover algorithm. So our algorithm offers advantage only if oracle operator is computationally more expensive than diffusion operator, which is true in most search problems.

abstract: The equivalence of thermodynamic ensembles is at the heart of statistical mechanics and central to our understanding of equilibrium states of matter. Recently, it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the dynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra dimension. This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics generates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible quantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions in the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of continuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad master equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which encodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed total observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates trajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events into the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an interesting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different ensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by total number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of different thermodynamic ensembles, akin to "grand-canonical" and "isobaric", but for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are equivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is in direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence between ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An intrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all observables that commute with the number of quantum jumps.

abstract: We present an analytical solution of the single photon quantum feedback in a cavity quantum electrodynamics system based on a half cavity set-up coupled to a structured continuum. The exact analytical expression we obtain allows us to discuss in detail under which conditions a single emitter-cavity system, which is initially in the weak coupling regime, can be driven into the strong coupling regime via the proposed quantum feedback mechanism [Carmele et al, Phys.Rev.Lett. 110, 013601]. Our results reveal that the feedback induced oscillations rely on a well-defined relationship between the delay time and the atom-light coupling strength of the emitter. At these specific values the leakage into the continuum is prevented by a destructive interference effect, which pushes the emitter to the strong coupling limit.

abstract: This paper examines chains of $N$ coupled harmonic oscillators. In isolation, the $j$th oscillator ($1\leq j\leq N$) has the natural frequency $\omega_j$ and is described by the Hamiltonian $\frac{1}{2}p_j^2+\frac{1}{2}\omega_j^2x_j^2$. The oscillators are coupled adjacently with coupling constants that are purely imaginary; the coupling of the $j$th oscillator to the $(j+1)$st oscillator has the bilinear form $i\gamma x_jx_{j+1}$ ($\gamma$ real). The complex Hamiltonians for these systems exhibit {\it partial} $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; that is, they are invariant under $i\to-i$ (time reversal), $x_j\to-x_j$ ($j$ odd), and $x_j\to x_j$ ($j$ even). [They are also invariant under $i\to-i$, $x_j\to x_j$ ($j$ odd), and $x_j\to- x_j$ ($j$ even).] For all $N$ the quantum energy levels of these systems are calculated exactly and it is shown that the ground-state energy is real. When $\omega_j=1$ for all $j$, the full spectrum consists of a real energy spectrum embedded in a complex one; the eigenfunctions corresponding to real energy levels exhibit partial $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. However, if the $\omega_j$ are allowed to vary away from unity, one can induce a phase transition at which {\it all} energies become real. For the special case $N=2$, when the spectrum is real, the associated classical system has localized, almost-periodic orbits in phase space and the classical particle is confined in the complex-coordinate plane. However, when the spectrum of the quantum system is partially real, the corresponding classical system displays only open trajectories for which the classical particle spirals off to infinity. Similar behavior is observed when $N>2$.

We show that by a proper design, it is possible to achieve an output state of two photons occupying three different spatial modes. The advantage of using such waveguide structure is its flexibility and the design space availability to achieve desired characteristics of the photon pairs generated in the down conversion process

abstract: This paper presents a multi-stage, multi-photon quantum key distribution protocol based on the double-lock cryptography. It exploits the asymmetry in the detection strategies between the legitimate users and the eavesdropper. The security analysis of the protocol is presented with coherent states under the intercept-resend attack, the photon number splitting attack, and the man-in-the-middle attack. It is found that the mean photon number can be much larger than one. This complements the recent interest in multi-photon quantum communication protocols that require a pre-shared key between the legitimate users.

abstract: Spin effects in the tunneling regime of strong field ionization of hydrogenlike highly charged ions in linearly as well as circularly polarized laser fields are investigated. The impact of the polarization of a laser field on the spin effects are analyzed. Spin-resolved differential ionization rates are calculated employing the relativistic Coulomb-corrected strong-field approximation (SFA) developed in the previous paper of the series. Analytical expressions for spin asymmetries and spin flip probability, depending on the laser's polarization, are obtained for the photoelectron momentum corresponding to the maximum of tunneling probability. A simpleman model is developed for the description of spin dynamics in tunnel-ionization, which provides an intuitive explanation for the spin effects. The spin flip is shown to be experimentally observable by using moderate highly charged ions with a charge of the order of 20 and a laser field with an intensity of $I\sim 10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$.

abstract: In this paper we construct abstract models of blackbox quantum algorithms using a model of quantum computation in sets and relations, a setting that is usually considered as a model for nondeterministic classical computation. This work provides an alternative model of quantum computation (QCRel) that, though unphysical, nevertheless faithfully models its computational structure. Our main results are models of the Deutsch-Jozsa, single-shot Grovers, and GroupHomID algorithms in QCRel. These models provide new tools to analyze the semantics of quantum computation and improve our understanding of the relationship between computational speedups and the structure of physical theories. They also exemplify a method of extending physical/computational intuition into new mathematical settings.

abstract: Often physical potentials are approximated to a harmonic potential so as to analytically solve the system dynamics. For example, the quantized electromagnetic field used to manipulate a qubit in cavity quantum electrodynamics, can be described using quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). Hence, it is important to know when a QHO behaves quantum mechanically and when classically. In this work, we encode the four lower-most eigenstates of the one dimensional-QHO(1D-QHO) onto the four Zeeman product states of a pair of spin-1/2 nuclei. Using the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processing (QIP), we then demonstrate the strong violation of noncontextual hidden variable (NCHV) inequality, under specific experimental arrangements. We also experimentally investigate the weak violation of NCHV inequality by thermal equilibrium states in nuclear spins, thereby assessing their quantumness.

abstract: The basic motivation behind this work is to raise the question that whether post selection can be considered a valid physical transformation (on probability space) or not. We study the consequences of both answers set in a device (theory) independent framework, based only on observed statistics. We start with taking up post-selection as an assumption and model the same using independent devices governed by Boolean functions. We establish analogy between the post selection functions and the general probabilistic games in a two party binary input-output scenario. As an observation, we categorize all possible post-selection functions based on the effect on a uniform input probability distribution. We find that post-selection can transform simple no signaling probability distributions to signaling. Similarly, solving NP complete problems is easy independent of classical or quantum computation (in particular we prove that Post RP = NP). Finally, we demonstrate an instance of the violation of the pigeon hole principle independent of underlying theory. As result of our theory independent modeling we conclude that post-selection as an assumption adds power to the underlying theory. In particular, quantum mechanics benefits more with the post-selection assumption, only because it admits a more general set of allowed probabilities as compared to the local hidden variable model. Without the assumption we associate a device independent efficiency factor to quantify the cost of post selection. Our study shows that in the real world post-selection is not efficient enough to be of any advantage. But from an adversarial perspective it is still of significance. As an application, we obtain robust bounds on faking the bell violation in terms of minimum efficiency required using post selection.

We give a brief description of the controlled Rabi and Jaynes--Cummings models and we discuss their appearance in the mathematics and physics literature. We then study the controllability of the Rabi model when the control is an external field acting on the bosonic part. Applying geometric control techniques to the Galerkin approximation and using perturbation theory to guarantee non-resonance of the spectrum of the drift operator, we prove approximate controllability of the system, for almost every value of the interaction parameter.

We show that the above condition is satisfied when the de Broglie length of the incident particle is much larger than the size of the system.

abstract: The stability of the topological order phase induced by the $Z_3$ Kitaev model, which is a candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation, against the local order phase induced by the 3-State Potts model is studied. We show that the low energy sector of the Kitaev-Potts model is mapped to the Potts model in the presence of transverse magnetic field. Our study relies on two high-order series expansion based on continuous unitary transformations in the limits of small- and large-Potts couplings as well as mean-field approximation. Our analysis reveals that the topological phase of the $Z_3$ Kitaev model breaks down to the Potts model through a first order phase transition. We capture the phase transition by analysis of the ground state energy, one-quasiparticle gap and geometric measure of entanglement.

abstract: We consider bi-linear analogues of $s$-positivity for linear maps. The dual objects of these notions can be described in terms of Schimdt ranks for tri-tensor products and Schmidt numbers for tri-partite quantum states. These tri-partite versions of Schmidt numbers cover various kinds of bi-separability, and so we may interpret witnesses for those in terms of bi-linear maps. We give concrete examples of witnesses for various kinds of three qubit entanglement.

abstract: The main concern of this paper is how to define proper measures of multipartite entanglement for mixed quantum states. Since the structure of partial separability/entanglement is getting complicated if the number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an ultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the rich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order structure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps towards this direction. First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability classification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. K\"ok\'enyesi, Phys. Rev. A 86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that the structure of the entanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different kinds of partial separability/entanglement, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of the partitions of the subsystems. Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that a given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of entanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement classes. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and propose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite generalization of the Entanglement of Formation based on the Entanglement Entropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability.

abstract: Coplanar microwave resonators made of 330 nm-thick superconducting YBCO have been realized and characterized in a wide temperature ($T$, 2-100 K) and magnetic field ($B$, 0-7 T) range. The quality factor $Q_L$ exceeds 10$^4$ below 55 K and it slightly decreases for increasing fields, remaining 90$\%$ of $Q_L(B=0)$ for $B=7$ T and $T=2$ K. These features allow the coherent coupling of resonant photons with a spin ensemble at finite temperature and magnetic field. To demonstrate this, collective strong coupling was achieved by using DPPH organic radical placed at the magnetic antinode of the fundamental mode: the in-plane magnetic field is used to tune the spin frequency gap splitting across the single-mode cavity resonance at 7.75 GHz, where clear anticrossings are observed with a splitting as large as $\sim 82$ MHz at $T=2$ K. The spin-cavity collective coupling rate is shown to scale as the square root of the number of active spins in the ensemble.

abstract: We show how a property of dualism, which can exist in the entanglement of identical particles, can be tested in the usual photonic Bell measurement apparatus with minor modifications. Two different sets of coincidence measurements on the same experimental setup consisting of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer demonstrate how the same two-photon state can emerge entanglement in the polarization or the momentum degree of freedom depending on the dynamical variables used for labeling the particles. Our experiment demonstrates how the same source can be used as both a polarization entangled state, as well as a dichotomic momentum entangled state shared between distant users Alice and Bob in accordance to which sets of detectors they access. When the particles become distinguishable by letting the information about one of the variables to be imprinted in yet another (possibly inaccessible) system or degree of freedom, the feature of dualism is expected to vanish. We verify this feature by polarization decoherence (polarization information in environment) or arrival time difference, which both respectively destroy one of the dual forms of entanglement.

abstract: We propose a scheme for the ultrafast control of the emitter-field coupling rate in cavity quantum electrodynamics. This is achieved by the control of the vacuum field seen by the emitter through a modulation of the optical modes in a coupled-cavity structure. The scheme allows the on/off switching of the coupling rate without perturbing the emitter and without introducing frequency chirps on the emitted photons. It can be used to control the shape of single-photon pulses for high-fidelity quantum state transfer, to control Rabi oscillations and as a gain-modulation method in lasers. We discuss two possible experimental implementations based on photonic crystal cavities and on microwave circuits.

abstract: Single photons are a vital resource for photonic quantum information processing. However, even state-of-the-art single photon sources based on photon-pair generation and heralding detection have only a low probability of delivering a single photon when one is requested. We analyse a scheme that uses a switched fibre delay loop to increase the delivery probability per time bin of single photons from heralded sources. We show that, for realistic experimental parameters, combining the output of up to 15 pulses can yield a performance improvement of a factor of 10. We consider the future performance of this scheme with likely component improvements.

abstract: In this paper, the distinguishability of multipartite geometrically uniform quantum states obtained from a single reference state is studied in the symmetric subspace. We specially focus our attention on the unitary transformation in a way that the produced states remain in the symmetric subspace, so rotation group with Jy as the generator of rotation is applied. The optimal probability and measurements are obtained for the pure and some special mixed separable states and the results are compared with those obtained at the previous articles for the special cases. The results are valid for lin- early dependent states. The discrimination of these states is also investigated using the separable measurement. We introduce appropriate transformation to gain the optimal separable measurements equivalent to the optimal global measurements with the same optimal probability.

abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient high-dimensional quantum state transfer scheme through an $XXZ$-Heisenberg spin chain in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. By the use of a combination of coherent quantum coupling and free spin-wave approximation, pure unitary evolution results in a perfect high-dimensional swap operation between two remote quantum registers mediated by a uniform quantum data bus, and the feasibility is confirmed by numerical simulations. Also, we observe that either the strong $z$-directional coupling or high quantum spin number can partly suppress the thermal excitations and protect quantum information from the thermal noises when the quantum data bus is in the thermal equilibrium state.

abstract: The quantum random walk (QRW) is the term given to a family of algorithms governing the evolution of a discrete quantum system and as such has a founding role in the study of quantum computation. We contribute to the investigation of QRW phenomena by performing a detailed numerical study of discrete-time quantum walks. In one dimension (1D), we compute the structure of the probability distribution, which is not a smooth curve but shows oscillatory features on all length scales. By analyzing walks up to $N = 1000000$ steps, we discuss the scaling characteristics and limiting forms of the QRW in both real and Fourier space. In 2D, with a view to ready experimental realization, we consider two types of QRW, one based on a four-faced coin and the other on sequential flipping of a single two-faced coin. We show analytically and numerically that both QRWs may be generated using two two-faced coins, which in the first case are completely unentangled and in the second are maximally entangled. We draw on our 1D results to characterize the properties of both walks, demonstrating maximal speed-up and emerging semi-classical behavior in the maximally entangled QRW. We discuss existing and proposed experiments realizing these phenomena.

abstract: Quantum coherence is a key component of topical research on quantum resource theories and a primary facilitator for design and implementation of quantum technologies. However, the resourcefulness of quantum coherence is severely restricted by environmental noise, which is indicated by the loss of information in a quantum system, measured in terms of its purity. In this work, we derive the limits imposed by the mixedness of a quantum system on the amount of quantum coherence that it can possess. We obtain an analytical trade-off between the two quantities that upperbounds the maximum quantum coherence for fixed mixedness in a system. This gives rise to a class of quantum states, "maximally coherent mixed states", whose coherence cannot be increased further under any purity-preserving operation. For the above class of states, quantum coherence and mixedness satisfy a complementarity relation, which is crucial to understand the interplay between a resource and noise in open quantum systems.

abstract: We present several quantum algorithms for the simulation of quantum systems in one spatial dimension. First, we provide a method to simulate the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) and compute scattering amplitudes using a discrete QHO. To achieve precision \epsilon, it suffices to choose the dimension of the Hilbert space of the discrete system, N, proportional to N' and logarithmic in |t|/\epsilon, where N' is the largest eigenvalue in the spectral decomposition of the initial state, and t is the evolution time. We then present a Trotter-Suzuki product formula to approximate the evolution. The number of terms in the product is subexponential, and the complexity of simulating the evolution on a quantum computer is O(|t| \exp( \gamma \sqrt{\log(N' |t|/\epsilon)})), where \gamma >0 is constant. Our results suggest a superpolynomial speedup. Next, we describe a quantum algorithm to prepare the ground state of the discrete QHO with complexity polynomial in \log(1/\epsilon) and \log (N). Such a quantum algorithm may be of independent interest, as it gives a way to prepare states of Gaussian-like amplitudes. Other eigenstates can be prepared by evolving with a Hamiltonian that is a discrete version of the Jaynes-Cummings model, with complexity polynomial in \log (N) and 1/\epsilon. We then study a quantum system with a quartic potential and numerically show that the evolution operator can be approximated using the Trotter-Suzuki formula, where the number of terms scales as N^{q}, for q <1. Our results suggest a polynomial speedup in this case. We also prove an upper bound on the complexity of simulating a large class of one-dimensional quantum systems, and describe a quantum algorithm of complexity almost linear in N|t| and logarithmic in 1/\epsilon. We discuss further applications of our results, in particular with regards to the fractional Fourier transform.

abstract: Many important computer science problems can be reduced to clause satisfaction problem. We are given $n$ Boolean variables $x_{k}$ and $m$ clauses $c_{j}$ where each clause is a function of values of some of the variables. We want to find an assignment $i$ of variables for which all $m$ clauses are satisfied. Let $f_{j}(i)$ be a binary function which is $1$ if $j^{\rm th}$ clause is satisfied by the assignment $i$ else $f_{j}(i) = 0$. Then the solution is $r$ for which $f(i=r) = 1$, where $f(i)$ is the AND function of all $f_{j}(i)$. In quantum computing, Grover`s algorithm can be used to find $r$. A crucial component of this algorithm is the selective phase inversion $I_{r}$ of the solution state encoding $r$. $I_{r}$ is implemented by computing $f(i)$ for all $i$ in superposition which requires computing AND of all $m$ binary functions $f_{j}(i)$. Hence there must be coupling between the computation circuits for each $f_{j}(i)$. In this paper, we present an alternative quantum search algorithm which relaxes the requirement of such couplings. Hence it offers implementation advantages for clause satisfaction problems.

abstract: "Bell's theorem" can refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the joint assumptions of Locality and Predetermination. His 1976 theorem is their incompatibility with the single property of Local Causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions, that his 1964 theorem began with the assumption of Local Causality, even if not by that name. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not. Hence, the earlier and later theorems suggest quite different conclusions, embraced by operationalists and realists, respectively. The key issue is whether Locality or Local Causality is the appropriate notion emanating from Relativistic Causality, and this rests on one's basic notion of causation. For operationalists the appropriate notion is what is here called the Principle of Agent-Causation, while for realists it is Reichenbach's Principle of common cause. By breaking down the latter into even more basic Postulates, it is possible to obtain a version of Bell's theorem in which each camp could reject one assumption, happy that the remaining assumptions reflect its weltanschauung. Formulating Bell's theorem in terms of causation is fruitful not just for attempting to reconcile the two camps, but also for better describing the ontology of different quantum interpretations and for more deeply understanding the implications of Bell's marvellous work.

abstract: Quantum annealing is a proposed combinatorial optimization technique meant to exploit quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling and entanglement. Real-world quantum annealing-based solvers require a combination of annealing and classical pre- and post-processing; at this early stage, little is known about how to partition and optimize the processing. This article presents an experimental case study of quantum annealing and some of the factors involved in real-world solvers, using a 504-qubit D-Wave Two machine and the graph isomorphism problem. To illustrate the role of classical pre-processing, a compact Hamiltonian is presented that enables a reduced Ising model for each problem instance. On random N-vertex graphs, the median number of variables is reduced from N^2 to fewer than N lg N and solvable graph sizes increase from N = 5 to N = 13. Additionally, a type of classical post-processing error correction is evaluated. While the solution times are not competitive with classical approaches to graph isomorphism, the enhanced solver ultimately classified correctly every problem that was mapped to the processor and demonstrated clear advantages over the baseline approach. The results shed some light on the nature of real-world quantum annealing and the associated hybrid classical-quantum solvers.

abstract: This is a Bachelor's thesis on point estimators for incomplete tomography of qutrits as of 2014, submitted to the National University of Singapore. The main content of the thesis focuses on various methods of estimation such as maximum entropy and average estimator and show that they are quite different. Numerical simulations of these methods show however that these estimators perform very close to one another. Therefore on this basis, there is no reason to favor one method over another.

abstract: It is known that to imperfectly clone a phase-set of states uncorrelatedly is impossible due to the linearity and the hermitian-preservation of quantum operations deterministically shown by D'Ariano et al. In this paper we address uncorrelated cloning in probabilistic cases. We show that there exists a linear and hermitian-preserving probabilistic map to imperfectly clone a phase-set of states uncorrelatedly. It is pointed out that the existence of such a map is due to the difference between non-unit-trace output operators and normalized (unit-trace) output operators inherent to probabilistic maps. We however prove that such a possibility of uncorrelated cloning is completely excluded by the condition of positivity in addition to the linearity and the hermitian-preservation of quantum operations. Our results implicate that the positivity of quantum operation is richer physical meaning than the one which we usually assume a priori for the necessity of "probability interpretation."

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The anisotropic Rabi model, which was proposed recently, differs from the original Rabi model: the rotating and counter-rotating terms are governed by two different coupling constants. This feature allows us to vary the counter-rotating interaction independently and explore the effects of it on some quantum properties. In this paper, we eliminate the counter-rotating terms approximately and obtain the analytical energy spectrums and wavefunctions. These analytical results agree well with the numerical calculations in a wide range of the parameters including the ultrastrong coupling regime. In the weak counter-rotating coupling limit we find out that the counter-rotating terms can be considered as the shifts to the parameters of the Jaynes-Cummings model. This modification shows the validness of the rotating-wave approximation on the assumption of near-resonance and relatively weak coupling. Moreover, the analytical expressions of several physics quantities are also derived, and the results show the break-down of the U(1)-symmetry and the deviation from the Jaynes-Cummings model.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06547
abstract: We provide a fully quantum description of a mechanical oscillator in the presence of thermal environmental noise by means of a quantum Langevin formulation based on quantum stochastic calculus. The system dynamics is determined by symmetry requirements and equipartition at equilibrium, while the environment is described by quantum Bose fields in a suitable non-Fock representation which allows for the introduction of temperature. A generic spectral density of the environment can be described by introducing its state trough a suitable $P$-representation. Including interaction of the mechanical oscillator with a cavity mode via radiation pressure we obtain a description of a simple optomechanical system in which, besides the Langevin equations for the system, one has the exact input-output relations for the quantum noises. The whole theory is valid at arbitrarily low temperature. This allows the exact calculation of the stationary value of the mean energy of the mechanical oscillator, as well as both homodyne and heterodyne spectra. The present analysis allows in particular to study possible cooling scenarios and to obtain the exact connection between observed spectra and fluctuation spectra of the position of the mechanical oscillator.

title: Quantum Walk Search through Potential Barriers

abstract: A randomly walking quantum particle searches for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices in Grover's $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ steps. This assumes that the particle can transition from one vertex to another, unhindered. Physically, however, it may need to tunnel through a potential barrier, perhaps due to an imperfect or non-ideal implementation of the walk. Then the particle has some amplitude of correctly hopping and some amplitude of staying put. We show that this causes the search to fail when the particle stays put with amplitude that scales greater than $1/\sqrt{N}$, so searching larger "databases" requires increasingly reliable hop operations. This condition also holds for search by continuous-time quantum walk.

abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a key ingredient of several quantum algorithms and a qudit-specific implementation of the QFT is hence an important step toward the realization of qudit-based quantum computers. This work develops a circuit decomposition of the QFT for hybrid qudits based on generalized Hadamard and generalized controlled-phase gates, which can be implemented using selective rotations in NMR. We experimentally implement the hybrid qudit QFT on an NMR quantum emulator, which uses four qubits to emulate a single qutrit coupled to two qubits.

This allows us to propose a realistic experiment to detect microwave photons coming from simulated acceleration radiation. Moreover, by combining this technique with the dynamical Casimir physics, we enhance the toolbox for studying relativistic phenomena in quantum field theory with superconducting circuits.

abstract: Here we report the fabrication of stable, shallow (< 5 nm) nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond by nitrogen delta doping at the last stage of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth process. The NVs are stabilized after treating the diamond in $SF_6$ plasma, otherwise the color centers are not observed, suggesting a strong influence from the surface. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show the presence of only fluorine atoms on the surface, in contrast to previous studies, and suggests very good surface coverage. We managed to detect hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance signal from protons in the immersion oil, revealing a depth of the NVs of about 5 nm

abstract: Combining techniques of cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum measurement and quantum feedback, we have realized the heralded transfer of a polarization qubit from a photon onto a single atom with 39% efficiency and 86% fidelity. The reverse process, namely qubit transfer from the atom onto a given photon, is also demonstrated. In contrast to previous work based on two-photon interference, our scheme is robust against photon arrival-time jitter and achieves much higher efficiencies. Thus, it constitutes a key step toward the implementation of a long-distance quantum network.

abstract: We present a time-dependent quantum calculation of the van der Waals interaction between a pair of dissimilar atoms, one of which is initially excited while the other one is in its ground state. For small detuning, the interaction is predominantly mediated at all distances by the exchange of doubly resonant photons between the two atoms. We find that it presents, generally, both temporal and spatial oscillations. Spatially oscillating terms depend on the resonant frequencies of both atoms, while the frequency of the time oscillations is given by their detuning. We analyse the physical content of our findings and discuss to what extent previous conflicting stationary approaches provide compatible results.

abstract: We propose a projection measurement onto encoded Bell states with a static network of linear optical elements. By increasing the size of the quantum error correction code, both Bell measurement efficiency and photon-loss tolerance can be made arbitrarily high at the same time. As a main application, we show that all-optical quantum communication over large distances with communication rates similar to those of classical communication is possible solely based on local state teleportations using optical sources of encoded Bell states, fixed arrays of beam splitters, and photon detectors discriminating up to two photons. As another application, generalizing state teleportation to gate teleportation for quantum computation, we find that in order to achieve universality the intrinsic loss tolerance must be sacrificed and a minimal amount of feedforward has to be added.

abstract: It has been predicted that particles with imaginary mass, called tachyons, would be able to travel faster than the speed of light. So far, there has not been any experimental evidence for tachyons in either natural or engineered systems. Here, we propose how to experimentally simulate Dirac tachyons with trapped ions. Quantum measurement on a Dirac particle simulated by a trapped ion causes it to have an imaginary mass so that it may travel faster than the effective speed of light. We show that a Dirac tachyon must have spinor-motion entanglement in order to be superluminal. We also show that it exhibits significantly more Klein tunneling than a normal Dirac particle. We provide numerical simulations with realistic ion systems and show that our scheme is feasible with current technology.

abstract: We study the geometric phase of a two-level system under the presence of a structured environment, particularly analysing its correction with the ohmicity parameter $s$ and the onset of non-Markovianity. We firstly examine the system coupled to a set of harmonic oscillators and studied the decoherence factor as function of the environment's ohmicity parameter. Secondly, we propose the two-level system coupled to a non-equilibrium environment, and show that these environments display non-Markovian effects for all values of the ohmicity parameter. The geometric phase of the two-level system is therefore computed under the presence of both types of environment. The correction to the unitary geometric phase is analysed in both, Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Under Markovian environments, the correction induced on the system's phase is mainly ruled by the coupling constant between the system and the environment, while in the non-Markovian regime, memory effects seem to trigger a significant correction to the unitary geometric phase. The result is significant to the quantum information processing based on the geometric phase in quantum open systems

In this paper we develop a method for parameter estimation for Markovian open quantum systems using a temporal record of measurements on the system. The method is based on system realization theory and is a generalization of our previous work on identification of Hamiltonian parameters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 080401 (2014)].

title: Controlling tripartite entanglement among optical cavities by reservoir engineering
authors: Imran M. Mirza

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06930
abstract: We study how to control the dynamics of tripartite entanglement among optical cavities using non-Markovian baths. In particular, we demonstrate how the reservoir engineering through the utilization of non-Markovian baths with different types of Lorentzian and ohmic spectral densities can lead to an entanglement survival for longer times and in some cases considerable regain of seemingly lost entanglement. Both of these behaviors indicate a better sustainability of entanglement (in time) compared to the usual Markovian bath situations which assumes a flat spectrum of the bath around the system resonant frequency. Our scheme shows these effects in the context of optical cavities starting off in a maximally entangled W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) tripartite states. In Lorentzian cases we find that the far detuned double Lorentzian baths with small coupling strengths and for ohmic type baths super-ohmic environments with smaller cutoff frequencies are the best candidates for preserving entanglement among cavities for significant amount of time. A non-Markovian quantum jump approach is employed to understand the entanglement dynamics in these cases, especially to recognize the collapse and revival of the entanglement in both W and GHZ states.

abstract: Yes. That is my polemical reply to the titular question in Travis Norsen's self-styled "polemical response to Howard Wiseman's recent paper." Less polemically, I am pleased to see that on two of my positions --- that Bell's 1964 theorem is different from Bell's 1976 theorem, and that the former does not include Bell's one-paragraph heuristic presentation of the EPR argument --- Norsen has made significant concessions. In his response, Norsen admits that "Bell's recapitulation of the EPR argument in [the relevant] paragraph leaves something to be desired," that it "disappoints" and is "problematic". Moreover, Norsen makes other statements that imply, on the face of it, that he should have no objections to the title of my recent paper ("The Two Bell's Theorems of John Bell"). My principle aim in writing that paper was to try to bridge the gap between two interpretational camps, whom I call 'operationalists' and 'realists', by pointing out that they use the phrase "Bell's theorem" to mean different things: his 1964 theorem (assuming locality and determinism) and his 1976 theorem (assuming local causality), respectively. Thus, it is heartening that at least one person from one side has taken one step on my bridge. That said, there are several issues of contention with Norsen, which we (the two authors) address after discussing the extent of our agreement with Norsen. The most significant issues are: the indefiniteness of the word 'locality' prior to 1964; and the assumptions Einstein made in the paper quoted by Bell in 1964 and their relation to Bell's theorem.

abstract: We study the problem of charging a quantum battery in finite time. We demonstrate an analytical optimal protocol for the case of a single qubit. Extending this analysis to an array of N qubits, we demonstrate that an N-fold advantage in power per qubit can be achieved when global operations are permitted. The exemplary analytic argument for this quantum advantage in the charging power is backed up by numerical analysis using optimal control techniques. It is demonstrated that the quantum advantage for power holds when, with cyclic operation in mind, initial and final states are required to be separable.

abstract: Polarizable particles trapped in a resonator-sustained optical-lattice potential generate strong position-dependent backaction on the intracavity field. In the quantum regime particles in different energy bands are connected to different intracavity light intensities and optical-lattice depths. This generates a highly nonlinear coupled particle-field dynamics. For a given pump strength and detuning, a factorizing mean-field approach predicts several self-consistent stationary solutions of strongly distinct photon numbers and motional states. Quantum Monte Carlo wavefunction simulations of the master equation confirm these predictions and reveal complex multi-modal photon-number and particle-momentum distributions. Using larger nanoparticles in such a setup thus constitutes a well-controllable playground to study nonlinear quantum dynamics and the buildup of macroscopic quantum superpositions at the quantum-classical boundary.

abstract: Time is a valuable resource and it seems intuitive that longer time should lead to better precision in Hamiltonian parameter estimation. However recent studies have put this intuition into question, showing longer time may even lead to worse estimation in certain cases. Here we show that the intuition can be restored if coherent feedback controls are included. By deriving asymptotically optimal feedback controls we present a quantification of the maximal improvement feedback controls can provide in Hamiltonian parameter estimation and show a universal time scaling for the precision limit of Hamiltonian parameter estimation under the optimal feedback scheme.

abstract: Decoupling is an important tool to prolong the coherence time of quantum systems. Most decoupling schemes have been assuming selective controls on the system and it is believed that with global pulses one can only decouple systems with certain coupling terms like secular dipole-dipole coupling. In this article we show that with global pulses it is possible to reduce the coupling strength of other types of coupling, which we demonstrate with Ising coupling. The complexity of such pulses is independent of the size of system.

abstract: We study the classical capacity of a forgetful quantum memory channel that switches between two qubit depolarizing channels according to an ergodic Markov chain. The capacity of this quantum memory channel depends on the parameters of the two depolarizing channels and the memory of the ergodic Markov chain. When the number of input qubit's is two, we show that depending on channel parameters either the maximally entangled input states or product input states achieve the classical capacity. Our conjecture based on numerics is that as the number of input qubits are increased the classical capacity approaches the product state capacity for all values of the parameters.

Using a connection between the XY and Bose-Hubbard models that we exploited in previous work, this establishes QMA-completeness of the XY model.

abstract: Relative entropy measure quantifying coherence, a key property of quantum system, is proposed recently. In this note, we investigate the maximally coherent state (MCS) with respect to relative entropy measure. %(denoted by $\mathcal C_{RE}$)%. We show that there are not mixed maximally coherent states and give a complete characterization of pure maximally coherent states. Based on this characterization, for a bipartite MCS with $d_A=d_B$, we obtain that the super-additivity equality of relative entropy measure holds if and only if the state is a product state of its reduced states. From the viewpoint of resource in quantum information, we find there exists a MCS with maximal entanglement. Originated from the behaviour of quantum correlation under the influence of noisy operations, we further classify the incoherent operations which send maximally coherent states to themselves.

The resultant EB condition is applicable not only for quantum channels but also for general quantum operations, namely, trace-non-increasing class of completely positive maps. We illustrate our method associated with a quantum benchmark based on the input ensemble of Gaussian distributed coherent states. We also exploit our idea for channels acting on finite dimensional systems and present a Schmidt-number benchmark based on input states of two mutually unbiased bases and measurements of generalized Pauli operators.

abstract: For all the joint von Neumann measurements on a D-dimensional quantum system, we present the specific example of a context-invariant quasi hidden variable (qHV) model, proved in [Loubenets, J. Math. Phys. 56, 032201 (2015)] to exist for each Hilbert space. In this model, a quantum observable X is represented by a variety of random variables satisfying the functional condition required in quantum foundations but, in contrast to a contextual model, each of these random variables equivalently models X under all joint von Neumann measurements, regardless of their contexts. This, in particular, implies the specific local qHV (LqHV) model for an N-qudit state and allows us to derive the new exact upper bound on the maximal violation of 2x...x2-setting Bell-type inequalities of any type (either on correlation functions or on joint probabilities) under N-partite joint von Neumann measurements on an N-qudit state. For d=2, this new upper bound coincides with the maximal violation by an N-qubit state of the Mermin-Klyshko inequality. Based on our results, we discuss the conceptual and mathematical advantages of context-invariant and local qHV modelling.

abstract: There is great interest in designing photonic devices capable of disorder-resistant transport and information processing. In this work we propose to exploit 3D integrated photonic circuits for the realization of 2D discrete-time quantum walks in a background synthetic gauge field, for both the single and many walker case. The gauge fields are generated by introducing the appropriate phase shifts between waveguides. Polarization-independent phase shifts lead to an Abelian or magnetic field, a case we describe in detail. We characterize the single-particle Abelian quantum walk, finding that in the presence of disorder the magnetic field enhances transport due to the presence of topologically protected chiral edge states which do not localize. Polarization-dependent phase shifts lead to effective non-Abelian gauge fields, which could be adopted to realize of Rashba-like quantum walks with spin-orbit coupling. Our work introduces a flexible platform for the experimental study of multi-particle quantum walks in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which paves the way towards topologically robust transport of many-body states of photons.

abstract: We study $(d-1)$-dimensional excitations in the $d$-dimensional color code that are created by transversal application of the $R_{d}$ phase operators on connected subregions of qubits. We find that such excitations are superpositions of electric charges and can be characterized by fixed-point wavefunctions of $(d-1)$-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with $(\mathbb{Z}_{2})^{\otimes d}$ symmetry. While these SPT excitations are localized on $(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries, their creation requires operations acting on all qubits inside the boundaries, reflecting the non-triviality of emerging SPT wavefunctions. Moreover, these SPT-excitations can be physically realized as transparent gapped domain walls which exchange excitations in the color code. Namely, in the three-dimensional color code, the domain wall, associated with the transversal $R_{3}$ operator, exchanges a magnetic flux and a composite of a magnetic flux and loop-like SPT excitation, revealing rich possibilities of boundaries in higher-dimensional TQFTs. We also find that magnetic fluxes and loop-like SPT excitations exhibit non-trivial three-loop braiding statistics in three dimensions as a result of the fact that the $R_{3}$ phase operator belongs to the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy. We believe that the connection between SPT excitations, fault-tolerant logical gates and gapped domain walls, established in this paper, can be generalized to a large class of topological quantum codes and TQFTs.

abstract: Weak values are average quantities,therefore investigating their associated variance is crucial in understanding their place in quantum mechanics. We develop the concept of a position-postselected weak variance of momentum as cohesively as possible, building primarily on material from Moyal (Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1949) and Sonego (Found Phys 21(10):1135, 1991) . The weak variance is defined in terms of the Wigner function, using a standard construction from probability theory. We show this corresponds to a measurable quantity, which is not itself a weak value. It also leads naturally to a connection between the imaginary part of the weak value of momentum and the quantum potential. We study how the negativity of the Wigner function causes negative weak variances, and the implications this has on a class of `subquantum' theories. We also discuss the role of weak variances in studying determinism, deriving the classical limit from a variational principle.

abstract: Information-theoretical security of quantum key distribution (QKD) has been convincingly proven in recent years and remarkable experiments have shown the potential of QKD for real world applications. Due to its unique capability of combining high key rate and security in a realistic finite-size scenario, the efficient version of the BB84 QKD protocol endowed with decoy states has been subject of intensive research. Its recent experimental implementation finally demonstrated a secure key rate beyond 1 Mbps over a 50 km optical fiber. However the achieved rate holds under the restrictive assumption that the eavesdropper performs collective attacks. Here, we review the protocol and generalize its security. We exploit a map by Ahrens to rigorously upper bound the Hypergeometric distribution resulting from a general eavesdropping. Despite the extended applicability of the new protocol, its key rate is only marginally smaller than its predecessor in all cases of practical interest.

abstract: We demonstrate a multiphoton interferometer able to reproduce, by using only a thermal source, the operation of a quantum logic gate known as controlled-NOT gate. We show how 100%-visibility correlations typical of any Bell state can be obtained by performing polarization correlation measurements in the fluctuation of the number of photons at the interferometer output. The physics of multiphoton interference at the heart of this proposal can be readily used, in general, for the implementation of arbitrary-dimension bosonic networks leading to arbitrary-order entanglement-like correlations.

abstract: A semiclassical, four-level model of a nanosecond, chirped pulse interacting with all optically accessible hyperfine states in the ultracold Rb atom is analyzed aiming at population inversion within $5S_{1/2}$ electronic state. The nature of two-photon adiabatic passage performed by such a single pulse having a bandwidth smaller than the hyperfine splitting of $5S_{1/2}$ state is investigated in the framework of the dressed state picture. It is shown that two dressed states are involved in the adiabatic dynamics of population inversion. The excited state manifold appeared to play an important mediating role in the mechanism of population transfer.

abstract: An ever broader range of physical platforms provides the possibility to study and engineer quantum dynamics under continuous measurements. In many experimental arrangements the system of interest is monitored by means of an ancillary device, whose sole purpose is to transduce the signal from the system to the measurement apparatus. Here, we present a method of adiabatic elimination when the transducer consists of an arbitrary number of bosonic modes with Gaussian dynamics while the measured object can be any quantum system. Crucially, our approach can cope with the highly relevant case of finite temperature of the transducer, which is not easily achieved with other methods. We show that this approach provides a significant improvement in the readout of superconducting qubits in circuit QED already for a few thermal excitations, and admits to adiabatically eliminate optomechanical transducers.

In all three cases high transfer efficiencies $>99\%$ were achieved for the experimentally realizable Rabi frequencies and the pulse durations of the fields.

abstract: We present a method for estimating the probabilities of outcomes of a quantum circuit using Monte Carlo sampling techniques applied to a quasiprobability representation. Our estimate converges to the true quantum probability at a rate determined by the total negativity in the circuit, using a measure of negativity based on the 1-norm of the quasiprobability. If the negativity grows at most polynomially in the size of the circuit, our estimator converges efficiently. These results highlight the role of negativity as a measure of non-classical resources in quantum computation.

abstract: We study the entanglement of families of Unruh modes in the Bell states $|\Phi^\pm\rangle =1/\sqrt{2}(|00\rangle\pm|11\rangle)$ and $|\Psi^\pm\rangle=1/\sqrt{2}(|01\rangle\pm|10\rangle)$ shared by two accelerated observers, and find fundamental differences in the robustness of entanglement against acceleration for these states. States $\Psi^\pm$ are entangled for all finite accelerations, whereas, due to the Unruh effect, states $\Phi^\pm$ lose their entanglement for finite accelerations. This is true for Bell states of two bosonic modes, as well as for Bell states of a bosonic and a fermionic mode. But also for Bell states of fermionic modes there are differences in the degradation of entanglement. We reveal the origin of these distinct characteristics of entanglement degradation and discuss the role that is played by particle statistics. Our studies suggest that the behavior of entanglement in accelerated frames strongly depends on the occupation patterns of the constituent states, whose superposition constitutes the entangled state, where especially states $\Phi^\pm$ and $\Psi^\pm$ exhibit distinct characteristics regarding entanglement degradation. Finally, we point out possible implications of hovering over a black hole for these states.

abstract: Device-independent (DI) quantum communication will require a loophole-free violation of Bell inequalities. In typical scenarios where line-of-sight between the communicating parties is not available, it is convenient to use energy-time entangled photons due to intrinsic robustness while propagating over optical fibers. Here we show an energy-time Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality violation with two parties separated by 3.7 km over the deployed optical fiber network belonging to the University of Concepci\'on in Chile. Remarkably, this violation is free of the post-selection loophole affecting all previous in-field long-distance energy-time experiments. Our work takes a further step towards a fiber-based loophole-free Bell test, which is highly desired for secure quantum communication due to the widespread existing telecommunication infrastructure.

We cover topics such as equilibration and thermalisation in pure state statistical mechanics, the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, the equivalence of ensembles, non-equilibration dynamics following global and local quenches as well as ramps. We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb-Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability. We put emphasis on rigorous approaches and present the most important results in a unified language.

abstract: We apply a distance-based Bell-test analysis method [E. Knill et al., Phys. Rev. A. 91, 032105 (2015)] to three experimental data sets where conventional analyses failed or required additional assumptions. The first is produced from a new classical source exploiting a "coincidence-time loophole" for which standard analysis falsely shows a Bell violation. The second is from a source previously shown to violate a Bell inequality; the distance-based analysis agrees with the previous results but with fewer assumptions. The third data set does not show a violation with standard analysis despite the high source quality, but is shown to have a strong violation with the distance-based analysis method.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the network entropy for consensus dynamics in classical or quantum networks. We show that in the classical case, the network entropy decreases at the consensus limit if the node initial values are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, and the network differential entropy is monotonically non-increasing if the node initial values are i.i.d. Gaussian. While for quantum consensus dynamics, the network's von Neumann entropy is in contrast non-decreasing. In light of this inconsistency, we compare several gossiping algorithms with random or deterministic coefficients for classical or quantum networks, and show that quantum gossiping algorithms with deterministic coefficients are physically related to classical gossiping algorithms with random coefficients.

The paper shows that the relation has a pure quantum origin deriving it from the quantum potential of the hydrodynamic model. The paper puts under light how these laws originates by the scale invariance breaking due to the quantum potential. The paper also briefly analyzes the consequences of this symmetry breaking on the small-size black holes formation.

abstract: The Pauli Exclusion Principle is one of the most fundamental rules of nature and represents a pillar of modern physics. According to many observations the Pauli Exclusion Principle must be extremely well fulfilled. Nevertheless, numerous experimental investigations were performed to search for a small violation of this principle. The VIP experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory searched for Pauli-forbidden X-ray transitions in copper atoms using the Ramberg-Snow method and obtained the best limit so far. The follow-up experiment VIP2 is designed to reach even higher sensitivity. It aims to improve the limit by VIP by orders of magnitude. The experimental method, comparison of different PEP tests based on different assumptions and the developments for VIP2 are presented.

We consider a setting of networks where quantum communication between nodes is restricted to sending just a qubit, but classical communication is unrestricted. We analyze which N-qubit unitary operations are implementable over cluster networks by investigating transformations of a given cluster network into quantum circuits. We show that any two-qubit unitary operation is implementable over the butterfly network and the grail network, which are fundamental primitive networks for classical network coding. We also analyze probabilistic implementations of unitary operations over cluster networks.

The coupling is observed by measuring the loss from a magnetic trap as the oscillating cantilever induces Zeeman state transitions in the atoms. Interfacing cold atoms with mechanical devices could enable probing and manipulating atomic spins with nanometer spatial resolution and single-spin sensitivity, leading to new capabilities in quantum computation, quantum simulation, or precision sensing.

abstract: We investigate the link between information and thermodynamics embodied by Landauer's principle in the open dynamics of a multipartite quantum system. Such irreversible dynamics is described in terms of a collisional model with a finite temperature reservoir. We demonstrate that Landauer's principle holds, for such a configuration, in a form that involves the flow of heat dissipated into the environment and the rate of change of the entropy of the system. Quite remarkably, such a principle for {\it heat and entropy power} can be explicitly linked to the rate of creation of correlations among the elements of the multipartite system and, in turn, the non-Markovian nature of their reduced evolution. Such features are illustrated in two exemplary cases.

abstract: We study relaxation of a moving spin qubit caused by phonon noise. As we vary the speed of the qubit, we observe several interesting features in spin relaxation and the associated phonon emission, induced by Doppler effect. In particular, in the supersonic regime, the phonons emitted by the relaxing qubit is concentrated along certain directions, similar to the shock waves produced in classical Cherenkov effect. As the speed of the moving qubit increases from the subsonic regime to the supersonic regime, the qubit experiences a peak in the spin relaxation rate near the speed of sound, which we term a spin relaxation boom in analogy to the classical sonic boom. We also find that the moving spin qubit may have a lower relaxation rate than a static qubit, which hints at the possibility of coherence-preserving transportation for a spin qubit. While the physics we have studied here has strong classical analogies, we do find that quantum confinement for the spin qubit plays an important role in all the phenomena we observe. Specifically, it produces a correction on the Cherenkov angle, and removes the divergence in relaxation rate at the sonic barrier. It is our hope that our results would encourage further research into approaches for transferring and preserving quantum information in spin qubit architectures.

abstract: We apply a new method based upon thermofield dynamics (TFD) to study entanglement of finite-spin systems with non-competitive external fields for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases. For the equilibrium finite-spin systems, the temperature dependence of the extended density matrices is derived using this method, and the effect of non-competitive external field is elucidated. For the non-equilibrium finite-spin systems, the time dependence of the extended density matrices and the extended entanglement entropies is derived in accordance with von Noumann equation, and the dissipative dynamics of the finite-spin systems is argued. Consequently, the applicability of the TFD-based method to describe entanglement is confirmed in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases.

abstract: The dipole cutoff behavior for the proton form factor has been and still is one of the major issues in high-energy physics. It is shown that this dipole behavior comes from the coherence between the Lorentz contraction of the proton size and the decreasing wavelength of the incoming photon signal. The contraction rates are the same for both cases. This form of coherence is studied also in the momentum-energy space. The coherence effect in this space can be explained in terms of two overlapping wave functions.

abstract: The emergence of an effective field theory out of equilibrium is studied in the case in which a light field --the system-- interacts with very heavy fields in a finite temperature bath. We obtain the reduced density matrix for the light field, its time evolution is determined by an effective action that includes the \emph{influence action} from correlations of the heavy degrees of freedom. The non-equilibrium effective field theory yields a Langevin equation of motion for the light field in terms of dissipative and noise kernels that obey a generalized fluctuation dissipation relation. These are completely determined by the spectral density of the bath which is analyzed in detail for several cases. At $T=0$ we elucidate the effect of thresholds in the renormalization aspects and the asymptotic emergence of a local effective field theory with unitary time evolution. At $T\neq 0$ new "anomalous" thresholds arise, in particular the \emph{decay} of the environmental heavy fields into the light field leads to \emph{dissipative} dynamics of the light field. Even when the heavy bath particles are thermally suppressed this dissipative contribution leads to the \emph{thermalization} of the light field which is confirmed by a quantum kinetics analysis. We obtain the quantum master equation and show explicitly that its solution in the field basis is precisely the influence action that determines the effective non-equilibrium field theory. The Lindblad form of the quantum master equation features \emph{time dependent dissipative coefficients}. Their time dependence is crucial to extract renormalization effects at asymptotically long time. The dynamics from the quantum master equation is in complete agreement with that of the effective action, Langevin dynamics and quantum kinetics, thus providing a unified framework to effective field theory out of equilibrium.

abstract: One of the new discoveries in quantum biology is the role of Environment Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT) in excitonic transport processes. In disordered quantum systems transport is most efficient when the environment just destroys quantum interferences responsible for localization, but the coupling does not drive the system to fully classical thermal diffusion yet. This poised realm between the pure quantum and the semi-classical domains has not been considered in other biological transport processes, such as charge transport through organic molecules. Binding in receptor-ligand complexes is assumed to be static as electrons are assumed to be not able to cross the ligand molecule. We show that ENAQT makes cross ligand transport possible and efficient between certain atoms opening the way for the reorganization of the charge distribution on the receptor when the ligand molecule docks. This new effect can potentially change our understanding how receptors work. We demonstrate room temperature ENAQT on the caffeine molecule.

abstract: One route to numerically propagating quantum systems is time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The application of TDDFT to a particular system's time evolution is predicated on V-representability which we have analyzed in a previous publication. In this work, we provide new insights concerning lattice V-representability using an newly developed explicit solver for the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential which contrast with implicit solvers studied in the past few years. We present and interpret the force-balance equation central to our numerical method, describe details of its implementation, and present illustrative numerical results. A new characterization of V-representability for one-electron systems is also included. Taken together, the results here open the door to deeper theoretical and numerical investigations of the foundations of TDDFT.

abstract: The transport of excess electrons in liquid argon driven out of equilibrium by an applied electric field is revisited using a multi-term solution of Boltzmann's equation together with ab initio liquid phase cross-sections calculated using the Dirac-Fock scattering equations. The calculation of liquid phase cross-sections extends previous treatments to consider multipole polarisabilities and a non-local treatment of exchange while the accuracy of the electron-argon potential is validated through comparison of the calculated gas phase cross-section with experiment. The results presented highlight the inadequacy of local treatments of exchange that are commonly used in liquid and cluster phase cross-section calculations. The multi-term Boltzmann equation framework accounting for coherent scattering enables the inclusion of the full anisotropy in the differential cross-section arising from the interaction and the structure factor, without an a priori assumption of quasi-isotropy in the velocity distribution function. The model, which contains no free parameters and accounts for both coherent scattering and liquid phase screening effects, was found to reproduce well the experimental drift velocities and characteristic energies.

abstract: Starting from the Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian, we determine the photon current and photon polarization tensor in inhomogeneous, slowly varying electromagnetic fields. To this end, we consider background field configurations varying in both space and time, paying special attention to the tensor structure. As a main result, we obtain compact analytical expressions for the photon polarization tensor in realistic Gaussian laser pulses, as generated in the focal spots of high-intensity lasers. These expressions are of utmost importance for the investigation of quantum vacuum nonlinearities in realistic high-intensity laser experiments.

abstract: We analyze the quantum dynamics of two electromagnetic oscillators coupled in series to a voltage biased Josephson junction. When the applied voltage leads to a Josephson frequency across the junction which matches the sum of the two mode frequencies, tunneling Cooper pairs excite photons in both modes simultaneously leading to far-from-equilibrium states. These states display highly non-classical features including strong anti-bunching, violation of Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities, and number squeezing. The regimes of low and high photon occupancies allow for analytical results which are supported by a full numerical treatment. The impact of asymmetries between the two modes is explored, revealing a pronounced enhancement of number squeezing when the modes are damped at different rates.

abstract: We derive a microscopic model for dissipative dynamics in a system of qubits interacting with an Ohmic bath that generalises the dissipative model of Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert to the case of general anisotropic couplings to a thermal bath. Obtained from the Keldysh path integral formalism, it gives the classical (zero entanglement) limit of a system's dynamics. The fluctuation dissipation relation enforces a close relationship between the thermal fluctuations and dissipative forcing terms of these dynamical equations. We use a representation that highlights the action of dissipation in confining the system to a reduced phase space. This model applies to a system of superconducting flux qubits whose coupling to the environment is necessarily anisotropic. We study the model in the context of the D-Wave computing device and show that the form of environmental coupling in this case produces dynamics that are closely related to several models proposed on phenomenological grounds.

abstract: The density matrix equations of motion in near-degenerate three-level V-type closed-loop atomic system are calculated numerically in Floquet frame. The dynamical behavior of atom- photon entanglement between the dressed atom and its spontaneous emission is studied in semi classical approach beyond the two-photon resonance condition in such a system. The quantum entropy of these two subsystems is investigated by using the von Neumann entropy. It is shown that, the degree of entanglement measure (DEM) can be controlled via the intensity and the detuning of coupling optical field and quantum interference induced by spontaneous emission. Moreover In the absence of quantum interference the steady state behavior of DEM can be achieved even in beyond the two- photon resonance condition. Furthermore In the absence of quantum interference for special parameters of Rabi frequency and detuning of driving laser field disentanglement can be occurred. Also the electromagnetically induced transparency condition can be obtained when the system is disentangled.

abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) posits that the reduced density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is "thermal". Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: for which class of operators, local or non-local, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: is the Hamiltonian of a system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH where in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as certain conditions on the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size are satisfied. This allows one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy densities/temperatures using just a single eigenstate. We provide support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a non-integrable 1D lattice quantum model with only energy conservation. For this particular model, we provide evidence that the aforementioned strong form of ETH holds up to finite size corrections, which enables us to extract the free energy density and correlators of operators at various temperatures using a single eigenstate. We also study a particle number conserving model at infinite temperature which also substantiates our conjecture.

abstract: The quantum analog of Carnot cycles in few-particle systems consists of two quantum adiabatic steps and two isothermal steps. This construction is formally justified by use of a minimum work principle. It is then shown, without relying on any microscopic interpretations of work or heat, that the heat-to-work efficiency of the quantum Carnot cycle thus constructed may be further optimized, provided that two conditions regarding the expectation value of some generalized force operators evaluated at equilibrium states are satisfied. In general the optimized efficiency is system-specific, lower than the Carnot efficiency, and dependent upon both temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs. Simple computational examples are used to illustrate our theory. The results should be an important guide towards the design of favorable working conditions of a realistic quantum heat engine.

abstract: Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction (SOI) controlled band structure of a two-dimensional superlattice allows for the modulation of the conductance of finite size devices by changing the strength of the SOI. We consider rectangular arrays and find that the temperature dependence of the conductance disappears for high temperatures, but the strength of the SOI still affects the conductance at these temperatures. The modulation effect can be seen even in the presence of strong dephasing, which can be important in case of practical applications.

For finite mesoscopic arrays we show that their conductance properties can be understood from these spin-dependent band diagrams.

abstract: Transport properties of massive Dirac particles are investigated through an oscillating barrier. The Floquet quasienergies related to the time-dependent potential appear both in transmission and reflection as sidebands around the incoming electron's energy. We take all relevant sidebands into account and present time averaged transmission and reflection probabilities in a wide energy range. Most qualitative features of scattering on a static barrier -- like Klein paradox -- are still visible, but the transmission probability in the evanescent regime observably increases due to the oscillation of the potential. The strongly inelastic scattering process is shown to lead to multiple Fano-type resonances and temporal trapping of the particles inside the oscillating potential. We also present a detailed study of the time evolution of the wave packets generated in the scattering process. Our results can be relevant for graphene with an induced energy gap.

abstract: Broadband suppression of quantum noise below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) becomes a top-priority problem for the future generation of large-scale terrestrial detectors of gravitational waves, as the interferometers of the Advanced LIGO project, predesigned to be quantum-noise-limited in the almost entire detection band, are phased in. To this end, among various proposed methods of quantum noise suppression or signal amplification, the most elaborate approach implies a so-called *xylophone* configuration of two Michelson interferometers, each optimised for its own frequency band, with a combined broadband sensitivity well below the SQL. Albeit ingenious, it is a rather costly solution. We demonstrate that changing the optical scheme to a Sagnac interferometer with weak detuned signal recycling and frequency dependent input squeezing can do almost as good a job, as the xylophone for significantly lower spend. We also show that the Sagnac interferometer is more robust to optical loss in filter cavity, used for frequency dependent squeezed vacuum injection, than an analogous Michelson interferometer, thereby reducing building cost even more.

Since full tensor environment is taken into account, then with increasing bond dimension the optimized PEPS becomes the exact Gibbs state. Our presentation opens with a 1D version for a matrix product state (MPS) and then generalizes to PEPS in 2D. Benchmark results in the quantum Ising model are presented.

abstract: We explore the R\'enyi entanglement entropies of a one-dimensional (line) subsystem of length $L$ embedded in two-dimensional $L\times L$ square lattice for quantum spin models whose ground-state breaks a continuous symmetry in the thermodynamic limit. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we first study the $J_1 - J_2$ Heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1>0$ and ferromagnetic second-neighbor couplings $J_2\le 0$. The signature of SU(2) symmetry breaking on finite size systems, ranging from $L=4$ up to $L=40$ clearly appears as a universal additive logarithmic correction to the R\'enyi entanglement entropies: $l_q \ln L$ with $l_q\simeq 1$, independent of the R\'enyi index and values of $J_2$. We confirm this result using a high precision spin-wave analysis (with restored spin rotational symmetry) on finite lattices up to $10^5\times 10^5$ sites, allowing to explore further non-universal finite size corrections and study in addition the case of U(1) symmetry breaking. Our results fully agree with the prediction $l_q=n_G/2$ where $n_G$ is the number of Goldstone modes, by Metlitski and Grover [arXiv:1112.5166].

abstract: Materials exhibiting negative differential resistance have important applications in technologies involving microwave generation, which range from motion sensing to radio astronomy. Despite their usefulness, there has been few physical mechanisms giving rise to materials with such properties, i.e. GaAs employed in the Gunn diode. In this work, we show that negative differential resistance also generically arise in Dirac ring systems, an example of which has been experimentally observed in the surface states of Topological Insulators. This novel realization of negative differential resistance is based on a completely different physical mechanism from that of the Gunn effect, relying on the characteristic non-monotonicity of the response curve that remains robust in the presence of nonzero temperature, chemical potential, mass gap and impurity scattering. As such, it opens up new possibilities for engineering applications, such as frequency upconversion devices which are highly sought for terahertz signal generation. Our results may be tested with thin films of Bi2Se3 Topological Insulators, and are expected to hold qualitatively even in the absence of a strictly linear Dirac dispersion, as will be the case in more generic samples of Bi2Se3 and other materials with topologically nontrivial Fermi sea regions.

abstract: Transmission of Dirac fermions through a chip of graphene under the effect of magnetic field and a time vibrating double barrier with frequency $w$ is investigated. Quantum interference within the oscillating barrier has an important effect on quasi-particles tunneling. A combination of both a time dependent potential and a magnetic field generate physical states whose energy is double quantified by the pair of integers $(n, l)$ with high degeneracy. The large number of modes that exist in the energy spectrum presents a colossal difficulty in numerical computations. Thus we were obliged to make a truncation and limit ourselves to the central $(n = 0)$ and two adjacent side band ($n=\pm 1$).

abstract: !-graphs provide a means of reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams and have proven useful in manipulation of (co)algebraic structures like Hopf algebras, Frobenius algebras, and compositions thereof. However, they have previously been limited by an inability to express families of diagrams involving non-commutative structures which play a central role in algebraic quantum information and the theory of quantum groups. In this paper, we fix this shortcoming by offering a new semantics for non-commutative !-graphs using an enriched version of Penrose's abstract tensor notation.

abstract: We derive anomalous equations of state for non-relativistic 2D complex bosonic felds with contact interactions, using Fujikawa's path-integral approach to anomalies and scaling arguments. In the process, we derive an anomalous virial theorem for such systems. The methods used are easily generalizable for other 2D systems, including fermionic ones, and of different spatial dimensionality, all of which share a classical SO(2,1) Schrodinger symmetry. The discussion is of a more formal nature and is intended mainly to shed light on the structure of anomalies in 2D many-body systems. The practicality of these ideas rests upon being able to compute in detail the Fujikawa Jacobian that contains the anomaly. This and other technical and conceptual issues are discussed at the end of the paper

abstract: In this paper, we show that an attempt to construct shape invariant extensions of a known shape invariant potential leads to, apart from a shift by a constant, the well known technique of isospectral shift deformation. Using this, we construct infinite sets of generalized potentials with $X_m$ exceptional polynomials as solutions. These potentials are rational extensions of the existing shape invariant potentials. The method is elucidated using the radial oscillator and the trigonometric P\"{o}schl-Teller potentials. For the case of radial oscillator, in addition to the known rational extensions, we construct two infinite sets of rational extensions, which seem to be less studied. For one of the potential, we show that its solutions involve a third type of exceptional Laguerre polynomials. Explicit expressions of this generalized infinite set of potentials and the corresponding solutions are presented. For the trigonometric P\"{o}schl-Teller potential, our analysis points to the possibility of several rational extensions beyond those known in literature.

We conjecture that the influence of chaos on this correlator can develop no faster than exponentially, with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L \le 2 \pi k_B T/\hbar$. We give a precise mathematical argument, based on plausible physical assumptions, establishing this conjecture.

abstract: We study slow variation (both spatial as well as temporal) of a parameter of a system in the vicinity of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, in particular, a discontinuity critical point (DCP) (or a first-order critical point). We obtain the universal scaling relations of the density of defects and the residual energy after a temporal quench, while we also unravel the scaling of the characteristic length scale associated with a spatial quench of a symmetry breaking field. Considering a spin-1/2 XXZ chain we establish how these scaling relations get modified when the DCP is located at the boundary of a gapless critical phase; these predictions are also confirmed numerically.

abstract: We consider two immobile spin $1/2$ fermions in a two-dimensional magnetic system that is close to the $ O(3)$ magnetic quantum critical point (QCP) which separates magnetically ordered and disordered phases. Focusing on the disordered phase in the vicinity of the QCP, we demonstrate that the criticality results in a strong long range attraction between the fermions, with potential $V(r) \propto -1/r^{\nu}$, $\nu \approx 0.75$, where $r$ is separation between the fermions. The mechanism of the enhanced attraction is similar to Casimir effect and corresponds to multi-magnon exchange processes between the fermions. While we consider a model system, the problem is originally motivated by recent establishment of magnetic QCP in hole doped cuprates under the superconducting dome at doping of about 10\%. We suggest the mechanism of magnetic critical enhancement of pairing in cuprates.

abstract: In a multi-terminal device the (electronic) heat and charge currents can follow different paths. In this paper we introduce and analyse a class of multi-terminal devices where this property is pushed to its extreme limits, with charge $and$ heat currents flowing in different reservoirs. After introducing the main characteristics of such $heat-charge$ $current$ $separation$ regime we show how to realise it in a multi-terminal device with normal and superconducting leads. We demonstrate that this regime allows to control independently heat and charge flows and to greatly enhance thermoelectric performances at low temperatures. We analyse in details a three-terminal setup involving a superconducting lead, a normal lead and a voltage probe. For a generic scattering region we show that in the regime of heat-charge current separation both the power factor and the figure of merit $ZT$ are highly increased with respect to a standard two-terminal system. These results are confirmed for the specific case of a system consisting of three coupled quantum dots.

abstract: Quantum transport through disordered structures is inhibited by (Anderson) localization effects. The disorder can be either topological as in random networks or energetical as in the original Anderson model. In both cases the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian associated with the network become localized. We show how to overcome localization by network multiplexing. Here, multiple layers of random networks with the same number of nodes are stacked in such a way that in the perpendicular directions regular one-dimensional networks are formed. Depending on the ratio of the coupling within the layer and perpendicular to it, transport gets either enhanced or diminished. In particular, if the couplings are of the same order, transport gets enhanced and localization effects can be overcome. We exemplify our results by two examples: multiplexes of random networks and of one-dimensional Anderson models.

abstract: Since the very first experiments, superconducting circuits have suffered from strong coupling to environmental noise, destroying quantum coherence and degrading performance. In state-of-the-art experiments it is found that the relaxation time of superconducting qubits fluctuates as a function of time. We present measurements of such fluctuations in a 3D-Transmon circuit and develop a qualitative model based on interactions within a bath of background two-level systems (TLS) which emerge from defects in the device material. Assuming both high- and low-frequency TLS are present, their mutual interaction will lead to fluctuations in the noise spectral density acting on the qubit circuit. This model is further supported by direct measurements of energy fluctuations in a single high-frequency TLS.

abstract: A natural atom placed into a cavity with time-dependent parameters can be parametrically excited due to the interaction with the quantized photon mode. One of the channels of such a process is the dynamical Lamb effect, induced by a nonadiabatic modulation of atomic level Lamb shift. However, in experiments with natural atoms it is quite difficult to isolate this effect from other mechanisms of atom excitation. We point out that a transmission line cavity coupled with a superconducting qubit (artificial macroscopic atom) provides a unique platform for the observation of the dynamical Lamb effect. A key idea is to exploit a dynamically tunable qubit-resonator coupling, which was implemented quite recently. By varying nonadiabatically the coupling, it is possible to parametrically excite a qubit through a nonadiabatic modulation of the Lamb shift, even if the cavity was initially empty. A dynamics of such a coupled system is studied within the Rabi model with time-dependent coupling constant and beyond the rotating wave approximation. An efficient method to increase the effect through the periodic and nonadiabatic switching of a qubit-resonator coupling energy is proposed.

abstract: The recently proposed UV self-complete quantum gravity program is a new and very interesting way to envision Planckian/trans-Planckian physics. in this new framework, high energy scattering is dominated by the creation of micro black holes, and it is experimentally impossible to probe distances shorter than the horizon radius. In this letter we present a model which realizes this idea through the creation of self-regular quantum black holes admitting a minimal size extremal configuration. Their radius provides a dynamically generated minimal length acting as a universal short-distance cut-off. We propose a quantisation scheme for this new kind of microscopic objects based on a Bohr-like approach, which does not require a detailed knowledge of quantum gravity. The resulting black hole quantum picture resembles the energy spectrum of a quantum harmonic oscillator. The mass of the extremal configuration plays the role of zero-point energy. Large quantum number re-establish the classical black hole description. Finally, we also formulate a "quantum hoop conjecture" which is satisfied by all the mass eigen-states and sustains the existence of quantum black holes sourced by Gaussian matter distributions.

abstract: The conversion of ultracold atoms to molecules via a magnetic Feshbach resonance with a sinusoidal modulation of the field is studied. Different practical realizations of this method in Bose atomic gases are analyzed. Our model incorporates many-body effects through an effective reduction of the complete microscopic dynamics. Moreover, we simulate the experimental conditions corresponding to the preparation of the system as a thermal gas and as a condensate. Some of the experimental findings are clarified. The origin of the observed dependence of the production efficiency on the frequency, amplitude, and application time of the magnetic modulation is elucidated. Our results uncover also the role of the atomic density in the dynamics, specifically, in the observed saturation of the atom-molecule conversion process.

We also construct the coherent states for the same systems using the ladder operators obtained by traditional methods with the knowledge of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation. We show that both methods yield coherent states with identical algebraic structure.

abstract: Quantum-disordering a discrete-symmetry breaking state by condensing domain-walls can lead to a trivial symmetric insulator state. In this work, we show that if we bind a 1D representation of the symmetry (such as a charge) to the intersection point of several domain walls, condensing such modified domain-walls can lead to a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. This result is obtained by showing that the modified domain-wall condensed state has a non-trivial SPT invariant -- the symmetry-twist dependent partition function. We propose two different kinds of field theories that can describe the above mentioned SPT states. The first one is a Ginzburg-Landau-type non-linear sigma model theory, but with an additional multi-kink domain-wall topological term. The second one is a gauge theory, which is beyond Abelian Chern Simons/BF gauge theories. We argue that the two field theories are equivalent at low energies. After coupling to the symmetry twists, both theories produce the desired SPT invariant. Our approach completely captures bosonic SPT states with finite Abelian group symmetry in 1+1D and 2+1D, and also sheds lights towards constructing complete bulk dynamical actions for Abelian bosonic SPT states in 3+1D. We further show that edge theories for these SPT states can be naturally derived from the bulk-edge correspondence via a dimension reduction scheme.

abstract: We study the nature of the inner Cauchy horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in a quantum context by means of the horizon wave-function obtained from modelling the electrically charged source as a Gaussian wave-function. Our main finding it that there is a significant range of black hole mass (around the Planck scale) and specific charge for which the probability of realizing the inner horizon is negligible. This result suggests that any semiclassical instability one expects near the inner horizon may not be occur in quantum black holes.

abstract: Single-atom-resolved detection in optical lattices using quantum-gas microscopes has enabled a new generation of experiments in the field of quantum simulation. Fluorescence imaging of individual atoms has so far been achieved for bosonic species with optical molasses cooling, whereas detection of fermionic alkaline atoms in optical lattices by this method has proven more challenging. Here we demonstrate single-site- and single-atom-resolved fluorescence imaging of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in a quantum-gas microscope setup using electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling. We detected on average 1000 fluorescence photons from a single atom within 1.5s, while keeping it close to the vibrational ground state of the optical lattice. Our results will enable the study of strongly correlated fermionic quantum systems in optical lattices with resolution at the single-atom level, and give access to observables such as the local entropy distribution and individual defects in fermionic Mott insulators or anti-ferromagnetically ordered phases.

abstract: This article is concerned with the role of fundamental principles in theoretical physics, especially quantum theory. The fundamental principles of relativity will be be addressed as well in view of their role in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, specifically Dirac's work, which, in particular Dirac's derivation of his relativistic equation for the electron from the principles of relativity and quantum theory, is the main focus of this article. I shall, however, also consider Heisenberg's derivation of quantum mechanics, which inspired Dirac. I argue that Heisenberg's and Dirac's work alike was guided by their adherence to and confidence in the fundamental principles of quantum theory. The final section of the article discusses the recent work by G. M. D' Ariano and his coworkers on the principles of quantum information theory, which extends quantum theory and its principles in a new direction. This extension enabled them to offer a new derivation of Dirac's equation from these principles alone, without using the principles of relativity.

abstract: We propose an approach to position measurements based on the hypothesis that the action of a position detector on a quantum system can be effectively described by a dissipative disordered potential. We show that such kind of potential is able, via the dissipation-induced Anderson localization, to contemporary localize the wavefunction of the system and to dissipate information to modes bounded to the detector. By imposing a diabaticity condition we demonstrate that the dissipative dynamics between the modes of the system leads to a localized energy exchange between the detector and the rest of the environment -the "click" of the detector- thus providing a complete deterministic description of a position measurement. We finally numerically demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the Born probability rule.

The problem of constructing proper initial wavefunctions coupled to single excitations of the model is also treated within perturbative and non-perturbative methods.

abstract: In his famous doctoral dissertation, de Broglie assumed that a massive particle is surrounded in its rest frame by a standing wave. He argued that as observed from another inertial frame this wave becomes the superluminal wave now known as the de Broglie wave. It is shown here that under a Lorentz transformation, such a standing wave becomes, not the de Broglie wave, but a modulated wave moving at the velocity of the particle. It is the modulation that has the superluminal velocity of the de Broglie wave and should be recognized as the true de Broglie wave. De Broglie's demonstrations relied, variously, on his "theorem of the harmony of phases", on a mechanical model, and on a spacetime diagram. It is shown that in each case the underlying wave was inadvertently suppressed. Identified as a modulation, the de Broglie wave acquires a physically reasonable ontology, avoiding the awkward device of recovering the particle velocity from a superposition of such waves. The deeper wave structure implied by this de Broglie wave must also impinge on such issues in quantum mechanics as the meaning of the wave function and the nature of wave-particle duality.

abstract: We investigate the absorption line shapes of laser-dressed atoms beyond the single-atom response, by using extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulse trains to probe an optically thick helium target under the influence of a strong infrared (IR) field. We study the interplay between the IR-induced phase shift of the microscopic time-dependent dipole moment and the resonant-propagation-induced reshaping of the macroscopic XUV pulse. Our experimental and theoretical results show that as the optical depth increases, this interplay leads initially to a broadening of the IR-modified line shape, and subsequently to the appearance of new, narrow features in the absorption line.

abstract: In this paper we calculate the scale anomaly for a quantum field theoretic 2D-nonrelativistic Bose gas with contact interactions using Fujikawa's method, both in vacuum and in many-body systems. The use of path integrals for these problems is novel and motivated by a recently developed path-integral framework for addressing questions about scaling in these systems. A natural class of regulators is found that produces the correct value of the anomaly traditionally calculated via other methods, e.g., diagrammatically via the beta function.

abstract: The evolution of the, initially Gaussian, centre-of-mass wave-function for a homogeneous, spherical particle according to the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation can be approximated by a harmonic potential, if the wave-function is narrow compared to the size of the particle. Here, the validity of a previously proposed approximation of the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation is studied, where this is extended beyond the regime of narrow wave-functions, replacing the coupling constant of the harmonic potential by a function of the wave-function width. It turns out that such an extension beyond the narrow wave-function regime is not a good approximation for the self-gravitational evolution according to the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation.

abstract: We investigate the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture by means of the horizon wave-function (HWF) formalism. We consider a charged massive particle whose quantum mechanical state is represented by a spherically symmetric Gaussian wave-function, and restrict our attention to the superxtremal case (with charge-to-mass ratio $\alpha>1$), which is the prototype of a naked singularity in the classical theory. We find that one can still obtain a normalisable HWF for $\alpha^2<{2}$, and this configuration has a non-vanishing probability of being a black hole, thus extending the classically allowed region for a charged black hole. However, the HWF is not normalisable for $\alpha^2 > 2$, and the uncertainty in the location of the horizon blows up at $\alpha^2=2$, signalling that such an object is no more well-defined. This perhaps implies that a quantum Cosmic Censorhip might be conjectured by stating that no black holes with charge-to-mass ratio greater than a critical value (of the order of $\sqrt{2}$) can exist.

This is an important tool for implementing quantum gates and other quantum information protocols with Rydberg atoms, and reliable theoretical methods to find such magic wavelengths are thus extremely useful. We use a high-precision all-order method to calculate magic wavelengths for the $5s-18s$ transition of rubidium, and compare the calculation to experiment by measuring the light shift for atoms held in an optical dipole trap at a range of wavelengths near a calculated magic value.

Our main result is a second-order Derivative Expansion (DE) approximation for the Casimir energy, which is studied in different interesting limits. In particular, we focus on the emergence of a non-analyticity beyond the leading-order term in the DE, when approaching the limit of perfectly-conducting mirrors. We also show that the system considered is equivalent to a dual one, consisting of a massless real scalar field satisfying imperfect Neumann conditions (on the very same boundaries). Therefore, the results obtained for the EM field hold also true for the scalar field model

The Generalized Hyper-Ramsey Resonance based on independent manipulation of interaction time, field amplitude and frequency detuning is presented to increase performances in the next generation of atomic, molecular and nuclear clocks, to upgrade high resolution frequency measurement in Penning trap mass spectrometry, for a better control of light induced frequency shifts in matter wave interferometer and quantum information processing.

abstract: Some physical effects of time averaged quantum electric field fluctuations are discussed. The one loop radiative correction to potential scattering are approximately derived from simple arguments which invoke vacuum electric field fluctuations. For both above barrier scattering and quantum tunneling, this effect increases the transmission probability. It is argued that the shape of the potential determines a sampling function for the time averaging of the quantum electric field operator. We also suggest that there is a nonperturbative enhancement of the transmission probability which can be inferred from the probability distribution for time averaged electric field fluctuations.

An ab initio nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NA-QMD) analysis of C$_{60}$+C$_{60}$ collisions reveals that the dominant excitation of an exceptionally "giant" oblate-prolate H$_g(1)$ mode plays the key role in answering both questions. From these microscopic calculations, a macroscopic collision model is derived, which reproduces the NA-QMD results. Moreover, it predicts analytically fusion barriers for different fullerene-fullerene combinations in excellent agreement with experiments.

We firstly discuss the quantum foundational reasons that led us to investigate the mechanisms of formation and combination of concepts in human reasoning, starting from the empirically observed deviations from classical logical and probabilistic structures. We then develop our quantum-theoretic perspective in Fock space which allows successful modeling of various sets of cognitive experiments collected by different scientists, including ourselves. In addition, we formulate a unified explanatory hypothesis for the presence of quantum structures in cognitive processes, and discuss our recent discovery of further quantum aspects in concept combinations, namely, 'entanglement' and 'indistinguishability'. We finally illustrate perspectives for future research.

abstract: We numerically study quantum phase transitions and dynamical properties in the one-dimensional cluster model with several interactions by using the time-evolving block decimation method for infinite systems and the exact diagonalization. First, boundaries among several quantum phases of the model are determined from energy gap and each phase is characterized by order parameters and the entanglement spectrum (ES). We confirm that in the model with open boundary condition the degeneracy of the lowest levels in the ES corresponds to that of the ground states. Then, using the time-dependent Bogoliubov transformation with open boundary condition, we investigate dynamical properties during an interaction sweep through the critical point which separates two topological phases involving four-fold degeneracy in the ground state. After a slow sweep across the critical point, we observe spatially periodic structures in the string correlation functions and the entanglement entropy. It is shown that the periodicities stem from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles generated near the critical point.

abstract: Work in the paradigm of quantum fluctuation theorems of Crooks and Jarzynski, is determined by projective measurements of energy at the beginning and end of the force protocol. In analogy to classical systems, we consider an alternate definition of work given by the integral of the supplied power determined by integrating up the results of repeated measurements of the instantaneous power during the force protocol. We observe that such a definition of work, in spite of taking account of the process dependence, has different possible values and statistics from the work determined by the conventional two energy measurement approach (TEMA). In the limit of many projective measurements of power, the system's dynamics is frozen in the power measurement basis due to the quantum Zeno effect leading to statistics only trivially dependent on the force protocol except for the case when the instantaneous power operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian at all times. We also consider properties of the joint statistics of power-based definition of work and TEMA work in protocols where both values are determined. This allows us to quantify their correlations. Relaxing the projective measurement condition, weak continuous measurements of power are considered within the stochastic master equation formalism. Even in this scenario the power-based work statistics is in general not able to reproduce qualitative features of the TEMA work statistics.

abstract: Quantum control could be implemented by varying the system Hamiltonian. According to adiabatic theorem, a slowly changing Hamiltonian can approximately keep the system at the ground state during the evolution if the initial state is a ground state. In this paper we consider this process as an interpolation between the initial and final Hamiltonians. We use the mean value of a single operator to measure the distance between the final state and the ideal ground state. This measure could be taken as the error of adiabatic approximation. We prove under certain conditions, this error can be precisely estimated for an arbitrarily given interpolating function. This error estimation could be used as guideline to induce adiabatic evolution. According to our calculation, the adiabatic approximation error is not proportional to the average speed of the variation of the system Hamiltonian and the inverse of the energy gaps in many cases. In particular, we apply this analysis to an example on which the applicability of the adiabatic theorem is questionable.

abstract: Quantum field theory in curved space-times is a well developed area in mathematical physics which has had important phenomenological applications to the very early universe. However, it is not commonly appreciated that on time dependent space-times ---including the simplest cosmological models--- dynamics of quantum fields is not unitary in the standard sense. This issue is first explained with an explicit example and it is then shown that a generalized notion of unitarity does hold. The generalized notion allows one to correctly pass to the Schr\"odinger picture starting from the Heisenberg picture used in the textbook treatments. Finally, we indicate how these considerations can be extended from simple cosmological models to general globally hyperbolic space-times

abstract: The Carnot statement of the second law of thermodynamics poses an upper limit on the efficiency of all heat engines. Recently, it has been studied whether generic quantum features such as coherence and quantum entanglement could allow for quantum devices with efficiencies larger than the Carnot efficiency. The present study shows that this is not permitted by the laws of thermodynamics. In particular, we will show that rather the definition of heat has to be modified to account for the thermodynamic cost for maintaining coherence and entanglement. Our theoretical findings are numerically illustrated for an experimentally relevant example from optomechanics.

abstract: The idea that black holes (BHs) result in highly excited states representing both the "hydrogen atom" and the "quasi-thermal emission" in quantum gravity is today an intuitive but general conviction. In this paper it will be shown that such an intuitive picture is more than a picture. In fact, we will discuss a model of quantum BH somewhat similar to the historical semi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in 1913. The model is completely consistent with existing results in the literature, starting from the celebrated result of Bekenstein on the area quantization.

abstract: We present a new theoretical framework for describing an impurity in a trapped Bose system in one spatial dimension. The theory handles any external confinement, arbitrary mass ratios, and a weak interaction may be included between the Bose particles. To demonstrate our technique, we calculate the ground state energy and properties of a sample system with eight bosons and find an excellent agreement with numerically exact results. Our theory can thus provide definite predictions for experiments in cold atomic gases.

abstract: We present a classical counterpart to quantum teleportation that uses classical entanglement instead of quantum entanglement. In our implementation we take advantage of classical entanglement among three parties: orbital angular momentum (OAM), polarization, and the radial degrees of freedom of a beam of light. We demonstrate the teleportation of arbitrary OAM states, in the subspace spanned by any two OAM states, to the polarization of the same beam. Our letter presents the first classical demonstration of a commonly-perceived--quantum phenomenon that requires entanglement among more than two parties.

abstract: Certain real parameters of a Hamiltonian, when continued to complex values, can give rise to singular points called exceptional points ($EP$'s), where two or more eigenvalues coincide and the complexified Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. We show that for a generic $d$-dimensional topological superconductor/superfluid with a chiral symmetry, one can find $EP$'s associated with the chiral zero energy Majorana fermions bound to a topological defect/edge. Exploiting the chiral symmetry, we propose a formula for counting the number ($n$) of such chiral zero modes. We also establish the connection of these solutions to the Majorana fermion wavefunctions in the position space. The imaginary parts of these momenta are related to the exponential decay of the wavefunctions localized at the defect/edge, and hence their change of sign at a topological phase transition point signals the appearance or disappearance of a chiral Majorana zero mode. Our analysis thus explains why topological invariants like the winding number, defined for the corresponding Hamiltonian in the momentum space for a defectless system with periodic boundary conditions, captures the number of admissible Majorana fermion solutions for the position space Hamiltonian with defect(s). Finally, we conclude that $EP$'s cannot be associated with the Majorana fermion wavefunctions for systems with no chiral symmetry, though one can use our formula for counting $n$, using complex $k$ solutions where the determinant of the corresponding BdG Hamiltonian vanishes.

abstract: We study the entanglement production in a quantum spin Hall ring geometry where electrons of opposite spins are emitted in pairs from a source and collected in two different detectors. Postselection of coincidence detector events gives rise to entanglement in the system, measurable through correlations between the outcomes in the detectors. We have chosen a geometry such that the entanglement depends on the dynamical phases picked up by the edge states as they move around the ring. In turn, the dependence of the phases on gate potential and Rashba interaction allows for a precise electrical control of the entanglement production in the ring.

abstract: Supersymmetries in quantum mechanics offer a way to obtain degeneracies in the excitation spectrum which do not originate from selection rules. The mechanism behind the degeneracies is the same as the one that leads to the miraculous cancellations of divergences in supersymmetric field theories found in the high energy physics context. Even though of importance, there is up to now no realistic proposal of non-integrable systems that show level degeneracies due to a supersymmetric structure. Here, we propose an implementation of a quantum-mechanical supersymmetry in a Cooper-pair box shunted by a Josephson junction rhombus which is effectively $\pi$-periodic in the superconducting phase difference. For a characteristic ratio between the strength of the $2\pi$- and the $\pi$-periodic junction, we find a two-fold degeneracy of all the energy levels all the way from the weak junction/charge qubit limit to the strong junction/transmon regime. We provide explicit values for the parameters of the rhombus and show that tuning in and out of the supersymmetric point is easily achieved by varying an external gate voltage. We furthermore discuss a microwave experiment to detect the supersymmetry and conclude that it could indeed be simulated with currently existing Josephson junction technology.

abstract: We consider various approaches to the creation of a high-stability active optical frequency standard, where the atomic ensemble itself produces a highly stable and accurate frequency signal. The short-time frequency stability of such standards may overcome the stability of lasers stabilized to macroscopic cavities which are used as local oscillators in the modern optical frequency standard systems. The main idea is to create a "superradiant" laser operating deep in the bad cavity regime, where the decay rate of the cavity field significantly exceeds the decoherence rate of the lasing transition. Two main approaches towards the realization of an active optical frequency standard have been proposed already: the optical lattice laser, and the atomic beam laser. We consider these and some alternative approaches, and discuss the parameters for atomic ensembles necessary to attain the metrology relevant level of short-time frequency stability, and various effects and main challenges critical for practical implementations.

abstract: We show that the general quantum state of synthetically spin-orbit coupled ultra cold bosonic atom whose condensate was experimentally created recently ( Y. J. Lin {\it et al.}, Nature, {\bf 471}, 83, (2011)), shows entanglement between motional degrees of freedom ( momentum) and internal degrees of freedom (hyperfine spin). We demonstrate the violation of Bell-like inequality (CHSH) for such states that provides a unique opportunity to verify fundamental principle like quantum non-contextuality for commutating observables which are not spatially separated. We analyze in detail the Rabi oscillation executed by such atom-laser system and how that influneces quantities like entanglement entropy, violation of Bell like Inequality etc. We also discuss the implication of our result in testing the quantum non-contextuality and Bell's Inequality vioaltion by macroscopic quantum object like Bose-Einstein Condensate of ultra cold atoms.

abstract: We investigate three-body recombination rates into deep dimers in cold atomic gases with large scattering length within hyper-spherical adiabatic zero-range approach. We derive closed analytic expressions for the rates for one- and two-species gases. Although the deep dimers are beyond the zero-range theory the latter can still describe the recombination into deep dimers by use of one additional short-range absorption parameter. The recombination rate, as function of the scattering length, retains the known universal behavior --- the fourth power trend with characteristic log-periodic peaks --- however increasing the short-range absorption broadens the peaks until they are eventually completely smeared out. Increasing the heavy-to-light mass ratio in a two-species system decreases the distance between the peaks and increases the overal scale of the recombination rate.

The objective was to study with very high resolution the exceptional spectral properties emerging from the symmetries of the icosahedral structure of the carbon lattice. In particular, the number of zero modes has been determined to test the predictions of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, which relates it to the topology of the curved carbon lattice. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental verification of the index theorem.

abstract: In this paper we introduce Schwartz operators as a non-commutative analog of Schwartz functions and provide a detailed discussion of their properties. We equip them in particular with a number of different (but equivalent) families of seminorms which turns the space of Schwartz operators into a Frechet space. The study of the topological dual leads to non-commutative tempered distributions which are discussed in detail as well. We show in particular that the latter can be identified with a certain class of quadratic forms, therefore making operations like products with bounded (and also some unbounded) operators and quantum harmonic analysis available to objects which are otherwise too singular for being a Hilbert space operator. Finally we show how the new methods can be applied by studying operator moment problems and convergence properties of fluctuation operators.

abstract: For a pair of real or complex scattering potentials $v_j:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ ($j=1,2$) with support $I_j$ and transfer matrix $M_j$, the transfer matrix of $v_1+v_2$ is given by the product $M_2 M_1$ provided that $I_1$ lies to the left of $I_2$. We explore the prospects of generalizing this composition rule for the cases that $I_1$ and $I_2$ have a small intersection. In particular, we show that if $I_1$ and $I_2$ intersect in a finite closed interval of length $\ell$ in which both the potentials are analytic, then the lowest order correction to the above composition rule is proportional to $\ell^5$. This correction is of the order of $\ell^3$, if $v_1$ and $v_2$ are respectively analytic throughout this interval except at $x=\ell$ and $x=0$. We use these results to explore the superposition of a pair of unidirectionally invisible potentials with overlapping support.

abstract: We analyse in this paper the data collected in a set of experiments performed on human subjects on the combination of natural concepts. We investigate the mutual influence of conceptual conjunction and negation by measuring the membership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two concepts, e.g., 'Fruits' and 'Vegetables', and their conjunction 'Fruits And Vegetables', but also their conjunction when one or both concepts are negated, namely, 'Fruits And Not Vegetables', 'Not Fruits And Vegetables' and 'Not Fruits And Not Vegetables'. Our findings sharpen existing analysis on conceptual combinations, revealing systematic and remarkable deviations from classical (fuzzy set) logic and probability theory. And, more important, our results give further considerable evidence to the validity of our quantum-theoretic framework for the combination of two concepts. Indeed, the representation of conceptual negation naturally arises from the general assumptions of our two-sector Fock space model, and this representation faithfully agrees with the collected data. In addition, we find a further significant deviation and a priori unexpected from classicality, which can exactly be explained by assuming that human reasoning is the superposition of an 'emergent reasoning' and a 'logical reasoning', and that these two processes can be successfully represented in a Fock space algebraic structure.

abstract: An alternative, geometrical proof of a known theorem concerning the decomposition of positive maps of the matrix algebra $M_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ has been presented. The premise of the proof is the identification of positive maps with operators preserving the Lorentz cone in four dimensions, and it allows to decompose the positive maps with respect to those preserving the boundary of the cone. In addition, useful conditions implying complete positivity of a map of $M_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ have been given, together with a sufficient condition for complete positivity of an extremal Schwarz map of $M_{n}(\mathbb{C})$. Lastly, following the same geometrical approach, a description in topological terms of maps that are simultaneously completely positive and completely copositive has been presented.

abstract: A thermodynamic system of non-interacting quantum particles changes its statistical distribution formulas if there is a universal limitation for the size of energetic quantum leaps (magnitude of quantum leaps smaller than Planck energy). By means of a restriction of the a priori equiprobability postulate one can reach a thermodynamic foundation of these corrected distribution formulas. The number of microstates is determined by means of a suitable counting method and combined with thermodynamics via the Boltzmann principle. The result is that, for particle energies that come close to the Planck energy, the thermodynamic difference between fermion and boson distribution vanishes. Both distributions then approximate a Boltzmann distribution. The wave and particle character of the quantum particles, too, can be influenced by choosing the size of the temperature and particle energy parameters relative to the Planck energy, as you can see from the associated fluctuation formulas. In the case of non-relativistic degeneration, the critical parameters Fermi momentum (fermions) and Einstein temperature (bosons) vanish as soon as the rest energy of the quantum particles reaches the Planck energy. For the Bose-Einstein condensation there exists, in the condensation range, a finite upper limit for the number of particles in the ground state, which is determined by the ratio of Planck mass to the rest mass of the quantum particles. In the relativistic high-temperature range, the energy densities of photon and neutrino radiation have finite limit values, which is of interest with regard to the start of cosmic expansion.

There exist various exotic attractors, including ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and inccomensurate fixed points, as well as regions of persistent oscillations. Many of these features can be understood analytically by truncating to the two lowest lying states of the Rabi model on each site. We also show that these features survive beyond mean-field, using Matrix Product Operator simulations.

abstract: We report observations of superradiance for atoms trapped in the near field of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). By fabricating the PCW with a band edge near the D$_1$ transition of atomic cesium, strong interaction is achieved between trapped atoms and guided-mode photons. Following short-pulse excitation, we record the decay of guided-mode emission and find a superradiant emission rate scaling as $\bar{\Gamma}_{\rm SR}\propto\bar{N}\cdot\Gamma_{\rm 1D}$ for average atom number $0.19 \lesssim \bar{N} \lesssim 2.6$ atoms, where $\Gamma_{\rm 1D}/\Gamma_0 =1.1\pm0.1$ is the peak single-atom radiative decay rate into the PCW guided mode and $\Gamma_{0}$ is the Einstein-$A$ coefficient for free space. These advances provide new tools for investigations of photon-mediated atom-atom interactions in the many-body regime.

We are thus in a position to explore the corresponding extensions of parity (P)-time (T)-symmetric models by generalizing the concept of an extended phase space. Applications to the problems of harmonic oscillator, inverted oscillator and isotonic oscillator are considered and many new interesting properties are uncovered for the new types of PT symmetries.

abstract: The local minimum degree of a graph is the minimum degree that can be reached by means of local complementation. For any n, there exist graphs of order n which have a local minimum degree at least 0.189n, or at least 0.110n when restricted to bipartite graphs. Regarding the upper bound, we show that for any graph of order n, its local minimum degree is at most 3n/8+o(n) and n/4+o(n) for bipartite graphs, improving the known n/2 upper bound. We also prove that the local minimum degree is smaller than half of the vertex cover number (up to a logarithmic term). The local minimum degree problem is NP-Complete and hard to approximate. We show that this problem, even when restricted to bipartite graphs, is in W[2] and FPT-equivalent to the EvenSet problem, which W[1]-hardness is a long standing open question. Finally, we show that the local minimum degree is computed by a O*(1.938^n)-algorithm, and a O*(1.466^n)-algorithm for the bipartite graphs.

abstract: Retrieving the vast amount of information carried by a photon is an enduring challenge in quantum metrology science and quantum photonics research. The transverse spatial state of a photon is a convenient high-dimensional quantum system for study, as it has a well-understood classical analogue as the transverse complex field profile of an optical beam. One severe drawback of all currently available quantum metrology techniques is the need for a time-consuming characterization process, which scales very unfavorably with the dimensionality of the quantum system. Here we demonstrate a technique that directly measures a million-dimensional photonic spatial state in a single setting. Through the arrangement of a weak measurement of momentum and parallel strong measurements of position, the complex values of the entire photon state vector become measurable directly. The dimension of our measured state is approximately four orders of magnitude larger than previously measured. Our work opens up a practical route for characterizing high-dimensional quantum systems in real time. Furthermore, our demonstration also serve as a high-speed, extremely-high-resolution unambiguous complex field measurement technique for diverse classical applications.

abstract: We consider oscillators evolving subject to a periodic driving force that dynamically entangles them, and argue that this gives the linearized evolution around periodic orbits in a general chaotic Hamiltonian dynamical system. We show that the entanglement entropy, after tracing over half of the oscillators, generically asymptotes to linear growth at a rate given by the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents of the system. These exponents give a classical entropy growth rate, in the sense of Kolmogorov, Sinai and Pesin. We also calculate the dependence of this entropy on linear mixtures of the oscillator Hilbert space factors, to investigate the dependence of the entanglement entropy on the choice of coarse-graining. We find that for almost all choices the asymptotic growth rate is the same.

abstract: A genuine feature of projective quantum measurements is that they inevitably alter the mean energy of the observed system if the measured quantity does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Compared to the classical case, Jacobs proved that this additional energetic cost leads to a stronger bound on the work extractable after a single measurement from a system initially in thermal equilibrium [Phys. Rev. A 80, 012322 (2009)]. Here, we extend this bound to a large class of feedback-driven quantum engines operating periodically and in finite time. The bound thus implies a natural definition for the efficiency of information to work conversion in such devices. For a simple model consisting of a laser-driven two-level system, we maximize the efficiency with respect to the observable whose measurement is used to control the feedback operations. We find that the optimal observable typically does not commute with the Hamiltonian and hence would not be available in a classical two level system. This result reveals that periodic feedback engines operating in the quantum realm can exploit quantum coherences to enhance efficiency.

abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of a quantum filter for the case of multiple measurements being made on a quantum system. We consider a class of measurement processes which are functions of bosonic field operators, including combinations of diffusive and Poissonian processes. This covers the standard cases from quantum optics, where homodyne detection may be described as a diffusive process and photon counting may be described as a Poissonian process. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for any pair of such measurements taken at different output channels to satisfy a commutation relationship. Then, we derive a general, multiple measurement quantum filter as an extension of a single-measurement quantum filter. As an application we explicitly obtain the quantum filter corresponding to homodyne detection and photon counting at the output ports of a beam splitter, correcting an earlier result.

For this purpose, the differential force between a Au-coated sphere and either Au or Si sectors of a rotating disc, arising due to two-axion exchange, is calculated. Over a wide region of axion masses from 1.7 meV to 0.9 eV the obtained constraints are stronger up to a factor of 60 than the previously known ones following from the Cavendish-type experiment and measurements of the effective Casimir pressure.

abstract: We study ground states of a system of bosonic atoms and diatomic Feshbach molecules trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice using exact diagonalization and Variational Monte Carlo methods. We primarily study the case of an average filling of one boson per site. In agreement with bosonization theory, we show that the ground state of the system in the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the Pfaffian-like state when the system is tuned towards the superfluid to Mott insulator quantum phase transition. Our study clarifies possibility of the creation of exotic Pfaffian-like states in realistic one-dimensional systems. Such states could be used as the basis to create non-Abelian anyons in one-dimensional systems, with potential application for fault tolerant topological quantum computation.

abstract: Competition between the Kondo effect and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in the two-impurity Kondo problem can be phenomenologically described by the Rasul-Schlottmann spin model. We revisit this model from the quantum entanglement perspective by calculating both the inter-impurity entanglement and the local Kondo entanglement, the latter being the entanglement between a local magnetic impurity and its spatially nearby conduction electron. A groundstate phase diagram is derived and a discontinuous breakdown of the local Kondo entanglement is found at the singular point, associated concomitantly with a jump in the inter-impurity entanglement. An entanglement monogamy holds in the whole phase diagram. Our results identify the important role of the frustrated cross-coupling and demonstrate the local characteristic of the quantum phase transition in the two-impurity Kondo problem. The implications of these results for Kondo lattices and quantum information processing are also briefly discussed.

abstract: Topological insulators and topological superconductors display various topological phases that are characterized by different Chern numbers or by gapless edge states. In this work we show that various quantum information methods such as the von Neumann entropy, entanglement spectrum, fidelity, and fidelity spectrum may be used to detect and distinguish topological phases and their transitions. As an example we consider a two-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman term. The nature of the phases and their changes are clarified by the eigenvectors of the $k$-space reduced density matrix. We show that in the topologically nontrivial phases the highest weight eigenvector is fully aligned with the triplet pairing state. A signature of the various phase transitions between two points on the parameter space is encoded in the $k$-space fidelity operator.

abstract: Recently a new class of time-dependent Bell inequalities in Wigner form was introduced. The structure of the inequalities allows experimental studies of quantum and open quantum systems in external fields. In this paper we study the properties of the time dependent Wigner inequalities using the time evolution of neutral pseudoscalar mesons. It is shown that it is always possible to find a range of parameters to test for violation in an experimentally accessible area. The effect of the relaxation of the inequalities for large time scales is demonstrated.

abstract: The infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) algorithm [J. Jordan et al, PRL 101, 250602 (2008)] has become a useful tool in the calculation of ground state properties of 2d quantum lattice systems in the thermodynamic limit. Despite its many successful implementations, the method has some limitations in its present formulation which hinder its application to some highly-entangled systems. The purpose of this paper is to unravel some of these issues, in turn enhancing the stability and efficiency of iPEPS methods. For this, we first introduce the fast full update scheme, where effective environment and iPEPS tensors are both simultaneously updated (or evolved) throughout time. As we shall show, this implies two crucial advantages: (i) dramatic computational savings with essentially no loss of accuracy, and (ii) improved overall stability. Besides, we extend the application of the local gauge fixing, successfully implemented for finite-size PEPS [M. Lubasch, J. Ignacio Cirac, M.-C. Ba\~nuls, PRB 90, 064425 (2014)], to the iPEPS algorithm. We see that the gauge fixing not only further improves the stability of the method, but also accelerates the convergence of the alternating least squares sweeping in the (either "full" or "fast full") tensor update scheme. The improvement in terms of computational cost and stability of the resulting "improved" iPEPS algorithm is benchmarked by studying the ground state properties of the quantum Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising models on an infinite square lattice.

abstract: The exact fermion master equation previously obtained in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 235311 (2008); New J. Phys. \textbf{12}, 083013 (2010)] describes the dynamics of quantum states of a principal system of fermionic particles under the influences of external fermion reservoirs (e.g. nanoelectronic systems). Here, we present the general solution to this exact fermion master equation. The solution is analytically expressed in the most intuitive particle number representation. It is applicable to an arbitrary number of orbitals in the principal system prepared at arbitrary initial states. We demonstrate the usefulness of such general solution with the transient dynamics of nanostructured artificial molecules. We show how various initial states can lead to distinct transient dynamics, manifesting a multitude of underlying transition pathways.

abstract: We present a general relativistic model of a spherical shell of matter with a perfect fluid on its surface coupled to an internal oscillator, which generalizes a model recently introduced by the authors to construct a self-gravitating interferometer [1]. The internal oscillator evolution is defined with respect to the local proper time of the shell, allowing the oscillator to serve as a local clock that ticks differently depending on the shell's position and momentum. A Hamiltonian reduction is performed on the system, and an approximate quantum description is given to the reduced phase space. If we focus only on the external dynamics, we must trace out the clock degree of freedom, and this results in a form of intrinsic decoherence that shares some features with a proposed "universal" decoherence mechanism attributed to gravitational time dilation [2]. We show that the proposed decoherence remains present in the (gravity-free) limit of flat spacetime, indicating that the effect can be attributed entirely to proper time differences, and thus is not necessarily related to gravity. Finally, we point out a way to bootstrap the gravitational contribution to the time dilation decoherence by including self-interaction, and comment on how this can be considered a fundamentally gravitational intrinsic decoherence effect.

abstract: We realize and study the ionic Hubbard model using an interacting two-component gas of fermionic atoms loaded into an optical lattice. The bipartite lattice has honeycomb geometry with a staggered energy-offset that explicitly breaks the inversion symmetry. Distinct density-ordered phases are identified using noise correlation measurements of the atomic momentum distribution. For weak interactions the geometry induces a charge density wave. For strong repulsive interactions a Mott insulator forms and we observe a restoration of the inversion symmetry. The local density distributions in different configurations are characterized by measuring the number of doubly occupied lattice sites as a function of interaction and energy-offset. We further probe the excitations of the system using direction dependent modulation spectroscopy and discover a complex spectrum, which we compare with a theoretical model.

abstract: The dynamic structure factor is a central quantity describing the physics of quantum many-body systems, capturing structure and collective excitations of a material. In condensed matter, it can be measured via inelastic neutron scattering, which is an energy-resolving probe for the density fluctuations. In ultracold atoms, a similar approach could so far not be applied due to the diluteness of the system. Here, we report on a direct, real-time and non-destructive measurement of the dynamic structure factor of a quantum gas exhibiting cavity-mediated long-range interactions. The technique relies on inelastic scattering of photons, stimulated by the enhanced vacuum field inside a high finesse optical cavity. We extract the density fluctuations, their energy and lifetime while the system undergoes a structural phase transition. We observe an occupation of the relevant quasi-particle mode on the level of a few excitations, and provide a theoretical description of this dissipative quantum many-body system.

abstract: Employing a spin-parameterized Kleldysh-Usadel technique for the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that even in the low proximity limit, considerable long-ranged triplet supercurrents can be effectively generated by spin-singlet supercurrents flowing \textit{parallel} to the interfaces of uniform double ferromagnet interlayers with noncollinear exchange fields "{\it independent}" of actual junction geometry. The triplet supercurrents are found to be most pronounced when the thicknesses of the ferromagnet strips are unequal. To experimentally verify this generic phenomenon, we propose an accessible and well-controlled structure that can fully isolate the long-range triplet effects.

abstract: We investigate the influence of exciton-phonon coupling on the dynamics of a strongly coupled quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity system and explore the effects of this interaction on different schemes for non-classical light generation. By performing time-resolved measurements, we map out the detuning-dependent polariton lifetime and extract the spectrum of the polariton-to-phonon coupling. Photon-blockade experiments are presented for different pulse-length and detuning conditions that are in very good agreement with quantum-optical simulations; we demonstrate that achieving high-fidelity photon blockade requires an intricate understanding of this parameter space. Furthermore, we show that detuned photon blockade, which is more efficient than resonant photon blockade, is also more dramatically affected by phonons. Finally, we achieve coherent control of the polariton states of a strongly coupled system and demonstrate that their efficient coupling to phonons can be exploited for novel concepts in high-fidelity single photon generation.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to put the description of number scaling and its effects on physics and geometry on a firmer foundation, and to make it more understandable. A main point is that two different concepts, number and number value are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is valid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It is not valid when different structures of each number type are being considered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by themselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a number structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are described. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number structures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a real or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as scalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are described that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M locations and at neighbor scaling levels. Scalar and vector structure valued fields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained. Two complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear, with one complex field associated with positions in $M$ and the other with position dependent scaling factors. A derivation of the covariant derivative for scalar and vector valued fields gives the same vector fields. The derivation shows that the complex vector field associated with scaling fiber levels is the gradient of a complex scalar field. Use of these results in gauge theory shows that the imaginary part of the vector field associated with M positions acts like the electromagnetic field. The physical relevance of the other three fields, if any, is not known.

We point out that all the $G_c(z,E)$ functions defined by Trav\v{e}nec are identically zero, thus the spectrum is not in fact given by their roots.

abstract: We address a physical interpretation of the Hawking-Unruh effect with our emphasis put on judicious consideration of observables and vacua with and without acceleration. In particular we discuss thermal-like corrections using explicit computation of correlation functions. We identify the correspondence between thermo-field dynamics and accelerated systems. Then we make it clear that a genuine thermal state corresponds to a non-accelerated frame, while vacuum states correspond to Rindler wedges, which accounts for a negative contribution of the thermal-like correction measured in the accelerated vacuum. We apply our results to investigate how the acceleration effect would affect a condensate of fields. Our conclusion is that a larger acceleration should enhance a condensate as compared to those in a non-accelerated vacuum.

abstract: Selenium impurities in silicon are deep double donors and their optical and electronic properties have been recently investigated due to their application for infrared detection. However, a singly-ionised selenium donor (Se$^{+}$) possesses an electron spin which makes it a potential candidate as a silicon-based spin qubit, with significant potential advantages compared to the more commonly studied group V donors. Here we study the electron spin relaxation ($T_1$) and coherence ($T_2$) times of Se$^{+}$ in isotopically purified 28-silicon, and find them to be up to two orders of magnitude longer than shallow group V donors at temperatures above $\sim 15$ K. We further study the dynamics of donor-acceptor recombination between selenium and boron, demonstrating that it is possible to control the donor charge state through optical excitation of neutral Se$^0$.

abstract: The emission times of laser-triggered electrons from a sharp tungsten tip are directly characterized under ultrafast, near-infrared laser excitation at intermediate Keldysh parameters 2.1 < $\gamma$ < 4.8. Prompt emission is observed at the highest field strengths. At lower field strengths, emission delays as large as 10 fs are observed. Emission time is inferred from the energy gain of photoelectrons directly emitted into a synchronously driven radio-frequency (RF) cavity. 1 fs timing resolution is achieved in a configuration capable of measuring timing shifts greater than 10 ps. The technique can also be used to measure the RF phase inside the cavity with a precision below 70 fs upon the energy resolved detection of a single electron.

abstract: We analyze the stochastic evolution and dephasing of a qubit within the quantum jump (QJ) approach. It allows one to treat individual realizations of inelastic processes, and in this way it provides solutions, for instance, to problems in quantum thermodynamics and distributions in statistical mechanics. As a solvable example, we study a qubit in the weak dissipation limit, and demonstrate that dephasing and relaxation render the Jarzynski and Crooks fluctuation relations (FRs) of non-equilibrium thermodynamics intact. On the contrary, the standard two-measurement protocol, taking into account only the fluctuations of the internal energy $U$, leads to deviations in FRs under the same conditions. We relate the average $\langle e^{-\beta U} \rangle $ (where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature) with the qubit's relaxation and dephasing rates, and discuss this relationship for different mechanisms of decoherence.

We report the control of transition strengths by five orders of magnitude and measurements of highly nonlinear Zeeman shifts, which we explain with an accurate {\it ab initio} model. Mixed quantization in an optical lattice enables the experimental procedure. Our observation of formerly inaccessible $f$-parity excited states offers a new avenue for improving theoretical models for divalent atom dimers. Furthermore, magnetically enabled transitions may lead to an extremely precise subradiant molecular lattice clock.

abstract: Large-scale quantum computers must be built upon quantum bits that are both highly coherent and locally controllable. We demonstrate the quantum control of the electron and the nuclear spin of a single 31P atom in silicon, using a continuous microwave magnetic field together with nanoscale electrostatic gates. The qubits are tuned into resonance with the microwave field by a local change in electric field, which induces a Stark shift of the qubit energies. This method, known as A-gate control, preserves the excellent coherence times and gate fidelities of isolated spins, and can be extended to arbitrarily many qubits without requiring multiple microwave sources.

Density distributions in the Fock--Bargmann space are constructed for bound and resonance states of $^{6,7}$Li and $^{7,8}$Be, provided that all these nuclei are treated within a microscopic two-cluster model. The density distribution in the phase space is compared with those in the coordinate and momentum representations. Bound states realize themselves in a compact area of the phase space, as also do narrow resonance states. We establish the quantitative boundaries of this region in the phase space for the nuclei under consideration. Quantum trajectories are demonstrated to approach their classical limit with increasing energy.

abstract: The partner mode with respect to a vacuum state for a given mode (like that corresponding to one of the thermal particles emitted by a black hole) is defined and calculated. The partner modes are explicitly calculated for a number of cases, in particular for the modes corresponding to a particle detector being excited by turn-on/turn-off transients, or with the thermal particles emitted by the accelerated mirror model for black hole evaporation. One of the key results is that the partner mode in general is just a vacuum fluctuation, and one can have the partner mode be located in a region where the state cannot be distinguished from the vacuum state by any series of local measurements, including the energy density. I.e., "information" (the correlations with the thermal emissions) need not be associated with any energy transport. The idea that black holes emit huge amounts of energy in their last stages because of all the information which must be emitted under the assumption of black-hole unitarity is found not necessarily to be the case.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the effect of broken inversion symmetry on the generation and control of ultrafast currents in a transparent dielectric (SiO2) by strong femto-second optical laser pulses. Ab-initio simulations based on time-dependent density functional theory predict ultrafast DC currents that can be viewed as a non-linear photogalvanic effect. Most surprisingly, the direction of the current undergoes a sudden reversal above a critical threshold value of laser intensity I_c ~ 3.8*10^13 W/cm2. We trace this switching to the transition from non-linear polarization currents to the tunneling excitation regime. We demonstrate control of the ultrafast currents by the time delay between two laser pulses. We find the ultrafast current control by the non-linear photogalvanic effect to be remarkably robust and insensitive to laser-pulse shape and carrier-envelope phase.

abstract: The dynamics of many open quantum systems are described by stochastic master equations. In the discrete-time case, we recall the structure of the derived quantum filter governing the evolution of the density operator conditioned to the measurement outcomes. We then describe the structure of the corresponding particle quantum filters for estimating constant parameter and we prove their stability. In the continuous-time (diffusive) case, we propose a new formulation of these particle quantum filters. The interest of this new formulation is first to prove stability, and also to provide an efficient algorithm preserving, for any discretization step-size, positivity of the quantum states and parameter classical probabilities. This algorithm is tested on experimental data to estimate the detection efficiency for a superconducting qubit whose fluorescence field is measured using a heterodyne detector.

abstract: We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the AdS/CFT correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes with a tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an exact isometry from bulk operators to boundary operators. The entire tensor network is a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in arXiv:1411.7041.

abstract: We study how universal properties of quantum quenches across critical points are modified by a weak coupling to thermal dissipation, focusing on the paradigmatic case of the transverse field Ising model. Beyond the standard quench-induced Kibble-Zurek defect production in the absence of the bath, the bath contributes extra thermal defects. We show that spatial correlations in the noise produced by the bath can play a crucial role: one obtains quantitatively different scaling regimes depending on whether the correlation length of the noise is smaller or larger than the Kibble-Zurek length associated with the quench speed, and the thermal length set by temperature. For the case of spatially-correlated bath noise, additional thermal defect generation is restricted to a window that is both quantum critical and excluded from the non-equilibrium regime surrounding the critical point. We map the dissipative quench problem to a set of effectively independent dissipative Landau-Zener problems. Using this mapping along with both analytic and numerical calculations allows us to find the scaling of the excess defect density produced in the quench, and suggests a generic picture for such dissipative quenches.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate synchronization between two distinct ensembles of cold atoms undergoing steady state superradiance within a single longitudinal and transverse mode of the same optical cavity. The synchronization process is studied first in terms of the time dynamics of re-synchronization when the phase alignment of the two oscillators is abruptly broken. We also observe the steady state behavior of the lasers as their relative frequency is continuously varied. This system has the potential to realize a non-equilibrium quantum phase transition and could inform future implementations of milliHertz linewidth lasers.

I focus on genuinely irreversible, Markovian processes, for which the incomplete data are given in the form of snapshots of the macrostate at different instances of the evolution, yet without any information about the timing of these snapshots. A reconstruction of the equation of motion must therefore be preceded by a reconstruction of time.

On the basis of this formalism we develop an algorithm for calculating the Heisenberg parameter for magnetic materials. Finally, we calculate the characteristics of antiferromagnetic transitions for the high-Tc materials La2-xMeCuO4 and YBa2Cu3O6.

abstract: Quantum devices for sensing and computing applications require coherent quantum systems which can be manipulated in a fast and robust way. Such quantum control is typically achieved using external electric or magnetic fields which drive the system's orbital or spin degrees of freedom. However, most of these approaches require complex and unwieldy antenna or gate structures, and with few exceptions are limited to the regime of weak driving. Here, we present a novel approach to strongly and coherently drive a single electron spin in the solid state using internal strain fields in an integrated quantum device. Specifically, we study individual Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) spins embedded in diamond mechanical oscillators and exploit the intrinsic strain coupling between spin and oscillator to strongly drive the spins. As hallmarks of the strong driving regime, we directly observe the energy spectrum of the emerging phonon-dressed states and employ our strong, continuous driving for enhancement of the NV spin coherence time. Our results constitute a first step towards strain-driven, integrated quantum devices and open new perspectives to investigate unexplored regimes of strongly driven multi-level systems and to study exotic spin dynamics in hybrid spin-oscillator devices.

abstract: Recently the connection between Majorana fermions bound to defects in arbitrary dimensions, and complex momentum roots of the the vanishing determinant of the corresponding bulk BdG Hamiltonian, has been established (arXiv:1503.03839). Based on this understanding, a formula has been proposed to count the number ($n$) of the zero energy Majorana bound states, which is related to the topological phase of the system. In this paper, we apply this formula to a variety of $1d$ and $2d$ models belonging to the classes BDI, DIII and D. We show that we can successfully chart out the topological phase diagrams. Studying these examples also enables us to explicitly observe the correspondence between these complex momentum solutions in the Fourier space, and the localized Majorana fermion wavefunctions in the position space. Finally, we corroborate the fact that for systems with a chiral symmetry, these solutions are the so-called "Exceptional Points", where two or more eigenvalues of the complexified Hamiltonian coalesce.

abstract: The concept of emergence is critically analyzed in particular with respect to the assumed emergence of mental properties from a neuronal basis. We argue that so-called contextual emergence is needed to avoid an eliminatory reductionism. Quantum-like features of the emergent qualities are to be expected. As a consequence, non-causal relations like entanglement correlations have to be considered as full fledged elements of reality. "Observable extension" is proposed as a contextual alternative to emergence avoiding the asymmetry between purportedly basic and emergent properties.

abstract: In the study of the capacity problem for multiple access channels (MACs), a lower bound on the error probability obtained by Han plays a crucial role in the converse parts of several kinds of channel coding theorems in the information-spectrum framework. Recently, Yagi and Oohama showed a tighter bound than the Han bound by means of Polyanskiy's converse. In this paper, we give a new bound which generalizes and strengthens the Yagi-Oohama bound, and demonstrate that the bound plays a fundamental role in deriving extensions of several known bounds. In particular, the Yagi-Oohama bound is generalized to two different directions; i.e, to general input distributions and to general encoders. In addition we extend these bounds to the quantum MACs and apply them to the converse problems for several information-spectrum settings.

abstract: We regularize compact and non-compact Abelian Chern-Simons-Maxwell theories on a spatial lattice using the Hamiltonian formulation. We consider a doubled theory with gauge fields living on a lattice and its dual lattice. The Hilbert space of the theory is a product of local Hilbert spaces, each associated with a link and the corresponding dual link. The two electric field operators associated with the link-pair do not commute. In the non-compact case with gauge group $\mathbb{R}$, each local Hilbert space is analogous to the one of a charged "particle" moving in the link-pair group space $\mathbb{R}^2$ in a constant "magnetic" background field. In the compact case, the link-pair group space is a torus $U(1)^2$ threaded by $k$ units of quantized "magnetic" flux, with $k$ being the level of the Chern-Simons theory. The holonomies of the torus $U(1)^2$ give rise to two self-adjoint extension parameters, which form two non-dynamical background lattice gauge fields that explicitly break the manifest gauge symmetry from $U(1)$ to $\mathbb{Z}(k)$. The local Hilbert space of a link-pair then decomposes into representations of a magnetic translation group. In the pure Chern-Simons limit of a large "photon" mass, this results in a $\mathbb{Z}(k)$-symmetric variant of Kitaev's toric code, self-adjointly extended by the two non-dynamical background lattice gauge fields. Electric charges on the original lattice and on the dual lattice obey mutually anyonic statistics with the statistics angle $\frac{2 \pi}{k}$. Non-Abelian $U(k)$ Berry gauge fields that arise from the self-adjoint extension parameters may be interesting in the context of quantum information processing.

abstract: We present a numerical scheme for efficiently extracting the higher-order moments and cumulants of various operators on spin systems represented as tensor product states, for both finite and infinite systems, and present several applications for such quantities. For example, the second cumulant of the energy of a state, $\langle \Delta H^2 \rangle$, gives a straightforward method to check the convergence of numerical ground-state approximation algorithms. Additionally, we discuss the use of moments and cumulants in the study of phase transitions. Of particular interest is the application of our method to calculate the so-called Binder's cumulant, which we use to detect critical points and study the critical exponent of the correlation length with only small finite numerical calculations. We apply these methods to study the behavior of a family of one-dimensional models (the transverse Ising model, the spin-1 Ising model, and the spin-1 Ising model in a crystal field), as well as the two-dimensional Ising model on a square lattice. Our results show that in one dimension, cumulant-based methods can produce precise estimates of the critical points at a low computational cost, and show promise for two-dimensional systems as well.

The Majorana idea was so innovative for the time that the scientific community understood its importance only towards the end of the thirties. This paper aims to analyse what were the scientific reasons led Majorana to the formulation of a new relativistic theory of quantum particles and what was its contribution to the development of quantum mechanics in the years that followed. In doing so, it will be followed a purely physical-mathematical approach in order to highlight strengths and limitations of the Majorana theory, comparing the results with those provided by the modern quantum physics.

abstract: Self-assembled, epitaxially-grown InAs/GaAs quantum dots are promising semiconductor quantum emitters that can be integrated on a chip for a variety of photonic quantum information science applications. However, self-assembled growth results in an essentially random in-plane spatial distribution of quantum dots, presenting a challenge in creating devices that exploit the strong interaction of single quantum dots with highly confined optical modes. Here, we present a photoluminescence imaging approach for locating single quantum dots with respect to alignment features with an average (minimum) position uncertainty < 30 nm (< 10 nm), which represents an enabling technology for the creation of optimized single quantum dot devices. To that end, we create quantum dot single-photon sources, based on a circular Bragg grating geometry, that simultaneously exhibit high collection efficiency (48 % +/- 5 % into a 0.4 numerical aperture lens, close to the theoretically predicted value of 50 %), low multiphoton probability (g(2)(0) <1 %), and a significant Purcell enhancement factor (~ 3).

abstract: We demonstrate that non-equilibrium dynamics provides a direct means of detecting the topological phase transition (TPT) between conventional and topological superfluid (SF) phases in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases with attractive interactions. To date, no cold atom experiment has realized a topological SF, because of loss or heating processes. In the alkali fermions, off-resonant light scattering dominates these processes, therefore, we minimize their impact by rapidly quenching in and out of the topological SF phase. This quench excites Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the final phase (a conventional SF), the distribution of which carries signatures of the TPT. We calculate the resulting spin-resolved momentum distribution by self-consistently solving the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. They exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling and St\"{u}ckelberg oscillations characteristic of the TPT. We discuss parameter regimes where the TPT is experimentally accessible.

abstract: In the modern quantum mechanics of cosmology observers are physical systems within the universe. They have no preferred role in the formulation of the theory nor in its predictions of third person probabilities of what occurs. However, observers return to importance for the prediction of first person probabilities for what we observe of the universe: What is most probable to be observed is not necessarily what is most probable to occur. This essay reviews the basic framework for the computation of first person probabilities in quantum cosmology starting with an analysis of very simple models. It is shown that anthropic selection is automatic in this framework, because there is no probability for us to observe what is where we cannot exist. First person probabilities generally favor larger universes resulting from inflation where there are more places for us to be. In very large universes it is probable that our observational situation is duplicated elsewhere. The calculation of first person probabilities then requires a specification of whether our particular situation is assumed to be typical of all the others. It is the combination of the model of the observational situation, including this typicality assumption, and the third person theory which is tested by observation. We conclude with a discussion of the first person predictions of cosmological observables such as the cosmological constant and features of the primordial density fluctuations, in the no-boundary quantum state of the universe and a dynamical theory in which these are allowed to vary.

abstract: The approximate degree of a Boolean function $f: \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ is the minimum degree of a real polynomial that approximates $f$ to within error $1/3$ in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. In an influential result, Aaronson and Shi (J. ACM 2004) proved tight $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ and $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/3})$ lower bounds on the approximate degree of the Collision and Element Distinctness functions, respectively. Their proof was non-constructive, using a sophisticated symmetrization argument and tools from approximation theory. More recently, several open problems in the study of approximate degree have been resolved via the construction of dual polynomials. These are explicit dual solutions to an appropriate linear program that captures the approximate degree of any function. We reprove Aaronson and Shi's results by constructing explicit dual polynomials for the Collision and Element Distinctness functions.

abstract: We study theoretically the dipole radiation of a hydrogen atom driven by an intense sub-cycle pulse. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the system is solved by ab initio calculation to obtain the dipole response. Remarkably, a narrowband emission lasting longer than the driving pulse appears at a frequency just above the ionization threshold. An additional calculation using the strong field approximation also recovers this emission, which suggests that it corresponds to the oscillation of nearly-bound electrons that behave similarly to Rydberg electrons. The predicted phenomenon is unique to ultrashort driving pulses but not specific to any particular atomic structure.

In this Letter we examine this fact from the point of view of the Full Counting Statistics (FCS). Under very general conditions, we establish a tight form of the first law asserting that the fluctuations of the FCS of the total energy current are exponentially suppressed in the large time limit. We illustrate this general result using the example of the Anderson model.

abstract: We investigate the effect of intercombination transitions in excitation hopping processes such as those found in F\"orster resonance energy transfer. Taking strontium Rydberg states as our model system, the breakdown of $LS$-coupling leads to weakly allowed transitions between Rydberg states of different spin quantum number. We show that the long-range interactions between two Rydberg atoms can be affected by these weakly allowed spin transitions, and the effect is greatest when there is a near-degeneracy between the initial state and a state with a different spin quantum number. We also consider a case of four atoms in a spin chain, and show that a spin impurity can resonantly hop along the chain. By engineering the many-body energy levels of the spin-chain, the breakdown of $LS$ coupling due to inter-electronic effects in individual atoms can be mapped onto a spatial separation of the total spin and the total orbital angular momentum along the spin chain.

abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large family of receptor proteins that sense molecular signals on the exterior of a cell and activate signal transduction pathways within the cell. Modeling how an agonist activates such a receptor is fundamental for an understanding of a wide variety of physiological processes and it is of tremendous value for pharmacology and drug design. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) has been proposed as a model for the mechanism by which olfactory GPCRs are activated by a bound agonist. We apply this hypothesis to GPCRs within the mammalian nervous system using quantum chemical modeling. We found that non-endogenous agonists of the serotonin receptor share a particular IET spectral aspect both amongst each other and with the serotonin molecule: a peak whose intensity scales with the known agonist potencies. We propose an experiential validation of this model by utilizing lysergic acid dimethylamide (DAM-57), an ergot derivative, and its deuterated isotopologues; we also provide theoretical predictions for comparison to experiment. If validated our theory may provide new avenues for guided drug design and elevate methods of in silico potency/activity prediction.

abstract: Engineering and studying few-electron states in ballistic conductors is a key step towards understanding entanglement in quantum electronic systems. In this Letter, we introduce the intrinsic two-electron coherence of an electronic source in quantum Hall edge channels and relate it to two-electron wavefunctions and to current noise in an Hanbury Brown--Twiss interferometer. Inspired by the analogy with photon quantum optics, we propose to measure the intrinsic two-electron coherence of a source using low-frequency current correlation measurements at the output of a Franson interferometer. To illustrate this protocol, we discuss how it can distinguish between a time-bin entangled pure state and a statistical mixture of time shifted electron pairs.

New high accuracy formulas are deduced for approximate eigenfunctions. We analyze how their shape reproduction fidelity is correlated with the evaluation finesse of the corresponding eigenvalues.

abstract: Nuclear spins in the solid state environment of diamond are highly coherent, but difficult to rapidly control due to the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio. Here we demonstrate a more than 50-fold enhancement of the effective nuclear gyromagnetic ratio by coupling the nuclear spin to an electronic spin of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The enhancement allows for faster nuclear spin rotations and is in good agreement with second-order perturbation theory. The method may be applied to other systems with similar electron-nuclear spin interactions, such as phosphorous donors in silicon, opening up the possibility of fast and direct nuclear spin control in coupled spin systems.

abstract: We suggest and analyze a new scheme to adiabatically cool bosonic atoms to picokelvin temperatures which should allow the observation of magnetic ordering via superexchange in optical lattices. The starting point is a gapped phase called the spin Mott phase where each site is occupied by one spin-up and one spin-down atom. An adiabatic ramp leads to an xy-ferromagnetic phase. We show that the combination of time-dependent density matrix renormalization group methods with quantum trajectories can be used to fully address possible experimental limitations due to decoherence, and demonstrate that the magnetic correlations are robust for experimentally realizable ramp speeds. Using a microscopic master equation treatment of light scattering in the many-particle system, we test the robustness of adiabatic state preparation against decoherence. Due to different ground-state symmetries, we also find a metastable state with xy-ferromagnetic order if the ramp crosses to regimes where the ground state is a z-ferromagnet. The bosonic spin Mott phase as the initial gapped state for adiabatic cooling has many features in common with a fermionic band insulator, but the use of bosons should enable experiments with substantially lower initial entropies.

abstract: We consider properties of the measurement intensity $\rho$ of a random variable for which the probability density function represented by the corresponding Wigner function attains negative values on a part of the domain. We consider a simple economic interpretation of this problem. This model is used to present the applicability of the method to the analysis of the negative probability on markets where there are anomalies in the law of supply and demand (e.g. Giffen's goods). It turns out that the new conditions to optimize the intensity $\rho$ require a new strategy. We propose a strategy (so-called $\grave{a}$ rebours strategy) based on the fixed point method and explore its effectiveness.

abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, being a promising candidate for quantum information processing, may also be an ideal platform for simulating many-body physics. However, it is difficult to realize interactions between nitrogen-vacancy centers strong enough to form a macroscopically ordered phase under realistic temperatures. Here we propose a scheme to realize long-range ferromagnetic Ising interactions between distant nitrogen-vacancy centers by using a mechanical resonator as a medium. Since the critical temperature in the long-range Ising model is proportional to the number of spins, a ferromagnetic order can be formed at a temperature of tens of millikelvin for a sample with $\sim10^4$ nitrogen-vacancy centers. This method may provide a new platform for studying many-body physics using qubit systems.

abstract: The spin dynamics of the strongly localized, donor-bound electrons in fluorine-doped ZnSe epilayers is studied by pump-probe Kerr rotation techniques. A method exploiting the spin inertia is developed and used to measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time, $T_1$, in a wide range of magnetic fields, temperatures, and pump densities. The $T_1$ time of the donor-bound electron spin of about 1.6 $\mu$s remains nearly constant for external magnetic fields varied from zero up to 2.5 T (Faraday geometry) and in a temperature range $1.8-45$ K. The inhomogeneous spin dephasing time, $T_2^*=8-33$ ns, is measured using the resonant spin amplification and Hanle effects under pulsed and steady-state pumping, respectively. These findings impose severe restrictions on possible spin relaxation mechanisms.

abstract: We provide an explicit connection between the differential generation of entanglement entropy in a tensor network representation of the ground states of two field theories, and a geometric description of these states based on the Fisher information metric. We show how the geometrical description remains invariant despite there is an irreducible gauge freedom in the definition of the tensor network. The results might help to understand how spacetimes may emerge from distributions of quantum states, or more concretely, from the structure of the quantum entanglement concomitant to those distributions.

abstract: In view of promising applications of fractal nanostructures, we analyze the spectra of quantum particles in the Sierpinski carpet and study the non-correlated electron gas in this geometry. We show that the spectrum exhibits scale invariance with almost arbitrary spacing between energy levels, including large energy gaps at high energies. These features disappear in the analogous random fractal---where Anderson localization dominates---and in the regular lattice of equally sized holes---where only two length scales are present. The fractal structure amplifies microscopic effects, resulting in the presence of quantum behavior of the electron gas even at high temperatures. Our results demonstrate the potential of fractal nanostructures to improve the light-matter interaction at any frequency, with possible applications, e.g., in the development of solar cells with a wide absorption spectrum, artificial photosynthesis, or nanometamaterials with tailored Fermi levels and band gaps, operating in a wide range of frequencies, and with extended operating temperature range.

abstract: We construct rational extensions of the Darboux-P\"{o}schl-Teller and isotonic potentials via two-step confluent Darboux transformations. The former are strictly isospectral to the initial potential, whereas the latter are only quasi-isospectral. Both are associated to new families of orthogonal polynomials, which, in the first case, depend on a continuous parameter. We also prove that these extended potentials possess an enlarged shape invariance property.

abstract: In this work we perform a comparison between Classical Molecular Static (CMS) and quantum Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations in order to obtain the diffusion coefficients for diluted \emph{Fe-Cr} alloys. We show that, in accordance with Bohr's correspondence principle, as the size of the atomic cell (total number of atoms) is increased, quantum results with DFT approach to the classical ones obtained with CMS. Quantum coherence effects play a crucial role in the difference arising between CMS and DFT calculations. Also, thermal contact with the environment destroys quantum coherent effects making the classical behavior to emerge. Indeed, CMS calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data. We claim that, the atomic diffusion process in metals is a classical phenomena. Then, if reliable semi empirical potentials are available, a classical treatment of the atomic transport in metals is much convenient than DFT.

abstract: We calculate numerically the R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground state of Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators) after fixing the position (partial measurement) of some of the oscillators in $d=1,2$ and $3$ dimensions. We show that after partial measurement as far as the two parts are connected the area-law is valid in generic dimensions except in $d=1$ conformal field theories. When due to the measured region the two parts are disconnected, the entanglement entropy decreases exponentially with respect to the minimum distance between the regions. In the massless case the decay is power-law with a universal dimension-dependent exponent.
