**1.    Linear Optical Quantum Metrology with Single Photons: Exploiting Spontaneously Generated Entanglement to Beat the Shot-Noise Limit**

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum number-path entanglement is a resource for super-sensitive quantum metrology and in particular provides for sub-shotnoise or even Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. However, such number-path entanglement has thought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place --- typically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic preparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement. Very recently, arising from the study of quantum random walks with multi-photon walkers, as well as the study of the computational complexity of passive linear optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, it has been shown that such passive linear optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount of number-path entanglement. A logical question to ask is whether this entanglement may be exploited for quantum metrology. We answer that question here in the affirmative by showing that a simple, passive, linear-optical interferometer --- fed with only uncorrelated, single-photon inputs, coupled with simple, single-mode, disjoint photodetection --- is capable of significantly beating the shotnoise limit. Our result implies a pathway forward to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology.

**2.    Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters**  
Dominic W. Berry, Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01715  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation that has optimal dependence on all parameters of interest (up to log factors). Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity $d$ at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error $\epsilon$. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in $\epsilon$ at the expense of poor scaling in $d$. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm achieves near-linear scaling in $\tau := d \|H\|_{\max} t$ and sublogarithmic scaling in $1/\epsilon$. Our dependence on $\epsilon$ is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$.

**3.    Quantum walks on two kinds of two-dimensional models**  
Dan Li, Michael Mc Gettrick, Wei-Wei Zhang, Ke-Jia Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01816  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we numerically study quantum walks on two kinds of two-dimensional graphs: cylindrical strip and Mobius strip. The two kinds of graphs are typical two-dimensional topological graph. We study the crossing property of quantum walks on these two models. Also, we study its dependence on the initial state, size of the model. At the same time, we compare the quantum walk and classical walk on these two models to discuss the difference of quantum walk and classical walk.

**4.    Quantum Logic with Interacting Bosons in 1D**  
Yoav Lahini, Gregory R. Steinbrecher, Adam D. Bookatz, Dirk Englund  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04349  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme for implementing high-fidelity quantum logic gates using the quantum walk of a few interacting bosons on a one-dimensional lattice. The gate operation is carried out by a single compact lattice described by a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interactions. We find high-fidelity deterministic logic operations for a gate set (including the CNOT gate) that is universal for quantum information processing. We discuss the applicability of this scheme in light of recent developments in controlling and monitoring cold-atoms in optical lattices, as well as an implementation with realistic nonlinear quantum photonic devices.

**5.    Experimental realisation of generalised qubit measurements based on quantum walks**  
Yuan-yuan Zhao, Neng-kun Yu, Pawe Kurzynski, Guo-yong Xiang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05096  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report an experimental implementation of a single-qubit generalised measurement scenario(POVM) based on a quantum walk model. The qubit is encoded in a single-photon polarisation. The photon performs a quantum walk on an array of optical elements, where the polarisation-dependent translation is performed via birefringent beam displacers and a change of the polarisation is implemented with the help of wave-plates. We implement: (i) Trine-POVM, i.e., the POVM elements uniformly distributed on an equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere; (ii) Symmetric-Informationally- Complete (SIC) POVM; and (iii) Unambiguous Discrimination of two non-orthogonal qubit states.

**6.    Realization of single-qubit positive operator-valued measurement via a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk**  
Zhihao Bian, Jian Li, Hao Qin, Xiang Zhan, Rong Zhang, Barry C. Sanders, Peng Xue  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05540  
<blockquote>
<p>
We perform generalized measurements of a qubit by realizing the qubit as a coin in a photonic quantum walk and subjecting the walker to projective measurements. Our experimental technique can be used to realize photonically any rank-1 single-qubit positive operator-valued measure via constructing an appropriate interferometric quantum-walk network and then projectively measuring the walker's position at the final step.

**7.    Strongly trapped two-dimensional quantum walks**  
B��lint Koll��r, Tam��s Kiss, Igor Jex  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 022308 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05844  
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete time quantum walks (DTQWs) are nontrivial generalizations of random walks with a broad scope of applications. In particular, they can be used as computational primitives, and they are suitable tools for simulating other quantum systems. DTQWs usually spread ballistically due to their quantumness. In some cases, however, they can remain localized at their initial state (trapping). The trapping and other fundamental properties of DTQWs are determined by the choice of the coin operator. We introduce and analyze an up to now uncharted type of walks driven by a coin class leading to strong trapping, complementing the known list of walks. This class of walks exhibit a number of exciting properties with the possible applications ranging from light pulse trapping in a medium to topological effects and quantum search.

**8.    Fast Escape from Quantum Mazes in Integrated Photonics**  
Filippo Caruso, Andrea Crespi, Anna Gabriella Ciriolo, Fabio Sciarrino, Roberto Osellame  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06438  
<blockquote>
<p>
Escaping from a complex maze, by exploring different paths with several decision-making branches in order to reach the exit, has always been a very challenging and fascinating task. Wave field and quantum objects may explore a complex structure in parallel by interference effects, but without necessarily leading to more efficient transport. Here, inspired by recent observations in biological energy transport phenomena, we demonstrate how a quantum walker can efficiently reach the output of a maze by partially suppressing the presence of interference. In particular, we show theoretically an unprecedented improvement in transport efficiency for increasing maze size with respect to purely quantum and classical approaches. In addition, we investigate experimentally these hybrid transport phenomena, by mapping the maze problem in an integrated waveguide array, probed by coherent light, hence successfully testing our theoretical results. These achievements may lead towards future bio-inspired photonics technologies for more efficient transport and computation.

**9.    Continuous Limit of Discrete Quantum Walks**  
Dheeraj M N, Todd A. Brun  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06950  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks can be defined in two quite distinct ways: discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks (DTQWs and CTQWs). For classical random walks, there is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of discrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an additional "coin space" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time evolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints. This means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a limit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this problem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on $d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian: from a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a well-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this limit as a {\it coined} continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share some properties with coined DTQWs. In particular, we look at spatial search by a DTQW over the 2-D torus (a grid with periodic boundary conditions) of size $\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$, where it was shown \nocite{AAmbainis08} that a coined DTQW can search in time $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$, but a standard CTQW \nocite{Childs2004} takes $\Omega(N)$ time to search for a marked element. The continuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from. We also look at the effects of graph symmetry on the limiting walk, and show that the properties are similar to those of the DTQW as shown in \cite{HariKrovi2007}.

**10.    On the Breakdown of Quantum Search with Spatially Distributed Marked Vertices**  
Thomas G. Wong  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07071  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover's algorithm finds one of $k$ "marked" items in an \emph{unstructured} "database" of size $N$ in time $O(\!\sqrt{N/k})$, and the algorithm's parameter(s) and runtime are unchanged no matter which of the $k$ items are marked. For \emph{structured} search by continuous-time quantum walk, however, we show that rearranging the marked elements can cause the parameter(s) or runtime to vary such that, without prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of the marked elements, a potentially sub-exponential number of configurations would need to be tried, meaning it would be better to not run the search algorithm at all.

**11.    Role of the coin in the spectrum of quantum walks**  
Lauri Lehman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07294  
<blockquote>
<p>
The most elementary quantum walk is characterized by a 2-dimensional unitary coin flip matrix, which can be parameterized by 4 real variables. The influence of the choice of the coin flip matrix on the time evolution operator is analysed in a systematic way. By changing the coin parameters, the dispersion and asymmetry of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator can be tuned in a controlled way. The reduced eigenvectors in coin space are distributed along trajectories on the surface or inside the Bloch sphere, depending on the degeneracy of the spectrum. At certain values of the coin parameters the spectrum of the time evolution operator becomes 2-fold degenerate, but there might exist unique eigenvalues at the top and bottom of each quasi-energy band. The eigenstates corresponding to such eigenvalues are robust against arbitrary temporal variations in the bias parameter of the coin, as long as rest of the parameters remain unchanged.

**12.    Efficient Scheme of Experimental Quantifying non-Markovianity in High-Dimension Systems**  
S.-J. Dong, B.-H. Liu, Y.-N. Sun, Y.-J. Han, G.-C. Guo, Lixin He  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07317  
<blockquote>
<p>
The non-Markovianity is a prominent concept of the dynamics of the open quantum systems, which is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics and quantum information. Despite of lots of efforts, the experimentally measuring of non-Markovianity of an open system is still limited to very small systems. Presently, it is still impossible to experimentally quantify the non-Markovianity of high dimension systems with the widely used Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) trace distance measure. In this paper, we propose a method, combining experimental measurements and numerical calculations, that allow quantifying the non-Markovianity of a $N$ dimension system only scaled as $N^2$, successfully avoid the exponential scaling with the dimension of the open system in the current method. After the benchmark with a two-dimension open system, we demonstrate the method in quantifying the non-Markovanity of a high dimension open quantum random walk system.

**13.    Quantum walks and quantum search on graphene lattices**  
Iain Foulger, Sven Gnutzmann, Gregor Tanner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07543  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have been very successful in the development of search algorithms in quantum information, in particular in the development of spatial search algorithms. However, the construction of continuous-time quantum search algorithms in two-dimensional lattices has proved difficult, requiring additional degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-time quantum walk search is possible in two-dimensions by changing the search topology to a graphene lattice, utilising the Dirac point in the energy spectrum. This is made possible by making a change to standard methods of marking a particular site in the lattice. Various ways of marking a site are shown to result in successful search protocols. We further establish that the search can be adapted to transfer probability amplitude across the lattice between specific lattice sites thus establishing a line of communication between these sites.

**14.    Perfect state transfer in products and covers of graphs**  
Gabriel Coutinho, Chris Godsil  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04396  
<blockquote>
<p>
A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph $X$ is represented by the complex matrix $\exp (-\mathrm{i} t A)$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $X$ and $t$ is a non-negative time. If the graph models a network of interacting qubits, transfer of state among such qubits throughout time can be formalized as the action of the continuous-time quantum walk operator in the characteristic vectors of the vertices. Here we are concerned with the problem of determining which graphs admit a perfect transfer of state. More specifically, we will study graphs whose adjacency matrix is a sum of tensor products of $01$-matrices, focusing on the case where a graph is the tensor product of two other graphs. As a result, we will construct many new examples of perfect state transfer.

**15.    Quantum walk and Anderson localization of rotational excitations in disordered ensembles of polar molecules**  
Tianrui Xu, Roman V. Krems  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05063  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dynamics of rotational excitations placed on a single molecule in spatially disordered 1D, 2D and 3D ensembles of ultracold molecules trapped in optical lattices. The disorder arises from incomplete populations of optical lattices with molecules. This leads to a model corresponding to a quantum particle with long-range tunnelling amplitudes moving on a lattice with the same on-site energy but with forbidden access to random sites (vacancies). We examine the time and length scales of Anderson localization for this type of disorder with realistic experimental parameters in the Hamiltonian. We show that for an experimentally realized system of KRb molecules on an optical lattice this type of disorder leads to disorder-induced localization in 1D and 2D systems on a time scale $t \sim 1$ sec. For 3D lattices with $55$ sites in each dimension and vacancy concentration $ 90~\%$, the rotational excitations diffuse to the edges of the lattice and show no signature of Anderson localization. We examine the role of the long-range tunnelling amplitudes allowing for transfer of rotational excitations between distant lattice sites. Our results show that the long-range tunnelling has little impact on the dynamics in the diffusive regime but affects significantly the localization dynamics in lattices with large concentrations of vacancies, enhancing the width of the localized distributions in 2D lattices by more than a factor of 2. Our results raise a general question whether quantum particles with long-range tunnelling can undergo quantum localization in 3D lattices with substitutional disorder.
