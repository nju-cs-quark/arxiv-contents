**1.    One-dimensional quantum walks with absorbing boundaries**  
Eric Bach, Susan Coppersmith, Marcel Paz Goldschen, Robert Joynt, John Watrous  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207008  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we analyze the behavior of quantum random walks. In particular we present several new results for the absorption probabilities in systems with both one and two absorbing walls for the one-dimensional case. We compute these probabilites both by employing generating functions and by use of an eigenfunction approach. The generating function method is used to determine some simple properties of the walks we consider, but appears to have limitations. The eigenfunction approach works by relating the problem of absorption to a unitary problem that has identical dynamics inside a certain domain, and can be used to compute several additional interesting properties, such as the time dependence of absorption. The eigenfunction method has the distinct advantage that it can be extended to arbitrary dimensionality. We outline the solution of the absorption probability problem of a (d-1)-dimensional wall in a d-dimensional space.

**2.    Quantum quincunx in cavity quantum electrodynamics**  
Barry C. Sanders, Stephen D. Bartlett, Ben Tregenna, Peter L. Knight  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 042305 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207028  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the quantum quincunx, which physically demonstrates the quantum walk and is analogous to Galton's quincunx for demonstrating the random walk. In contradistinction to the theoretical studies of quantum walks over orthogonal lattice states, we introduce quantum walks over nonorthogonal lattice states (specifically, coherent states on a circle) to demonstrate that the key features of a quantum walk are observable albeit for strict parameter ranges. A quantum quincunx may be realized with current cavity quantum electrodynamics capabilities, and precise control over decoherence in such experiments allows a remarkable decrease in the position noise, or spread, with increasing decoherence.

**3.    A discrete and finite approach to past proper time**  
Wolfgang Orthuber  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207045  
<blockquote>
<p>
The function $\gamma(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ plays an important role in mathematical physics, e.g. as factor for relativistic time dilation in case of $x=\beta$ with $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$ or $\beta=\frac{pc}{E}$. Due to former considerations it is reasonable to study the power series expansion of $\gamma(x)$. Here its relationship to the binomial distribution is shown, especially the fact, that the summands of the power series correspond to the return probabilities to the starting point (local coordinates, configuration or state) of a Bernoulli random walk. So $\gamma(x)$ and with that also proper time is proportional to the sum of the return probabilities. In case of $x=1$ or $v=c$ the random walk is symmetric. Random walks with absorbing barriers are introduced in the appendix. Here essentially the basic mathematical facts are shown and references are given, most interpretation is left to the reader.

**4.    Asymptotic entanglement capacity of the Ising and anisotropic Heisenberg interactions**  
A. M. Childs, D. W. Leung, F. Verstraete, G. Vidal  
Quantum Information and Computation 3, 97 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207052  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compute the asymptotic entanglement capacity of the Ising interaction ZZ, the anisotropic Heisenberg interaction XX + YY, and more generally, any two-qubit Hamiltonian with canonical form K = a XX + b YY. We also describe an entanglement assisted classical communication protocol using the Hamiltonian K with rate equal to the asymptotic entanglement capacity.

**5.    Towards the Classical Communication Complexity of Entanglement Distillation Protocols with Incomplete Information**  
Andris Ambainis, Ke Yang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207090  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum entanglement distillation protocols are LOCC protocols between Alice and Bob that convert imperfect EPR pairs, or, in general, partially entangled bipartite states into perfect or near-perfect EPR pairs. The classical communication complexity of these protocols is the minimal amount of classical communication needed for the conversion. In this paper, we focus on the communication complexity of protocols that operate with incomplete information, i.e., where the inputs are mixed states and/or prepared adversarially. We study 3 models of imperfect EPR pairs. In the measure-r model, r out of n EPR pairs are measured by an adversary; in the depolarization model, Bob's share of qubits underwent a depolarization channel; in the fidelity model, the only information Alice and Bob possess is the fidelity of the shared state. For the measure-r model and the depolarization model, we prove tight and almost-tight bounds on the outcome of LOCC protocols that don't use communication. For the fidelity model, we prove a lower bound on the communication complexity that matches the upper bound given by Ambainis, Smith, and Yang [ASY02].

**6.    Quantum random walks in optical lattices**  
W. D��r, R. Raussendorf, V.M. Kendon, H.-J. Briegel  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 052319 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207137  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimental realization of discrete quantum random walks using neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices. The random walk is taking place in position space and experimental implementation with present day technology --even using existing set-ups-- seems feasible. We analyze the influence of possible imperfections in the experiment and investigate the transition from a quantum random walk to the classical random walk for increasing errors and decoherence.
