**1.    Localization-like effect in two-dimensional alternate quantum walks with periodic coin operations**  
Carlo Di Franco, Mauro Paternostro  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 012328 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2052  
<blockquote>
<p>
Exploiting multi-dimensional quantum walks as feasible platforms for quantum computation and quantum simulation is attracting constantly growing attention from a broad experimental physics community. Here, we propose a two-dimensional quantum walk scheme with a single-qubit coin that presents, in the considered regimes, a strong localization-like effect on the walker. The result could provide new possible directions for the implementation of quantum algorithms or from the point of view of quantum simulation. We characterize the localization-like effect in terms of the parameters of a step-dependent qubit operation that acts on the coin space after any standard coin operation, showing that a proper choice can guarantee a non-negligible probability of finding the walker in the origin even for large times. We finally discuss the robustness to imperfections, a qualitative relation with coherences behavior, and possible experimental realizations of this model with the current state-of-the-art settings.

**2.    The Bose-Hubbard model is QMA-complete**

Proceedings of the 41st International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2014), pp. 308-319 (2014)

<blockquote>
<p>
The Bose-Hubbard model is a system of interacting bosons that live on the vertices of a graph. The particles can move between adjacent vertices and experience a repulsive on-site interaction. The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact. We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is QMA-complete. In our QMA-hardness proof, we encode the history of an n-qubit computation in the subspace with at most one particle per site (i.e., hard-core bosons). This feature, along with the well-known mapping between hard-core bosons and spin systems, lets us prove a related result for a class of 2-local Hamiltonians defined by graphs that generalizes the XY model. By avoiding the use of perturbation theory in our analysis, we circumvent the need to multiply terms in the Hamiltonian by large coefficients.

**3.    Simulating Anderson localization via a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits**  
Joydip Ghosh  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 022309 (2014)

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk (QW) in presence of lattice disorders leads to a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as Anderson localization. While QW has been realized in various optical and atomic systems, its implementation with superconducting qubits still remains pending. The major challenge in simulating QW with superconducting qubits emerges from the fact that on-chip superconducting qubits cannot hop between two adjacent lattice sites. Here we overcome this barrier and develop a scheme to realize the discrete time QW by placing a pair of superconducting qubits on each site of a 1D lattice and treating an excitation as a walker. It is also shown that lattice disorders can be introduced and fully controlled within this scheme by tuning the qubit parameters. We observe a distinct signature of transition from the ballistic regime to a localized QW with an increasing strength of disorder. Finally, an eight-qubit experiment is proposed where the signature of localized and delocalized regimes can be detected with existing superconducting technology.

**4.    Observation of Topological Structures in Photonic Quantum Walks**  
Graciana Puentes, Ilja Gerhardt, Fabian Katzschmann, Christine Silberhorn, J?rg Wrachtrup, Maciej Lewenstein

<blockquote>
<p>
Phases of matter with non-trivial topological order are predicted to exhibit a variety of exotic phenomena, such as the existence robust localized bound states in 1D systems, and edge states in 2D systems, which are expected to display spin-helicity, immunity to back-scattering, and weak anti-localization. In this Letter, we present an experimental observation of topological structures generated via the controlled implementation of two consecutive non-commuting rotations in photonic discrete-time quantum walks. The second rotation introduces valley-like Dirac points in the system, allowing to create the non-trivial topological pattern. By choosing specific values for the rotations, it is possible to coherently drive the system between topological sectors characterized by different topological invariants. We probe the full topological landscape, demonstrating the emergence of localized bound states hosted at the topological boundaries, and the existence of extremely localized or delocalized non-Gaussian quantum states. Our results pave the way for the study of valley-based electronics and applications of topological mechanisms in robust optical-device engineering.

**5.    The uniform measure for discrete-time quantum walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno  
Quantum Information Processing, Volume 13, Issue 5, pp.1103-1125 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0427  
<blockquote>
<p>
We obtain the uniform measure as a stationary measure of the one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem. As an application, the uniform probability measure on a finite interval at a time can be given.

**6.    Renormalization and Scaling in Quantum Walks**  
S. Boettcher, S. Falkner, R. Portugal  
Physical Review A 90, 032324 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3369  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to extract the scaling behavior of quantum walks using the renormalization group (RG). We introduce the method by efficiently reproducing well-known results on the one-dimensional lattice. As a nontrivial model, we apply this method to the dual Sierpinski gasket and obtain its exact, closed system of RG-recursions. Numerical iteration suggests that under rescaling the system length, $L^{\prime}=2L$, characteristic times rescale as $t^{\prime}=2^{d_{w}}t$ with the exact walk exponent $d_{w}=\log_{2}\sqrt{5}=1.1609\ldots$. Despite the lack of translational invariance, this is very close to the ballistic spreading, $d_{w}=1$, found for regular lattices. However, we argue that an extended interpretation of the traditional RG formalism will be needed to obtain scaling exponents analytically. Direct simulations confirm our RG-prediction for $d_w$ and furthermore reveal an immensely rich phenomenology for the spreading of the quantum walk on the gasket. Invariably, quantum interference localizes the walk completely with a site-access probability that declines with a powerlaw from the initial site, in contrast with a classical random walk, which would pass all sites with certainty.
