**1.    Quantum Search Algorithms on Hierarchical Networks**  
F. L. Marquezino, R. Portugal, S. Boettcher  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0529  
<blockquote>
<p>
The "abstract search algorithm" is a well known quantum method to find a marked vertex in a graph. It has been applied with success to searching algorithms for the hypercube and the two-dimensional grid. In this work we provide an example for which that method fails to provide the best algorithm in terms of time complexity. We analyze search algorithms in degree-3 hierarchical networks using quantum walks driven by non-groverian coins. Our conclusions are based on numerical simulations, but the hierarchical structures of the graphs seems to allow analytical results.

**2.    Increasing the dimensionality of quantum walks using multiple walkers**  
Peter P. Rohde, Andreas Schreiber, Martin Stefanak, Igor Jex, Alexei Gilchrist, Christine Silberhorn  
Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 10, 1644 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1850  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that with the addition of multiple walkers, quantum walks on a line can be transformed into lattice graphs of higher dimension. Thus, multi-walker walks can simulate single-walker walks on higher dimensional graphs and vice versa. This exponential complexity opens up new applications for present-day quantum walk experiments. We discuss the applications of such higher-dimensional structures and how they relate to linear optics quantum computing. In particular we show that multi-walker quantum walks are equivalent to the BosonSampling model for linear optics quantum computation proposed by Aaronson & Arkhipov. With the addition of control over phase-defects in the lattice, which can be simulated with entangling gates, asymmetric lattice structures can be constructed which are universal for quantum computation.

**3.    Hyperentanglement-enabled Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics**  
Trent M. Graham, Julio T. Barreiro, Masoud Mohseni, Paul G. Kwiat  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 060404 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2587  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use hyperentangled photons to experimentally implement an entanglement-assisted quantum process tomography technique known as Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics. Specifically, hyperentanglement-assisted Bell-state analysis enabled us to characterize a variety of single-qubit quantum processes using far fewer experimental configurations than are required by Standard Quantum Process Tomography (SQPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate how known errors in Bell-state measurement may be compensated for in the data analysis. Using these techniques, we have obtained single-qubit process fidelities as high as 98.2% but with one-third the number experimental configurations required for SQPT. Extensions of these techniques to multi-qubit quantum processes are discussed.

**4.    Universal computation by multi-particle quantum walk**  
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset, Zak Webb  
Science 339, 791-794 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3782  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum-mechanical process on a graph defined by analogy to classical random walk. The quantum walker is a particle that moves from a given vertex to adjacent vertices in quantum superposition. Here we consider a generalization of quantum walk to systems with more than one walker. A continuous-time multi-particle quantum walk is generated by a time-independent Hamiltonian with a term corresponding to a single-particle quantum walk for each particle, along with an interaction term. Multi-particle quantum walk includes a broad class of interacting many-body systems such as the Bose-Hubbard model and systems of fermions or distinguishable particles with nearest-neighbor interactions. We show that multi-particle quantum walk is capable of universal quantum computation. Since it is also possible to efficiently simulate a multi-particle quantum walk of the type we consider using a universal quantum computer, this model exactly captures the power of quantum computation. In principle our construction could be used as an architecture for building a scalable quantum computer with no need for time-dependent control.

**5.    Discrete Quantum Walk on a Line with Two Entangled Particles**  
Joachim Nsofini  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4357  
<blockquote>
<p>
A review of discrete quantum walk with two particle is given. The use of different states encountered in identical particle, and the idea of entanglement and superposition is explored to explored the interesting dynamics of two particle quantum walk. Boundary conditions can specify certain dynamics and so a survey of periodic boundary condition (circle) is presented. A simulation for a Hadamard walk for different periods of a circle is considered and results are compared for various periods and for a case with absorbing boundaries.

**6.    Interaction-induced decoherence in non-Hermitian quantum walks of ultracold Bosons**  
K. Rapedius, H. J. Korsch  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 025601 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4511  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the influence of particle interaction on a quantum walk on a bipartite one-dimensional lattice with decay from every second site. The corresponding non-interacting (linear) system has been shown to have a topological transition described by the average displacement before decay. Here we use this topological quantity to distinguish coherent quantum dynamics from incoherent classical dynamics caused by a breaking of the translational symmetry. We furthermore analyze the behavior by means of a rate equation providing a quantitative description of the incoherent nonlinear dynamics.

**7.    Birth and death processes and quantum spin chains**  
Alberto F. Gr��nbaum, Luc Vinet, Alexei Zhedanov  
J. Math. Phys. 54, 062101 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4689  
<blockquote>
<p>
This papers underscores the intimate connection between the quantum walks generated by certain spin chain Hamiltonians and classical birth and death processes. It is observed that transition amplitudes between single excitation states of the spin chains have an expression in terms of orthogonal polynomials which is analogous to the Karlin-McGregor representation formula of the transition probability functions for classes of birth and death processes. As an application, we present a characterization of spin systems for which the probability to return to the point of origin at some time is 1 or almost 1.

**8.    Thermodynamic formalism for dissipative quantum walks**  
Silvano Garnerone  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 032342 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5744  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dynamical properties of dissipative continuous-time quantum walks on directed graphs. Using a large-deviation approach we construct a thermodynamic formalism allowing us to define a dynamical order parameter, and to identify transitions between dynamical regimes. For a particular class of dissipative quantum walks we propose a quantum generalization of the the classical PageRank vector, used to rank the importance of nodes in a directed graph. We also provide an example where one can characterize the dynamical transition from an effective classical random walk to a dissipative quantum walk as a thermodynamic crossover between distinct dynamical regimes.

**9.    Dephasing by a Continuous-Time Random Walk Process**  
Daniel M Packwood, Yoshitaka Tanimura  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0296  
<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic treatments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy require evaluations of functions like <exp(i int_0^t Q(s)ds)>, where t is time, Q(s) is the value of a stochastic process at time s, and the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging. This paper gives an exact evaluation of these functions for the case where Q is a continuous-time random walk process. The continuous time random walk describes an environment that undergoes slow, step-like changes in time. It also has a well-defined Gaussian limit, and so allows for non-Gaussian and Gaussian stochastic dynamics to be studied within a single framework. We apply the results to extract qubit-lattice interaction parameters from dephasing data of P-doped Si semiconductors (data collected elsewhere), and to calculate the two-dimensional spectrum of a three level harmonic oscillator undergoing random frequency modulations.

**10.    Quantum feedback control of a superconducting qubit: Persistent Rabi oscillations**  
R. Vijay, C. Macklin, D. H. Slichter, S. J. Weber, K. W. Murch, R. Naik, A. N. Korotkov, I. Siddiqi  
Nature 490, 77 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5591  
<blockquote>
<p>
The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single, albeit probabilistic, outcome. The time-scale of this "instantaneous" process can be stretched using weak measurements so that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. We monitor the dynamics of a resonantly driven quantum two-level system -- a superconducting quantum bit --using a near-noiseless parametric amplifier. The high-fidelity measurement output is used to actively stabilize the phase of Rabi oscillations, enabling them to persist indefinitely. This new functionality shows promise for fighting decoherence and defines a path for continuous quantum error correction.
