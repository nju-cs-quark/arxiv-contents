abstract: We show that the so-called quantum probabilistic rule, usually presented in the physical literature as an argument of the essential distinction between the probability relations under quantum and classical measurements, is not, as it is usually considered, in contrast to the rule for the addition of probabilities of incompatible events. The latter is, of course, valid under all measurement situations upon classical and quantum objects. We discuss also quantum measurement situation, which is similar to the classical one, corresponding to classical Bayes' formula for conditional probabilities. We show the compatibility of description of this quantum measurement situation in the frame of purely classical and experimentally justified straight ward frequency arguments [Khrennikov (1999, 2000, 2001)] and in the frame of the quantum stochastic approach to the description of generalized quantum measurements (Loubenets (2000); Barndorff-Nielsen and Loubenets (2001)]. In view of derived results, we argue that even in the classical probability the classical Bayes' formula describes a particular case of the considered measurement situation, which is specific for context-independent measurements. The similarity of the forms of the relation between the transformation of probabilities, which we derive in the frame of quantum stochastic approach and in the frame of straight ward frequency arguments, underlines once more that the projective (von Neumann) measurements correspond only to a very special kind of measurement situations in quantum theory.

abstract: Based on parity violation in the weak interaction and evidences from neutrino oscillation, a natural choice is that neutrinos may be spacelike particles with a tiny mass. To keep causality for spacelike particles, a kinematic time under a non-standard form of the Lorentz transformation is introduced, which is related to a preferred frame. A Dirac-type equation for spacelike neutrinos is further investigated and its solutions are discussed. This equation can be written in two spinor equations coupled together via nonzero mass while respecting maximum parity violation. As a consequence, parity violation implies that the principle of relativity is violated in the weak interaction.

abstract: A W state is pair-wisely entangled, belonging to the different class from Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We show that the W state enables three variant protocols, that is, quantum key distribution between several parts, quantum secret sharing, and both of them at the same time. It is discussed how one's cheating can be detected in each protocol.

abstract: It is impossible to discriminate four Bell states through local operations and classical communication (LOCC), if only one copy is provided. To complete this task, two copies will suffice and be necessary. When $n$ copies are provided, we show that the distillable entanglement is exactly $n-2$.

abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of the power of real-time feedback in quantum metrology, confirming a theoretical prediction by Wiseman regarding the superior performance of an adaptive homodyne technique for single-shot measurement of optical phase. For phase measurements performed on weak coherent states with no prior knowledge of the signal phase, we show that the variance of adaptive homodyne estimation approaches closer to the fundamental quantum uncertainty limit than any previously demonstrated technique. Our results underscore the importance of real-time feedback for reaching quantum performance limits in coherent telecommunication, precision measurement and information processing.

abstract: In this paper we explore the boundary between biology and the study of formal systems (logic). In the end, we arrive at a summary formalism, a chapter in "boundary mathematics" where there are not only containers <> but also extainers ><, entities open to interaction and distinguishing the space that they are not. The boundary algebra of containers and extainers is to biologic what boolean algebra is to classical logic. We show how this formalism encompasses significant parts of the logic of DNA replication, the Dirac formalism for quantum mechanics, formalisms for protein folding and the basic structure of the Temperley Lieb algebra at the foundations of topological invariants of knots and links.

abstract: We consider a fully quantized model of spontaneous emission, scattering, and absorption, and study propagation of a single photon from an emitting atom to a detector atom both with and without an intervening scatterer. We find an exact quantum analog to the classical complex analytic signal of an electromagnetic wave scattered by a medium of charged oscillators. This quantum signal exhibits classical phase delays. We define a time of detection which, in the appropriate limits, exactly matches the predictions of a classically defined delay for light propagating through a medium of charged oscillators. The fully quantized model provides a simple, unambiguous, and causal interpretation of delays that seemingly imply speeds greater than c in the region of anomalous dispersion.

abstract: Krentel [J. Comput. System. Sci., 36, pp.490--509] presented a framework for an NP optimization problem that searches an optimal value among exponentially-many outcomes of polynomial-time computations. This paper expands his framework to a quantum optimization problem using polynomial-time quantum computations and introduces the notion of an ``universal'' quantum optimization problem similar to a classical ``complete'' optimization problem. We exhibit a canonical quantum optimization problem that is universal for the class of polynomial-time quantum optimization problems. We show in a certain relativized world that all quantum optimization problems cannot be approximated closely by quantum polynomial-time computations. We also study the complexity of quantum optimization problems in connection to well-known complexity classes.

abstract: Entangled coherent states can be used to determine the entanglement fidelity for a device that is designed to teleport coherent states. This entanglement fidelity is universal, in that the calculation is independent of the use of entangled coherent states and applies generally to the teleportation of entanglement using coherent states. The average fidelity is shown to be a poor indicator of the capability of teleporting entanglement; i.e., very high average fidelity for the quantum teleportation apparatus can still result in low entanglement fidelity for one mode of the two-mode entangled coherent state.

abstract: Diffraction experiments have moved to ever heavier objects in recent years, now standing at the level of large molecules. Experiments in materials science on the other hand have come down to ever smaller sizes largely due to the success of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which allows studying single molecules on surfaces. Since both fields coming from opposite side of the size spectrum are now meeting, there is a need of consistent theories. The simulations presented in the article, which we are referring to, are not consistent with molecular dynamics simulations which are routinely used to interpret STM results. Our comment points this out in detail.

abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial search problems that uses only a sequence of measurements. The algorithm is similar in spirit to quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, in that the goal is to remain in the ground state of a time-varying Hamiltonian. Indeed, we show that the running times of the two algorithms are closely related. We also show how to achieve the quadratic speedup for Grover's unstructured search problem with only two measurements. Finally, we discuss some similarities and differences between the adiabatic and measurement algorithms.

abstract: We derive an encoded universality representation for a generalized anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian that contains cross-product terms in addition to the usual two-particle exchange terms. The recently developed algebraic approach is used to show that the minimal universality-generating encodings of one logical qubit are based on three physical qubits. We show how to generate both single- and two-qubit operations on the logical qubits, using suitably timed conjugating operations derived from analysis of the commutator algebra. The timing of the operations is seen to be crucial in allowing simplification of the gate sequences for the generalized Hamiltonian to forms similar to that derived previously for the symmetric (XY) anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian. The total number of operations needed for a controlled-Z gate up to local transformations is five. A scalable architecture is proposed.

abstract: Using continuous wave superposition of spatial modes, we demonstrate experimentally displacement measurement of a light beam below the standard quantum limit. Multimode squeezed light is obtained by mixing a vacuum squeezed beam and a coherent beam that are spatially orthogonal. Although the resultant beam is not squeezed, it is shown to have strong internal spatial correlations. We show that the position of such a light beam can be measured using a split detector with an increased precision compared to a classical beam. This method can be used to improve the sensitivity of small displacement measurements.

abstract: The notion of spin squeezing involves reduction in the uncertainty of a component of the spin vector below a certain limit. This aspect has been studied earlier for pure and mixed states of definite spin. In this paper, this study has been extended to coupled spin states which do not possess sharp spin value. A general squeezing criterion has been obtained by requiring that a direct product state for two spinors is not squeezed. The squeezing aspect of entangled states is studied in relation to their spin- spin correlations.

abstract: I conjecture that only those states of light whose Wigner function is positive are real states, and give arguments suggesting that this is not a serious restriction. Hence it follows that the Wigner formalism in quantum optics is capable of interpretation as a classical wave field with the addition of a zeropoint contribution. Thus entanglement between pairs of photons with a common origin occurs because the two light signals have amplitudes and phases, both below and above the zeropoint intensity level, which are correlated with each other.

This refined model predicts dissipationless energy transfer along such "shielded" macromolecules at near room temperatures as well as quantum teleportation of states across MTs and perhaps neurons.

abstract: We present a new protocol and two lower bounds for quantum coin flipping. In our protocol, no dishonest party can achieve one outcome with probability more than 0.75. Then, we show that our protocol is optimal for a certain type of quantum protocols. For arbitrary quantum protocols, we show that if a protocol achieves a bias of at most $\epsilon$, it must use at least $\Omega(\log \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ rounds of communication. This implies that the parallel repetition fails for quantum coin flipping. (The bias of a protocol cannot be arbitrarily decreased by running several copies of it in parallel.)

abstract: We examine the competition among one- and two-photon processes in an ultra-cold, three-level atom undergoing cascade transitions as a result of its interaction with a bimodal cavity. We show parameter domains where two-photon transitions are dominant and also study the effect of two-photon emission on the mazer action in the cavity. The two-photon emission leads to the loss of detailed balance and therefore we obtain the photon statistics of the cavity field by the numerical integration of the master equation. The photon distribution in each cavity mode exhibits sub- and super- Poissonian behaviors depending on the strength of atom-field coupling. The photon distribution becomes identical to a Poisson distribution when the atom-field coupling strengths of the modes are equal.

abstract: Recently it has been shown that transformations of Heisenberg-picture operators are the causal mechanism which allows Bell-theorem-violating correlations at a distance to coexist with locality in the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. A calculation to first order in perturbation theory of the generation of EPRB entanglement in nonrelativistic fermionic field theory in the Heisenberg picture illustrates that the same mechanism leads to correlations without nonlocality in quantum field theory as well. An explicit transformation is given to a representation in which initial-condition information is transferred from the state vector to the field operators, making the locality of the theory manifest.

abstract: We completely (that is, up to a logarithmic factor) characterize the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of every predicate $f(x,y)$ depending only on $|x\cap y|$ ($x,y\subseteq [n]$). Namely, for a predicate $D$ on $\{0,1,...,n\}$ let $\ell_0(D)\df \max\{\ell : 1\leq\ell\leq n/2\land D(\ell)\not\equiv D(\ell-1)\}$ and $\ell_1(D)\df \max\{n-\ell : n/2\leq\ell < n\land D(\ell)\not\equiv D(\ell+1)\}$. Then the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of $f_D(x,y) = D(|x\cap y|)$ is equal (again, up to a logarithmic factor) to $\sqrt{n\ell_0(D)}+\ell_1(D)$. In particular, the complexity of the set disjointness predicate is $\Omega(\sqrt n)$. This result holds both in the model with prior entanglement and without it.

Control is explained in terms of the nonadiabatic transition between optical potentials and the corresponding regular to chaotic transition in mixed classical-quantum dynamics. The results are of interest to both areas of coherent control and quantum chaos.

Moreover, the present scheme requires only two atomic levels in each ion, making it an appealing candidate for quantum computation.

A short discussion on the concept of well-defined relative phase is also included.

abstract: This paper posits that the cosmic digital code as the law of all physical laws contains two mutually exclusive values: attachment space attaching to object and detachment space detaching from object. However, the cosmic physical system could not start with mutually exclusive attachment space and detachment space at the same time in the beginning. The way out of this impasse is that the complete cosmic system consists of both the cosmic physical system and the unphysical cosmic digital code. The unphysical cosmic digital code allows the coexistence of attachment space and detachment space at the same time. The cosmic digital code behaves as gene in organism, and the cosmic physical system behaves as organ. Under different conditions and times, different spaces in the cosmic digital code are activated to generate different spaces in the cosmic physical systems with different physical laws for different universes in the multivese. All universes start from the primitive multiverse, which only has attachment space attaching to 10D string without the four force fields. During the big bang in our universe, detachment space emerged to detach particle from its four force fields. Such detachment, however, cannot be completely and permanently detached, because particle still attaches to its force fields. The result is hybrid space, combining both attachment space and detachment space in coherent state, such as particle and its force fields. Hybrid space is the space for wavefunction whose probability density is proportional to attachment space, and inversely proportional to detachment space. The collapse of wavefunction in decoherent state is the separation of attachment space and detachment space in such way that attachment space attaches to particle, and detachment space separately detaches from all probability density.

abstract: The generation and detection of maximally-entangled two-particle states, `Bell states,' are crucial tasks in many quantum information protocols such as cryptography and teleportation. Unfortunately, they require strong inter-particle interactions lacking in optics. For this reason, it has not previously been possible to perform complete Bell state determination in optical systems. In this work, we show how a recently developed quantum interference technique for enhancing optical nonlinearities can make efficient Bell-state measurement possible. We also discuss weaknesses of the scheme including why it cannot be used for unconditional quantum teleportation.

abstract: A scenario is outlined for quantum measurement, assuming that self-sustaining classicality is the consequence of an attractive gravitational self-interaction acting on massive bodies, and randomness arises already in the classical domain. A simple solvable model is used to demonstrate that small quantum systems influence big ones in a mean-field way, offering a natural route to Born's probability rule.

abstract: There is a certainty that the modern (Copenhagen's) interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct. However, the some physicist had the opinion that the modern quantum mechanics is a phenomenological theory. The suggested theory is the new quantum mechanics interpretation that is entirely according to the modern interpretation and gives a number of results, which naturally explain the postulates of the modern quantum mechanics.

abstract: We study the visible compression of a source E of pure quantum signal states, or, more formally, the minimal resources per signal required to represent arbitrarily long strings of signals with arbitrarily high fidelity, when the compressor is given the identity of the input state sequence as classical information. According to the quantum source coding theorem, the optimal quantum rate is the von Neumann entropy S(E) qubits per signal. We develop a refinement of this theorem in order to analyze the situation in which the states are coded into classical and quantum bits that are quantified separately. This leads to a trade--off curve Q(R), where Q(R) qubits per signal is the optimal quantum rate for a given classical rate of R bits per signal. Our main result is an explicit characterization of this trade--off function by a simple formula in terms of only single signal, perfect fidelity encodings of the source. We give a thorough discussion of many further mathematical properties of our formula, including an analysis of its behavior for group covariant sources and a generalization to sources with continuously parameterized states. We also show that our result leads to a number of corollaries characterizing the trade--off between information gain and state disturbance for quantum sources. In addition, we indicate how our techniques also provide a solution to the so--called remote state preparation problem. Finally, we develop a probability--free version of our main result which may be interpreted as an answer to the question: ``How many classical bits does a qubit cost?'' This theorem provides a type of dual to Holevo's theorem, insofar as the latter characterizes the cost of coding classical bits into qubits.

We propose to use this concurrence hierarchy as measurement of entanglement. This measurement does not increase under local quantum operations and classical communication.

abstract: Under certain simplifying conditions we detect monotonicity properties of the ground-state energy and the canonical-equilibrium density matrix of a spinless charged particle in the Euclidean plane subject to a perpendicular, possibly inhomogeneous magnetic field and an additional scalar potential. Firstly, we point out a simple condition warranting that the ground-state energy does not decrease when the magnetic field and/or the potential is increased pointwise. Secondly, we consider the case in which both the magnetic field and the potential are constant along one direction in the plane and give a genuine path-integral argument for corresponding monotonicities of the density-matrix diagonal and the absolute value of certain off-diagonals. Our results complement to some degree results of M. Loss and B. Thaller [Commun. Math. Phys. 186 (1997) 95] and L. Erdos [J. Math. Phys. 38 (1997) 1289].

abstract: Echo dynamics and fidelity are often used to discuss stability in quantum information processing and quantum chaos. Yet fidelity yields no information about entanglement, the characteristic property of quantum mechanics. We study the evolution of entanglement in echo dynamics. We find qualitatively different behavior between integrable and chaotic systems on one hand and between random and coherent initial states for integrable systems on the other. For the latter the evolution of entanglement is given by a classical time scale. Analytic results are illustrated numerically in a Jaynes Cummings model.

abstract: We present the results of a detailed analysis of a general, unstructured adiabatic quantum search of a data base of $N$ items. In particular we examine the effects on the computation time of adding energy to the system. We find that by increasing the lowest eigenvalue of the time dependent Hamiltonian {\it temporarily} to a maximum of $\propto \sqrt{N}$, it is possible to do the calculation in constant time. This leads us to derive the general theorem which provides the adiabatic analogue of the $\sqrt{N}$ bound of conventional quantum searches. The result suggests that the action associated with the oracle term in the time dependent Hamiltonian is a direct measure of the resources required by the adiabatic quantum search.

abstract: One of the greatest difficulties in the applications of single photon polarization states as qubits is the realization of controlled interactions between two photons. Recently, it has been shown that such interactions can be realized using only beam splitters and high efficiency photon detection by post-selecting a well defined part of the results in the output. We analyze these interactions and discuss schemes for qubit operations based on this mechanism.

Our method is based on a generalization of the displacement operator known in quantum optics and results in the separation of the center of mass motion from the internal dynamics of many-body systems. The center of mass motion is analyzed for an anisotropic rotating trap and a region of instability for intermediate rotational velocities is predicted.

abstract: Based upon the general supercharges which involve not only generators C_j of the Clifford algebra C(4,0) with positive metric, but also operators of third order, C_j C_k C_l, the general form of N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SSQM), which brings out the richer structures, is realized. Then from them, an one-dimensional physical realization and a new multi-dimensional physical realization of N=4 SSQM are respectively obtained by solving the constraint conditions. As applications, N=4 dynamical superconformal symmetries, which possess both the N=4 supersymmetries and the usual dynamical conformal symmetries, are studied in detail by considering two simple superpotentials k/x and \omega x, and their corresponding superalgebraic structures, which are spanned by eight fermionic generators and six bosonic generators, are established as well.

abstract: Recently quantum states discrimination has been frequently studied. In this paper we study them from the other way round, the likeness of two quantum states. The fidelity is used to describe the likeness of two quantum states. Then we presented a scheme to obtain the fidelity of two unknown qubits directly from the integral area of the spectra of the assistant qubit(spin) on an NMR Quantum Information Processor. Finally we demonstrated the scheme on a three-qubit quantum information processor. The experimental data are consistent with the theoretical expectation with an average error of 0.05, which confirms the scheme.

abstract: Light-induced nonlinear terms in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation arise from the stimulated coherent exchange of photons between two atoms. For atoms in an optical dipole trap this effect depends on the spatial profile of the trapping laser beam. Two different laser beams can induce the same trapping potential but very different nonlinearities. We propose a scheme to measure light-induced nonlinearities which is based on this observation.

abstract: We show that no distillation protocol for Gaussian quantum states exists that relies on (i) arbitrary local unitary operations that preserve the Gaussian character of the state and (ii) homodyne detection together with classical communication and postprocessing by means of local Gaussian unitary operations on two symmetric identically prepared copies. This is in contrast to the finite-dimensional case, where entanglement can be distilled in an iterative protocol using two copies at a time. The ramifications for the distribution of Gaussian states over large distances will be outlined. We also comment on the generality of the approach and sketch the most general form of a Gaussian local operation with classical communication in a bipartite setting.

We obtain generalized Kronig-Penney relations for bulk states and exact expressions for the corresponding periodic parts of the Bloch wave functions for the two possible choices of the matching conditions in an unit cell. We show also that our analitic expressions reduce to the well known expressions for the Kronig-Penney relations and Bloch waves under constant effective mass and appropriate matching conditions.

abstract: We suggest a quantum measurement model in an ion trap which specifies the probability distribution of two, distinct internal ground states of a trapped four-level ion. The external degrees of motion of the four-level ion constitute the meter which, in turn, is coupled to the environment by engineered reservoirs. In a previous publication, a similar measurement model was employed to test decoherence effects on quantum nonlocality in phase space on the basis of coincidence measurements of the entangled system-meter scheme. Here, we study the effects of decoherence on the entanglement of formation characterized by the concurrence. The concurrence of the system enables to find the maximum possible violation of the Bell inequality. Surprisingly, this model gives illustrative insights into the question to what extend the Bell inequality can be considered as a measure of entanglement.

abstract: We describe a scheme for the teleportation of entanglements of zero- and one-photon running-wave field states. In addition to linear optical elements, Kerr nonlinearity is also employed so as to achieve a 100% probability of success in the ideal case. A comprehensive phenomenological treatment of errors in the domain of running-wave physics, for linear and nonlinear optical elements, is also given, making it possible to calculate the fidelity of the teleportation process. A strategy for carrying out the Bell-type measurement which is able to probe the absorption of photons in the optical elements is adopted. Such strategy, combined with usually small damping constants characterizing the optical devices, results in a high fidelity for the teleportation process. The feasibility of the proposed scheme relies on the fact that the Kerr nonlinearity it demands can be achieved through the recently reported ultraslow light propagation in cold atomic media [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1419 (2000); Phys. Rev. A 65, 033833 (2002)].

abstract: The entanglement between occupation-numbers of different single particle basis states depends on coupling between different single particle basis states in the second-quantized Hamiltonian. Thus in principle, interaction is not necessary for occupation-number entanglement to appear. However, in order to characterize quantum correlation caused by interaction, we use the eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian as the single particle basis upon which the occupation-number entanglement is defined. Using the proper single particle basis, we discuss occupation-number entanglement in important eigenstates, especially ground states, of systems of many identical particles. The discussions on Fermi systems start with Fermi gas, Hatree-Fock approximation, and the electron-hole entanglement in excitations. The entanglement in a quantum Hall state is quantified as -fln f-(1-f)ln(1-f), where f is the proper fractional part of the filling factor. For BCS superconductivity, the entanglement is a function of the relative momentum wavefunction of the Cooper pair, and is thus directly related to the superconducting energy gap. For a spinless Bose system, entanglement does not appear in the Hatree-Gross-Pitaevskii approximation, but becomes important in the Bogoliubov theory.

For the sake of comparison we consider first an ideal, or instantaneous projective measurement, as postulated by von Neumann. Then we compare it with the more realistic or generalized measurement procedure based on photocounting on ${\cal M}$. Further we consider that the interaction term (between ${\cal S}$ and ${\cal M}$) contains a quantum nondemolition variable of ${\cal S}$ and discuss the possibility and limitations for reconstructing the initial state of ${\cal S}$ from information acquired by photocounting on ${\cal M}$.

It is shown that while the particle's energy decreases in limits of a single energy band, the probability of the particle to be in barrier-type region of periodic potential increases, in contrary to the expected decreasing. This ''anomalous'' behavior is more pronounced for the near-top bands and monotonically decreases for the higher or lower ones.

abstract: In perturbative calculations of quantum-statistical zero-temperature path integrals in curvilinear coordinates one encounters Feynman diagrams involving multiple temporal integrals over products of distributions, which are mathematically undefined. In addition, there are terms proportional to powers of Dirac delta-functions at the origin coming from the measure of path integration. We give simple rules for integrating products of distributions in such a way that the results ensure coordinate independence of the path integrals. The rules are derived by using equations of motion and partial integration, while keeping track of certain minimal features originating in the unique definition of all singular integrals in $1 - \epsilon$ dimensions. Our rules yield the same results as the much more cumbersome calculations in 1- epsilon dimensions where the limit epsilon --> 0 is taken at the end. They also agree with the rules found in an independent treatment on a finite time interval.

abstract: We prove that it is impossible to distill more entanglement from a single copy of a two-mode bipartite entangled Gaussian state via LOCC Gaussian operations. More generally, we show that any hypothetical distillation protocol for Gaussian states involving only Gaussian operations would be a deterministic protocol. Finally, we argue that the protocol considered by Eisert et al. [quant-ph/0204052] is the optimum Gaussian distillation protocol for two copies of entangled Gaussian states.

abstract: We propose a scheme to generate nonclassical states of a quantum system, which is composed of the one-dimensional trapped ion motion and a single cavity field mode. We show that two-mode SU(2) Schr\"odinger-cat states, entangled coherent states, two-mode squeezed vacuum states and their superposition can be generated. If the vibration mode and the cavity mode are used to represent separately a qubit, a quantum phase gate can be implemented.

abstract: Structures of quantum Fokker-Planck equations are characterized with respect to the properties of complete positivity, covariance under symmetry transformations and satisfaction of equipartition, referring to recent mathematical work on structures of unbounded generators of covariant quantum dynamical semigroups. In particular the quantum optical master-equation and the quantum Brownian motion master-equation are shown to be associated to $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathrm{R}$ symmetry respectively. Considering the motion of a Brownian particle, where the expression of the quantum Fokker-Planck equation is not completely fixed by the aforementioned requirements, a recently introduced microphysical kinetic model is briefly recalled, where a quantum generalization of the linear Boltzmann equation in the small energy and momentum transfer limit straightforwardly leads to quantum Brownian motion.

abstract: We analyze the formation of polarization-squeezed light in a medium with electronic Kerr nonlinearity. Quantum Stokes parameters are considered and the spectra of their quantum fluctuations are investigated. It is established that the frequency at which the suppression of quantum fluctuations is the greatest can be controlled by adjusting the linear phase difference between pulses. We shown that by varying the intensity or the nonlinear phase shift per photon for one pulse, one can effectively control the suppression of quantum fluctuations of the quantum Stokes parameters.

abstract: The performance of nondeterministic nonlinear gates in linear optics relies on the photon counting scheme being employed and the efficiencies of the detectors in such schemes. We assess the performance of the nonlinear sign gate, which is a critical component of linear optical quantum computing, for two standard photon counting methods: the double detector array and the visible light photon counter. Our analysis shows that the double detector array is insufficient to provide the photon counting capability for effective nondeterministic nonlinear transformations, and we determine the gate fidelity for both photon counting methods as a function of detector efficiencies.

abstract: In the field of atom optics, the basis of many experiments is a two level atom coupled to a light field. The evolution of this system is governed by a master equation. The irreversible components of this master equation describe the spontaneous emission of photons from the atom. For many applications, it is necessary to minimize the effect of this irreversible evolution. This can be achieved by having a far detuned light field. The drawback of this regime is that making the detuning very large makes the timestep required to solve the master equation very small, much smaller than the timescale of any significant evolution. This makes the problem very numerically intensive. For this reason, approximations are used to simulate the master equation which are more numerically tractable to solve. This paper analyses four approximations: The standard adiabatic approximation; a more sophisticated adiabatic approximation (not used before); a secular approximation; and a fully quantum dressed-state approximation. The advantages and disadvantages of each are investigated with respect to accuracy, complexity and the resources required to simulate. In a parameter regime of particular experimental interest, only the sophisticated adiabatic and dressed-state approximations agree well with the exact evolution.

abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to show that we can exploit the difference ($l_1$-norm and $l_2$-norm) in the probability calculation between quantum and probabilistic computations to claim the difference in their space efficiencies. It is shown that there is a finite language $L$ which contains sentences of length up to $O(n^{c+1})$ such that: ($i$) There is a one-way quantum finite automaton (qfa) of $O(n^{c+4})$ states which recognizes $L$. ($ii$) However, if we try to simulate this qfa by a probabilistic finite automaton (pfa) \textit{using the same algorithm}, then it needs $\Omega(n^{2c+4})$ states. It should be noted that we do not prove real lower bounds for pfa's but show that if pfa's and qfa's use exactly the same algorithm, then qfa's need much less states.

abstract: Photonic crystals doped with resonant atoms allow for uniquely advantageous nonlinear modes of optical propagation: (a) Self-induced transparency (SIT) solitons and multi-dimensional localized "bullets" propagating at photonic band gap frequencies. These modes can exist even at ultraweak intensities (few photons) and therefore differ substantially either from solitons in Kerr-nonlinear photonic crystals or from SIT solitons in uniform media. (b) Cross-coupling between pulses exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and SIT gap solitons. We show that extremely strong correlations (giant cross-phase modulation) can be formed between the two pulses. These features may find applications in high-fidelity classical and quantum optical communications.

Furthermore, we present an algorithm to simulate detections of the particle.

abstract: As a powerful tool in scientific computation, Mathematica offers us algebraic computation, but it does not provide functions to directly calculate commutators in quantum mechanics. Different from present software packets to deal with noncommutative algebra, such as NCAlgebra and NCComAlgebra, one simple method of calculating the commutator in quantum mechanics is put forward and is demonstrated by an example calculating SO(4) dynamical symmetry in 3 dimensions Coulomb potential. This method does not need to develop software packets but rather to directly write program in Mathematica. It is based on the connection between commutator in quantum mechanics and Poisson bracket in classical mechanics to perform calculations. Both the length and the running time of this example are very short, which demonstrates that this method is simple and effective in scientific research. Moreover, this method is used to calculate any commutator in Hamilton system in principle. In the end some deficiencies and applications are discussed.

We develop a master equation for the dynamics of the system subject to stochastic errors in the laser pulses, and use this to evaluate the sensitivity of the transfer process to stochastic pulse shape errors for a number of different pulse shapes. We show that under certain conditions, the sensitivity of the transfer to the noise depends on the pulse shape, and develop a method for determining a pulse shape that is minimally sensitive to specific errors.

abstract: An accidental degeneracy of resonances gives rise to a double pole in the scattering matrix, a double zero in the Jost function and a Jordan chain of length two of generalized Gamow-Jordan eigenfunctions of the radial Schroedinger equation. The generalized Gamow-Jordan eigenfunctions are basis elements of an expansion in bound and resonant energy eigenfunctions plus a continuum of scattering wave functions of complex wave number. In this biorthonormal basis, any operator which is a regular function of the Hamiltonian is represented by a complex matrix which is diagonal except for a Jordan block of rank two. The occurrence of a double pole in the Green's function, as well as the non-exponential time evolution of the Gamow-Jordan generalized eigenfunctions are associated to the Jordan block in the complex energy representation.

We show that this class coincides with that of all operations which can be performed on Gaussian states using linear optical elements and homodyne measurements. For bipartite systems we characterize the processes which can be implemented by local operations and classical communication, as well as those that can be implemented using positive partial transpose preserving maps. As an application, we show that Gaussian states cannot be distilled by local Gaussian operations and classical communication. We also define and characterize positive (but not completely positive) Gaussian maps.

abstract: Recently the continuous time algorithm based on the generalized quantum search Hamiltonian was presented. In this letter, we consider the running time of the generalized quantum search Hamiltonian. We provide the surprising result that the maximum speedup of quantum search in the generalized Hamiltonian is the O(1) running time regardless of the number of total states. It seems to violate the proof of Zalka that the quadratic speedup is optimal in quantum search. However the argurment of Giovannetti et al. that a quantum speedup comes from the interaction between subsystems(or, equivalently entanglement) (and is concerned with the Margolus and Levitin theorem) supports our result.

abstract: Schroedinger's wave function shows many aspects of a state of incomplete knowledge or information ("bit"): (1) it is usually defined on a space of classical configurations, (2) its generic entanglement is, therefore, analogous to statistical correlations, and (3) it determines probabilities of measurement outcomes. Nonetheless, quantum superpositions (such as represented by a wave function) define individual physical states ("it"). This conceptual dilemma may have its origin in the conventional operational foundation of physical concepts, successful in classical physics, but inappropriate in quantum theory because of the existence of mutually exclusive operations (used for the definition of concepts). In contrast, a hypothetical realism, based on concepts that are justified only by their universal and consistent applicability, favors the wave function as a description of (thus nonlocal) physical reality. The (conceptually local) classical world then appears as an illusion, facilitated by the phenomenon of decoherence, which is consistently explained by the very entanglement that must dynamically arise in a universal wave function.

abstract: We derive analytic solution for pulsed frequency conversion based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) or maximum coherence in resonant atomic vapors. In particular drive-field and coherence depletion are taken into account. The solutions are obtained with the help of an Hamiltonian approach which in the adiabatic limit allows to reduce the full set of Maxwell-Bloch equations to simple canonical equations of Hamiltonian mechanics for the field variables. Adiabatic integrals of motion can be obtained and general expressions for the spatio-temporal evolution of field intensities derived. Optimum conditions for maximum conversion efficiency are identified and the physical mechanism of nonlinear conversion in the limit of drive-field and coherence depletion discussed.

abstract: Set-theoretical, physical, and intuitive notions of continuum are compared. It is shown that the independence of the continuum hypothesis determines status and properties of the set of intermediate cardinality. The intermediate set is a hierarchy of non-equivalent infinite sets. Its description consist of autonomous theories. In particular, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and geometrical optics should be regarded as components of the complete description of the intermediate set. The intermediate sets may be produced as a result of a fission of a continuous interval. The simplest schemes of the fission are considered. Some analogy with the Standard Model is pointed out.

abstract: An approach to the description of subdynamics inside non-relativistic quantum field theory is presented, in which the notions of relevant observable, time scale and complete positivity of the time evolution are stressed. A scattering theory derivation of the subdynamics of a microsystem interacting through collisions with a macrosystem is given, leading to a master-equation expressed in terms of the operator-valued dynamic structure factor, a two-point correlation function which compactly takes the statistical mechanics properties of the macrosystem into account. For the case of a free quantum gas the dynamic structure factor can be exactly calculated and in the long wavelength limit a Fokker-Planck equation for the description of quantum dissipation and in particular quantum Brownian motion is obtained, where peculiar corrections due to quantum statistics can be put into evidence.

abstract: We study the amount of communication needed for two parties to transform some given joint pure state into another one, either exactly or with some fidelity. Specifically, we present a method to lower bound this communication cost even when the amount of entanglement does not increase. Moreover, the bound applies even if the initial state is supplemented with unlimited entanglement in the form of EPR pairs, and the communication is allowed to be quantum mechanical. We then apply the method to the determination of the communication cost of asymptotic entanglement concentration and dilution. While concentration is known to require no communication whatsoever, the best known protocol for dilution, discovered by Lo and Popescu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83(7):1459--1462, 1999], requires a number of bits to be exchanged which is of the order of the square root of the number of EPR pairs. Here we prove a matching lower bound of the same asymptotic order, demonstrating the optimality of the Lo-Popescu protocol up to a constant factor and establishing the existence of a fundamental asymmetry between the concentration and dilution tasks. We also discuss states for which the minimal communication cost is proportional to their entanglement, such as the states recently introduced in the context of ``embezzling entanglement'' [W. van Dam and P. Hayden, quant-ph/0201041].

abstract: In this article we establish new bounds on the quantum communication complexity of distributed problems. Specifically, we consider the amount of communication that is required to transform a bipartite state into another, typically more entangled, state. We obtain lower bounds in this setting by studying the Renyi entropy of the marginal density matrices of the distributed system. The communication bounds on quantum state transformations also imply lower bounds for the model of communication complexity where the task consists of the the distributed evaluation of a function f(x,y). Our approach encapsulates several known lower bound methods that use the log-rank or the von Neumann entropy of the density matrices involved. The technique is also effective for proving lower bounds on problems involving a promise or for which the "hard" distributions of inputs are correlated. As examples, we show how to prove a nearly tight bound on the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of the inner product function in the presence of unlimited amounts of EPR-type entanglement and a similarly strong bound on the complexity of the shifted quadratic character problem.

abstract: We consider the description of two independent quantum systems by a complete atomistic ortho-lattice (cao-lattice) L. It is known that since the two systems are independent, no Hilbert space description is possible, i.e. $L\ne P(H)$, the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space (theorem 1). We impose five conditions on L. Four of them are shown to be physically necessary. The last one relates the orthogonality between states in each system to the ortho-complementation of L. It can be justified if one assumes that the orthogonality between states in the total system induces the ortho-complementation of L. We prove that if L satisfies these five conditions, then L is the separated product proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe independent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we give strong arguments to exclude the separated product and therefore our last condition. As a consequence, we ask whether among the ca-lattices that satisfy our first four basic necessary conditions, there exists an ortho-complemented one different from the separated product.

abstract: Entanglement concentration requires no classical communication, but the best prior art result for diluting to N copies of a partially entangled state requires an amount of communication on the order of sqrt(N) bits. Our main result is to prove this prior art result optimal up to a constant factor; any procedure for creating N partially entangled states from singlets requires Omega(sqrt(N)) bits of classical communication. Previously not even a constant bound was known for approximate entanglement transforms. We also prove a lower bound on the inefficiency of the process: to dilute singlets to N copies of a partially entangled state, the entropy of entanglement must decrease by Omega(sqrt(N)).

abstract: We develop a multimode theory of direct homodyne measurements of quantum optical quasidistribution functions. We demonstrate that unbalanced homodyning with appropriately shaped auxiliary coherent fields allows one to sample point-by-point different phase space representations of the electromagnetic field. Our analysis includes practical factors that are likely to affect the outcome of a realistic experiment, such as non-unit detection efficiency, imperfect mode matching, and dark counts. We apply the developed theory to discuss feasibility of observing a loophole-free violation of Bell's inequalities by measuring joint two-mode quasidistribution functions under locality conditions by photon counting. We determine the range of parameters of the experimental setup that enable violation of Bell's inequalities for two states exhibiting entanglement in the Fock basis: a one-photon Fock state divided by a 50:50 beam splitter, and a two-mode squeezed vacuum state produced in the process of non-degenerate parametric down-conversion.

abstract: Causal quantum theory is an umbrella term for ordinary quantum theory modified by two hypotheses: state vector reduction is a well-defined process, and strict local causality applies. The first of these holds in some versions of Copenhagen quantum theory and need not necessarily imply practically testable deviations from ordinary quantum theory. The second implies that measurement events which are spacelike separated have no non-local correlations. To test this prediction, which sharply differs from standard quantum theory, requires a precise theory of state vector reduction. Formally speaking, any precise version of causal quantum theory defines a local hidden variable theory. However, causal quantum theory is most naturally seen as a variant of standard quantum theory. For that reason it seems a more serious rival to standard quantum theory than local hidden variable models relying on the locality or detector efficiency loopholes. Some plausible versions of causal quantum theory are not refuted by any Bell experiments to date, nor is it obvious that they are inconsistent with other experiments. They evade refutation via a neglected loophole in Bell experiments -- the {\it collapse locality loophole} -- which exists because of the possible time lag between a particle entering a measuring device and a collapse taking place. Fairly definitive tests of causal versus standard quantum theory could be made by observing entangled particles separated by $\approx 0.1$ light seconds.

abstract: A continuous-variable analog of the Deutsch's distillation protocol locally operating with two copies of the same Gaussian state is suggested. Irrespectively of the impossibility of Gaussian state distillation, we reveal that this protocol is able to perform a squeezing concentration of the Gaussian states with {\em unknown} displacement. Since this operation cannot be implemented using only single copy of the state, it is a new application of the distillation protocol which utilizes two copies of the same Gaussian state.

abstract: Quantum theory is compatible with special relativity. In particular, though measurements on entangled systems are correlated in a way that cannot be reproduced by local hidden variables, they cannot be used for superluminal signalling. As Czachor, Gisin and Polchinski pointed out, this is not true for general nonlinear modifications of the Schroedinger equation. Excluding superluminal signalling has thus been taken to rule out most nonlinear versions of quantum theory. The no superluminal signalling constraint has also been used for alternative derivations of the optimal fidelities attainable for imperfect quantum cloning and other operations. These results apply to theories satisfying the rule that their predictions for widely separated and slowly moving entangled systems can be approximated by non-relativistic equations of motion with respect to a preferred time coordinate. This paper describes a natural way in which this rule might fail to hold. In particular, it is shown that quantum readout devices which display the values of localised pure states need not allow superluminal signalling, provided that the devices display the values of the states of entangled subsystems as defined in a non-standard, but natural, way. It follows that any locally defined nonlinear evolution of pure states can be made consistent with Minkowski causality.

The consequences of this extension of the theory are outlined and predictions are made which may be verified in laboratories.

abstract: Quantum cryptography with the predetermined key was experimentally realized using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) correlations of continuously bright optical beams. Only one of two EPR correlated beams is transmitted with the signals modulated on quadrature phases and amplitudes, and the other one is retained by the authorized receiver. The modulated small signals are totally submerged in the large quantum noise of the signal beam, therefore nobody except the authorized receiver can decode the signals. Usability of imperfect quantum correlation, high transmission and detection efficiencies, and security provided by quantum mechanics are the favorable features of the presented scheme.

abstract: We propose a procedure based on phase equivalent chains of Darboux transformations to generate local potentials satisfying the radial Schr\"odinger equation and sharing the same scattering data. For potentials related by a chain of transformations an analytic expression is derived for the Jost function. It is shown how the same system of $S$-matrix poles can be differently distributed between poles and zeros of a Jost function which corresponds to different potentials with equal phase shifts. The concept of shallow and deep phase equivalent potentials is analyzed in connection with distinct distributions of poles. It is shown that phase equivalent chains do not violate the Levinson theorem. The method is applied to derive a shallow and a family of deep phase equivalent potentials describing the $^1S_0$ partial wave of the nucleon-nucleon scattering.

Our experiment scheme can be generalized to the case that environment is composed of multiple qubits.

abstract: A quantum linear Boltzmann equation is proposed, constructed in terms of the operator-valued dynamic structure factor of the macroscopic system the test particle is interacting with. Due to this operator structure it is a non-Abelian linear Boltzmann equation and when expressed through the Wigner function it allows for a direct comparison with the classical one. Considering a Brownian particle the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is obtained in a most direct way taking the limit of small energy and momentum transfer. A typically quantum correction to the Kramers equation thus appears, describing diffusion in position and further implying a correction to Einstein's diffusion coefficient in the high temperature and friction limit in which Smoluchowski equation emerges.

I generalize this model by introducing a parameter playing the role of an effective temperature. The corresponding thermodynamics provides criteria to tune the efficiency of quantum pattern recognition. I show that the associative memory undergoes a phase transition from a disordered high-temperature phase with no correlation between input and output to an ordered, low-temperature phase with minimal input-output Hamming distance.

abstract: We provide a method for checking indistinguishability of a set of multipartite orthogonal states by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). It bases on the principle of nonincreasing of entanglement under LOCC. This method originates from the one introduced by Ghosh \emph{et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{87}, 5807 (2001) (quant-ph/0106148)), though we deal with {\emph pure} states. In the bipartite case, our method is operational, although we do not know whether it can always detect local indistinguishability. We apply our method to show that an arbitrary complete multipartite orthogonal basis is indistinguishable if it contains at least one entangled state. We also show that probabilistic distinguishing is possible for full basis if and only if all vectors are product. We employ our method to prove local indistinguishability in a very interesting example akin to "nonlocality without entanglement".

abstract: Topological features in quantum computing provide controllability and noise error avoidance in the performance of logical gates. While such resilience is favored in the manipulation of quantum systems, it is very hard to identify topological features in nature. This paper proposes a scheme where holonomic quantum gates have intrinsic topological features. An ion trap is employed where the vibrational modes of the ions are coherently manipulated with lasers in an adiabatic cyclic way producing geometrical holonomic gates. A crucial ingredient of the manipulation procedures is squeezing of the vibrational modes, which effectively suppresses exponentially any undesired fluctuations of the laser amplitudes, thus making the gates resilient to control errors.

It is shown that with the use of an $Sp(2,R)$ unitary representation commuting with the SU(3) representation, the infinity of occurrences of each SU(3) irreducible representation can be handled in complete detail. A natural `generating representation' for SU(3), containing each irreducible representation exactly once, is identified within a subspace of the Schwinger construction; and this is shown to be equivalent to an induced representation of SU(3).

Both SU(3) standard coherent states, based on choice of highest weight vector as fiducial vector, and certain other specific systems of generalised coherent states, are found to be relevant. A complete analysis is presented, covering all the oscillator coherent states without exception, and amounting to SU(3) harmonic analysis of these states.

abstract: In a close form without referring the time-dependent Hamiltonian to the total system, a consistent approach for quantum measurement is proposed based on Zurek's triple model of quantum decoherence [W.Zurek, Phys. Rev. D 24, 1516 (1981)]. An exactly-solvable model based on the intracavity system is dealt with in details to demonstrate the central idea in our approach: by peeling off one collective variable of the measuring apparatus from its many degrees of freedom, as the pointer of the apparatus, the collective variable de-couples with the internal environment formed by the effective internal variables, but still interacts with the measured system to form a triple entanglement among the measured system, the pointer and the internal environment. As another mechanism to cause decoherence, the uncertainty of relative phase and its many-particle amplification can be summed up to an ideal entanglement or an Shmidt decomposition with respect to the preferred basis.

These binary measurements are related to the intermediate states known from eavesdropping in quantum cryptography. The maximum violation by $\sqrt{N}$ is reached for the maximally entangled state. Moreover, for N=2 it coincides with the familiar CHSH-inequality.

The model is valid for general electromagnetic interaction as well as many body systems with mutual interactions of general nature.

We find a positive energy density of the electromagnetic field which diverges at the interface despite the inclusion of dispersion in the calculation. We also investigate the mean squared fields and the energy density in the vacuum region between two parallel half-spaces. Of particular interest is the sign of the energy density. We find that the energy density is described by two terms: a negative position independent (Casimir) term, and a positive position dependent term with a minimum value at the center of the vacuum region. We argue that in some cases, including physically realizable ones, the negative term can dominate in a given region between the two half-spaces, so the overall energy density can be negative in this region.

abstract: The quantization of the scalar and electromagnetic fields in the presence of a parabolic mirror is further developed in the context of a geometric optics approximation. We extend results in a previous paper to more general geometries, and also correct an error in one section of that paper. We calculate the mean squared scalar and electric fields near the focal line of a parabolic cylindrical mirror. These quantities are found to grow as inverse powers of the distance from the focus. We give a combination of analytic and numerical results for the mean squared fields. In particular, we find that the mean squared electric field can be either negative or positive, depending upon the choice of parameters. The case of a negative mean squared electric field corresponds to a repulsive Van der Waals force on an atom near the focus, and to a region of negative energy density. Similarly, a positive value corresponds to an attractive force and a possibility of atom trapping in the vicinity of the focus.

In particular, it is not required that this transmission is larger than 50 %. Though squeezing or entanglement may be helpful, they are not required, and there is no need for quantum memories or entanglement purification. These protocols can thus be implemented using coherent states and homodyne detection, and they may be more efficient than usual protocols using quantum discrete variables.

abstract: We consider environment induced decoherence of quantum superpositions to mixtures in the limit in which that process is much faster than any competing one generated by the Hamiltonian $H_{\rm sys}$ of the isolated system. This interaction dominated decoherence limit has previously not found much attention even though it is of importance for the emergence of classical behavior in the macroworld, since it will always be the relevant regime for large enough separations between superposed wave packets. The usual golden-rule treatment then does not apply but we can employ a short-time expansion for the free motion while keeping the interaction $H_{\rm int}$ in full. We thus reveal decoherence as a universal short-time phenomenon largely independent of the character of the system as well as the bath. Simple analytical expressions for the decoherence time scales are obtained in the limit in which decoherence is even faster than any timescale emerging from the reservoir Hamiltonian $H_{\rm res}$.

abstract: The question of efficient multimode description of optical pulses is studied. We show that a relatively very small number of nonmonochromatic modes can be sufficient for a complete quantum description of pulses with Gaussian quadrature statistics. For example, a three-mode description was enough to reproduce the experimental data of photon number correlations in optical solitons [S. Spalter et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 786 (1998)]. This approach is very useful for a detailed understanding of squeezing properties of soliton pulses with the main potential for quantum communication with continuous variables. We show how homodyne detection and/or measurements of photon number correlations can be used to determine the quantum state of the multi-mode field. We also discuss a possible way of physical separation of the nonmonochromatic modes.

abstract: A structure of generator of a quantum dynamical semigroup for the dynamics of a test particle interacting through collisions with the environment is considered, which has been obtained from a microphysical model. The related master-equation is shown to go over to a Fokker-Planck equation for the description of Brownian motion at quantum level in the long wavelength limit. The structure of this Fokker-Planck equation is expressed in this paper in terms of superoperators, giving explicit expressions for the coefficient of diffusion in momentum in correspondence with two cases of interest for the interaction potential. This Fokker-Planck equation gives an example of a physically motivated generator of quantum dynamical semigroup, which serves as a starting point for the theory of measurement continuous in time, allowing for the introduction of trajectories in quantum mechanics. This theory had in fact already been applied to the problem of Brownian motion referring to similar phenomenological structures obtained only on the basis of mathematical requirements.

abstract: In the previous paper (quant-ph/0204037) we proved that the quantum mechanics not only has statistic interpretation, but also the specific electromagnetic form. Here, from this point of view we show that all the formal particularities of Dirac's equation have also the known electromagnetic sense.

abstract: The separation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a Markovian and an interference term provides a new insight in the quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems. The competition between these two terms determines the localized or diffusive character of the dynamics. In the case of the Kicked Rotor, we show how the constrained maximization of the entropy implies exponential localization.

abstract: We discuss some systematic methods for implementing state manipulations in systems formally similar to chains of a few spins with nearest-neighbor interactions, arranged such that there are strong and weak scales of coupling links. States are permuted by means of bias potentials applied to a few selected sites. This generic structure is then related to an atoms-in-a-cavity model that has been proposed in the literature as a way of achieving a decoherence free subspace. A new method using adiabatically varying laser detuning to implement a CNOT gate in this model is proposed.

abstract: Dirac's quantization of the Maxwell theory on non-commutative spaces has been considered. First class constraints were found which are the same as in classical electrodynamics. The gauge covariant quantization of the non-linear equations of electromagnetic fields on non-commutative spaces were studied. We have found the extended Hamiltonian which leads to equations of motion in the most general gauge covariant form. As a special case, the gauge fixing approach on the basis of Dirac's brackets has been investigated. The problem of the construction of the wave function and physical observables have been discussed.

abstract: Within the framework of relativistic quantum theory, we consider the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) gedanken-experiment in which measurements of the spin are performed by moving observers. We find that the perfect anti-correlation in the same direction between the EPR pair no longer holds in the observers' frame. This does not imply a breakdown of the non-local correlation. We explicitly show that the observers must measure the spin in appropriately chosen different directions in order to observe the perfect anti-correlation. This fact should be taken into account in utilizing the entangled state in quantum communication by moving observers.

abstract: For quantum mechanics on a lattice the position (``particle number'') operator and the quasi-momentum (``phase'') operator obey canonical commutation relations (CCR) only on a dense set of the Hilbert space. We compare exact numerical results for a particle in simple potentials on the lattice with the expectations, when the CCR are assumed to be strictly obeyed. Only for sufficiently smooth eigenfunctions this leads to reasonable results. In the long time limit the use of the CCR can lead to a qualitativel wrong dynamics even if the initial state is in the dense set.

The main physical hypothesis, already contained in the literature, amounts to allowing some internal parameters of the system to evolve in a random fashion. This formalism may also be applicable to open quantum systems.

abstract: One of the main requirements in linear optics quantum computing is the ability to perform single-qubit operations that are controlled by classical information fed forward from the output of single photon detectors. These operations correspond to pre-determined combinations of phase corrections and bit-flips that are applied to the post-selected output modes of non-deterministic quantum logic devices. Corrections of this kind are required in order to obtain the correct logical output for certain detection events, and their use can increase the overall success probability of the devices. In this paper, we report on the experimental demonstration of the use of this type of feed-forward system to increase the probability of success of a simple non-deterministic quantum logic operation from approximately 1/4 to 1/2. This logic operation involves the use of one target qubit and one ancilla qubit which, in this experiment, are derived from a parametric down-conversion photon pair. Classical information describing the detection of the ancilla photon is fed-forward in real-time and used to alter the quantum state of the output photon. A fiber optic delay line is used to store the output photon until a polarization-dependent phase shift can be applied using a high speed Pockels cell.

abstract: For a special class of bipartite states we calculate explicitly the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement $E_R^\infty$ with respect to states having a positive partial transpose (PPT). This quantity is an upper bound to distillable entanglement. The states considered are invariant under rotations of the form $O\otimes O$, where $O$ is any orthogonal matrix. We show that in this case $E_R^\infty$ is equal to another upper bound on distillable entanglement, constructed by Rains. To perform these calculations, we have introduced a number of new results that are interesting in their own right: (i) the Rains bound is convex and continuous; (ii) under some weak assumption, the Rains bound is an upper bound to $E_R^\infty$; (iii) for states for which the relative entropy of entanglement $E_R$ is additive, the Rains bound is equal to $E_R$.

abstract: Quantum cryptographic key distribution (QKD) uses extremely faint light pulses to carry quantum information between two parties (Alice and Bob), allowing them to generate a shared, secret cryptographic key. Autocompensating QKD systems automatically and passively compensate for uncontrolled time dependent variations of the optical fiber properties by coding the information as a differential phase between orthogonally-polarized components of a light pulse sent on a round trip through the fiber, reflected at mid-course using a Faraday mirror. We have built a prototype system based on standard telecom technology that achieves a privacy-amplified bit generation rate of ~1000 bits/s over a 10-km optical fiber link. Quantum cryptography is an example of an application that, by using quantum states of individual particles to represent information, accomplishes a practical task that is impossible using classical means.

abstract: A sequence of single photons is emitted on demand from a single three-level atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity. The photons are generated by an adiabatically driven stimulated Raman transition between two atomic ground states, with the vacuum field of the cavity stimulating one branch of the transition, and laser pulses deterministically driving the other branch. This process is unitary and therefore intrinsically reversible, which is essential for quantum communication and networking, and the photons should be appropriate for all-optical quantum information processing.

abstract: Working withing the framework of Hopf algebras, a random walk and the associated diffusion equation are constructed on a space that is algebraically described as the merging of the real line algebra with the anyonic line algebra. Technically this merged structure is a smash algebra, namely an algebra resulting by a braided tensoring of real with anyonic line algebras. The motivation of introducing the smashing results from the necessity of having non commuting increments in the random walk. Based on the observable-state duality provided by the underlying Hopf structure, the construction is cast into two dual forms: one using functionals determined by density probability functions and the other using the associated Markov transition operator. The ensuing diffusion equation is shown to possess triangular matrix realization. The study is completed by the incorporation of Hamiltonian dynamics in the above random walk model, and by the construction of the dynamical equation obeyed by statistical moments of the problem for generic entangled density functions.

Finally, we describe how to directly measure the Wigner function in a given phase space point by means of a tomographic method that, itself, can be interpreted as a simple quantum algorithm.

For this purpose we define a discrete Wigner function which is a minor variation of previously existing ones. This function is useful to represent composite quantum system in phase space and to analyze situations where entanglement between subsystems is relevant (dimensionality of the space of states of each subsystem is arbitrary). We also describe how a direct tomographic measurement of this Wigner function can be performed.

Employing this form, we discuss the relative entropy of entanglement of Schmidt correlated states. Also, we calculate the distillable entanglement of a class of mixed states.

abstract: It is well known that (non-orthogonal) pure states cannot be cloned so one may ask: how much or what kind of additional (quantum) information is needed to supplement one copy of a quantum state in order to be able to produce two copies of that state by a physical operation? For classical information, no supplementary information is required. However for pure quantum (non-orthogonal) states, we show that the supplementary information must always be as large as it can possibly be i.e. the clone must be able to be generated from the additional information alone, independently of the first (given) copy.

abstract: The formula for the correlation function of spin measurements of two particles in two moving inertial frames is derived within Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanics formulated in the absolute synchronization framework. The results are the first exact Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation functions obtained for Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical system in moving frames under physically acceptable conditions, i.e., taking into account the localization of the particles during the detection and using the spin opeartor with proper transformation properties under the action of the Lorentz group. Some special cases and approximations of the calculated correlation function are given. The resulting correlation function can be used as a basis for a proposal of a decisive experiment for a possible existence of a quantum-mechanical preferred frame.

abstract: The primary resource for quantum computation is Hilbert-space dimension. Whereas Hilbert space itself is an abstract construction, the number of dimensions available to a system is a physical quantity that requires physical resources. Avoiding a demand for an exponential amount of these resources places a fundamental constraint on the systems that are suitable for scalable quantum computation. To be scalable, the effective number of degrees of freedom in the computer must grow nearly linearly with the number of qubits in an equivalent qubit-based quantum computer.

abstract: For finite-dimensional bipartite quantum systems, we find the exact size of the largest balls, in spectral $l_p$ norms for $1 \le p \le \infty$, of separable (unentangled) matrices around the identity matrix. This implies a simple and intutively meaningful geometrical sufficient condition for separability of bipartite density matrices: that their purity $\tr \rho^2$ not be too large. Theoretical and experimental applications of these results include algorithmic problems such as computing whether or not a state is entangled, and practical ones such as obtaining information about the existence or nature of entanglement in states reached by NMR quantum computation implementations or other experimental situations.

A number of typical methods of finding solutions of the equation are proposed.

abstract: Geometric phases are well known in classical electromagnetism and quantum mechanics since the early works of Pantcharatnam and Berry. Their origin relies on the geometric nature of state spaces and has been studied in many different systems such as spins, polarized light and atomic physics. Recent works have explored their application in interferometry and quantum computation. Earlier works suggest how to observe these phases in single quantum systems adiabatically driven by external classical devices or sources, where, by classical, we mean any system whose state does not change considerably during the interaction time: an intense magnetic field interacting with a spin 1/2, or a birefringent medium interacting with polarized light. Here we propose a feasible experiment to investigate quantum effects in these phases, arising when this classical source drives not a single quantum system, but two interacting ones. In particular, we show how to observe a signature of field quantization through a vacuum effect in Berry's phase. To do so, we describe the interaction of an atom and a quantized cavity mode altogether driven by an external quasi-classical field.

We prove experimentally the feasibility of this scheme by performing a Franson-type Bell test using a 2-way interferometer with path-length difference equal to the distance between 2 pump pulses. With this experiment, we can demonstrate entanglement for a two-photon state of at least dimension D=11. Finally, we propose a feasible experiment to show a Fabry-Perot like effect for a high dimensional two-photon state.

Although the system has two lower states, quantum interference is possible because there are interfering pathways to each of the two lower states. The additional interference terms allow for interesting effects such as the suppression of a dark state which is present without the interference. Finally we examine a narrow spectral feature in the resonance fluorescence of the atom with quantum interference.

abstract: A recent Letter by Hess and Philipp claims that Bell's theorem neglects the possibility of time-like dependence in local hidden variables, hence is not conclusive. Moreover the authors claim that they have constructed, in an earlier paper, a local realistic model of the EPR correlations. However, they themselves have neglected the experimenter's freedom to choose settings, while on the other hand, Bell's theorem can be formulated to cope with time-like dependence. This in itself proves that their toy model cannot satisfy local realism, but we also indicate where their proof of its local realistic nature fails.

abstract: Cavity-mediated cooling of the center--of--mass motion of a transversally, coherently pumped atom along the axis of a high--Q cavity is studied. The internal dynamics of the atomic dipole strongly coupled to the cavity field is treated by a non-perturbative quantum mechanical model, while the effect of the cavity on the external motion is described classically in terms of the analytically obtained linear friction and diffusion coefficients. Efficient cavity-induced damping is found which leads to steady-state temperatures well-below the Doppler limit. We reveal a mathematical symmetry between the results here and for a similar system where, instead of the atom, the cavity field is pumped. The cooling process is strongly enhanced in a degenerate multimode cavity. Both the temperature and the number of scattered photons during the characteristic cooling time exhibits a significant reduction with increasing number of modes involved in the dynamics. The residual number of spontaneous emissions in a cooling time for large mode degeneracy can reach and even drop below the limit of a single photon.

abstract: We propose a novel scheme to implement a quantum controlled phase gate for trapped ions in thermal motion with one standing wave laser pulse. Instead of applying the rotating wave approximation this scheme makes use of the counter-rotating terms of operators. We also demonstrate that the same scheme can be used to generate maximally entangled states of $N$ trapped ions by a single laser pulse.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The information carrying capacity of the d-dimensional depolarizing channel is computed. It is shown that this capacity can be achieved by encoding messages as products of pure states belonging to an orthonormal basis of the state space, and using measurements which are products of projections onto this same orthonormal basis. In other words, neither entangled signal states nor entangled measurements give any advantage for information capacity. The result follows from an additivity theorem for the capacity of the product of the depolarizing channel with an arbitrary channel. We establish the Amosov-Holevo-Werner p-norm conjecture for this product channel for all p >= 1, and deduce from this the additivity of the minimal entropy and of the Holevo quantity.

abstract: We introduce a simple model for electromagnetically induced transparency in which all fields are treated quantum mechanically. We study a system of three separated atoms at fixed positions in a one-dimensional multimode optical cavity. The first atom serves as the source for a single spontaneously emitted photon; the photon scatters from a three-level Lambda-configuration atom which interacts with a single-mode field coupling two of the atomic levels; the third atom serves as a detector of the total transmitted field. We find an analytical solution for the quantum dynamics. From the quantum amplitude describing the excitation of the detector atom we extract information that provides exact single-photon analogs to wave delays predicted by semi-classical theories. We also find complementary information in the expectation value of the electric field intensity operator.

abstract: Spins based in silicon provide one of the most promising architectures for quantum computing. Quantum dots are an inherently scalable technology. Here, we combine these two concepts into a workable design for a silicon-germanium quantum bit. The novel structure incorporates vertical and lateral tunneling, provides controlled coupling between dots, and enables single electron occupation of each dot. Precise modeling of the design elucidates its potential for scalable quantum computing. For the first time it is possible to translate the requirements of fault-tolerant error correction into specific requirements for gate voltage control electronics in quantum dots. We demonstrate that these requirements are met by existing pulse generators in the kHz-MHz range, but GHz operation is not yet achievable. Our calculations further pinpoint device features that enhance operation speed and robustness against leakage errors. We find that the component technologies for silicon quantum dot quantum computers are already in hand.

abstract: We discuss some properties of the generalized entropies, called Renyi entropies and their application to the case of continuous distributions. In particular it is shown that these measures of complexity can be divergent, however, their differences are free from these divergences thus enabling them to be good candidates for the description of the extension and the shape of continuous distributions. We apply this formalism to the projection of wave functions onto the coherent state basis, i.e. to the Husimi representation. We also show how the localization properties of the Husimi distribution on average can be reconstructed from its marginal distributions that are calculated in position and momentum space in the case when the phase space has no structure, i.e. no classical limit can be defined. Numerical simulations on a one dimensional disordered system corroborate our expectations.

abstract: We show that a dilute 2-species gas of Fermi-Dirac alkali-metal atoms in a periodic optical lattice may exhibit fractionization of particle number when the two components are coupled via a coherent electromagnetic field with a topologically nontrivial phase profile. This results in fractional eigenvalues of the spin operator with vanishing fluctuations. The fractional part can be accurately controlled by modifying the effective detuning of the electromagnetic field.

abstract: We propose creation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by loading an atomic BEC into an optical lattice and driving it into a Mott insulator (MI) with exactly two atoms per site. Molecules in a MI state are then created under well defined conditions by photoassociation with essentially unit efficiency. Finally, the MI is melted and a superfluid state of the molecules is created. We study the dynamics of this process and photoassociation of tightly trapped atoms.

abstract: We introduce simple qubit-encodings and logic gates which eliminate the need for certain difficult single-qubit operations in superconducting phase-qubits, while preserving universality. The simplest encoding uses two physical qubits per logical qubit. Two architectures for its implementation are proposed: one employing N physical qubits out of which N/2 are ancillas fixed in the |1> state, the other employing N/2+1 physical qubits, one of which is a bus qubit connected to all others. Details of a minimal set of universal encoded logic operations are given, together with recoupling schemes, that require nanosecond pulses. A generalization to codes with higher ratio of number of logical qubits per physical qubits is presented. Compatible decoherence and noise suppression strategies are also discussed.

abstract: We study a model of a photon mode dipole-coupled to a medium of two-level oscillators in a microcavity in the presence of dephasing processes introduced by coupling to external baths. Decoherence processes can be classified as pair-breaking or non-pair-breaking in analogy with magnetic or non-magnetic impurities in superconductors. In the absence of dephasing, the ground state of the model is a polariton condensate with a gap in the excitation spectrum. Increase of the pair-breaking parameter $\gamma$ reduces the gap, which becomes zero at a critical value $\gamma_{C1}$; for large $\gamma$, the conventional laser regime is obtained in a way that demonstrates its close analogy to a gapless superconductor. In contrast, weak non-pair-breaking processes have no qualitative effect on the condensate or the existence of a gap, although they lead to inhomogeneous broadening of the excitations.

abstract: In the first part of this thesis I study the intermediate regime between ordinary lasing and a BEC of exciton polaritons. I take into account the fermionic structure of polaritons, treating the excitons as two-level systems coupled to a single mode in a microcavity. I introduce decoherence and dissipation processes to this system. Employing many-body Green function techniques, similar to those used by Abrikosov and Gor'kov in their theory of gapless superconductivity, I provide a mathematical structure that unifies models of lasers with models of condensates. This allows me to study the stability of the polariton condensate with respect to decoherence processes and the crossover between the polariton condensate and the laser. I give detailed indications of a regime in which the condensate should be observed to guide experimental work and show how to distinguish the Bose condensate from a laser. The second part of this thesis is concerned with properties of excitons and modelling of excitonic lasing in quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires. I develop a very general numerical method of calculating the properties of wires with different shapes and materials. Using this method I study the properties of very wide range of T-shaped quantum wires.

For the specific example of a one-dimensional, harmonically trapped dilute Bose condensate, it is shown that the inequality gives an explicit upper bound for the Thomas-Fermi condensate size which may be tested in current experiments.

abstract: We have studied theoretically the basic operation of a quantum feedback loop designed to maintain a desired phase of quantum coherent oscillations in a single solid-state qubit. The degree of oscillations synchronization with external harmonic signal is calculated as a function of feedback strength, taking into account available bandwidth and coupling to environment. The feedback can efficiently suppress the dephasing of oscillations if the qubit coupling to the detector is stronger than coupling to environment.

abstract: We study shot noise for spin-polarized currents and entangled electron pairs in a four-probe (beam splitter) geometry with a local Rashba spin-orbit (s-o) interaction in the incoming leads. Within the scattering formalism we find that shot noise exhibits Rashba-induced oscillations with continuous bunching and antibunching. We show that entangled states and triplet states can be identified via their Rashba phase in noise measurements. For two-channel leads we find an additional spin rotation due to s-o induced interband coupling which provides enhanced spin control. We show that the s-o interaction determines the Fano factor which provides a direct way to measure the Rashba coupling constant via noise.

abstract: A causal set C can describe a discrete spacetime, but this discrete spacetime is not quantum, because C is endowed with Boolean logic, as it does not allow cycles. In a quasi-ordered set Q, cycles are allowed. In this paper, we consider a subset QC of a quasi-ordered set Q, whose elements are all the cycles. In QC, which is endowed with quantum logic, each cycle of maximal outdegree N in a node, is associated with N entangled qubits. Then QC describes a quantum computing spacetime. This structure, which is non-local and non-casual, can be understood as a proto-spacetime. Micro-causality and locality can be restored in the subset U of Q whose elements are unentangled qubits which we interpret as the states of quantum spacetime. The mapping of quantum spacetime into proto-spacetime is given by the action of the XOR gate. Moreover, a mapping is possible from the Boolean causal set into U by the action of the Hadamard gate. In particular, the causal order defined on the elements of U induces the causal evolution of spin networks.

abstract: Search for the mechanisms suppressing formation of Higgs field defects (e.g. domain walls) during the cosmological phase transitions is one of key problems in explanation of the observed large-scale uniformity of the space-time. One of the possible solutions can be based on accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. Namely, if a coherent quantum state of the Higgs field was formed in the course of its previous evolution, then reduction to the state with broken symmetry during the phase transition should be correlated even at the scales exceeding the local cosmological horizons. Detailed consideration of the simplest one-dimensional cosmological model with Z2 Higgs field demonstrates that, at certain parameters of the Lagrangian, EPR-correlations really result in a substantial suppression of spontaneous formation of the domain walls.

We compute the entanglement entropy and we find that the nonunitarity of the mapping, between the vacua in the flat and the curved frames, makes the entanglement very robust.

abstract: Calogero-Moser systems are classical and quantum integrable multi-particle dynamics defined for any root system $\Delta$. The {\em quantum} Calogero systems having $1/q^2$ potential and a confining $q^2$ potential and the Sutherland systems with $1/\sin^2q$ potentials have "integer" energy spectra characterised by the root system $\Delta$. Various quantities of the corresponding {\em classical} systems, {\em e.g.} minimum energy, frequencies of small oscillations, the eigenvalues of the classical Lax pair matrices, etc. at the equilibrium point of the potential are investigated analytically as well as numerically for all root systems. To our surprise, most of these classical data are also "integers", or they appear to be "quantised". To be more precise, these quantities are polynomials of the coupling constant(s) with integer coefficients. The close relationship between quantum and classical integrability in Calogero-Moser systems deserves fuller analytical treatment, which would lead to better understanding of these systems and of integrable systems in general.

abstract: The hypothesis of brane-embedded matter appears to gain increasing credibility in astrophysics. However, it can only be truly successful if its implications on particle interaction are consistent with existing knowledge. This letter focuses on the issue of optical interference, and shows that at least one brane-world model can offer plausible interpretations for both Young's double-slit experiment, and the experiments that fit less neatly with it. The basic assumption is that particles can interact at a distance through the vibrations induced by their motion on the brane. The qualitative analysis of this mechanism suggests that fringe visibility in single photon interference depends on the energy levels and the interval between interacting particles. A double-slit experiment, performed with coherent single red photons should reveal the disappearance of interference when the time delay between individual particles is increased over 2.18 seconds. In the case of infrared photons with the frequency of $9\cdot 10^{13}$ Hz, interference must vanish already at the interval of one second.

We show that the adiabaticity is minimally broken in the sense that a gaussian wave-packet at the past infinity evolves to coherent states, however slowly the potential changes, its coherence factor is order of the coupling. We also show that the dynamics are governed by an equation of motion similar to the Kepler motion which satisfies the angular momentum conservation.

A brief discussion of the geometric structure of our star-product completes our work.

abstract: Looking for a quantum-mechanical implementation of duality, we formulate a relation between coherent states and complex-differentiable structures on classical phase space ${\cal C}$. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of locally-defined coherent states is the existence of an almost complex structure on ${\cal C}$. A necessary and sufficient condition for globally-defined coherent states is a complex structure on ${\cal C}$. The picture of quantum mechanics that emerges is conceptually close to that of a geometric manifold covered by local coordinate charts. Instead of the latter, quantum mechanics has local coherent states. A change of coordinates on ${\cal C}$ may or may not be holomorphic. Correspondingly, a transformation between quantum-mechanical states may or may not preserve coherence. Those that do not preserve coherence are duality transformations. A duality appears as the possibility of giving two or more, apparently different, descriptions of the same quantum-mechanical phenomenon. Coherence becomes a local property on classical phase space. Observers on ${\cal C}$ not connected by means of a holomorphic change of coordinates need not, and in general will not, agree on what is a semiclassical effect vs. what is a strong quantum effect

abstract: A class of spectral problems with a hidden Lie-algebraic structure is considered. We define a duality transformation which maps the spectrum of one quasi-exactly solvable (QES) periodic potential to that of another QES periodic potential. The self-dual point of this transformation corresponds to the energy-reflection symmetry found previously for certain QES systems. The duality transformation interchanges bands at the bottom (top) of the spectrum of one potential with gaps at the top (bottom) of the spectrum of the other, dual, potential. Thus, the duality transformation provides an exact mapping between the weak coupling (perturbative) and semiclassical (nonperturbative) sectors.

abstract: The assignment of local observables in the vacuum sector, fulfilling the standard axioms of local quantum theory, is known to determine uniquely a compact group G of gauge transformations of the first kind together with a central involutive element k of G, and a complete normal algebra of fields carrying the localizable charges, on which k defines the Bose/Fermi grading. We show here that any such pair {G,k}, where G is compact metrizable, does actually appear. The corresponding model can be chosen to fulfill also the split property. This is not a dynamical phenomenon: a given {G,k} arises as the gauge group of a model where the local algebras of observables are a suitable subnet of local algebras of a possibly infinite product of free field theories.

We use this result to give the explicit form of a linear Hermitian invertible operator with respect to which any standard PT-symmetric Hamiltonian with a real degree of freedom is pseudo-Hermitian. Our results do not make use of the assumption that H is diagonalizable or that its spectrum is discrete.

abstract: We propose a new approach based on the algebraization of the Associated Lam\'{e} equation \[-\psi''(x) + [ m(m+1)k^{2}sn^{2}x + \ell(\ell+1)k^{2}(cn^{2}x/dn^{2}x)]\psi(x) = E\psi(x)\] within sl(2,R) to derive the corresponding periodic potentials. The band edge eigenfunctions and energy spectra are explicitly obtained for integers m,$\ell$. We also obtain the explicit expressions of the solutions for half-integer m and integer or half-integer $\ell$.

abstract: Exact positive and negative energy solutions for the eigenvalue problem of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in one dimension with a $\delta^\prime$ interaction are found and analyzed. An infinite series of transparency resonance levels in the strength of this interaction is shown to exist. This result is against the actual belief that the $\delta^\prime$ potential acts as a totally reflecting wall. A finite number of bound states is obtained, contrary to the previous result on the existence of only one bound state. A new effect of a {\it negative stepwise} drop in the electron density across the $\delta^\prime$ junction is observed. The solutions are also applied to the propagation of the electromagnetic field in dielectric media.

abstract: We give an introduction to some of the numerical aspects in quantum chaos. The classical dynamics of two--dimensional area--preserving maps on the torus is illustrated using the standard map and a perturbed cat map. The quantization of area--preserving maps given by their generating function is discussed and for the computation of the eigenvalues a computer program in Python is presented. We illustrate the eigenvalue distribution for two types of perturbed cat maps, one leading to COE and the other to CUE statistics. For the eigenfunctions of quantum maps we study the distribution of the eigenvectors and compare them with the corresponding random matrix distributions. The Husimi representation allows for a direct comparison of the localization of the eigenstates in phase space with the corresponding classical structures. Examples for a perturbed cat map and the standard map with different parameters are shown. Billiard systems and the corresponding quantum billiards are another important class of systems (which are also relevant to applications, for example in mesoscopic physics). We provide a detailed exposition of the boundary integral method, which is one important method to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation. We discuss several methods to determine the eigenvalues from the Fredholm equation and illustrate them for the stadium billiard. The occurrence of spurious solutions is discussed in detail and illustrated for the circular billiard, the stadium billiard, and the annular sector billiard. We emphasize the role of the normal derivative function to compute the normalization of eigenfunctions, momentum representations or autocorrelation functions in a very efficient and direct way. Some examples for these quantities are given and discussed.

abstract: Except for ortho- and para-H2, very little is known about nuclear spin isomers (or spin modifications) of molecules. The main reason is the lack of practical enrichment techniques. Recently a few enrichment methods were developed, which opened up new possibilities in the field. These methods are briefly reviewed. Substantial progress in the field has been made by the introduction of Light-Induced Drift as a gas-phase separation tool. This is illustrated by extensive data on CH3F, which reveal that the gas-phase ortho-para conversion is governed by intramolecular mixing of the nuclear spin states. The role of ``direct'' ortho-para transitions is shown to be small. Various aspects of the conversion were investigated in detail: pressure and collision partner dependence, isotope effect, temperature dependence. The most decisive information on the spin conversion mechanism is derived from the observation of level-crossing resonances in an electric field and the Quantum Zeno effect induced by collisions.
