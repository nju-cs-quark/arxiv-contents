abstract: We report the experimental realization and the characterization of polarization and momentum hyperentangled two photon states, generated by a new parametric source of correlated photon pairs. By adoption of these states an "all versus nothing" test of quantum mechanics was performed. The two photon hyperentangled states are expected to find at an increasing rate a widespread application in state engineering and quantum information. PACS: 03.65.Ud, 03.67.Mn, 42.65. Lm
