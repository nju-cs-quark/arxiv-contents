abstract: We construct 3-D solutions of Maxwell's equations that describe Gaussian light beams focused by a strong lens. We investigate the interaction of such beams with single atoms in free space and the interplay between angular and quantum properties of the scattered radiation. We compare the exact results with those obtained with paraxial light beams and from a standard input-output formalism. We put our results in the context of quantum information processing with single atoms.

abstract: We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2^n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)^2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2^n, for which the best previous bound was O(n^2). As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP^BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size. Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).

abstract: Conventionally, one interprets the correlations observed in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments by Bell's inequalities and quantum nonlocality. We show, in this paper, that identical correlations arise, if the phase relations of electromagnetic fields are considered. In particular, we proceed from an analysis of a one-photon model. The correlation probability in this case contains a phase relation cos(b - a) between the two settings. In the two photon model the phases of the photon's electromagnetic fields are related at the origin. It is shown that this relation can be translated into a linearity requirement for electromagnetic fields between the two polarizers. Along these lines we compute the correlation integral with an expression conserving linearity. This expression, as shown, correctly describes the measured values. It seems thus that quantum nonlocality can be seen as a combination of boundary conditions on possible electromagnetic fields between the polarizers and a relation of the electromagnetic fields of the two photons via a phase. We expect the same feature to arise in every experiment, where joint probabilities of separate polarization measurements are determined.

abstract: Any method for estimating the ensemble average of arbitrary operator (observables or not, including the density matrix) relates the quantity of interest to a complete set of observables, i.e. a quorum}. This corresponds to an expansion on an irreducible set of operators in the Liouville space. We give two general characterizations of these sets. All the known unbiased reconstruction techniques, i.e. ``quantum tomographies'', can be described in this framework. New operatorial resolutions are given that can be used to implement novel reconstruction schemes.

abstract: A nondegenerate four-level N-type scheme was experimentally implemented to observe electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) at the $^{87}$Rb D$_{2}$ line. Radiations of two independent external-cavity semiconductor lasers were used in the experiment, the current of one of them being modulated at a frequency equal to the hyperfine-splitting frequency of the excited 5P$_{3/2}$ level. In this case, apart from the main EIT dip corresponding to the two-photon Raman resonance in a three-level $\Lambda$-scheme, additional dips detuned from the main dip by a frequency equal to the frequency of the HF generator were observed in the absorption spectrum. These dips were due to an increase in the medium transparency at frequencies corresponding to the three-photon Raman resonances in four-level N-type schemes. The resonance shapes are analyzed as functions of generator frequency and magnetic field.

authors: Paul B. Slater
comments: Sixteen pages, six postscript figures, we include an additional analysis (in sec. III D 3) for N = 2 copies of the 3-level quantum systems, leading us to conjecture that for (non-separable) optimal measurements of N copies of m-level quantum systems, the "Gill-Massar" trace converges downward in the pure state limit to (2N-1)(m-1), for all m and N, while (as Gill and Massar established) it can not exceed N(m-1) for separable measurements. This conjecture conforms with our previously obtained result of 2N -1, for m = 2 and N = 2,...7

abstract: We address the "major open problem" of evaluating how much increased efficiency in estimation is possible using non-separable, as opposed to separable, measurements of N copies of m-level quantum systems. First, we study the six cases m = 2, N = 2,...,7 by computing the the 3 x 3 Fisher information matrices for the corresponding optimal measurements recently devised by Vidal et al (quant-ph/9812068) for N = 2,...,7. We obtain simple polynomial expressions for the ("Gill-Massar") traces of the products of the inverse of the quantum Helstrom information matrix and these Fisher information matrices. The six traces all have minima of 2 N -1 in the pure state limit, while for separable measurements (quant-ph/9902063), the traces can equal N, but not exceed it. Then, the result of an analysis for m = 3, N = 2 leads us to conjecture that for optimal measurements for all m and N, the "Gill-Massar trace" achieves a minimum of (2N-1)(m-1) in the pure state limit.

abstract: Relativistic quantum field theory imposes additional fundamental restrictions on the distinguishability of quantum states. Because of the unavoidable delocalization of the quantum field states in the Minkowski space-time, the reliable (with unit probability) distinguishability of orthogonal states formally requires infinite time. For the cryptographic protocols which are finite in time the latter means that the effective ``noise'' is present even in the ideal communication channel because of the non-localizability of the quantum field states.

abstract: The upside-down simple harmonic oscillator system is studied in the contexts of quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics. It is shown that in order to study in a simple manner the creation and decay of a physical system by ways of Gamow vectors we must formulate the theory in a time-asymmetric fashion, namely using two different rigged Hilbert spaces to describe states evolving towards the past and the future. The spaces defined in the contexts of quantum and classical statistical mechanics are shown to be directly related by the Wigner function.

abstract: Consider any stationary Schroedinger wave equation (SWE) solution $psi (x)$ for a particle. The corresponding PDF on position QTR{em}{x} of the particle is QTR{em}{p}$_{X}(x)=|psi (x)|^{2}$. There is a classical trajectory QTR{em}{x(t)} for the particle that is consistent with this PDF. The trajectory is unique to within an additive constant corresponding to an initial condition QTR{em}{x(0).} However the value of QTR{em}{x(0)} cannot be known. As an example, a free particle in its ground state in a box of length QTR{em}{L} obeys a classical trajectory QTR{em}{x/L - (1/2}$pi)sin (2pi x/L)+t_{0}=t.$ The constant QTR{em}{t}$_{0}$ is an unknowable time displacement. Momentum values, however, cannot be determined by merely differentiating QTR{em}{d/dt} the trajectory QTR{em}{x(t)} and, instead, follow the usual quantification rules of Heisenberg's. This permits position and momentum to remain complementary variables. Our approach is fundamentally different from that of D. Bohm.

This motivates concepts of information extraction and disturbance which are distinct from those usually considered in quantum information theory. Using these concepts we identify an information trade-off in quantum feedback control.

abstract: Bell's Theorem was developed on the basis of considerations involving a linear combination of spin correlation functions, each of which has a distinct pair of arguments. The simultaneous presence of these different pairs of arguments in the same equation can be understood in two radically different ways: either as `strongly objective,' that is, all correlation functions pertain to the same set of particle pairs, or as `weakly objective,' that is, each correlation function pertains to a different set of particle pairs. It is demonstrated that once this meaning is determined, no discrepancy appears between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics: the discrepancy in Bell's Theorem is due only to a meaningless comparison between a local realistic inequality written within the strongly objective interpretation (thus relevant to a single set of particle pairs) and a quantum mechanical prediction derived from a weakly objective interpretation (thus relevant to several different sets of particle pairs).

abstract: Two recent experiments have reported the trapping of individual atoms inside optical resonators by the mechanical forces associated with single photons [Hood et al., Science 287, 1447 (2000) and Pinkse et al., Nature 404, 365 (2000)]. Here we analyze the trapping dynamics in these settings, focusing on two points of interest. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which light-induced forces in these experiments are distinct from their free-space counterparts. Secondly, we explore the quantitative features of the resulting atomic motion and how these dynamics are mapped onto variations of the intracavity field. Not surprisingly, qualitatively distinct atomic dynamics arise as the coupling and dissipative rates are varied. For the experiment of Hood et al., we show that atomic motion is largely conservative and is predominantly in radial orbits transverse to the cavity axis. A comparison with the free-space theory demonstrates that the fluctuations of the dipole force are suppressed by an order of magnitude. This effect is based upon the Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates of the atom-cavity system and represents qualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single-photon level. By contrast, even in a regime of strong coupling in the experiment of Pinkse et al., there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free-space theory and the quantum theory, so it is not clear that description of this experiment as a novel single-quantum trapping effect is necessary. The atomic motion is strongly diffusive, leading to an average localization time comparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity and to a reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the intracavity photon number.

abstract: We perform frequency analysis of the EPR-Bell argumentation. One of the main consequences of our investigation is that the existence of probability distributions of the Kolmogorov-type which was supposed by some authors is a mathematical assumption which may not be supported by actual physical quantum processes. In fact, frequencies for hidden variables for quantum particles and measurement devices may fluctuate from run to run of an experiment. These fluctuations of frequencies for micro-parameters need not contradict to the stabilization of frequencies for physical observables. If, nevertheless, micro-parameters are also statistically stable, then violations of Bell's inequality and its generalizations may be a consequence of dependence of collectives corresponding to two different measurement devices. Such a dependence implies the violation of the factorization rule for the simultaneous probability distribution. Formally this rule coincides with the well known BCHS locality condition (or outcome independence condition). However, the frequency approach implies totally different interpretation of dependence. It is not dependence of events, but it is dependence of collectives. Such a dependence may be induced by the same preparation procedure.

abstract: We present comparative probabilistic analysis of the Greenburger-Horne-Zeilinger paradox in the frameworks of Kolmogorov's (measure-theoretical) and von Mises' (frequency) models of the probability theory. This analysis demonstrated that the GHZ paradox is merely a consequence of the use of Kolmogorov's probabilistic model. By using von Mises' frequency approach we escape the contradiction between the local realism and quantum formalism. The frequency approach implies automatically contextual interpretation of quantum formalism: different collectives induce different probability distributions. On the other hand, the formal use of Kolmogorov's model implies the identification of such distributions with one abstract Kolmogorov measure. In the measure-theoretical approach we can escape the paradox, if we do not suppose that probability distributions corresponding to different settings of measurement devices are equivalent. We discuss the connection between equivalence/singularity dichotomy in measure theory and the existence of compatible and noncompatible observables.

abstract: A theoretical model of a quantum device which can factorize any number N in two steps i.e. by preparing an input state and performing a measurement is discussed. The analysis reveals that the duration of state preparation and measurement is proportional to N while the energy consumption grows like log N. These results suggest the existence of Heisenberg-type relation putting limits on the efficiency of a quantum computer in terms of a total computation time, a total energy consumption and a classical complexity of the problem.

Further, they are infinitely degenerate. For the first few eigenstates, we will find the stationary flows round a right angle that are expressed by the complex velocity potentials $W=\pm\gamma z^2/2$.

abstract: We consider a set of operators hat{x}=(hat{x}_1,..., hat{x}_N) with diagonal representatives P(n) in the space of generalized coherent states |n>; hat{x}=int dn P(n) |n><n|. We regularize the coherent-state path integral as a limit of a sequence of averages <.>_L over polygonal paths with L vertices {n_1...L}. The distribution of the path centroid bar{P}=(1/L) sum_{i=1}^{L}P(n_i) tends to the Wigner function W(x), the joint distribution for the operators: W(x)=lim_{L->infinity} <delta(x-bar{P})>_{L}. This result is proved in the case where the Hamiltonian commutes with hat{x}. The Wigner function is non-positive if the dominant paths with path centroid in a certain region have Berry phases close to odd multiples of pi. For finite L the path centroid distribution is a Wigner function convolved with a Gaussian of variance inversely proportional to L. The results are illustrated by numerical calculations of the spin Wigner function from SU(2) coherent states. The relevance to the quantum Monte Carlo sign problem is also discussed.

Thus, for a two-site two-setting experiment there are no quantum-mechanical predictions that violate local realism unless the efficiency is greater than 2/3. Secondly, there are n-site experiments for which the quantum-mechanical predictions violate local realism whenever the efficiency exceeds 1/2.

The inevitable experimental losses can be compensated by proper modification of the sampling functions. Results of Monte Carlo simulations for squeezed three-mode state are reported and the feasibility of reconstruction of the three-mode Q-function and s-ordered moments from 10^7 sampled data is demonstrated.

abstract: A general theory of the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field with atoms in the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies of given Kramers--Kronig consistent permittivities is developed. It is based on a source-quantity representation of the electromagnetic field, in which the electromagnetic-field operators are expressed in terms of a continuous set of fundamental bosonic fields via the Green tensor of the classical problem. Introducing scalar and vector potentials, the formalism is extended in order to include in the theory the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field with additional atoms. Both the minimal-coupling scheme and the multipolar-coupling scheme are considered. The theory replaces the standard concept of mode decomposition which fails for complex permittivities. It enables us to treat the effects of dispersion and absorption in a consistent way and to give a unified approach to the atom-field interaction, without any restriction to a particular interaction regime in a particular frequency range. All relevant information about the dielectric bodies such as form and intrinsic dispersion and absorption is contained in the Green tensor. The application of the theory to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom in the presence of dispersing and absorbing bodies is addressed.

Rev. A {\bf 59}, 4716 (1999)], we calculate the quantum state of the outgoing modes of a two-mode squeezed vacuum transmitted through optical fibers of given extinction coefficients. Using the Peres--Horodecki separability criterion for continuous variable systems [R.~Simon, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84}, 2726 (2000)], we compute the maximal length of transmission of a two-mode squeezed vacuum through an absorbing system for which the transmitted state is still inseparable. Further, we calculate the maximal gain for which inseparability can be observed in an amplifying setup. Finally, we estimate an upper bound of the entanglement preserved after transmission through an absorbing system. The results show that the characteristic length of entanglement degradation drastically decreases with increasing strength of squeezing.

abstract: A Bayesian approach is developed to determine quantum mechanical potentials from empirical data. Bayesian methods, combining empirical measurements and "a priori" information, provide flexible tools for such empirical learning problems. The paper presents the basic theory, concentrating in particular on measurements of particle coordinates in quantum mechanical systems at finite temperature. The computational feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by numerical case studies. Finally, it is shown how the approach can be generalized to such many-body and few-body systems for which a mean field description is appropriate. This is done by means of a Bayesian inverse Hartree-Fock approximation.

Our results suggest that the degree of nonlocality of these nonmaximally entangled continuous-variable states, represented by the maximum violation, grows with increasing number of parties. This growth does not appear to be exponentially large as for the maximally entangled qubit states, but rather decreases for larger numbers of parties.

abstract: We consider the use of arbitrary phases in quantum amplitude amplification which is a generalization of quantum searching. We prove that the phase condition in amplitude amplification is given by $\tan(\varphi/2) = \tan(\phi/2)(1-2a)$, where $\phi$ and $\phi$ are the phases used and where $a$ is the success probability of the given algorithm. Thus the choice of phases depends nontrivially and nonlinearly on the success probability. Utilizing this condition, we give methods for constructing quantum algorithms that succeed with certainty and for implementing arbitrary rotations. We also conclude that phase errors of order up to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}$ can be tolerated in amplitude amplification.

Here, we realized the one-to-two qubits Buzek-Hillery cloning machine with linear optical devices. This method relies on the representation of several qubits by a single photon. We showed that, the fidelities between the two output qubits and the original qubit are both 5/6 (which proved to be the optimal fidelity of one-to-two qubits universal cloner) for arbitrary input pure states.

abstract: In the information interpretation of quantum mechanics, information is the most fundamental, basic entity. Every quantized system is associated with a definite discrete amount of information (cf. Zeilinger). This information content remains constant at all times and is permutated one-to-one throughout the system evolution. What is interpreted as measurement is a particular type of information transfer over a fictitious interface. The concept of a many-to-one state reduction is not a fundamental one but results from the practical impossibility to reconstruct the original state after the measurement.

abstract: In this work we propose an approach to deal with radiation field states which incorporates damping effects at zero temperature. By using some well known results on dissipation of a cavity field state, obtained by standard ab-initio methods, it was possible to infer through a phenomenological way the explicit form for the evolution of the state vector for the whole system: the cavity-field plus reservoir. This proposal turns out to be of extreme convenience to account for the influence of the reservoir over the cavity field. To illustrate the universal applicability of our approach we consider the attenuation effects on cavity-field states engineering. A proposal to maximize the fidelity of the process is presented.

abstract: The time evolution of driven two-level systems in the far off-resonance regime is studied analytically. We obtain a general first-order perturbative expression for the time-dependent density operator which is applicable regardless of the coupling strength value. In the strong field regime, our perturbative expansion remains valid even when the far off-resonance condition is not fulfilled. We find that, in the absence of dissipation, driven two-level systems exhibit coherent population trapping in a certain region of parameter space, a property which, in the particular case of a symmetric double-well potential, implies the well-known localization of the system in one of the two wells. Finally, we show how the high-order harmonic generation that this kind of systems display can be obtained as a straightforward application of our formulation.

The main constructions are group analogs of the Hermite expansion, the Segal-Bargmann transform, and the Taylor expansion. The results are related to geometric quantization, to stochastic analysis, and to the quantization of 1+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.

The algorithm recovers the initial state of an ancillary register regardless of whether its state is pure or mixed. Thus we can use any qubits as an ancillary register even though they are entangled with others and are occupied by other computational process. We also show that our algorithm is optimal in the sense of the number of function evaluations.

abstract: Universal two-particle entanglement processes are analyzed in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces. On the basis of this analysis the class of possible optimal universal entanglement processes is determined whose resulting output states do not contain any separable states. It is shown that these processes form a one-parameter family. For all Hilbert space dimensions larger than two the resulting optimally entangled output states are mixtures of anti-symmetric states which are freely entangled and which also preserve information about input states. Within this one-parameter family there is only one process by which all information about any input state is destroyed completely.

These analytical results explain the dependence of the revival time on the characteristic parameters of the problem quantitatively in a simple way. They are in excellent agreement with numerical results.

It is shown that if the nonlinear response of the atoms is negligible and no additional atom-atom interactions are present, exchange interactions cannot produce entanglement between photons states in a process that returns the atoms to their initial state. Entanglement generation requires the presence of a nonlinear atomic response or atom-atom interactions.

We give an affirmative answer to this question by showing how to derive hidden-variable theorems that apply to real experiments, so that non-contextual hidden variables can indeed be experimentally disproved. The essential point is that for the derivation of hidden-variable theorems one does not have to know which observables are really measured by the apparatus. Predictions can be derived for observables that are defined in an entirely operational way.

abstract: Quantum teleportation uses prior entanglement and forward classical communication to transmit one instance of an unknown quantum state. Remote state preparation (RSP) has the same goal, but the sender knows classically what state is to be transmitted. We show that the asymptotic classical communication cost of RSP is one bit per qubit - half that of teleportation - and becomes even less when transmitting part of a known entangled state. We explore the tradeoff between entanglement and classical communication required for RSP, and discuss RSP capacities of general quantum channels.

abstract: We analyze various scenarios for entangling two initially unentangled qubits. In particular, we propose an optimal universal entangler which entangles a qubit in unknown state $|\Psi>$ with a qubit in a reference (known) state $|0>$. That is, our entangler generates the output state which is as close as possible to the pure (symmetrized) state $(|\Psi>|0> +|0>|\Psi>)$. The most attractive feature of this entangling machine, is that the fidelity of its performance (i.e. the distance between the output and the ideally entangled -- symmetrized state) does not depend on the input and takes the constant value $F= (9+3\sqrt{2})/14\simeq 0.946$. We also analyze how to optimally generate from a single qubit initially prepared in an unknown state $|\Psi\r$ a two qubit entangled system which is as close as possible to a Bell state $(|\Psi\r|\Psi^\perp\r+|\Psi^\perp\r|\Psi\r)$, where $\l\Psi|\Psi^\perp\r =0$.

abstract: It is not possible to disentangle a qubit in an unknown state $|\psi>$ from a set of (N-1) ancilla qubits prepared in a specific reference state $|0>$. That is, it is not possible to {\em perfectly} perform the transformation $(|\psi,0...,0\r +|0,\psi,...,0\r +...+ |0,0,...\psi\r) \to |0,...,0>\otimes |\psi>$. The question is then how well we can do? We consider a number of different methods of extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed from that qubit and a set of ancilla qubits in an known state. Measuring the whole system is, as expected, the least effective method. We present various quantum ``devices'' which disentangle the unknown qubit from the set of ancilla qubits. In particular, we present the optimal universal disentangler which disentangles the unknown qubit with the fidelity which does not depend on the state of the qubit, and a probabilistic disentangler which performs the perfect disentangling transformation, but with a probability less than one.

abstract: How much information about the original state preparation can be extracted from a quantum system which already has been measured? That is, how many independent (non-communicating) observers can measure the quantum system sequentially and give a nontrivial estimation of the original unknown state? We investigate these questions and we show from a simple example that quantum information is not entirely lost as a result of the measurement-induced collapse of the quantum state, and that an infinite number of independent observers who have no prior knowledge about the initial state can gain a partial information about the original preparation of the quantum system.

abstract: Entanglement shared between two seperated parties could not be increased without transmitting quantum system. We suggest the project to gain entanglement shared between Alice and Bob by transmitting quantum system and a nem scheme to achieve efficient rate of entanglement. It is proven that under any local operations and communicating classically, to transmit one qubit through an ideal or a noisy quantum channel can increase no more than one ebit between two parties. Furthermore, the prior nonmaximally transmitted entanglement could not be improved by subsequently transmitted qubit. Although our proof is given in the measure of formation of entanglement, we believe that the above conclusion is also hold independently of the measure of entanglement.

abstract: The buildup process of the probability density inside the quantum well of a double-barrier resonant structure is studied by considering the analytic solution of the time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the initial condition of a cutoff plane wave. For one level systems at resonance condition we show that the buildup of the probability density obeys a simple charging up law, $| \Psi (\tau) / \phi | =1-e^{-\tau /\tau_0},$ where $\phi$ is the stationary wave function and the transient time constant $\tau_0$ is exactly two lifetimes. We illustrate that the above formula holds both for symmetrical and asymmetrical potential profiles with typical parameters, and even for incidence at different resonance energies. Theoretical evidence of a crossover to non-exponential buildup is also discussed.

We first discuss a simple scheme based on two-level atoms inside a cavity to prepare the entangled state. We then discuss a scheme using four-level atoms, which requires a parameter regime much easier to access experimentally using current technology. As opposed to other schemes, our proposal relies on the presence of finite decay rates and its implementation should therefore be much less demanding.

The mixed state obtained has a permutational symmetry which is typical for a system of identical bosons.

We observe nonclassical interference in a singles rate, thanks to the intrinsic nonlinearity of photon counters. This is due to a dependence of the effective detection efficiency on the quantum statistics of the light beam. Such measurements of detector response to photon pairs promise to shed light on the microscopic aspects of silicon photodetectors, and on general issues of quantum measurement and decoherence.

The effect of the thermal cavity fields on the quantum decoherence of the superposition states of the exciton is studied and it is observed that the higher the temperature of the environment is, the shorter the decoherence characteristic time is.

abstract: A reference frame F is described by the element g of the Poincare' group P which connects F with a given fixed frame F_0. If F is a quantum frame, defined by a physical object following the laws of quantum physics, the parameters of g have to be considered as quantum observables. However, these observables are not compatible and some of them, namely the coordinates of the origin of F, cannot be represented by self-adjoint operators. Both these difficulties can be overcome by considering a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) on P, covariant with respect to the left translations of the group, namely a covariance system. We develop a construction procedure for this kind of mathematical structure. The formalism is also used to discuss the quantum observables measured with respect to a quantum reference frame.

abstract: The trade-off between the information gain and the state disturbance is derived for quantum operations on a single qubit prepared in a uniformly distributed pure state. The derivation is valid for a class of measures quantifying the state disturbance and the information gain which satisfy certain invariance conditions. This class includes in particular the Shannon entropy versus the operation fidelity. The central role in the derivation is played by efficient quantum operations, which leave the system in a pure output state for any measurement outcome. It is pointed out that the optimality of efficient quantum operations among those inducing a given operator-valued measure is related to Davies' characterization of convex invariant functions on hermitian operators.

abstract: An apparent paradox is resolved that concerns the existence of time operators which have been derived for the quantum harmonic oscillator. There is an apparent paradox because, although a time operator is canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian, it has been asserted that no operator exists that is canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian. In order to resolve the apparent paradox, we work in a representation where the phase operator is diagonal. The boundary condition on wave functions is such that they be periodic in the phase variable, which is related to the (continuous) eigenvalue of the time operator. Matrix elements of the commutator of the time operator with the Hamiltonian involve the phase variable itself in addition to periodic functions of the phase variable. The Hamiltonian is not hermitian when operating in space that includes the phase variable itself. The apparent paradox is resolved when this non-hermeticity is taken into account correctly in the evaluation of matrix elements of the commutation relation.

On one hand, the problems encountered at the frontiers of modern theoretical physics like Quantum Gravity, String Theories, etc. concern Quantum Theory, and are at the same time related to open problems of modern mathematics. But even within non-relativistic quantum mechanics itself there are fundamental unresolved problems that can be formulated in elementary terms. These problems are also related to challenging open questions of modern mathematics; linear algebra and functional analysis in particular. Two of these problems will be discussed in this article: a) the separability problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system does not contain any quantum correlations or entanglement and b) the distillability problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system can be transformed to an entangled pure state using local operations (local refers here to component subsystems of a given system). Although many results concerning the above mentioned problems have been obtained (in particular in the last few years in the framework of Quantum Information Theory), both problems remain until now essentially open. We will present a primer on the current state of knowledge concerning these problems, and discuss the relation of these problems to one of the most challenging questions of linear algebra: the classification and characterization of positive operator maps.

abstract: Recent experimental results on slow light heighten interest in nonlinear Maxwell theories. We obtain Galilei covariant equations for electromagnetism by allowing special nonlinearities in the constitutive equations only, keeping Maxwell's equations unchanged. Combining these with linear or nonlinear Schroedinger equations, e.g. as proposed by Doebner and Goldin, yields a Galilean quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: Geometric properties of the set of quantum entangled states are investigated. We propose an explicit method to compute the dimension of local orbits for any mixed state of the general K x M problem and characterize the set of effectively different states (which cannot be related by local transformations). Thus we generalize earlier results obtained for the simplest 2 x 2 system, which lead to a stratification of the 6D set of N=4 pure states. We define the concept of absolutely separable states, for which all globally equivalent states are separable.

authors: Arvind, N. Mukunda

abstract: The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is fundamental to the implementation of quantum computation, and requires at least two qubits for its demonstration. However, both Deutsch algorithm and Grover's search algorithm for two bits do not use entanglement. We develop a Deutsch-like problem, where we consider all possible binary functions for two bit inputs and distinguish their even or odd nature. The quantum algorithm to solve this problem requires entanglement at the level of two qubits. The final solution suggests that an NMR implementation of the problem would lead to interesting results.

abstract: We suggest solving the measurement problem by postulating the existence of a special future final boundary condition for the universe. Although this is an extension of the way boundary conditions are usually chosen (in terrestrial laboratories), it is our only deviation from standard quantum mechanics. Using two state vectors, or the "two-state", to describe completely the state of systems of interest, we analyze ideal and "weak" measurements, and show the consistency of our scheme. If the final state of a measuring device is assigned to be one of the possible outcomes of the measurement, an effective reduction is observed after an ideal measurement process. For final conditions chosen with an appropriate distribution, the predictions of standard quantum mechanics may be reconstructed, thus eliminating probability from the description of any single measurement. The interpretation attained, the Teleological Interpretation, is an ontological one; it is local and deterministic. Other special assumptions in the choice of the final boundary condition may explain certain unaccounted for phenomena, or even supply a mechanism for essential free will. In this context we believe that a new conception of time should be adopted.

The three qubit state problem is reformulated in the form suggesting possibility of explicite characterisation of all maps needed for separability condition.

abstract: The semiclassical approximation of coherent state path integrals is employed to study the dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings model. Decomposing the Hilbert space into subspaces of given excitation quanta above the ground state, the semiclassical propagator is shown to describe the exact quantum dynamics of the model. We also present a semiclassical approximation that does not exploit the special properties of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian and can be extended to more general situations. In this approach the contribution of the dominant semiclassical paths and the relevant fluctuations about them are evaluated. This theory leads to an accurate description of spontaneous emission going beyond the usual classical field approximation.

abstract: The standard generic quantum computer model is studied analytically and numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability. The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined. In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules, finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in the paper.

abstract: Quantum states can be used to encode the information contained in a direction, i.e., in a unit vector. We present the best encoding procedure when the quantum state is made up of $N$ spins (qubits). We find that the quality of this optimal procedure, which we quantify in terms of the fidelity, depends solely on the dimension of the encoding space. We also investigate the use of spatial rotations on a quantum state, which provide a natural and less demanding encoding. In this case we prove that the fidelity is directly related to the largest zeros of the Legendre and Jacobi polynomials. We also discuss our results in terms of the information gain.

abstract: In 1993 Elitzur and Vaidman introduced the concept of interaction-free measurements which allowed finding objects without ``touching'' them. In the proposed method, since the objects were not touched even by photons, thus, the interaction-free measurements can be called as ``seeing in the dark''. Since then several experiments have been successfully performed and various modifications were suggested. Recently, however, the validity of the term ``interaction-free'' has been questioned. The criticism of the name is briefly reviewed and the meaning of the interaction-free measurements is clarified.

abstract: The standard Born Oppenheimer theory does not give an accurate description of the wave function near points of level crossing. We give such a description near an isotropic conic crossing, for energies close to the crossing energy. This leads to the study of two coupled second order ordinary differential equations whose solution is described in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions of the kind 0F3(;a,b,c;z). We find that, at low angular momenta, the mixing due to crossing is surprisingly large, scaling like \mu^(1/6), where \mu is the electron to nuclear mass ratio.

abstract: A series of high presicion atomic experiments was carried out last decade to get a better estimate for the electron (anti)neutrino mass $m_\nu$. The reaction to be observed is molecular tritium $\beta$- decay. The $m_\nu$ value serves as one of the tune parameters to fit $\beta$- electrons spectrum via reference theoretical one. The unexpected message consists of that parameter ${m^2_\nu}$ has to be fixed at some negative value to get best statistically reliable fit. Apart of some exotic scenarios suggested the problem remains open. In this paper we tried to reanalyze ground features of the final states spectrum (FSS) and its influence on the $\beta$- electrons spectrum. A new approach has been developed which gives some hints to make proper modifications to the tabulated FSS in the course of experimental fits.

Wavelets are a special kind of functions which are localized in real as well as in Fourier space. In this paper we show how wavelets can be used as basis functions in canonical quantization. A countable set of mode functions are obtained. The general formalism of the change of basis is the same for all wavelets which satisfy a multiresolution analysis.

comments: 16 pages, REVTeX. Accepted for publication in the Journal of Mathematical Physics
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006085
abstract: The time operator, an operator which satisfies the canonical commutation relation with the Hamiltonian, is investigated, on the basis of a certain algebraic relation for a pair of operators T and H, where T is symmetric and H self-adjoint. This relation is equivalent to the Weyl relation, in the case of self-adjoint T, and is satisfied by the Aharonov-Bohm time operator T_0 and the free Hamiltonian H_0 for the one-dimensional free-particle system. In order to see the qualitative properties of T_0, the operators T and H satisfying this algebraic relation are examined. In particular, it is shown that the standard deviation of T is directly connected to the survival probability, and H is absolutely continuous. Hence, it is concluded that the existence of the operator T implies the existence of scattering states. It is also shown that the minimum uncertainty states do not exist. Other examples of these operators T and H, than the one-dimensional free-particle system, are demonstrated.

abstract: In a classical measurement the Shannon information is a natural measure of our ignorance about properties of a system. There, observation removes that ignorance in revealing properties of the system which can be considered to preexist prior to and independent of observation. Because of the completely different root of a quantum measurement as compared to a classical measurement conceptual difficulties arise when we try to define the information gain in a quantum measurement using the notion of Shannon information. The reason is that, in contrast to classical measurement, quantum measurement, with very few exceptions, cannot be claimed to reveal a property of the individual quantum system existing before the measurement is performed.

abstract: We investigate the computational power of passive and active linear optical elements and photo-detectors. We show that single photon sources, passive linear optics and photo-detectors are sufficient for implementing reliable quantum algorithms. Feedback from the detectors to the optical elements is required for this implementation. Without feedback, non-deterministic quantum computation is possible. A single photon source sufficient for quantum computation can be built with an active linear optical element (squeezer) and a photo-detector. The overheads associated with using only linear optics appear to be sufficiently low to make quantum computation based on our proposal a viable alternative.

abstract: If a measurement process is regarded as an irreversible process, then by Second law of thermodynamics the entropy should increase after any measurement process. By the same spirit a quantum system undergoing repeated measurement should show strong irreversibility leading to entropy production. On the contrary we show that in quantum Zeno effect setting the entropy of a quantum system decreases and goes to zero after a large number of measurements. We discuss the entropy change under continuous measurement model and show that entropy can decrease if we use a more accurate measuring apparatus.

Simulations with randomly generated problem instances show each step of the algorithm shifts amplitude preferentially towards lower cost states, thereby concentrating amplitudes into low-cost states, on average. These results are compared with conventional heuristics for these problems.

abstract: The possibility of using the two-fold topological degeneracy of spin-1/2 chiral spin liquid states on the torus to construct quantum error correcting codes is investigated. It is shown that codes constructed using these states on finite periodic lattices do not meet the necessary and sufficient conditions for correcting even a single qubit error with perfect fidelity. However, for large enough lattice sizes these conditions are approximately satisfied, and the resulting codes may therefore be viewed as approximate quantum error correcting codes.

The controlled absorption, where the state of one photon affects the absorption of the other photon, is realized by two photon absorption in a cubic crystal. The controlled absorption crystal detects a particular Bell state and is transparent for the other Bell states. The rotators and retarders transform a Bell state to another. This device may solve the problems in the early quantum teleportation experiments in photon polarization states.

Our experiment is performed in sodium vapor excited in $\Lambda $ configuration on the D$_{1}$ line by two laser fields of resonant frequencies $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, and probed by a third field $% \omega_{3}$. First-order sidebands for frequencies $\omega_{1}$, $\omega_{2}$ and up to the third-order sidebands for frequency $\omega_{3}$ are observed. The generation starts at a power as low as 10 microwatt for each input field. Dependencies of the intensities of both input and generated waves on the frequency difference ($\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}$), on the frequency $\omega_{3}$ and on the optical density are investigated.

The numerical solution of a Schroedinger equation with the account of Coulomb field of adjacent electrons shows, that in such structures the realization of a full set of basic logic operations which are necessary for fulfillment of quantum computations is possible. Durations of one- and two-qubit operations versus qubit geometry are obtained. Decoherence rates due to spontaneous emission of phonons and acoustic phonons (both piezoelectric and deformation) are evaluated. Analysis of these rates shows the offered qubit to be coherent enough to perform error correction procedures.

I consider two sources of decoherence: (i) the phase damping and (ii) the amplitude damping due to the coupling to the thermal environment. In particular, I give the exact value of the relative entropy of entanglement for the phase damping model. For the amplitude damping model, I give an upper bound for the relative entropy of entanglement, which turns out to be a good approximation for the entanglement measure in usual experimental situations.

abstract: Reasonable requirements of (a) physical invariance under particle permutation and (b) physical completeness of state descriptions, enable us to deduce a Symmetric Permutation Rule(SPR): that by taking care with our state descriptions, it is always possible to construct state vectors (or wave functions) that are purely symmetric under pure permutation for all particles, regardless of type distinguishability or spin. The conventional exchange antisymmetry for two identical half-integer spin particles is shown to be due to a subtle interdependence in the individual state descriptions arising from an inherent geometrical asymmetry. For three or more such particles, however, antisymmetrization of the state vector for all pairs simultaneously is shown to be impossible and the SPR makes observably different predictions, although the usual pairwise exclusion rules are maintained. The usual caveat of fermion antisymmetrization - that composite integer spin particles (with fermionic consitituents) behave only approximately like bosons - is no longer necessary.

abstract: Using the theoretical model of the optical beam-splitter, the interference of the self-phase modulated ultrashort light pulse (SPM-USP) with the coherent one is investigated. It is found that, the choice of the coefficient of transmission of the beam-splitter allows one to get the spectra of quadrature fluctuations with forms of interest to us. It is shown that the choice of the geometrical phase gives one the control of the position of the ellipse of squeezing in the quadrature space XY. The extended Mandel parameter is introduced and the photon statistics is scanned at all frequencies. It is established that the sub- and super-Poissonian statistics formation can be determined by the choice of the nonlinear phase addition and initial linear phase shift between pulses. It is also shown that the self-phase modulation (SPM) leads to the additional modulation of total photon number at the outputs of the beam-splitter.

The algorithm solves a generalisation of the Deutsch problem and distinguishes between even and odd functions using fewer function calls than is possible classically. The manipulation of entangled states of the two qubits is essential here, unlike the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Grover's search algorithm for two bits.

abstract: The quantum measurement problem considered for measuring system (MS) consist of measured state S (particle), detector D and information processing device (observer) O. It's shown that O states selfreference structure results in principal nonobservability of MS interference terms which discriminate pure and mixed S states. Such observables restriction permit to construct for MS states subjective representation (SR) which describes probabilistic evolution for measurement events observed by $O$ and his subjective information about S values. SR is dual and nonequivalent to MS Hilbert space $H$ for external observer $O'$. Due to it SR evolution is compatible with Schrodinger linear MS evolution observed by $O'$. It's argued that SR evolution corresponds to S state collapse for individual events observed by $O$.

abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of multiparticle systems, concentrating on the case where the entanglement is robust against disposal of particles. Two qubits -belonging to a multipartite system- are entangled in this sense iff their reduced density matrix is entangled. We introduce a family of multiqubit states, for which one can choose for any pair of qubits independently whether they should be entangled or not as well as the relative strength of the entanglement, thus providing the possibility to construct all kinds of ''Entanglement molecules''. For some particular configurations, we also give the maximal amount of entanglement achievable.

abstract: Collective operations on a network of spatially-separated quantum systems can be carried out using local quantum (LQ) operations, classical communication (CC) and shared entanglement (SE). Such operations can also be used to communicate classical information and establish entanglement between distant parties. We show how these facts lead to measures of the inseparability of quantum operations, and argue that a maximally-inseparable operation on 2 qubits is the SWAP operation. The generalisation of our argument to N qubit operations leads to the conclusion that permutation operations are maximally-inseparable. For even N, we find the minimum SE and CC resources which are sufficient to perform an arbitrary collective operation. These minimum resources are 2(N-1) ebits and 4(N-1) bits, and these limits can be attained using a simple teleportation-based protocol. We also obtain lower bounds on the minimum resources for the odd case. For all $N{\geq}4$, we show that the SE/CC resources required to perform an arbitrary operation are strictly greater than those that any operation can establish/communicate.

abstract: We provide a group-theoretical classification of the entangled states of N identical particles. The connection between quantum entanglement and the exchange symmetry of the states of N identical particles is made explicit using the duality between the permutation group and the simple unitary group. Each particle has n-levels and spans the n-dimensional Hilbert space. We shall call the general state of the particle as a qunit. The direct product of the N qunit space is given a decomposition in terms of states with definite permutation symmetry. The nature of fundamental entanglement of a state can be related to the classes of partitions of the integer N. The maximally entangled states are generated from linear combinations of the less entangled states of the direct product space. We also discuss the nature of maximal entanglement and its measures.

The scheme is inspired by quantum error-correction protocols, but it avoids the currently infeasible requirement for a controlled-NOT operation between single photons. The quantum communication scheme presented here rejects single bit-flip errors instead of correcting them and combines quantum-measurement properties of three-particle entangled (GHZ) states with properties of quantum teleportation.

abstract: Bit commitment involves the submission of evidence from one party to another so that the evidence can be used to confirm a later revealed bit value by the first party, while the second party cannot determine the bit value from the evidence alone. It is widely believed that secure quantum bit commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is codified in a general impossibility theorem. In this paper, the scope of this general impossibility proof is extended and analyzed, and gaps are found. Three specific protocols are described for which the entanglement cheating as given in the impossibility proof fails to work. One of these protocols, QBC2, is proved to be unconditionally secure.

abstract: We consider exact time-dependent analytic solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for tunneling in one dimension with cut off wave initial conditions at $t=0$. We obtain that as soon as $t \neq 0$ the transmitted probability density at any arbitrary distance rises instantaneously with time in a linear manner. Using a simple model we find that the above nonlocal effect of the time-dependent solution is suppressed by consideration of low-energy relativistic effects. Hence at a distance $x_0$ from the potential the probability density rises after a time $t_0=x_0/c$ restoring Einstein causality. This implies that the tunneling time of a particle can never be zero.

The created entangled state is a spin-squeezed state which could be used to improve the sensitivity of atomic clocks.

abstract: In this paper, we study the design of pulse sequences for NMR spectroscopy as a problem of time optimal control of the unitary propagator. Radio frequency pulses are used in coherent spectroscopy to implement a unitary transfer of state. Pulse sequences that accomplish a desired transfer should be as short as possible in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. Here, we give an analytical characterization of such time optimal pulse sequences applicable to coherence transfer experiments in multiple-spin systems. We have adopted a general mathematical formulation, and present many of our results in this setting, mindful of the fact that new structures in optimal pulse design are constantly arising. Moreover, the general proofs are no more difficult than the specific problems of current interest. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to study have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right invariant system on a compact Lie group, what is the minimum time required to steer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In NMR spectroscopy and quantum computing, this translates to, what is the minimum time required to produce a unitary propagator? We also give an analytical characterization of maximum achievable transfer in a given time for the two spin system.

abstract: We consider environment induced decoherence of quantum superpositions to mixtures in the limit in which that process is much faster than any competing one generated by the Hamiltonian $H_{\rm sys}$ of the isolated system. While the golden rule then does not apply we can discard $H_{\rm sys}$. By allowing for simultaneous couplings to different reservoirs, we reveal decoherence as a universal short-time phenomenon independent of the character of the system as well as the bath and of the basis the superimposed states are taken from. We discuss consequences for the classical behavior of the macroworld and quantum measurement: For the decoherence of superpositions of macroscopically distinct states the system Hamiltonian is always negligible.

abstract: It is shown, that oscillators on the sphere and the pseudosphere are related, by the so-called Bohlin transformation, with the Coulomb systems on the pseudosphere. The even states of an oscillator yield the conventional Coulomb system on the pseudosphere, while the odd states yield the Coulomb system on the pseudosphere in the presence of magnetic flux tube generating spin 1/2. A similar relation is established for the oscillator on the (pseudo)sphere specified by the presence of constant uniform magnetic field $B_0$ and the Coulomb-like system on pseudosphere specified by the presence of the magnetic field $\frac{B}{2r_0}(|\frac{x_3}{{\bf x}}|-\epsilon)$. The correspondence between the oscillator and the Coulomb systems the higher dimensions is also discussed.

abstract: We previously established that in principle, it is possible to quantum compute using passive linear optics with photo-detectors (quant-ph/0006088). Here we describe techniques based on error detection and correction that greatly improve the resource and device reliability requirements needed for scalability. The resource requirements are analyzed for ideal linear optics quantum computation (LOQC). The coding methods can be integrated both with loss detection and phase error-correction to deal with the primary relaxation processes in non-ideal optics, including detector inefficiencies. The main conclusion of our work is that the resource requirements for implementing quantum communication or computation with LOQC are reasonable. Furthermore, this work clearly demonstrates how special knowledge of the error behavior can be exploited for greatly improving the fault tolerance and overheads of a physical quantum computer.

abstract: After giving an outline of the quantization scheme based on the microscopic Hopfield model of a dielectric bulk material, we show how the classical phenomenological Maxwell equations of the electromagnetic field in the presence of dielectric matter of given space- and frequency-dependent complex permittivity can be transferred to quantum theory. Including in the theory the interaction of the medium-assisted field with atomic systems, we present both the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian and the multipolar-coupling Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge. To illustrate the concept, we discuss the input--output relations of radiation and the transformation of radiation-field quantum states at absorbing four-port devices, and the spontaneous decay of an excited atom near the surface of an absorbing body and in a spherical micro-cavity with intrinsic material losses. Finally, we give an extension of the quantization scheme to other media such as amplifying media, magnetic media, and nonlinear media.

Our scheme can overcome some difficulties of the existing schemes and makes improvements to different extent in the scale of quantum network, ability of computation, implementation of engineering, efficiency of quantum network, universality, compatibility, design principle, programmability, fault tolerance, error control, industrialization and commercialization {\it et. al} aspects. As the applications of this construction scheme, we obtain the entire quantum networks for Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm and solving Schr\"odinger equation in general. This implies that the scalable, uniform and universal quantum networks are able to generally describe the known main results and can be further applied to more interesting examples in quantum computations.

Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm for one and two qubits, using one extra work qubit, has also been implemented using selective pulses after creating a coherent superposition state, in the two-dimensional methodology.

abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of enciphering quantum states of two-state systems (qubits) for sending them in secrecy without entangled qubits shared by two legitimate users (Alice and Bob). This method has the following two properties. First, even if an eavesdropper (Eve) steals qubits, she can extract information from them with certain probability at most. Second, Alice and Bob can confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring a signature. If Eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and sends alternative ones (the Intercept/Resend attack), a probability that Alice and Bob do not notice Eve's action is equal to (3/4)^m or less. Passwords for decryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are disclosed through a public channel. Enciphering classical information by this method is equivalent to the one-time pad method with distributing a classical key (random binary string) by the BB84 protocol. If Eve takes away qubits, Alice and Bob lose the original quantum information. If we apply our method to a state in iteration, Eve's success probability decreases exponentially. We cannot examine security against the case that Eve makes an attack with using entanglement. This remains to be solved in the future.

Requiring a finite dimensional version of the Wigner function to be well defined we find a natural time quantization that leads to classical maps from which the arithmetical basis of quantum revivals is seen. The flux line, that fundamentally alters the quantum statistics, forces this time quantum to be increased by a factor of a winding number and determines the homotopy class of the path. The value of the flux is restricted to the rational numbers, a feature that persists in the infinite dimensional limit.

abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for the characterisation of separability and entanglement of formation (EoF) of general bipartite states. These characterisations are of the variational kind, meaning that separability and EoF are given in terms of a function which is to be minimized over the manifold of unitary matrices. A major benefit of such a characterisation is that it directly leads to a numerical procedure for calculating EoF. We present an efficient minimisation algorithm and an apply it to the bound entangled 3X3 Horodecki states; we show that their EoF is very low and that their distance to the set of separable states is also very low. Within the same variational framework we rephrase the results by Wootters (W. Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2245 (1998)) on EoF for 2X2 states and present progress in generalising these results to higher dimensional systems.

abstract: A general two qubit system expressed in terms of the complete set of unit and fifteen traceless, Hermitian Dirac matrices, is shown to exhibit novel features of this system. The well-known physical interpretations associated with the relativistic Dirac equation involving the symmetry operations of time-reversal T, charge conjugation C, parity P, and their products are reinterpreted here by examining their action on the basic Bell states. The transformation properties of the Bell basis states under these symmetry operations also reveal that C is the only operator that does not mix the Bell states whereas all others do. In a similar fashion, expressing the various logic gates introduced in the subject of quantum computers in terms of the Dirac matrices shows for example, that the NOT gate is related to the product of time-reversal and parity operators.

abstract: We consider entanglement swapping schemes with general (rather than maximally) entangled bipartite states of arbitary dimension shared pairwise between three or more parties in a chain. The intermediate parties perform generalised Bell measurements with the result that the two end parties end up sharing a entangled state which can be converted into maximally entangled states. We obtain an expression for the average amount of maximal entanglement concentrated in such a scheme and show that in a certain reasonably broad class of cases this scheme is provably optimal and that, in these cases, the amount of entanglement concentrated between the two ends is equal to that which could be concentrated from the weakest link in the chain.

abstract: The k-electron correlation function of a free chaotic electron beam is derived with the spin degree of freedom taken into account. It is shown that it can be expressed with the help of correlation functions for a polarized electron beam of all orders up to k and the degree of spin polarization. The form of the correlation function suggests that if the electron beam is not highly polarized, observing multi-particle correlations should be difficult. The result can be applied also to chaotic photon beams, the degree of spin polarization being replaced by the degree of polarization.

abstract: By probabilistic means, the concept of contextuality is extended so that it can be used in non-ideal situations. An inequality is presented, which at least in principle enables a test to discard non-contextual hidden-variable models at low error rates, in the spirit of the Kochen-Specker theorem. Assuming that the errors are independent, an explicit error bound of 1.42% is derived, below which a Kochen-Specker contradiction occurs.

abstract: We calculate the quantum corrections to the classical action of a particle with coordinate-dependent mass. The result is made self-consistent by a variational approach, thus making it applicable to strong-couplings and singular potentials. By including thermal fluctuations, the we obtain an effective action whose classical Euler-Lagrange equation describes the motion of a particle including quantum and thermal effects.

The amount of quantum memory required is $O(N^{1/2})$. The quantum algorithm that accomplishes this consists of an inner Grover search combined with a partial sort all sitting inside of an outer Grover search.

This process is equivalent to down-conversion in quantum optics where it is responsible for squeezing of the field amplitudes. Monte Carlo simulations derived from the Positive P description of the system, and approximate equations for second moments of the atomic field operators are introduced to describe the early stages of the process -- not amenable to the usual mean-field description.

abstract: We analyze the coherent multi-mode dynamics of a system of coupled atomic and molecular Bose gases. Starting from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with a small thermal component, we observe a complete depletion of the atomic and molecular condensate modes on a short time scale due to significant population of excited states. Giant coherent oscillations between the two condensates for typical parameters are almost completely suppressed. Our results cast serious doubts on the common use of the 2-mode model for description of coupled ultracold atomic-molecular systems and should be considered when planning future experiments with ultracold molecules.

abstract: We obtain the finite-temperature unconditional master equation of the density matrix for two coupled quantum dots (CQD) when one dot is subjected to a measurement of its electron occupation number using a point contact (PC). To determine how the CQD system state depends on the actual current through the PC device, we use the so-called quantum trajectory method to derive the zero-temperature conditional master equation. We first treat the electron tunneling through the PC barrier as a classical stochastic point process (a quantum-jump model). Then we show explicitly that our results can be extended to the quantum-diffusive limit when the average electron tunneling rate is very large compared to the extra change of the tunneling rate due to the presence of the electron in the dot closer to the PC. We find that in both quantum-jump and quantum-diffusive cases, the conditional dynamics of the CQD system can be described by the stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equations for its conditioned state vector if and only if the information carried away from the CQD system by the PC reservoirs can be recovered by the perfect detection of the measurements.

abstract: We consider the concept of fractons as particles or quasiparticles which obey a specific fractal statistics in connection with a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid theory. We obtain a dual statistics parameter ${\tilde{\nu}}=\nu+1$ which is identified with the controlling parameter $e^{-2\phi}$ of the Luttinger model. In this way, a bosonic system characterized by a fractal index $i_{f}[h]=i_{f}[2]=1$ is considered as a conformal field theory with central charge $c[\nu=0]=1=i_{f}[2]$ with a compactified radius $R=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\tilde{\nu}}}=1$. Thus, we have a mapping of a bosonic theory to a fermionic one and vice-versa, i.e., the duality symmetry ${{\tilde{h}} =3-h}$ of the universal class $h$ of fractons defined in the interval 1< h <2 is satisfied.

abstract: We emphasize that a specific aspect of quantum gravity is the absence of a super-selection rule that prevents a linear superposition of different gravitational charges. As an immediate consequence, we obtain a tiny, but observable, violation of the equivalence principle, provided, inertial and gravitational masses are not assumed to be operationally identical objects. In this framework, the cosmic gravitational environment affects local experiments. A range of terrestrial experiments, from neutron interferometry to neutrino oscillations, can serve as possible probes to study the emergent quantum aspects of gravity.

abstract: The joint realm of quantum mechanics and the general-relativistic description of gravitation is becoming increasingly accessible to terrestrial experiments and observations. In this essay we study the emerging indications of the violation of equivalence principle (VEP). While the solar neutrino anomaly may find its natural explanation in a VEP, the statistically significant discrepancy observed in the gravitationally induced phases of neutron interferometry seems to be the first indication of a VEP. However, such a view would seem immediately challenged by the atomic interferometry results. The latter experiments see no indications of VEP, in apparent contradiction to the neutron interferometry results. Here we present arguments that support the view that these, and related torsion pendulum experiments, probe different aspects of gravity; and that current experimental techniques, when coupled to the solar-neutrino data, may be able to explore quantum mechanically induced violations of the equivalence principle. We predict quantum violation of the equivalence principle (qVEP) for next generation of atomic interferometry experiments. The prediction entails comparing free fall of two different linear superpositions of Cesium atomic states.

abstract: In the following we undertake to derive quantum theory as a stochastic low-energy and coarse-grained theory from a more primordial discrete and basically geometric theory living on the Planck scale and which (as we argue) possibly underlies also \tit{string theory}. We isolate the so-called \tit{ideal elements} which represent at the same time the cornerstones of the framework of ordinary quantum theory and show how and why they encode the \tit{non-local} aspects, being ubiquituous in the quantum realm, in a, on the surface, local way. We show that the quantum non-locality emerges in our approach as a natural consequence of the underlying \tit{two-storey} nature of space-time or the physical vacuum, that is, quantum theory turns out to be a residual effect of the geometric depth structure of space-time on the Planck scale. We indicate how the \tit{measurement problem} and the emergence of the \tit{macroscopic sub-regime} can be understood in this framework.

abstract: We show that quantum mechanics and general relativity limit the speed $\tilde{\nu}$ of a simple computer (such as a black hole) and its memory space $I$ to $\tilde{\nu}^2 I^{-1} \lsim t_P^{-2}$, where $t_P$ is the Planck time. We also show that the life-time of a simple clock and its precision are similarly limited. These bounds and the holographic bound originate from the same physics that governs the quantum fluctuations of space-time. We further show that these physical bounds are realized for black holes, yielding the correct Hawking black hole lifetime, and that space-time undergoes much larger quantum fluctuations than conventional wisdom claims -- almost within range of detection with modern gravitational-wave interferometers.

Gravitational waves reduce the non-locality of correlated quanta controlled by Bell's inequalities, distorting quantum encryption key statistics away from a pure white noise. Gravitational waves therefore act as shadow eavesdroppers. The resulting colour distortions can, at least in principle, be separated from noise and can differentiate both deterministic and stochastic sources.

abstract: The exact wave functions that describe scattering of a charged particle by a confined magnetic field (Aharonov-Bohm effect) and by a Coulomb field are analyzed. It is well known that the usual procedure of finding asymptotic forms of these functions which admit a separation into a superposition of an incident plane wave and a circular or spherical scattered wave is problematic near the forward direction. It thus appears to be impossible to express the conservation of probability by means of an optical theorem of the usual kind. Both the total cross section and the forward scattering amplitude appear to be infinite. To address these difficulties we find a new representation for the asymptotic form of the Aharonov-Bohm wave function that is valid for all angles. Rather than try to define a cross section at forward angles, however, we work instead with the probability current and find that it is quite well behaved. The same is true for Coulomb scattering. We trace the usual difficulties to a nonuniformity of limits.

abstract: Most recently 't Hooft has postulated (G 't Hooft, Class. Quant. Grav. 16 (1999) 3263-3279) that quantum states at the ``atomic scale''can be understood as equivalence classes of primordial states governed by a dissipative deterministic theory underlying quantum theory at the ``Planck scale''. Defining invariant subspaces clearly for primordial states according to a given evolution, we mathematically re-formulate 't Hooft's theory as a quotient space construction with the time-reversible evolution operator induced naturally. With this observation and some analysis, 't Hooft's theory is generalized beyond his case where the evolution at the ``Planck scale'' is periodic or the time is discrete. We also give a novel illustration that the Fock space of quantum oscillator could follow from the quotient space construction for certain primordial states obeying non-reversible evolution governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

abstract: Conformal symmetry is taken as an attribute of theories of massless fields in manifolds with specific dimensionalities. This paper shows that this is not an absolute truth; it is a consequence of the mathematical representation used for the physical interactions. It introduces a new kind of representation where the propagation of massive (invariant mass) and massless interactions are unifiedly described by a single conformally symmetric Green's function. Sources and fields are treated at a same footing, symmetrically, as discrete fields - the fields in this new representation - fields defined with support on straight lines embedded in a (3+1)-Minkowski manifold. The discrete field turns out to be a point in phase space. It is finite everywhere. With a finite number of degrees of freedom it does not share the well known problems faced by the standard continuous formalism which can be retrieved from the discrete one by an integration over a hypersurface. The passage from discrete to continuous fields illuminates the physical meaning and origins of their properties and problems. The price for having massive discrete field with conformal symmetry is of hiding its mass and time-like velocity behind its non-constant proper-time.

abstract: For differential operators which are invariant under the action of an abelian group Bloch theory is the preferred tool to analyze spectral properties. By shedding some new non-commutative light on this we motivate the introduction of a non-commutative Bloch theory for elliptic operators on Hilbert C*-modules. It relates properties of C*-algebras to spectral properties of module operators such as band structure, weak genericity of cantor spectra, and absence of discrete spectrum. It applies e.g. to differential operators invariant under a projective group action, such as Schroedinger, Dirac and Pauli operators with periodic magnetic field, as well as to discrete models, such as the almost Matthieu equation and the quantum pendulum.

If this potential depends on the longitudinal variable only, there are embedded eigenvalues which turn into resonances if the symmetry is violated, either by applying a magnetic field or by deformation of the well. For a weak symmetry breaking we derive the perturbative expansion of these resonances. We also deduce a sufficient condition under which the discrete spectrum of such a system (without any symmetry) survives the presence of a strong magnetic field. It is satisfied, in particular, if the dot potential is purely attractive.

The proof is based on the microlocal description of the Szegoe kernel of a strictly pseudoconvex domain given by Boutet de Monvel and Sjoestrand.

abstract: The radiation dynamics of a dipole antenna embedded in a Photonic Crystal are modeled by an initially excited harmonic oscillator coupled to a non--Markovian bath of harmonic oscillators representing the colored electromagnetic vacuum within the crystal. Realistic coupling constants based on the natural modes of the Photonic Crystal, i.e., Bloch waves and their associated dispersion relation, are derived. For simple model systems, well-known results such as decay times and emission spectra are reproduced. This approach enables direct incorporation of realistic band structure computations into studies of radiative emission from atoms and molecules within photonic crystals. We therefore provide a predictive and interpretative tool for experiments in both the microwave and optical regimes.

abstract: We study coherent photoassociation, phenomena analogous to coherent optical transients in few-level systems, which may take place in photoassociation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate but not in a nondegenerate gas. We develop a second-quantized Hamiltonian to describe photoassociation, and apply the Hamiltonian both in the momentum representation and in the position representation (field theory). Solution of the two-mode problem including only one mode each for the atomic and molecular condensates displays analogs of Rabi oscillations and rapid adiabatic passage. A classical version of the field theory for atoms and molecules is used to demonstrate that, in the presence of photoassociating light, a joint-atom molecule is unstable against growth of density fluctuations. Experimental complications, including spontaneous emission and unwanted "rogue" photodissociation from a photoassociated molecule are analyzed. A two-color Raman scheme is studied as a method to set up an effective two-mode scheme with reduced spontaneous emission losses. We discuss photoassociation rates and photoassociation Rabi frequencies for high-lying vibrational states in alkalis both on the basis of molecular-structure calculations, and by comparing with an experiment [Wynar et al., Science 287, 1016 (2000)].

abstract: We discuss the role of Bose enhancement of the dipole matrix element in photoassociation, using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage as an example. In a nondegenerate gas the time scale for coherent optical transients tends to infinity in the thermodynamic limit, whereas Bose enhancement keeps this time scale finite in a condensate. Coherent transients are therefore absent in photoassociation of a thermal nondegenerate gas, but are feasible if the gas is a condensate.
