**1.    A study of heuristic guesses for adiabatic quantum computation**  
Alejandro Perdomo, Salvador E. Venegas-Andraca, Al��n Aspuru-Guzik

<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is a universal model for quantum computation which seeks to transform the initial ground state of a quantum system into a final ground state encoding the answer to a computational problem. AQC initial Hamiltonians conventionally have a uniform superposition as ground state. We diverge from this practice by introducing a simple form of heuristics: the ability to start the quantum evolution with a state which is a guess to the solution of the problem. With this goal in mind, we explain the viability of this approach and the needed modifications to the conventional AQC (CAQC) algorithm. By performing a numerical study on hard-to-satisfy 6 and 7 bit random instances of the satisfiability problem (3-SAT), we show how this heuristic approach is possible and we identify that the performance of the particular algorithm proposed is largely determined by the Hamming distance of the chosen initial guess state with respect to the solution. Besides the possibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy allows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the measured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of states as in CAQC. The outcome of the measurement can be used as a more refined guess state to restart the adiabatic evolution. This concatenated restart process is another heuristic that the CAQC strategy cannot capture.

**2.    One-dimensional quantum random walks with two entangled coins**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 032312 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2263  
<blockquote>
<p>
We offer theoretical explanations for some recent observations in numerical simulations of quantum random walks (QRW). Specifically, in the case of a QRW on the line with one particle (walker) and two entangled coins, we explain the phenomenon, called "localization", whereby the probability distribution of the walker's position is seen to exhibit a persistent major "spike" (or "peak") at the initial position and two other minor spikes which drift to infinity in either direction. Another interesting finding in connection with QRW's of this sort pertains to the limiting behavior of the position probability distribution. It is seen that the probability of finding the walker at any given location becomes eventually stationary and non-vanishing. We explain these observations in terms of the degeneration of some eigenvalue of the time evolution operator $U(k)$. An explicit general formula is derived for the limiting probability, from which we deduce the limiting value of the height of the observed spike at the origin. We show that the limiting probability decreases {\em quadratically} for large values of the position $x$. We locate the two minor spikes and demonstrate that their positions are determined by the phases of non-degenerated eigenvalues of $U(k)$. Finally, for fixed time $t$ sufficiently large, we examine the dependence on $t$ of the probability of finding a particle at a given location $x$.

**3.    Transport and Quantum Walk of Nonclassical Light in Coupled Waveguides**  
Amit Rai, G. S. Agarwal, J. H. H. Perk  
PHYSICAL REVIEW A 78, 042304 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3063  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the transport and quantum walk of nonclassical light in an array of coupled waveguides which have novel properties like very low decoherence and thus making them ideal for storage of quantum information. We show how squeezing gets turned over from one waveguide to another. We further show how input nonclassical light can generate entanglement among different waveguides. Our results involve both first quantization due to array structure and second quantization due to the quantum nature of fields and can also be used to discuss the Talbot effect in the quantum regime.

**4.    Linear-Optical Hyperentanglement-Assisted Quantum Error-Correcting Code**  
Mark M. Wilde, Dmitry B. Uskov  
Physical Review A 79, 022305 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4906  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a linear-optical implementation of a hyperentanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code. The code is hyperentanglement-assisted because the shared entanglement resource is a photonic state hyperentangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum. It is possible to encode, decode, and diagnose channel errors using linear-optical techniques. The code corrects for polarization "flip" errors and is thus suitable only for a proof-of-principle experiment. The encoding and decoding circuits use a Knill-Laflamme-Milburn-like scheme for transforming polarization and orbital angular momentum photonic qubits. A numerical optimization algorithm finds a unit-fidelity encoding circuit that requires only three ancilla modes and has success probability equal to 0.0097.

**5.    Limit theorems for quantum walks driven by many coins**  
Etsuo Segawa, Norio Konno  
International Journal of Quantum Information, Vol.6, Issue 6, pp.1231-1243 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.5074  
<blockquote>
<p>
We obtain some rigorous results on limit theorems for quantum walks driven by many coins introduced by Brun et al. in the long time limit. The results imply that whether the behavior of a particle is quantum or classical depends on the three factors: the initial qubit, the number of coins M, d= [t/M], where t is time step. Our main theorem shows that we can see a transition from classical behavior to quantum one for a class of three factors.
