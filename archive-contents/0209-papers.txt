abstract: We generate a pair of entangled beams from the interference of two amplitude squeezed beams. The entanglement is quantified in terms of EPR-paradox [Reid88] and inseparability [Duan00] criteria, with observed results of $\Delta^{2} X_{x|y}^{+} \Delta^{2} X_{x|y}^{-} = 0.58 \pm 0.02$ and $\sqrt{\Delta^{2} X_{x \pm y}^{+} \Delta^{2} X_{x \pm y}^{-}} = 0.44 \pm 0.01$, respectively. Both results clearly beat the standard quantum limit of unity. We experimentally analyze the effect of decoherence on each criterion and demonstrate qualitative differences. We also characterize the number of required and excess photons present in the entangled beams and provide contour plots of the efficacy of quantum information protocols in terms of these variables.

The role played by entanglement in reaching the classical limit is pointed out. Dissipative and thermal effects of the cavity are calculated and a simple modification of the experiment is proposed in order to observe the progressive loss of the capacity of ``quantum erasing''as a manifestation of the classical limit of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a cold trapped ion coupled to the quantized field inside a high-finesse cavity, considering exact resonance between the ionic internal levels and the field (carrier transition). We derive an intensity-dependent hamiltonian in which terms proportional to the square of the Lamb-Dicke parameter ($\eta$) are retained. We show that different nonclassical effects arise in the dynamics of the ionic population inversion, depending on the initial states of the vibrational motion/field and on the values of $\eta$.

abstract: We present a study of the effects of decoherence in the operation of a discrete quantum walk on a line, cycle and hypercube. We find high sensitivity to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of decoherence is to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms. Specifically, we observe a highly uniform distribution on the line, a very fast mixing time on the cycle, and more reliable hitting times across the hypercube.

abstract: The problem of quantum state filtering consists of determining whether an unknown quantum state, which is chosen from a known set of states, is either a particular, specified state, or not. We consider this problem for the case that the filtering procedure is required to be unambiguous, which necessitates admitting inconclusive answers when the given states are not orthogonal. As an application, we propose an efficient, probabilistic procedure for distinguishing between sets of Boolean functions, which is an extension of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

abstract: Scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures require quantum gates that operate within a small fraction of the qubit decoherence time and with high accuracy over a bandwidth set by the decoherence rate. Electron spin quantum bits in Si are promising because of long decoherence times (~0.5 ms), but electrical gating schemes still seem problematic. Oxide-semiconductor heterostructures have the potential for precise electrical control of gate operations in the semiconductor, using optical rectification in the ferroelectric oxide. Accurate (~80 dB), local (~10 nm), dynamic (>THz) and programmable optical control over electric polarization in the ferroelectric can be achieved using existing technology. Optical techniques may also be useful in rapid initialization of the quantum computer, and for providing a source of initialized qubits to use for quantum error correction. Advantages of optical methods will be discussed within a framework proposed for a quantum information processor using ferroelectrically coupled electron spins and Ge quantum dots in Si.

abstract: The temporal evolution of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) coherence resonances in pump-probe spectroscopy of degenerate two-level atomic transition is studied for light intensities below saturation. Analytical expression for the transient absorption spectra are given for simple model systems and a model for the calculation of the time dependent response of realistic atomic transitions, where the Zeeman degeneracy is fully accounted for, is presented. EIT and EIA resonances have a similar (opposite sign) time dependent lineshape, however, the EIA evolution is slower and thus narrower lines are observed for long interaction time. Qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions is obtained for the transient probe absorption on the $^{85}Rb$ $D_{2}$ line in an atomic beam experiment.

abstract: We discuss a general and systematic method for obtaining effective Hamiltonians that describe different nonlinear optical processes. The method exploits the existence of a nonlinear deformation of the usual su(2) algebra that arises as the dynamical symmetry of the original model. When some physical parameter, dictated by the process under consideration, becomes small, we immediately get a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that correctly represents the dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We extend the technique to su(3) and su(N), finding the corresponding effective Hamiltonians when some resonance conditions are fulfilled.

abstract: Among the many proposals for the realization of a quantum computer, holonomic quantum computation (HQC) is distinguished from the rest in that it is geometrical in nature and thus expected to be robust against decoherence. Here we analyze the realization of various quantum gates by solving the inverse problem: Given a unitary matrix, we develop a formalism by which we find loops in the parameter space generating this matrix as a holonomy. We demonstrate for the first time that such a one-qubit gate as the Hadamard gate and such two-qubit gates as the CNOT gate, the SWAP gate and the discrete Fourier transformation can be obtained with a single loop.

abstract: We study the time evolution of the entangled kaon system by considering the Liouville - von Neumann equation with an additional term which allows for decoherence. We choose as generators of decoherence the projectors to the 2-particle eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Then we compare this model with the data of the CPLEAR experiment and find in this way an upper bound on the strength $\lambda$ of the decoherence. We also relate $\lambda$ to an effective decoherence parameter $\zeta$ considered previously in literature. Finally we discuss our model in the light of different measures of entanglement, i.e. the von Neumann entropy $S$, the entanglement of formation $E$ and the concurrence $C$, and we relate the decoherence parameter $\zeta$ to the loss of entanglement: $1 - E$.

We also predict two novel peculiar features of the system considered, namely the independence of the transit time (for non resonant tunneling) and the resonant frequency on the number of barriers crossed, which can be directly tested in photonic experiments. A thorough analysis of the role played by inter-barrier multiple reflections and a physical interpretation of the results obtained is reported, showing that multibarrier tunneling is a highly non-local phenomenon.

This optimal bound is shown to be greater than or equal to the bounds derived in the literature on the entropic uncertainties of two observables which are measured on distinct but identically prepared ensembles of systems. In the case of a two-dimensional Hilbert Space, the optimal bound for successive measurements of two spin components, is seen to be strictly greater than the optimal bound for the case when they are measured on distinct ensembles, except when the spin components are mutually parallel or perpendicular.

abstract: We consider the problem of correcting the errors incurred from sending classical or quantum information through a noisy quantum environment by schemes using classical information obtained from a measurement on the environment. We give a conditions for quantum or classical information (prepared in a specified input basis B) to be corrigible based on a measurement M. Based on these criteria we give examples of noisy channels such that (1) no information can be corrected by such a scheme (2) for some basis B there is a correcting measurement M (3) for all bases B there is an M (4) there is a measurement M which allows perfect correction for all bases B. The last case is equivalent to the possibility of correcting quantum information, and turns out to be equivalent to the channel allowing a representation as a convex combination of isometric channels. Such channels are doubly stochastic but not conversely.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209026
abstract: We address the decomposition of a multi-mode pure Gaussian state with respect to a bi-partite division of the modes. For any such division the state can always be expressed as a product state involving entangled two-mode squeezed states and single mode local states at each side. The character of entanglement of the state can therefore be understood modewise; that is, a given mode on one side is entangled with only one corresponding mode of the other, and therefore the total bi-partite entanglement is the sum of the modewise entanglement. This decomposition is generally not applicable to all mixed Gaussian states. However, the result can be extended to a special family of "isotropic" states, characterized by a phase space covariance matrix with a completely degenerate symplectic spectrum.

The procedure is based on the emission of a first photon from a two-level system moving into a laser-illuminated region. The resulting temporal distribution is explicitly calculated for the one-dimensional case and compared with axiomatically proposed expressions. As a main result we show that by means of a deconvolution one obtains the well known quantum mechanical probability flux of the particle at the location as a limiting distribution.

abstract: We show how an experimentally realized set of operations on a single trapped ion is sufficient to simulate a wide class of Hamiltonians of a spin-1/2 particle in an external potential. This system is also able to simulate other physical dynamics. As a demonstration, we simulate the action of an $n$-th order nonlinear optical beamsplitter. Two of these beamsplitters can be used to construct an interferometer sensitive to phase shifts in one of the interferometer beam paths. The sensitivity in determining these phase shifts increases linearly with $n$, and the simulation demonstrates that the use of nonlinear beamsplitters ($n$=2,3) enhances this sensitivity compared to the standard quantum limit imposed by a linear beamsplitter ($n$=1).

Our protocol is induced naturally from symmetry of $n$-tensored pure state, and is optimal for all the protocols which concentrates entanglement from unknown pure states, in the sense of failure probability. In the proof of optimality, the statistical estimation theory plays a key role, for concentrated entanglement gives a natural estimate of the entropy of entanglement.

abstract: The generation of pulsed polarization entangled photon pair has been realized using type-I phase matching in the spontaneous parametirc downconversion process in a space cascaded two-crystal geometry. The optical axes of the crystal are aligned in such a way that the horizontal polarization photon pair is produced from up crystal, and the vertical polarization photon pair is produced from down crystal. These two processes are simultaneous, but are separable in space. We get the high entangled polarization photon pair by using the single mode fiber to erase the spatial information between these two processes. This photon pair exhibits more than 86% high-visibility quantum interference for polarization variable without the narrowband filter and temporal compensation.

Here we propose a two-qubit gate for the XY interaction which combines CNOT with the SWAP operation. By using this gate quantum circuits can be implemented efficiently, even if only nearest-neighbor coupling between the qubits is available.

abstract: We show that particle transport in a uniform, quantum multi-baker map, is generically ballistic in the long time limit, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. Random matrix theory provides explicit analytical predictions for the mean square displacement of a particle in the system. These results exhibit a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time from diffusive to ballistic motion on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant. We can argue, that for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum multi-baker, a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Using an initial equilibrium density matrix, we find that diffusive behavior is recovered in the semi-classical limit for such systems, without further interactions with the environment.

abstract: We study the robustness and fragility of entanglement of open quantum systems in some exactly solvable models in which the decoherence is caused by a pure dephasing process. In particular, for the toy models presented in this paper, we identify two different time scales, one is responsible for local dephasing, while the other is for entanglement decay. For a class of fragile entangled states defined in this paper, we find that the entanglement of two qubits, as measured by concurrence, decays faster asymptotically than the quantum dephasing of an individual qubit.

abstract: A novel secure communication protocol is presented, based on an entangled pair of qubits and allowing asymptotically secure key distribution and quasi-secure direct communication. Since the information is transferred in a deterministic manner, no qubits have to be discarded. The transmission of information is instantaneous, i.e. the information can be decoded during the transmission. The security against arbitrary eavesdropping attacks is provided. In case of eavesdropping attacks with full information gain, the detection rate is 50% per control transmission. The experimental realization of the protocol is feasible with relatively small effort, which also makes commercial applications conceivable.

abstract: We report a novel Bell-state synthesizer in which an interferometric entanglement concentration scheme is used. An initially mixed polarization state from type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion becomes entangled after the interferometric entanglement concentrator. This Bell-state synthesizer is universal in the sense that the output polarization state is not affected by spectral filtering, crystal thickness, and, most importantly, the choice of pump source. It is also robust against environmental disturbance and a more general state, partially mixed$-$partially entangled state, can be readily generated as well.

abstract: We discuss the regularization of attractive singular potentials $-\alpha _{s}/r^{s}$, $s\geq 2$ by infinitesimal imaginary addition to interaction constant $\alpha_{s}=\alpha_{s}\pm i0$. Such a procedure enables unique definition of scattering observables and is equal to an absorption (creation) of particles in the origin. It is shown, that suggested regularization is an analytical continuation of the scattering amplitudes of repulsive singular potential in interaction constant $\alpha_{s}$. The nearthreshold properties of regularized in a mentioned way singular potential are examined. We obtain expressions for the scattering lengths, which turn to be complex even for infinitesimal imaginary part of interaction constant. The problem of perturbation of nearthreshold states of regular potential by a singular one is treated, the expressions for level shifts and widths are obtained. We show, that the physical sense of suggested regularization is that the scattering observables are insensitive to any details of the short range modification of singular potential, if there exists sufficiently strong inelastic short range interaction. In this case the scattering observables are determined by solutions of Schrodinger equation with regularized potential $-(\alpha_{s}\pm i0)/r^{s}$. We point out that the developed formalism can be applied for the description of systems with short range annihilation, in particular low energy nucleon-antinucleon scattering.

abstract: Causality imposes strong restrictions on the type of operators that may be observables in relativistic quantum theories. In fact, causal violations arise when computing conditional probabilities for certain partial causally connected measurements using the standard non covariant procedure. Here we introduce another way of computing conditional probabilities, based on an intrinsic covariant relational order of the events, which differs from the standard one when these type of measurements are included. This alternative procedure is compatible with a wider and very natural class of operators without breaking causality. If some of these measurements could be implemented in practice as predicted by our formalism, the non covariant, conventional approach should be abandoned. Furthermore, the description we promote here would imply a new physical effect where interference terms are suppressed as a consequence of the covariant order in the measurement process.

abstract: As it is well known, every bipartite $2\otimes 2$ density matrix can be obtained from Bell decomposable states via local quantum operations and classical communications (LQCC). Using this fact, the Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition of an arbitrary bipartite $2\otimes 2$ density matrix has been obtained through LQCC action upon Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition of Bell decomposable states of $2\otimes 2$ quantum systems, where the product states introduced by Wootters in [W. K. Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80} 2245 (1998)] form the best separable approximation ensemble for Bell decomposable states. It is shown that in these systems the average concurrence of the Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition is equal to the concurrence of these states.

abstract: We present a new perturbation theory for quantum mechanical energy eigenstates when the potential equals the sum of two localized, but not necessarily weak potentials $V_{1}(\vec{r})$ and $V_{2}(\vec{r})$, with the distance $L$ between the respective centers of the two taken to be quite large. It is assumed that complete eigenfunctions of the local Hamiltonians (i.e., in the presence of $V_{1}(\vec{r})$ or $V_{2}(\vec{r})$ only) are available as inputs to our perturbation theory. If the two local Hamiltonians have degenerate bound-state energy levels, a systematic extension of the molecular orbital theory (or the tight-binding approximation) follows from our formalism. Our approach can be viewed as a systematic adaptation of the multiple scattering theory to the problem of bound states.

abstract: As we know, "Who can be said to be a conscious being?" is one of the hard problems in present science, and no method has been found to strictly differentiate the conscious being from the being without consciousness or usual matter. In this short paper, we present a strict physical method based on revised quantum dynamics to test the existence of consciousness, and the principle is to use the distinguishability of nonorthogonal single states. We demonstrate that although the dynamical collapse time can't be measured by a physical measuring device, a conscious being can perceive it under the assumed QSC condition, thus can distinguish the nonorthogonal single states in the framework of revised quantum dynamics This in principle provides a quantum method to differentiate man and machine, or to test the existence of consciousness. We further discuss the rationality of the assumed QSC condition, and denote that some experimental evidences have indicated that our human being can satisfy the condition. This not only provides some confirmation of our method, but also indicates that the method is a practical proposal, which can be implemented in the near future experiments.

abstract: We consider deeply the relation between the orthogonality and the distinguishability of a set of arbitrary states (including multi-partite states). It is shown that if a set of arbitrary states can be distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), \QTR{it}{\}each of the states can be written as a linear combination of product vectors such that all product vectors of one of the states are orthogonal to the other states. With this result we then prove a simple necessary condition for LOCC distinguishability of a class of orthogonal states. These conclusions may be useful in discussing the distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states further, understanding the essence of nonlocality and discussing the distillation of entanglement.

In combination with existing single qubit gates this provides a universal set of robust quantum logic gates.

The formalism of the model is related to that of the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics.

As an application, we consider n parties sharing a GHZ-type state and show that the amount of super-luminal classical communication required to reproduce the correlations is at least n(log n - 3) bits and the maximum detector efficiency eta* for which the resulting correlations can still be reproduced by a local hidden-variable theory is upper bounded by eta* <= 8/n and thus decreases with n.

abstract: The impact of an anti-unitary symmetry on the spectrum of non-hermitean operators is studied. Wigner's normal form of an anti-unitary operator is shown to account for the spectral properties of non-hermitean, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians. Both the occurrence of single real or complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues follows from this theory. The corresponding energy eigenstates span either one- or two-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetry PT. In this framework, the concept of a spontaneously broken PT-symmetry is not needed.

This proof is free of the difficulties encountered in applying to the Everett interpretation previous results regarding relative frequency and probability in quantum mechanics. The ontology of the Everett interpretation in the Heisenberg picture is also discussed.

abstract: The paradigm of the two-level atom is revisited and its perturbative analysis is discussed in view of the principle of duality in perturbation theory. The models we consider are a two-level atom and an ensemble of two-level atoms both interacting with a single radiation mode. The aim is to see how the latter can be actually used as an amplifier of quantum fluctuations to the classical level through the thermodynamic limit of a very large ensemble of two-level atoms [M. Frasca, Phys. Lett. A {\bf 283}, 271 (2001)] and how can remove Schr\"odinger cat states. The thermodynamic limit can be very effective for producing both classical states and decoherence on a quantum system that evolves without dissipation. Decoherence without dissipation is indeed an effect of a single two-level atom interacting with an ensemble of two-level atoms, a situation that proves to be useful to understand recent experiments on nanoscale devices showing unexpected disappearance of quantum coherence at very low temperatures.

The proof introduces a new parameter of Boolean functions called the "nonparity coefficient," which might be of independent interest.

The class is based on the use of sets of unitary quantum operations in both transmission and reception, and on appending a quantum tag to the quantum message used in transmission. The previous secret between partners required for any authentication is a classical key. We obtain the minimal requirements on the unitary operations that lead to a probability of failure of the scheme less than one. This failure may be caused by someone performing a unitary operation on the message in the channel between the communicating partners, or by a potential forger impersonating the transmitter.

abstract: Entanglement is a powerful resource for processing quantum information. In this context pure, maximally entangled states have received considerable attention. In the case of bipartite qubit-systems the four orthonormal Bell-states are of this type. One of these Bell states, the singlet Bell-state, has the additional property of being antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange. In this contribution we discuss possible generalizations of this antisymmetric Bell-state to cases with more than two particles and with single-particle Hilbert spaces involving more than two dimensions. We review basic properties of these totally antisymmetric states. Among possible applications of this class of states we analyze a new quantum key sharing protocol and methods for comparing quantum states.

Spherical functions basis expansion of the potentials introduces partial amplitudes and corresponding radial functions. The approach is generalized to multi-channel case by a matrix formulation in which a state vector component is associated with a scattering channel. The zero-range potentials naturally enter the scheme when the class of operators of multiplication is widen to distributions. %Analog of multipolar expansion is treated. Spin variables, o Oscillations and rotations are incorporated into the scheme.

Here, we show how a degenerate entanglement, created without transmitting any timing signal, can be used to teleport this phase information. This phase-teleportation process may be applied to achieve frequency-locking of remote oscillators, thereby facilitating the process of synchronizing distant clocks.

abstract: Classical electromagnetic radiation from quantum currents and densities are calculated. For the free Schrodinger equation with no external force it's found that the classical radiation is zero to all orders of the multipole expansion. This is true of mixed or pure states for the charged particle. It is a non-trivial and surprising result. A similar result is found for the Klein-Gordon currents when the wave function consists of only positive energy solutions. For the Dirac equation it is found that radiation is suppressed at lower frequencies but is not zero at all frequencies. Implications of these results for the interpretation of quantum mechanics are discussed.

abstract: The scaling of decoherence rates with the number of q-bits is studied for a simple quantum computer model. Two state q-bits are localised around well-separated positions via trapping potentials, but vibrational motion of q-bits centre of mass motion occurs. Coherent one and two q-bit gating processes are controlled by external classical fields and facilitated by a high Q cavity mode. Decoherence due to q-bit and cavity mode coupling to a bath of spontaneous emission modes, cavity decay modes and to the vibrational modes is treated. A non-Markovian treatment of the short time behaviour of the fidelity is presented, enabling time scales for decoherence to be determined, together with their dependence on q-bit number for the case where the q-bit/cavity mode system is in a pure state and the baths are in thermal states.

Results can be related with known semiclassical ones obtained with a truncated hamiltonian, and the symmetric case is easily recovered.

abstract: As the matching condition in Grover search algorithm is transgressed due to inevitable errors in phase inversions, it gives a reduction in maximum probability of success. With a given degree of maximum success, we have derive the generalized and imroved criterion for tolerated error and corresponding size of quantum database under the inevitable gate imperfections. The vanished inaccurancy to this condition has also been shown. Besides, a concise formula for evaluating minimum number of iterations is also presented in this work.

abstract: We experimentally analyzed the statistical errors in quantum-state estimation and examined whether their lower bound, which is derived from the Cramer-Rao inequality, can be truly attained or not. In the experiments, polarization states of bi-photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion were estimated employing tomographic measurements. Using a new estimation strategy based on Akaike's information criterion, we demonstrated that the errors actually approach the lower bound, while they fail to approach it using the conventional estimation strategy.

abstract: We consider a wide class of nonlinear canonical quantum systems described by a one-particle Schroedinger equation containing a complex nonlinearity. We introduce a nonlinear unitary transformation which permits us to linearize the continuity equation. In this way we are able to obtain a new quantum system obeying to a nonlinear Schroedinger equation with a real nonlinearity. As an application of this theory we consider a few already studied Schroedinger equations as that containing the nonlinearity introduced by the exclusion-inclusion principle, the Doebner-Goldin equation and others.

abstract: In Shannon information theory the capacity of a memoryless communication channel cannot be increased by the use of feedback. In quantum information theory the no-cloning theorem means that noiseless copying and feedback of quantum information cannot be achieved. In this paper, quantum feedback is defined as the unlimited use of a noiseless quantum channel from receiver to sender. Given such quantum feedback, it is shown to provide no increase in the entanglement--assisted capacities of a memoryless quantum channel, in direct analogy to the classical case. It is also shown that in various cases of non-assisted capacities, feedback may increase the capacity of memoryless quantum channels.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209077
abstract: We propose an experimental set up allowing to convert an input light of wavelengths about $1-2 \mu m$ into an output light of a lower frequency. The basic principle of operating relies on the nonlinear optical properties exhibited by a microcavity filled with glass. The light inside this material behaves like a 2D interacting Bose gas susceptible to thermalise and create a quasi-condensate. Extension of this setup to a photonic bandgap material (fiber grating) allows the light to behave like a 3D Bose gas leading, after thermalisation, to the formation of a Bose condensate. Theoretical estimations show that a conversion of $1 \mu m$ into $1.5 \mu m$ is achieved with an input pulse of about $1 ns$ with a peak power of $10^3 W$, using a fiber grating containing an integrated cavity of size about $500 \mu m \times 100 \mu m^2$.

abstract: Resonant energy transfer mechanisms have been observed in the sensitized luminescence of solids, in quantum dots and in molecular nanostructures, and they also play a central role in light harvesting processes in photosynthetic organisms. We demonstrate that such mechanisms, together with the exciton-exciton binding energy shift typical of these nanostructures, can be used to perform universal quantum logic. In particular, we show how to generate controlled exciton entanglement and identify two different regimes of quantum behaviour.

abstract: A low temperature model system consisting of a central spin coupled to a spin-bath is studied to determine whether interaction among bath spins has an effect on central spin dynamics. In the absence of intra-environmental coupling, decoherence of the central spin is fast and irreversible. Strong intra-environmental interaction results in an effective decoupling of the central spin from the bath and suppression of decoherence. Weaker intra-environmental coupling reduces but does not eliminate decoherence. We believe that similar behaviour will be observed in any system with a self-interacting environment.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209084
abstract: We develop a computation model for solving Boolean networks that implements wires through quantum ground-state computation and implements gates through identities following from angular momentum algebra and statistics. The gates are static in the sense that they contribute Hamiltonian 0 and hold as constants of the motion; only the wires are dynamic. Just as a spin 1/2 makes an ideal 1-bit memory element, a spin 1 makes an ideal 3-bit gate. Such gates cost no computation time: relaxing the wires alone solves the network. We compare computation time with that of an easier Boolean network where all the gate constraints are simply removed. This computation model is robust with respect to decoherence and yields a generalized quantum speed-up for all NP problems.

abstract: The production of quantum entanglement between weakly coupled mapping systems, whose classical counterparts are both strongly chaotic, is investigated. In the weak coupling regime, it is shown that time correlation functions of the unperturbed systems determine the entanglement production. In particular, we elucidate that the increment of nonlinear parameter of coupled kicked tops does not accelerate the entanglement production in the strongly chaotic region. An approach to the dynamical inhibition of entanglement is suggested.

Extension to higher dimensional Hilbert spaces is delineated. A physical scenario for the off-diagonal mixed state geometric phase in polarization-entangled two-photon interferometry is proposed.

abstract: The principle of detailed balance is at the basis of equilibrium physics and is equivalent to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition (under quite general assumptions). In the present paper we prove that a large class of open quantum systems satisfies a dynamical generalization of the detailed balance condition ({\it dynamical detailed balance}) expressing the fact that all the micro-currents, associated to the Bohr frequencies are constant. The usual (equilibrium) detailed balance condition is characterized by the property that this constant is identically zero. From this we deduce a simple and experimentally measurable relation expressing the microcurrent associated to a transition between two levels $\epsilon_m\to\epsilon_n$ as a linear combination of the occupation probabilities of the two levels, with coefficients given by the generalized susceptivities (transport coefficients). Finally, using a master equation characterization of the dynamical detailed balance condition, we show that this condition is equivalent to a "local" generalization of the usual KMS condition.

abstract: We show how to convert a quantum stabilizer code to a one-way or two-way entanglement distillation protocol. The proposed conversion method is a generalization of those of Shor-Preskill and Nielsen-Chuang. The recurrence protocol and the quantum privacy amplification protocol are equivalent to the protocols converted from [[2,1]] stabilizer codes. We also give an example of a two-way protocol converted from a stabilizer better than the recurrence protocol and the quantum privacy amplification protocol. The distillable entanglement by the class of one-way protocols converted from stabilizer codes for a certain class of states is equal to or greater than the achievable rate of stabilizer codes over the channel corresponding to the distilled state, and they can distill asymptotically more entanglement from a very noisy Werner state than the hashing protocol.

abstract: Due to the no-cloning theorem, the unknown quantum state can only be cloned approximately or exactly with some probability. There are two types of cloners: universal and state-dependent cloner. The optimal universal cloner has been found and could be viewed as a special state-dependent quantum cloner which has no information about the states. In this paper, we investigate the state-dependent cloning when the state-set contains more than two states. We get some bounds of the global fidelity for these processes. This method is not dependent on the number of the states contained in the state-set. It is also independent of the numbers of copying.

abstract: We introduce the entanglement gauge describing the combined effects of local operations and nonlocal unitary transformations on bipartite quantum systems. The entanglement gauge exploits the invariance of nonlocal properties for bipartite systems under local (gauge) transformations. This new formalism yields observable effects arising from the gauge geometry of the bipartite system. In particular, we propose a non-Abelian gauge theory realized via two separated spatial modes of the quantized electromagnetic field manipulated by linear optics. In this linear optical realization, a bi-partite state of two separated spatial modes can acquire a non-Abelian geometric phase.

abstract: We investigate whether it is possible to store and retrieve the intense probe pulse from a $\Lambda$-type homogeneous medium of cold atoms. Through numerical simulations we show that it is possible to store and retrieve the probe pulse which are not necessarily weak. As the intensity of the probe pulse increases, the retrieved pulse remains a replica of the original pulse, however there is overall broadening and loss of the intensity. These effects can be understood in terms of the dependence of absorption on the intensity of the probe. We include the dynamics of the control field, which becomes especially important as the intensity of the probe pulse increases. We use the theory of adiabatons [Grobe {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 73}, 3183 (1994)] to understand the storage and retrieval of light pulses at moderate powers.

abstract: As currently implemented, single-photon sources cannot be made to produce single photons with high probability, while simultaneously suppressing the probability of yielding two or more photons. Because of this, single photon sources cannot really produce single photons on demand. We describe a multiplexed system that allows the probabilities of producing one and more photons to be adjusted independently, enabling a much better approximation of a source of single photons on demand. The scheme uses a heralded photon source based on parametric downconversion, but by effectively breaking the trigger detector area into multiple regions, we are able to extract more information about a heralded photon than is possible with a conventional arrangement. This scheme allows photons to be produced along with a quantitative ``certification'' that they are single photons. Some of the single-photon certifications can be significantly better than what is possible with conventional downconversion sources (using a unified trigger detector region), as well as being better than faint laser sources. With such a source of more tightly certified single photons, it should be possible to improve the maximum secure bit rate possible over a quantum cryptographic link. We present an analysis of the relative merits of this method over the conventional arrangement.

abstract: The predictions of the Bohmian and the decoherent (or consistent) histories formulations of the quantum mechanics of a closed system are compared for histories -- sequences of alternatives at a series of times. For certain kinds of histories, Bohmian mechanics and decoherent histories may both be formulated in the same mathematical framework within which they can be compared. In that framework, Bohmian mechanics and decoherent histories represent a given history by different operators. Their predictions for the probabilities of histories therefore generally differ. However, in an idealized model of measurement, the predictions of Bohmian mechanics and decoherent histories coincide for the probabilities of records of measurement outcomes. The formulations are thus difficult to distinguish experimentally. They may differ in their accounts of the past history of the universe in quantum cosmology.

abstract: Classical random walks on well-behaved graphs are rapidly mixing towards the uniform distribution. Moore and Russell showed that a continuous quantum walk on the hypercube is instantaneously uniform mixing. We show that the continuous-time quantum walks on other well-behaved graphs do not exhibit this uniform mixing. We prove that the only graphs amongst balanced complete multipartite graphs that have the instantaneous uniform mixing property are the complete graphs on two, three and four vertices, and the cycle graph on four vertices. Our proof exploits the circulant structure of these graphs. Furthermore, we conjecture that most complete cycles and Cayley graphs lack this mixing property as well.

abstract: The degree of nonclassicality of states of a field mode is analysed considering both phase-space and distance-type measures of nonclassicality. By working out some general examples, it is shown explicitly that the phase-space measure is rather sensitive to superposition of states, with finite superpositions possessing maximum nonclassical depth (the highest degree of nonclassicality) irrespective to the nature of the component states. Mixed states are also discussed and examples with nonclassical depth varying between the minimum and the maximum allowed values are exhibited. For pure Gaussian states, it is demonstrated that distance-type measures based on the Hilbert-Schmidt metric are equivalent to the phase-space measure. Analyzing some examples, it is shown that distance-type measures are efficient to quantify the degree of nonclassicality of non-Gaussian pure states.

abstract: To describe a quantum system whose potential is divergent at one point, one must provide proper connection conditions for the wave functions at the singularity. Generalizing the scheme used for point interactions in one dimension, we present a set of connection conditions which are well-defined even if the wave functions and/or their derivatives are divergent at the singularity. Our generalized scheme covers the entire U(2) family of quantizations (self-adjoint Hamiltonians) admitted for the singular system. We use this scheme to examine the spectra of the Coulomb potential $V(x) = - e^2 / | x |$ and the harmonic oscillator with square inverse potential $V(x) = (m \omega^2 / 2) x^2 + g/x^2$, and thereby provide a general perspective for these models which have previously been treated with restrictive connection conditions resulting in conflicting spectra. We further show that, for any parity invariant singular potentials $V(-x) = V(x)$, the spectrum is determined solely by the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix $U \in U(2)$.

abstract: We present a fiber-based source of polarization-entangled photon pairs that is well suited for quantum communication applications in the 1.5$\mu$m band of standard telecommunication fiber. Quantum-correlated signal and idler photon pairs are produced when a nonlinear-fiber Sagnac interferometer is pumped in the anomalous-dispersion region of the fiber. Recently, we have demonstrated nonclassical properties of such photon pairs by using Geiger-mode InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes. Polarization entanglement in the photon pairs can be created by pumping the Sagnac interferometer with two orthogonally polarized pulses. In this case the parametrically scattered signal-idler photons yield biphoton interference with $>$90% visibility in coincidence detection, while no interference is observed in direct detection of either the signal or the idler photons.

abstract: Current methods of preparing maximally entangled states in the laboratory need an extremely accurate control of interaction times, requiring sophisticated experimental techniques. Here, we show that such precise control is not necessary when one utilizes short or weak interactions followed by measurements. We present a scheme for the probabilistic generation of Bell states in a pair of cavities, after each has interacted briefly with an atom. The advantage of this proposal, as compared to present schemes, is its low sensitivity to the exact values of experimental parameters such as atomic velocity and coupling strength, in fact, for a large range of parameters the fidelity of the Bell states generated remains close to unity.

abstract: Any attempt to introduce probabilities into quantum mechanics faces difficulties due to the mathematical structure of Hilbert space, as reflected in Birkhoff and von Neumann's proposal for a quantum logic. The (consistent or decoherent) histories solution is provided by its single framework rule, an approach that includes conventional (Copenhagen) quantum theory as a special case. Mermin's Ithaca interpretation addresses the same problem by defining probabilities which make no reference to a sample space or event algebra (``correlations without correlata''). But this leads to severe conceptual difficulties, which almost inevitably couple quantum theory to unresolved problems of human consciousness. Using histories allows a sharper quantum description than is possible with a density matrix, suggesting that the latter provides an ensemble rather than an irreducible single-system description as claimed by Mermin. The histories approach satisfies the first five of Mermin's desiderata for a good interpretation of quantum mechanics, including Einstein locality, but the Ithaca interpretation seems to have difficulty with the first (independence of observers) and the third (describing individual systems).

abstract: It is argued that the standard quantum mechanical description of the Bell correlations between entangled subsystems is in conflict with relativistic space-time symmetry. Proposals to abandon relativistic symmetry, in the sense of explicitly returning to an absolute time and preferred frame, are rejected on the grounds that the preferred frame is not empirically detectable, so the asymmetry is an unsatisfactory feature in physical theory. A "symmetric view" is proposed in which measurement events on space-like separated entangled subsystems are connected by a symmetric two-way mutual influence. Because of this reciprocity, there is complete symmetry of the description: Einsteinian relativity of simultaneity and space-time symmetry are completely preserved. The nature of the two-way influence is considered, as well as the possibility of an empirical test.

abstract: We study non-local two-qubit operations from a geometric perspective. By applying a Cartan decomposition to su(4), we find that the geometric structure of non-local gates is a 3-Torus. We derive the invariants for local transformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the 3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and simulation.

When one player has access only to classical strategies while the other can use the full range of quantum strategies, there are ``miracle'' moves available to the quantum player that can direct the result of the game towards the quantum player's preferred result regardless of the classical player's strategy. The advantage pertaining to the quantum player is dependent on the degree of entanglement. Below a critical level, dependent on the payoffs in the game, the miracle move is of no advantage.

abstract: We investigate the entaglement characteristics of two general bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates - a pair of tunnel-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates and the atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate. We argue that the entanglement is only physically meaningful if the system is viewed as a bipartite system, where the subsystems are the two modes. The indistinguishibility of the particles in the condensate means that the atomic constituents are physically inaccessible and thus the degree of entanglement between individual particles, unlike the entanglement between the modes, is not experimentally relevant so long as the particles remain in the condensed state. We calculate the entanglement between the modes for the exact ground state of the two bimodal condensates and consider the dynamics of the entanglement in the tunnel-coupled case.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: This article presents a general discussion of several aspects of our present understanding of quantum mechanics. The emphasis is put on the very special correlations that this theory makes possible: they are forbidden by very general arguments based on realism and local causality. In fact, these correlations are completely impossible in any circumstance, except the very special situations designed by physicists especially to observe these purely quantum effects. Another general point that is emphasized is the necessity for the theory to predict the emergence of a single result in a single realization of an experiment. For this purpose, orthodox quantum mechanics introduces a special postulate: the reduction of the state vector, which comes in addition to the Schrodinger evolution postulate. Nevertheless, the presence in parallel of two evolution processes of the same object (the state vector) maybe a potential source for conflicts; various attitudes that are possible to avoid this problem are discussed in this text. After a brief historical introduction, recalling how the very special status of the state vector has emerged in quantum mechanics, various conceptual difficulties are introduced and discussed. The Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) theorem is presented with the help of a botanical parable, in a way that emphasizes how deeply the EPR reasoning is rooted into what is often called "scientific method''. In another section the GHZ argument, the Hardy impossibilities, as well as the BKS theorem are introduced in simple terms.

abstract: We simply construct a quantum universal variable-length source code in which, independent of information source, both of the average error and the probability that the coding rate is greater than the entropy rate $H(rho_p)$, tend to 0. If $H(rho_p)$ is estimated, we can compress the coding rate to the admissible rate $H(rho_p)$ with a probability close to 1. However, when we perform a naive measurement for the estimation of $H(rho_p)$, the input state is demolished. By smearing the measurement, we successfully treat the trade-off between the estimation of $H(rho_p)$ and the non-demolition of the input state. Our protocol can be used not only for the Schumacher's scheme but also for the compression of entangled states.

abstract: This paper characterizes two forms of separability of pure states of systems of n qubits: (i) into a tensor product of n qubit states, and (ii), into a tensor product of 2 subsystems states of p and q qubits respectively with p+q=n. For both cases, necessary and sufficient conditions are proved in the form of minimal sets of equalities among pair-wise products of amplitudes. These conditions bear some relation with entanglement measures, and a number of more refined questions about separability in n qubit systems can be studied on the basis of these results.

abstract: So far all the proven unconditionally secure prepare and measure protocols for the quantum key distribution(QKD) must solve the very complex problem of decoding the classical CSS code. In the decoding stage, Bob has to compare his string with an exponentially large number of all the strings in certain code space to find out the closest one. Here we have spotted that, in an entanglement purification protocol(EPP), the random basis in the state preparation stage is only necessary to those check qubits, but uncessary to the code qubits. In our modified two way communication EPP(2-EPP) protocol, Alice and Bob may first take all the parity checks on $Z$ basis to reduce the bit flip error to strictly zero with a high probability, e.g., $1-2^{-30}$, and then use the CSS code to obtain the final key. We show that, this type of 2-EPP protocol can be reduced to an equivalent prepare and measure protocol. In our protocol, the huge complexity of decoding the classical CSS code is totally removed.

abstract: When a one-atom maser is operated in the standard way -- excited, resonant two-level atoms traverse the resonator at random times -- the emerging atoms are entangled with the cavity field. As a consequence, the results of measurements on different atoms tend to be correlated. We show that truly non-classical correlations can be found between two successive atoms by studying the properties of the reduced state of such an atom pair. In particular, we calculate its degree of separability and find parameter ranges in which it is markedly less than unity.

abstract: Problems connected with non-Hamiltonian nature of low energy nucleon dynamics in the effective field theory (EFT) of nuclear forces is investigated by using the formalism of the generalized quantum dynamics (GQD) developed in [J. Phys. A, 5657 (1999)]. This formalism is based on a generalized dynamical equation derived as the most general equation of motion consistent with the current concepts of quantum physics. By using the example of the EFT of nuclear forces, we demonstrate that a theory, which, being formulated in terms of Hamiltonian formalism, leads to ultraviolet divergences, may manifest itself as a perfectly consistent theory free from infinities, if it is considered from the more general point of view provided by the GQD. We show that non-Hamiltonian character of nucleon dynamics gives rise to some new problems connected with discontinuity of the evolution operator. This discontinuity results in the fact that the Hilbert space of nucleon states cannot be realized in the standard way. A space which allows one to realize, in a natural way, the Hilbert space of nucleon states is investigated. The structure of this space reflects the existence of the high energy degrees of freedom which affect on low energy nucleon dynamics.

We introduce a nonlinear transformation which permits the linearization of the source term in the evolution equations for the gauge field, and transforms the nonlinear Schroedinger equations in another one with real nonlinearities. We show that this transformation can be performed either on the gauge field $A_\mu$ or, equivalently, on the matter field $\psi$. Since the transformation does not change the quantities $|\psi|^2$ and $F_{\mu\nu}$, it can be considered a generalization of the gauge transformation of third kind introduced some years ago by other authors.

The quantum algorithm is based on a continuous time quantum walk, and thus employs a different technique from previous quantum algorithms based on quantum Fourier transforms. We show how to implement the quantum walk efficiently in our oracular setting. We then show how this quantum walk can be used to solve our problem by rapidly traversing a graph. Finally, we prove that no classical algorithm can solve this problem with high probability in subexponential time.

abstract: We study time dependence of various measures of entanglement (covariance entanglement coefficient, purity entanglement coefficient, normalized distance coefficient, entropic coefficients) between resonantly coupled modes of the electromagnetic field in ideal cavities with oscillating boundaries. Two types of cavities are considered: a three-dimensional cavity possessing eigenfrequencies $\omega_3=3\omega_1$, whose wall oscillates at the frequency $\omega_w=2\omega_1$, and a one-dimensional (Fabry--Perot) cavity with an equidistant spectrum $\omega_n= n\omega_1$, when the distance between perfect mirrors oscillates at the frequencies $\omega_1$ and $2\omega_1$. The behaviour of entanglement measures in these cases turns out to be completely different, although all three coefficients demonstrate qualitatively similar time dependences in each case (except for some specific situations, where the covariance entanglement coefficient, based on traces of covariance submatrices, seems to be essentially more sensitive to entanglement than other measures, which are based on determinants of covariance submatrices). Different initial states of the field are considered: vacuum, squeezed vacuum, thermal, Fock, and even/odd coherent states.

abstract: We report on the preparation and detection of entangled states between an electron spin 1/2 and a nuclear spin 1/2 in a molecular single crystal. These were created by applying pulses at ESR (9.5 GHz) and NMR (28 MHz) frequencies. Entanglement was detected by using a special entanglement detector sequence based on a unitary back transformation including phase rotation.

abstract: In this paper we address the problem of optimal reconstruction of a quantum state from the result of a single measurement when the original quantum state is known to be a member of some specified set. A suitable figure of merit for this process is the fidelity, which is the probability that the state we construct on the basis of the measurement result is found by a subsequent test to match the original state. We consider the maximisation of the fidelity for a set of three mirror symmetric qubit states. In contrast to previous examples, we find that the strategy which minimises the probability of erroneously identifying the state does not generally maximise the fidelity.

abstract: Using time-independent scattering matrices, we study how the effects of nonclassical paths on the recurrence spectra of diamagnetic atoms can be extracted from purely quantal calculations. This study reveals an intimate relationship between two types of nonclassical paths: exotic ghost orbits and diffractive orbits. This relationship proves to be a previously unrecognized reason for the success of semiclassical theories, like closed-orbit theory, and permits a comprehensive reformulation of the semiclassical theory that elucidates its convergence properties.

abstract: Inconclusive photon subtraction (IPS) is a conditional measurement scheme to force nonlinear evolution of a given state. In IPS the input state is mixed with the vacuum in a beam splitter and then the reflected beam is revealed by ON/OFF photodetection. When the detector clicks we have the (inconclusive) photon subtracted state. We show that IPS on both channels of an entangled twin-beam of radiation improves the fidelity of coherent state teleportation if the energy of the incoming twin-beam is below a certain threshold, which depends on the beam splitter transmissivity and the quantum efficiency of photodetectors. We show that the energy threshold diverges when the transmissivity and the efficiency approach unit and compare our results with that of previous works on {\em conclusive} photon subtraction.

abstract: Differential geometric structures such as the principal bundle for the canonical vector bundle on a complex Grassmann manifold, the canonical connection form on this bundle, the canonical symplectic form on a complex Grassmann manifold and the corresponding dynamical systems are investigated. The Grassmann manifold is considered as an orbit of the co-adjoint action and the symplectic form is described as the restriction of the canonical Poisson structure on a Lie coalgebra. The holonomy of the connection on the principal bundle over Grassmannian and its relation with Berry phase is considered and investigated for the integral curves of Hamiltonian dynamical systems.

abstract: Most quantum computer realizations require the ability to apply local fields and tune the couplings between qubits, in order to realize single bit and two bit gates which are necessary for universal quantum computation. We present a scheme to remove the necessity of switching the couplings between qubits for two bit gates, which are more costly in many cases. Our strategy is to compute in and out of carefully designed interaction free subspaces analogous to decoherence free subspaces, which allows us to effectively turn off and turn on the interactions between the encoded qubits. We give two examples to show how universal quantum computation is realized in our scheme with local manipulations to physical qubits only, for both diagonal and off diagonal interactions.

abstract: We study the stability of unitary quantum dynamics of composite systems (for example: central system + environment) with respect to weak interaction between the two parts. Unified theoretical formalism is applied to study different physical situations: (i) coherence of a forward evolution as measured by purity of the reduced density matrix, (ii) stability of time evolution with respect to small coupling between subsystems, and (iii) Loschmidt echo measuring dynamical irreversibility. Stability has been measured either by fidelity of pure states of a composite system, or by the so-called reduced fidelity of reduced density matrices within a subsystem. Rigorous inequality among fidelity, reduced-fidelity and purity is proved and a linear response theory is developed expressing these three quantities in terms of time correlation functions of the generator of interaction. The qualitatively different cases of regular (integrable) or mixing (chaotic in the classical limit) dynamics in each of the subsystems are discussed in detail. Theoretical results are demonstrated and confirmed in a numerical example of two coupled kicked tops.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209148
abstract: Quantum algorithms are conventionally formulated for implementation on a single system of qubits amenable to projective measurements. However, in expectation value quantum computation, such as nuclear magnetic resonance realizations, the computer consists of an ensemble of identical qubit-systems amenable only to expectation value measurements. The prevalent strategy in such expectation value implementations of quantum algorithms has been to retain the conventional formulation's unitary operations but modify its initialization and measurement steps appropriately. This naive approach is not optimal for Grover's algorithm and a shortened version for expectation value quantum computers is presented.

abstract: Mayers, Lo and Chau argued that all quantum bit commitment protocols are insecure, because there is no way to prevent an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) cheating attack. However, Yuen presented some protocols which challenged the previous impossibility argument. Up to now, it is still debated whether there exist or not unconditionally secure protocols. In this paper the above controversy is addressed. For such purpose, a complete classification of all possible bit commitment protocols is given, including all possible cheating attacks. Focusing on the simplest class of protocols (non-aborting and with complete and perfect verification), it is shown how naturally a game-theoretical situation arises. For these protocols, bounds for the cheating probabilities are derived, involving the two quantum operations encoding the bit values and their respective alternate Kraus decompositions. Such bounds are different from those given in the impossibility proof. The whole classification and analysis has been carried out using a "finite open system" approach. The discrepancy with the impossibility proof is explained on the basis of the implicit adoption of a "closed system approach"--equivalent to modeling the commitment as performed by two fixed machines interacting unitarily in a overall "closed system"--according to which it is possible to assume as "openly known" both the initial state and the probability distributions for all secret parameters, which can be then "purified". This approach is also motivated by existence of unitary extensions for any open system. However, it is shown that the closed system approach for the classification of commitment protocols unavoidably leads to infinite dimensions, which then invalidate the continuity argument at the basis of the impossibility proof.

abstract: Optical nonlinearities sensitive to individual photons may be extremely useful as elements in quantum logic circuits for photonic qubits. A much cited example is the work of Turchette et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4710 (1995)], in which a phase shift of about 10 degrees was reported. To improve this result, we propose a single sided cavity geometry with minimal cavity losses. It should then be possible to achieve a nonlinear phase shift of 180 degrees.

abstract: We study the competitive action of magnetic field, Coulomb repulsion and space curvature on the motion of a charged particle. The three types of interaction are characterized by three basic lengths: l_{B} the magnetic length, l_{0} the Bohr radius and R the radius of the sphere. The energy spectrum of the particle is found by solving a Schr\"odinger equation of the Heun type, using the technique of continued fractions. It displays a rich set of functioning regimes where ratios \frac{R}{l_{B}} and \frac{R}{l_{0}} take definite values.

abstract: The non-Markovian behaviour of open quantum systems interacting with a reservoir can often be described in terms of a time-local master equation involving a time-dependent generator which is not in Lindblad form. A systematic perturbation expansion of the generator is obtained either by means of van Kampen's method of ordered cumulants or else by use of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional technique. Both expansions are demonstrated to yield equivalent expressions for the generator in all orders of the system-reservor coupling. Explicit formulae are derived for the second and the fourth order generator in terms of the influence functional.

abstract: The two photon interference phenomenon is theoretically investigated for the general situations with an arbitrary input two photon state with and without photon polarization. For the case without polarization, the necessary-sufficient condition for the destructive interference of coincidence counting is given as the symmetric pairing of photons in the light pulses. For both case it is shown that the "dip" in coincidence curve can be understood in terms of the free induction decay mechanism. This observation predicts the destructive interference phenomenon to occur even for certain cases with separable input two photon state, but it can only be explained in terms of "the two photon (not two photons)interference ".

As a result a complete algebraic treatment of the HNP by means of the $so(2,1)$ algebra is achieved. In the bound state sector we discuss a set of satellite potentials which arises from the action of the $so(2,1)$ generators. It is shown that the set of new potentials are not related to the one obtained by means of SUSYQM or of the potential algebra approach using the $so(2,2)$ algebra.

abstract: Recent experimental measurements of the time interval between detection of the two photons emitted in positron/electron annihilation have indicated that collapse of the spatial part of the photon's wavefunction, due to detection of the other photon, does not occur. Although quantum nonlocality actually occurs in photons produced through parametric down-conversion, the recent experiments give strong evidence against measurement-induced instantaneous spatial-localization of high-energy gamma photons. A new quantum-mechanical analysis of the EPR problem is presented which may help to explain the observed differences between photons produced through parametric down-conversion and photons produced through positron/electron annihilation. The results are found to concur with the recent experiments involving gamma photons.

The scheme is valid for solving Cauchy problems for arbitrary number of equations with arbitrary constant coefficients. The numerical scheme takes its legality by proving its stability and convergence which gives the conditions and the appropriate choice of the grid sizes. The method is applied to Hirota-Satsuma (HS) system and compared with its known explicit solution investigating the influence of initial conditions and grid sizes on accuracy. We also illustrate the method to show the effects of constants with a transition to the non-integrable case.

abstract: Four-wave mixing in resonant atomic vapors based on maximum coherence induced by Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage (SCRAP) is investigated theoretically. We show the advantages of a coupling scheme involving maximum coherence and demonstrate how a large atomic coherence between a ground and an highly excited state can be prepared by SCRAP. Full analytic solutions of the field propagation problem taking into account pump field depletion are derived. The solutions are obtained with the help of an Hamiltonian approach which in the adiabatic limit permits to reduce the full set of Maxwell-Bloch equations to simple canonical equations of Hamiltonian mechanics for the field variables. It is found that the conversion efficiency reached is largely enhanced if the phase mismatch induced by linear refraction is compensated. A detailed analysis of the phase matching conditions shows, however, that the phase mismatch contribution from the Kerr effect cannot be compensated simultaneously with linear refraction contribution. Therefore, the conversion efficiency in a coupling scheme involving maximum coherence prepared by SCRAP is high, but not equal to unity.

abstract: The effects of any quantum measurement can be described by a collection of measurement operators {M_m} acting on the quantum state of the measured system. However, the Hilbert space formalism tends to obscure the relationship between the measurement results and the physical properties of the measured system. In this paper, a characterization of measurement operators in terms of measurement resolution and disturbance is developed. It is then possible to formulate uncertainty relations for the measurement process that are valid for arbitrary input states. The motivation of these concepts is explained from a quantum communication viewpoint. It is shown that the intuitive interpretation of uncertainty as a relation between measurement resolution and disturbance provides a valid description of measurement back action. Possible applications to quantum cryptography, quantum cloning, and teleportation are discussed.

Here I show that `true coherence' is always illusory, as the concept of absolute time on a scale beyond direct human experience is meaningless. A laser is as good a clock as any other, even in principle, and this objection to teleportation experiments is baseless.

abstract: In this paper, the Lorentz transformation of entangled Bell states seen by a moving observer is studied. The calculated Bell observable for 4 joint measurements turns out to give a universal value, $<\hat{a}\otimes\vec{b}>+<\hat{a}\otimes\vec{b}'>+\lang le\hat{a}'\otimes\vec{b}> -<\hat{a}'\otimes\vec{b}'>=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2-\beta^2}}(1+\sqrt{1-\be ta^2})$, where $\hat{a}, \hat{b}$ are the relativistic spin observables derived from the Pauli-Lubanski pseudo vector and $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$. We found that the degree of violation of the Bell's inequality is decreasing with increasing velocity of the observer and the Bell's inequality is satisfied in the ultra-relativistic limit where the boost speed reaches the speed of light.

abstract: Employing the currently discussed notion of pseudo-Hermiticity, we define a pseudo-unitary group. Further, we develop a random matrix theory which is invariant under such a group and call this ensemble of pseudo-Hermitian random matrices as the pseudo-unitary ensemble. We obtain exact results for the nearest-neighbour level spacing distribution for (2 X 2) PT-symmetric Hamiltonian matrices which has a novel form, s log (1/s) near zero spacing. This shows a level repulsion in marked distinction with an algebraic form in the Wigner surmise. We believe that this paves way for a description of varied phenomena in two-dimensional statistical mechanics, quantum chromodynamics, and so on.

abstract: The lateral Casimir force acting between a sinusoidally corrugated gold plate and sphere was calculated and measured. The experimental setup was based on the atomic force microscope specially adapted for the measurement of the lateral Casimir force. The measured force oscillates sinusoidally as a function of the phase difference between the two corrugations. Both systematic and random errors are analysed and a lateral force amplitude of $3.2\times 10^{-13} $N was measured at a separation distance of 221 nm with a resulting relative error 24% at a 95% confidence probability. The dependence of the measured lateral force amplitude on separation was investigated and shown to be consistent with the inverse fourth power distance dependence. The complete theory of the lateral Casimir force is presented including finite conductivity and roughness corrections. The obtained theoretical dependence was analysed as a function of surface separation, corrugation amplitudes, phase difference, and plasma wavelength of a metal. The theory was compared with the experimental data and shown to be in good agreement. The constraints on hypothetical Yukawa-type interactions following from the measurements of the lateral Casimir force are calculated. The possible applications of the lateral vacuum forces to nanotechnology are discussed.

abstract: Continuous variable remote state preparation and teleportation are analyzed using Wigner functions in phase space. We suggest a remote squeezed state preparation scheme between two parties sharing an entangled twin beam, where homodyne detection on one beam is used as a conditional source of squeezing for the other beam. The scheme works also with noisy measurements, and provide squeezing if the homodyne quantum efficiency is larger than 50%. Phase space approach is shown to provide a convenient framework to describe teleportation as a generalized conditional measurement, and to evaluate relevant degrading effects, such the finite amount of entanglement, the losses along the line, and the nonunit quantum efficiency at the sender location.

abstract: We develop a computation model for solving Boolean networks by implementing wires through quantum ground-mode computation and gates through identities following from angular momentum algebra and statistics. Gates are represented by three-dimensional (triplet) symmetries due to particle indistinguishability and are identically satisfied throughout computation being constants of the motion. The relaxation of the wires yields the network solutions. Such gates cost no computation time, which is comparable with that of an easier Boolean network where all the gate constraints implemented as constants of the motion are removed. This model computation is robust with respect to decoherence and yields a generalized quantum speed-up for all NP problems.

abstract: Within the framework of stochastic Schroedinger equations, we show that the correspondence between statevector equations and ensemble equations is infinitely many to one, and we discuss the consequences. We also generalize the results of [Phys. Lett.

abstract: We analyze the operation of quantum gates for neutral atoms with qubits that are delocalized in space, i.e., the computational basis states are defined by the presence of a neutral atom in the ground state of one out of two trapping potentials. The implementation of single qubit gates as well as a controlled phase gate between two qubits is discussed and explicit calculations are presented for rubidium atoms in optical microtraps. Furthermore, we show how multi-qubit highly entangled states can be created in this scheme.

abstract: We study the pairing correlations in a finite Fermi system from quantum entanglement point of view. We investigate the relation between the order parameter, which has been introduced recently to describe both finite and infinite superconductors, and the concurrence. For a proper definition of the concurrence, we argue that a possible generalization of spin flip transformation is time reversal operation. While for a system with indefinite number of particles concurrence is a good measure of entanglement, for a finite system it does not distinguish between normal and superconducting states. We propose that the expectation value of the radial operator for the total pseudospin can be used to identify entanglement of pairing.

abstract: We study dissipation effects for electrons on the surface of liquid helium, which may serve as qubits of a quantum computer. Each electron is localized in a 3D potential well formed by the image potential in helium and the potential from a submicron electrode submerged into helium. We estimate parameters of the confining potential and characterize the electron energy spectrum. Decay of the excited electron state is due to two-ripplon scattering and to scattering by phonons in helium. We identify mechanisms of coupling to phonons and estimate contributions from different scattering mechanisms. Even in the absence of a magnetic field we expect the decay rate to be $\alt 10^4$ s$^{-1}$. We also calculate the dephasing rate, which is due primarily to ripplon scattering off an electron. This rate is $\alt 10^2$ s$^{-1}$ for typical operation temperatures.

abstract: We discuss a recently developed formalism which describes the quantum evolution of a solid-state qubit due to its continuous measurement. In contrast to the conventional ensemble-averaged formalism, it takes into account the measurement record and therefore is able to consider individual realizations of the measurement process. The formalism provides testable experimental predictions and can be used for the analysis of a quantum feedback control of solid-state qubits. We also discuss generalization of the Bayesian formalism to the continuous measurement of entangled qubits.

abstract: We examine the quantum tunneling process in Bose condensates of two interacting species trapped in a double well configuration. We discover the condition under which particles of different species can tunnel as pairs through the potential barrier between two wells in opposition directions. This novel form of tunneling is due to the interspecies interaction that eliminates the self- trapping effect. The correlated motion of tunneling atoms leads to the generation of quantum entanglement between two macroscopically coherent systems.

abstract: We have argued that quantum mechanics and general relativity give a lower bound $\delta l \gtrsim l^{1/3} l_P^{2/3}$ on the measurement uncertainty of any distance $l$ much greater than the Planck length $l_P$. Recently Baez and Olson have claimed that one can go below this bound by attaching the measuring device to a massive elastic rod. Here we refute their claim. We also reiterate (and invite our critics to ponder on) the intimate relationship and consistency between black hole physics (including the holographic principle) and our bound on distance measurements.

I discuss the potential impact of quantum effects on this result.

It turns out that one may construct out of a pair of resonant states an analog of the stationary Wigner function.

This involves dealing with the peculiarities of formulating a unitary quantum dynamics in a Hilbert space with a time-dependent inner product. We apply our general results to obtain possible Hilbert space structures on the solution space of the equation of motion for a classical simple harmonic oscillator, a free Klein-Gordon equation, and the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the FRW-massive-real-scalar-field models.

We present a natural extension of these results to the class of diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians H with a discrete spectrum. In particular, we introduce generalized parity (${\cal P}$), time-reversal (${\cal T}$), and charge-conjugation (${\cal C}$) operators and establish the ${\cal PT}$- and ${\cal CPT}$-invariance of H.

abstract: General solutions of relativistic wave equations are studied in terms of the functions on the Lorentz group. A close relationship between hyperspherical functions and matrix elements of irreducible representations of the Lorentz group is established. A generalization of the Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism for higher-spin equations is given. It is shown that a two-dimensional complex sphere is associated with the each point of Minkowski spacetime. The separation of variables in a general relativistically invariant system is obtained via the hyperspherical functions defined on the surface of the two-dimensional complex sphere. In virtue of this, the wave functions are represented in the form of series on the hyperspherical functions. Such a description allows to consider all the physical fields on an equal footing. General solutions of the Dirac and Weyl equations, and also the Maxwell equations in the Majorana-Oppenheimer form, are given in terms of the functions on the Lorentz group.

abstract: The Jones-Witten theory gives rise to representations of the (extended) mapping class group of any closed surface Y indexed by a semi-simple Lie group G and a level k. In the case G=SU(2) these representations (denoted V_A(Y)) have a particularly simple description in terms of the Kauffman skein modules with parameter A a primitive 4r-th root of unity (r=k+2). In each of these representations (as well as the general G case), Dehn twists act as transformations of finite order, so none represents the mapping class group M(Y) faithfully. However, taken together, the quantum SU(2) representations are faithful on non-central elements of M(Y). (Note that M(Y) has non-trivial center only if Y is a sphere with 0, 1, or 2 punctures, a torus with 0, 1, or 2 punctures, or the closed surface of genus = 2.) Specifically, for a non-central h in M(Y) there is an r_0(h) such that if r>= r_0(h) and A is a primitive 4r-th root of unity then h acts projectively nontrivially on V_A(Y). Jones' [J] original representation rho_n of the braid groups B_n, sometimes called the generic q-analog-SU(2)-representation, is not known to be faithful. However, we show that any braid h not= id in B_n admits a cabling c = c_1,...,c_n so that rho_N (c(h)) not= id, N=c_1 + ... + c_n.

abstract: We find a uniform semiclassical (SC) wave function describing coherent branched flow through a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), a phenomenon recently discovered by direct imaging of the current using scanned probed microscopy. The formation of branches has been explained by classical arguments, but the SC simulations necessary to account for the coherence are made difficult by the proliferation of catastrophes in the phase space. In this paper, expansion in terms of "replacement manifolds" is used to find a uniform SC wave function for a cusp singularity. The method is then generalized and applied to calculate uniform wave functions for a quantum-map model of coherent flow through a 2DEG. Finally, the quantum-map approximation is dropped and the method is shown to work for a continuous-time model as well.

This technique is presented as an alternative to the conventional method of series expansion of the radical. Besides reproducing all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this method leads to additional terms in the optical Hamiltonian.

abstract: Recent Feshbach-resonance experiments with 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensates have led to a host of unexplained results: dramatic losses of condensate atoms for an across-resonance sweep of the magnetic field, a collapsing condensate with a burst of atoms emanating from the remnant condensate, increased losses for decreasing interaction times--until very short times are reached, and coherent oscillations between remnant and burst atoms. In particular, the amplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing atoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate. Using a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular dissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the physical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little molecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and the fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured atom loss.

abstract: Interfering electrons in a mesoscopic ring are irradiated with both classical and nonclassical microwaves. The average intensity of the charges is calculated as a function of time and it is found that it depends on the nature of the irradiating electromagnetic field. For various quantum states of the microwaves, the electron autocorrelation function is calculated and it shows that the quantum noise of the external field affects the interference of the charges. Two-mode entangled microwaves are also considered and the results are compared with those of the corresponding separable state. In both cases, the results depend on whether the ratio of the two frequencies is rational or irrational.
