abstract: We address the question of symmetries of an important type of quantum walks. We introduce all the necessary definitions and provide a rigorous formulation of the problem. Using a thorough analysis, we reach the complete answer by presenting a constructive method of finding all solutions of the problem with minimal additional assumptions. We apply the results on an example of a quantum walk on a line to demonstrate the practical significance of the theory.

abstract: We study perfect state transfer of quantum walks on signed graphs. Our aim is to show that negative edges are useful for perfect state transfer. Specific results we prove include: (1) The signed join of a negative 2-clique with any positive (n,3)-regular graph has perfect state transfer even if the unsigned join does not. Curiously, the perfect state transfer time improves as n increases. (2) A signed complete graph has perfect state transfer if its positive subgraph is a regular graph with perfect state transfer and its negative subgraph is periodic. This shows that signing is useful for creating perfect state transfer since no complete graph (except for the 2-clique) has perfect state transfer. (3) The double-cover of a signed graph has perfect state transfer if the positive subgraph has perfect state transfer and the negative subgraph is periodic. Here, signing is useful for constructing unsigned graphs with perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on a family of signed graphs called the exterior powers which is derived from a many-fermion quantum walk on graphs.

abstract: A quantum algorithm is exact if, on any input data, it outputs the correct answer with certainty (probability 1). A key question is: how big is the advantage of exact quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts: deterministic algorithms. For total Boolean functions in the query model, the biggest known gap was just a factor of 2: PARITY of N inputs bits requires $N$ queries classically but can be computed with N/2 queries by an exact quantum algorithm. We present the first example of a Boolean function f(x_1, ..., x_N) for which exact quantum algorithms have superlinear advantage over the deterministic algorithms. Any deterministic algorithm that computes our function must use N queries but an exact quantum algorithm can compute it with O(N^{0.8675...}) queries.

abstract: Discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) represent robust and versatile platforms for the controlled engineering of single particle quantum dynamics, and have attracted special attention due to their algorithmic applications in quantum information science. Even in their simplest 1D architectures, they display complex topological phenomena, which can be employed in the systematic study of topological quantum phase transitions [1]. Due to the exponential scaling in the number of resources required, most experimental realizations of QWs up to date have been limited to single particles, with only a few implementations involving correlated quantum pairs. In this article we study applications of quantum walks in the controlled dynamical engineering of entanglement in bipartite bosonic systems. We show that quantum walks can be employed in the transition from mode entanglement, where indistinguishability of the quantum particles plays a key role, to the standard type of entanglement associated with distinguishable particles. We also show that, by carefully tailoring the steps in the QWs, as well as the initial state for the quantum walker, it is possible to preserve the entanglement content by topological protection. The underlying mechanism that allows for the possibility of both entanglement engineering and entanglement protection is the strong "spin-orbit" coupling induced by the QW. We anticipate that the results reported here can be employed for the controlled emulation of quantum correlations in topological phases.

abstract: We present an implementation scheme for a quantum walk in the orbital angular momentum space of a laser beam. The scheme makes use of a ring interferometer, containing a quarter-wave plate and a q plate. This setup enables one to perform an arbitrary number of quantum walk steps. In addition, the classical nature of the implementation scheme makes it possible to observe the quantum walk evolution in real time. We use nonquantum entanglement of the laser beam's polarization with its orbital angular momentum to implement the quantum walk.

abstract: We study the time evolution of continuous-time quantum walks on randomly changing graphs. At certain moments edges of the graph appear or disappear with a given probability. We focus on the case when the time interval between subsequent changes of the graph tends to zero. We derive explicit formulae for the general evolution in this limit. We find that the percolation in this limit causes an effective time rescaling. Independently of the graph and the initial state of the walk, the time is rescaled by the probability of keeping and edge. Both the individual trajectories for a single system and average properties with a superoperator formalism are discussed. We give an analytical proof for our theorem and we also present results from numerical simulations of the phenomena for different graphs.

abstract: We provide a recursive method for constructing product formula approximations to exponentials of commutators, giving the first approximations that are accurate to arbitrarily high order. Using these formulas, we show how to approximate unitary exponentials of (possibly nested) commutators using exponentials of the elementary operators, and we upper bound the number of elementary exponentials needed to implement the desired operation within a given error tolerance. By presenting an algorithm for quantum search using evolution according to a commutator, we show that the scaling of the number of exponentials in our product formulas with the evolution time is nearly optimal. Finally, we discuss applications of our product formulas to quantum control and to implementing anticommutators, providing new methods for simulating many-body interaction Hamiltonians.

abstract: We clarify that coined quantum walk is determined by only the choice of local quantum coins. To do so, we characterize coined quantum walks on graph by disjoint Euler circles with respect to symmetric arcs. In this paper, we introduce a new class of coined quantum walk by a special choice of quantum coins determined by corresponding quantum graph, called quantum graph walk. We show that a stationary state of quantum graph walk describes the eigenfunction of the quantum graph.

abstract: We compare two different models of transport of light in a disordered system with a spherical Gaussian distribution of scatterers. A coupled dipole model, keeping into account all interference effects, is compared to an incoherent model, using a random walk of particles. Besides the well known coherent backscattering effect and a well pronounced forward lobe, the incoherent model reproduces extremely well all scattering features. In an experiment with cold atoms, we use the momentum recoil imparted on the center of mass of the sample as a partial probe of the light scattering properties. We find that the force acting on the center of mass of the atoms is not well suited to exhibit the coherence effects in light propagation under multiple scattering conditions.
