**1.    Local subgraph structure can cause localization in continuous-time quantum walk**  
Yusuke Ide  
Yokohama Mathematical Journal 60, 113-123 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0347  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on finite graphs determined by the Laplacian matrices. By introducing fully interconnected graph decomposition of given graphs, we show a decomposition method for the Laplacian matrices. Using the decomposition method, we show several conditions for graph structure which return probability of CTQW tends to 1 while the number of vertices tends to infinity.

**2.    Path-integral solution of the one-dimensional Dirac quantum cellular automaton**  
Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano, Nicola Mosco, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1021  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum cellular automata have been recently considered as a fundamental approach to quantum field theory, resorting to a precise automaton, linear in the field, for the Dirac equation in one dimension. In such linear case a quantum automaton is isomorphic to a quantum walk, and a convenient formulation can be given in terms of transition matrices, leading to a new kind of discrete path integral that we solve analytically in terms of Jacobi polynomials versus the arbitrary mass parameter.

**3.    Towards High-Fidelity Quantum Computation and Simulation on a Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuit**  
Jacob Mower, Nicholas C. Harris, Gregory R. Steinbrecher, Yoav Lahini, Dirk Englund  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3255  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze the design of a programmable photonic integrated circuit for high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation. We demonstrate that the reconfigurability of our design allows us to overcome two major impediments to quantum optics on a chip: it removes the need for a full fabrication cycle for each experiment and allows for compensation of fabrication errors using numerical optimization techniques. Under a pessimistic fabrication model for the silicon-on-insulator process, we demonstrate a dramatic fidelity improvement for the linear optics CNOT and CPHASE gates and, showing the scalability of this approach, the iterative phase estimation algorithm built from individually optimized gates. We also propose and simulate a novel experiment that the programmability of our system would enable: a statistically robust study of the evolution of entangled photons in disordered quantum walks. Overall, our results suggest that existing fabrication processes are sufficient to build a quantum photonic processor capable of high fidelity operation.

**4.    Momentum switches**  
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset, Daniel Nagaj, Mouktik Raha, Zak Webb  
Quantum Information and Computation 15, 601-621 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4510  
<blockquote>
<p>
Certain continuous-time quantum walks can be viewed as scattering processes. These processes can perform quantum computations, but it is challenging to design graphs with desired scattering behavior. In this paper, we study and construct momentum switches, graphs that route particles depending on their momenta. We also give an example where there is no exact momentum switch, although we construct an arbitrarily good approximation.

**5.    Quantum POMDPs**  
Jennifer Barry, Daniel T. Barry, Scott Aaronson  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 032311, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2858  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present quantum observable Markov decision processes (QOMDPs), the quantum analogues of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In a QOMDP, an agent's state is represented as a quantum state and the agent can choose a superoperator to apply. This is similar to the POMDP belief state, which is a probability distribution over world states and evolves via a stochastic matrix. We show that the existence of a policy of at least a certain value has the same complexity for QOMDPs and POMDPs in the polynomial and infinite horizon cases. However, we also prove that the existence of a policy that can reach a goal state is decidable for goal POMDPs and undecidable for goal QOMDPs.
